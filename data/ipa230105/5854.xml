More specifically, the disclosure relates to methods of forming microelectronic devices and memory devices, and to related microelectronic devices, memory devices, and electronic systems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Microelectronic device designers often desire to increase the level of integration or density of features within a microelectronic device by reducing the dimensions of the individual features and by reducing the separation distance between neighboring features. In addition, microelectronic device designers often desire to design architectures that are not only compact, but offer performance advantages, as well as simplified, easier and less expensive to fabricate designs.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One example of a microelectronic device is a memory device. Memory devices are generally provided as internal integrated circuits in computers or other electronic devices. There are many types of memory devices including, but not limited to, volatile memory devices. One type of volatile memory device is a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device. A DRAM device may include a memory array including DRAM cells arranged rows extending in a first horizontal direction and columns extending in a second horizontal direction. In one design configuration, an individual DRAM cell includes an access device (e.g., a transistor) and a storage node device (e.g., a capacitor) electrically connected to the access device. The DRAM cells of a DRAM device are electrically accessible through digit lines and word lines arranged along the rows and columns of the memory array and in electrical communication with control logic devices within a base control logic structure of the DRAM device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Control logic devices within a base control logic structure underlying a memory, array of a DRAM device have been used to control operations on the DRAM cells of the DRAM device. Control logic devices of the base control logic structure can be provided in electrical communication with digit lines and word lines coupled to the DRAM cells by way of routing and contact structures. Unfortunately, processing conditions (e.g., temperatures, pressures, materials) for the formation of the memory array over the base control logic structure can limit the configurations and performance of the control logic devices within the base control logic structure. In addition, the quantities, dimensions, and arrangements of the different control logic devices employed within the base control logic structure can also undesirably impede reductions to the size (e.g., horizontal footprint) of a memory device, and/or improvements in the performance (e.g., faster memory cell ON/OFF speed, lower threshold switching voltage requirements, faster data transfer

end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The following description provides specific details, such as material compositions, shapes, and sizes, in order to provide a thorough description of embodiments of the disclosure. However, a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the embodiments of the disclosure may be practiced without employing these specific details. Indeed, the embodiments of the disclosure may be practiced in conjunction with conventional microelectronic device fabrication techniques employed in the industry. In addition, the description provided below does not form a complete process flow for manufacturing a microelectronic device (e.g., a memory device). The structures described below do not form a complete microelectronic device. Only those process acts and structures necessary to understand the embodiments of the disclosure are described in detail below. Additional acts to form a complete microelectronic device from the structures may be performed by conventional fabrication techniques.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Drawings presented herein are for illustrative purposes only, and are not meant to be actual views of any particular material, component, structure, device, or system. Variations from the shapes depicted in the drawings as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments described herein are not to be construed as being limited to the particular shapes or regions as illustrated, but include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region illustrated or described as box-shaped may have rough and/or nonlinear features, and a region illustrated or described as round may include some rough and/or linear features. Moreover, sharp angles that are illustrated may be rounded, and vice versa. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature, and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region and do not limit the scope of the present claims. The drawings are not necessarily to scale. Additionally, elements common between figures may retain the same numerical designation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein, a &#x201c;memory device&#x201d; means and includes microelectronic devices exhibiting memory functionality, but not necessary limited to memory functionality. Stated another way, and by way of non-limiting example only, the term &#x201c;memory device&#x201d; includes not only conventional memory (e.g., conventional volatile memory; conventional non-volatile memory), but also includes an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) (e.g., a system on a chip (SoC)), a microelectronic device combining logic and memory, and a graphics processing unit (GPU) incorporating memory.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used herein, the term &#x201c;configured&#x201d; refers to a size, shape, material composition, orientation, and arrangement of one or more of at least one structure and at least one apparatus facilitating operation of one or more of the structure and the apparatus in a pre-determined way.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;vertical,&#x201d; &#x201c;longitudinal,&#x201d; &#x201c;horizontal,&#x201d; and &#x201c;lateral&#x201d; are in reference to a major plane of a structure and are not necessarily defined by earth's gravitational field. A &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; or &#x201c;lateral&#x201d; direction is a direction that is substantially parallel to the major plane of the structure, while a &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; or &#x201c;longitudinal&#x201d; direction is a direction that is substantially perpendicular to the major plane of the structure. The major plane of the structure is defined by a surface of the structure having a relatively large area compared to other surfaces of the structure. With reference to the figures, a &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; or &#x201c;lateral&#x201d; direction may be perpendicular to an indicated &#x201c;Z&#x201d; axis, and may be parallel to an indicated &#x201c;X&#x201d; axis and/or parallel to an indicated &#x201c;Y&#x201d; axis; and a &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; or &#x201c;longitudinal&#x201d; direction may be parallel to an indicated &#x201c;Z&#x201d; axis, may be perpendicular to an indicated &#x201c;X&#x201d; axis, and may be perpendicular to an indicated &#x201c;Y&#x201d; axis.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As used herein, features (e.g., regions, structures, devices) described as &#x201c;neighboring&#x201d; one another means and includes features of the disclosed identity (or identities) that are located most proximate (e.g., closest to) one another. Additional features (e.g., additional regions, additional structures, additional devices) not matching the disclosed identity (or identities) of the &#x201c;neighboring&#x201d; features may be disposed between the &#x201c;neighboring&#x201d; features. Put another way, the &#x201c;neighboring&#x201d; features may be positioned directly adjacent one another, such that no other feature intervenes between the &#x201c;neighboring&#x201d; features; or the &#x201c;neighboring&#x201d; features may be positioned indirectly adjacent one another, such that at least one feature having an identity other than that associated with at least one the &#x201c;neighboring&#x201d; features is positioned between the &#x201c;neighboring&#x201d; features. Accordingly, features described as &#x201c;vertically neighboring&#x201d; one another means and includes features of the disclosed identity (or identities) that are located most vertically proximate (e.g., vertically closest to) one another. Moreover, features described as &#x201c;horizontally neighboring&#x201d; one another means and includes features of the disclosed identity (or identities) that are located most horizontally proximate (e.g., horizontally closest to) one another.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;bottom,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;top,&#x201d; &#x201c;front,&#x201d; &#x201c;rear,&#x201d; &#x201c;left,&#x201d; &#x201c;right,&#x201d; and the like, may be used for ease of description to describe one element's or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. Unless otherwise specified, the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the materials in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if materials in the figures are inverted, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; or &#x201c;under&#x201d; or &#x201c;on bottom of&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; or &#x201c;on top of&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the term &#x201c;below&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below, depending on the context in which the term is used, which will be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art. The materials may be otherwise oriented (e.g., rotated 90 degrees, inverted, flipped) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As used herein, &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; refers to structures operatively connected with each other, such as electrically connected through a direct Ohmic connection or through an indirect connection (e.g., by way of another structure).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As used herein, the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; in reference to a given parameter, property, or condition means and includes to a degree that one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the given parameter, property, or condition is met with a degree of variance, such as within acceptable tolerances. By way of example, depending on the particular parameter, property, or condition that is substantially met, the parameter, property, or condition may be at least 90.0 percent met, at least 95.0 percent met, at least 99.0 percent met, at least 99.9 percent met, or even 100.0 percent met.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; in reference to a numerical value for a particular parameter is inclusive of the numerical value and a degree of variance from the numerical value that one of ordinary skill in the art would understand is within acceptable tolerances for the particular parameter. For example, &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; in reference to a numerical value may include additional numerical values within a range of from 90.0 percent to 110.0 percent of the numerical value, such as within a range of from 95.0 percent to 105.0 percent of the numerical value, within a range of from 97.5 percent to 102.5 percent of the numerical value, within a range of from 99.0 percent to 101.0 percent of the numerical value, within a range of from 99.5 percent to 100.5 percent of the numerical value, or within a range of from 99.9 percent to 100.1 percent of the numerical value.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As used herein, &#x201c;conductive material&#x201d; means and includes electrically conductive material such as one or more of a metal (e.g., tungsten (W), titanium (Ti), molybdenum (Mo), niobium (Nb), vanadium (V), hafnium (Hf), tantalum (Ta), chromium (Cr), zirconium (Zr), iron (Fe), ruthenium (Ru), osmium (Os), cobalt (Co), rhodium (Rh), iridium (Ir), nickel (Ni), palladium (Pa), platinum (Pt), copper (Cu), silver (Ag), gold (Au), aluminum (Al)), an alloy (e.g., a Co-based alloy, an Fe-based alloy, an Ni-based alloy, an Fe- and Ni-based alloy, a Co- and Ni-based alloy, an Fe- and Co-based alloy, a Co- and Ni- and Fe-based alloy, an Al-based alloy, a Cu-based alloy, a magnesium (Mg)-based alloy, a Ti-based alloy, a steel, a low-carbon steel, a stainless steel), a conductive metal-containing material (e.g., a conductive metal nitride, a conductive metal silicide, a conductive metal carbide, a conductive metal oxide), and a conductively-doped semiconductor material (e.g., conductively-doped polysilicon, conductively-doped germanium (Ge), conductively-doped silicon germanium (SiGe)). In addition, a &#x201c;conductive structure&#x201d; means and includes a structure formed of and including conductive material.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As used herein, &#x201c;insulative material&#x201d; means and includes electrically insulative material, such one or more of at least one dielectric oxide material (e.g., one or more of a silicon oxide (SiO<sub>x</sub>), phosphosilicate glass, borosilicate glass, borophosphosilicate glass, fluorosilicate glass, an aluminum oxide (AlO<sub>x</sub>), a hafnium oxide (HfO<sub>x</sub>), a niobium oxide (NbO<sub>x</sub>), a titanium oxide (TiO<sub>x</sub>), a zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>x</sub>), a tantalum oxide (TaO<sub>x</sub>), and a magnesium oxide (MgO<sub>x</sub>)), at least one dielectric nitride material (e.g., a silicon nitride (SiN<sub>y</sub>)), at least one dielectric oxynitride material (e.g., a silicon oxynitride (SiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>)), at least one dielectric oxycarbide material (e.g., silicon oxycarbide (SiO<sub>x</sub>C<sub>y</sub>)), at least one hydrogenated dielectric oxycarbide material (e.g., hydrogenated silicon oxycarbide (SiC<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>Hz)), and at least one dielectric carboxynitride material (e.g., a silicon carboxynitride (SiO<sub>x</sub>C<sub>z</sub>N<sub>y</sub>)). Formulae including one or more of &#x201c;x,&#x201d; &#x201c;y,&#x201d; and &#x201c;z&#x201d; herein (e.g., SiO<sub>x</sub>, AlO<sub>x</sub>, HfO<sub>x</sub>, NbO<sub>x</sub>, TiO<sub>x</sub>, SiN<sub>y</sub>, SiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, SiO<sub>x</sub>C<sub>y</sub>, SiC<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>Hz, SiO<sub>x</sub>C<sub>z</sub>N<sub>y</sub>) represent a material that contains an average ratio of &#x201c;x&#x201d; atoms of one element, &#x201c;y&#x201d; atoms of another element, and &#x201c;z&#x201d; atoms of an additional element (if any) for every one atom of another element (e.g., Si, Al, Hf, Nb, Ti). As the formulae are representative of relative atomic ratios and not strict chemical structure, an insulative material may comprise one or more stoichiometric compounds and/or one or more non-stoichiometric compounds, and values of &#x201c;x,&#x201d; &#x201c;y,&#x201d; and &#x201c;z&#x201d; (if any) may be integers or may be non-integers. As used herein, the term &#x201c;non-stoichiometric compound&#x201d; means and includes a chemical compound with an elemental composition that cannot be represented by a ratio of well-defined natural numbers and is in violation of the law of definite proportions. In addition, an &#x201c;insulative structure&#x201d; means and includes a structure formed of and including insulative material.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As used herein, the term &#x201c;homogeneous&#x201d; means relative amounts of elements included in a feature (e.g., a material, a structure) do not vary throughout different portions (e.g., different horizontal portions, different vertical portions) of the feature. Conversely, as used herein, the term &#x201c;heterogeneous&#x201d; means relative amounts of elements included in a feature (e.g., a material, a structure) vary throughout different portions of the feature. If a feature is heterogeneous, amounts of one or more elements included in the feature may vary stepwise (e.g., change abruptly), or may vary continuously (e.g., change progressively, such as linearly, parabolically) throughout different portions of the feature. The feature may, for example, be formed of and include a stack of at least two different materials.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Unless the context indicates otherwise, the materials described herein may be formed by any suitable technique including, but not limited to, spin coating, blanket coating, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), plasma enhanced ALD (PEALD), physical vapor deposition (PVD) (e.g., sputtering), or epitaxial growth. Depending on the specific material to be formed, the technique for depositing or growing the material may be selected by a person of ordinary skill in the art. In addition, unless the context indicates otherwise, removal of materials described herein may be accomplished by any suitable technique including, but not limited to, etching (e.g., dry etching, wet etching, vapor etching), ion milling, abrasive planarization (e.g., chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP)), or other known methods.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> are various views (described in further detail below) illustrating different processing stages of a method of forming a microelectronic device (e.g., a memory device, such as a DRAM device), in accordance with embodiments of the disclosure.
