Inter alia, the activation of the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) causes OCD (Repeated cortico-striatal stimulation generates persistent OCD-like behavior. Science (New York, N.Y.), 340(6137), 1234-1239. (2013)) while the activation of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (1&#xb0; F.C) is suppressive of OCD (Optogenetic stimulation of lateral orbitofronto-striatal pathway suppresses compulsive behaviors. Science (New York, N.Y.), 340(6137), 1243-1246. (2013)).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">OCD is one of the very high rates of mental illness with a prevalence of 2%-3% worldwide. OCD is characterized by a severe obsession that appears with a particular repetitive convention (compulsion). Obsessive compulsive behaviors are common behaviors that occur in a similar pattern not only in patients diagnosed with OCD, but also in Tourette syndrome, drug addiction, and compulsive eating disorder, and are a major symptom involved in various mental disorders. However, there has not been any suggestion of neurological basis for the existence of an interaction between anxiety behavior and OCD. Currently, the first-line treatment relies on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-based drugs that act on the representative neurotransmitter serotonin system. In order to understand various related diseases and advance therapeutic techniques, there is therefore a need for development of a new animal model that helps understand the molecular and neuroscientific mechanisms of compulsions and simultaneously exhibits other OCD patterns in addition to specific compulsions (mainly grooming).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Given the current situation that a significant number of patients are resistant to currently available treatments (mainly SSRI-based), the development of new therapeutic techniques can be expected to have a very high ripple effect. Therefore, providing an integrated animal model of OCD is expected to be very useful in understanding the mechanisms of OCD as well as several related diseases (such as Tourette syndrome, adduction, comprehensive eating disorder, etc.) and in developing therapeutic and diagnostic techniques.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Existing OCD-related animal models have the disadvantage of not being able to reproduce all the various characteristics of obsessive-compulsive disorder because they are constructed by mainly deleting specific genes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">By contrast, the model suggested by the present disclosure is designed to alter the activity of the basal ganglia circuitry and expected to provide understanding of the mechanism of OCD in view of neural circuits.

Compulsive behaviors appear in the form of cleaning behavior, checking behavior, repetitive behavior, arranging behavior, delaying behavior, etc., and patients with OCD repeat the behaviors to recover from the anxiety that stems from obsessive thoughts, even though they know it is inappropriate and excessive.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As used herein, the &#x201c;amygdala&#x201d; is a part of the limbic system in the brain and performs a primary role in the processing of information pertaining to motivation, learning, and emotional responses. It is an organ consisting of 10 or more nuclei classified largely into three parts including basolateral nuclei, corticomedial nuclei, and central nuclei and receives information from various regions. First, the information received from sensory organs of the body is sent to the basolateral nuclei of the amygdala and then transferred to the cerebral cortex to make emotional experiences. Among sensory signals, olfactory signals penetrate into the corticomedial nuclei of the amygdala. The sensory signals introduced into the amygdala are connected to the central nuclei and then sent to the autonomic nervous system. The signals are in turn transferred to the hypothalamus to generate physiological responses such as stress hormone release or awakening.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The term &#x201c;basolateral amygdala&#x201d; (BLA), as used herein, refers to an area located at the basolateral side (basal side) of the amygdala.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As used herein, the term &#x201c;striatum&#x201d; refers to an area of the basal ganglia of the brain that plays an important role in the selection and initiation of movement through neural network connections with the cerebral cortex and thalamus. In primates, the striatum is divided into a ventral striatum and a dorsal striatum, subdivisions that are based upon function and connections. The ventral striatum consists of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the olfactory tubercle. The dorsal striatum consists of the caudate nucleus and the putamen.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As used herein, the term &#x201c;dorsomedial striatum&#x201d; (DMS) refers to an area that is located at the dorsal medial side of the striatum and corresponds to the caudate nucleus in primates.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the present disclosure, it was found that there is connectivity from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) and activation of the BLA-DMS neural circuit provokes representative compulsive behaviors of obsessive-compulsive disorder, such as checking behavior, repetitive behavior, cleaning behavior, or hoarding behavior, as analyzed through experiments.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Above all, it was found that there is a neural circuit connecting from BLA to DMS.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In detail, BLA, when injected with AAV-tdTomato, was stained red in the forward direction. At this location, a striatum area represented as the caudate-putamen (CPu), inter alia, a dorsomedial striatum (DMS) area and a ventral striatum area (NAc) were stained. After choleratoxin subunit b (CTB) was injected into a target area of DMS, staining in the reverse direction toward the BLA was detected, revealing that there is a circuit from the BLA to the DMS (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">This BLA-DMS neural circuit has not yet been known previously.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the present disclosure, optogenetics experiments were conducted to identify the role of the BLA-DMS neural circuit. When the BLA-DMS neural circuit is activated, grooming activity, which is a representative behavior of OCD, becomes excessive. Grooming in mice is an action corresponding to the repetitive hand wash known as a representative symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">For greater detail, AAV-ChR2 was injected into the BLA and an optical fiber was installed in the DMS, followed by exposure of the DMS to a blue radiation (473 nm) to specifically activate the BLA-DMS neural circuit, under the condition of which an EPM (elevated plus-maze) test was conducted (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). When AAV-ChR2 is injected into the BLA, the axons projecting from the BLA express channelrhodopsin (ChR2) at the ends thereof. When absorbing blue light with a wavelength of 470 nm, the channelrhodopsin (ChR2), located at the cell membrane, allows the inflow of Na<sup>+</sup> ions into cells to activate neurons. In an embodiment of the present disclosure, blue light (473 nm) was emitted to the optical fiber installed in the DMS to activate the BLA-DMS neural circuit. The activation of the BLA-DMS neural circuit was observed to increase anxiety, leading to the onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition, an animal model of obsessive-compulsive disorder was constructed using AAV virus and the chemogenetic technique designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug (DREADD) system in the present disclosure in order to activate the BLA-DMS circuit in a long term, not temporarily. The mice in which the BLA-DMS neural circuit is activated for a long term were observed to exhibit representative compulsive behaviors of obsessive-compulsive disorder, such as checking behavior, repetitive behavior, cleaning behavior, and hoarding behavior.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In greater detail, retrograde AAV carrying a gene coding for a Cre recombinant enzyme was injected into an area of the DMS and AAV-DIO-hM3Dq virus specifically expressing cre was injected to an area of the BLA, after which when the introduced virus was activated, a specific drug was administered to specifically the BLA-DMS neural circuit. For reference, this is based on the principle that when the retrograde virus from the DMS expresses Cre in the neuron cell body (soma) of the BLA, the AAV-DIO-hM3Dq virus is induced to express the target gene (hM3Dq) through the Double-Floxed Inverted Open reading frame (DIO) only in the presence of Cre. hM3Dq can activate neurons in cooperation with the membrane protein GPCR (G-protein-coupled receptors) upon stimulation with a specific drug, whereby the specific activation of the BLA-DMS neural circuit can be achieved. For mice adapted to activate the BLA-DMS neural circuit for a long term, the checking behavior, repetitive behavior, cleaning behavior, and hoarding behavior, which correspond to the representative compulsive behaviors of obsessive-compulsory disorder, were significantly increased while cognitive flexibility decreased (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>15</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Herein, &#x201c;adeno-associated virus&#x201d; (AAV), which is a type of parvovirus, is a non-pathogenic virus that does not provoke a significant immune response and has a broad spectrum of host cells. AAV can infect both dividing and quiescent cells. Having ability to integrate virally carried genes into the host genome in addition to existing in the form of an episomal DNA within host cells, AAV is available as a gene carrier (vector) for gene therapy and thus has recently attracted considerable interest. Particularly when infecting human cells, the virus tends to integrate the viral genome into a specific site in the human chromosome 19. Since this site is known to be free of genes responsible for special functions, the insertional mutagenesis-induced activation of oncogenes is highly unlikely to occur. Hence, AAV is further advantageous for gene therapy. Moreover, chromosomal insertion is almost not carried out by adeno-associated viruses in a recombinant form, and the reason remains unclear yet.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Due to the aforementioned advantages, adeno-related virus (AAV) has been considered as a gene carrier (vector) that can introduce foreign genes necessary for treatment into a subject to be treated.

Axon terminals projecting from the BLA express channel rhodopsin (ChR2). When exposed to blue light, ChR2 acts in the cell membrane to cause an influx of Na+ ions, activating neurons. While This technology (Optogenetics) was used to selectively activate the BLA-DMS circuit by applying blue light (473) specifically to the DMS among the sites receiving signals from the BLA, an elevated plus maze (EPM) test was conducted.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The EPM is a test measuring anxiety mainly in rodents such as mice. In the EPM, it is interpreted that the longer the time spent on the open arm, the lower the anxiety, and the longer the time spent on the closed arm, the higher the anxiety. As a result of observing the behavioral change of mice (BL6/N), the representative grooming behavior (hair trimming) among obsessive-compulsive symptoms increased rapidly immediately after receiving light. At the same time, it was seen that the rate of open arm duration in the EPM decreased while receiving light (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). This data suggests that activation of the BLA-DMS circuit may increase anxiety and further induce obsessive-compulsive symptoms.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Construction of Animal Model of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">First, an animal model of obsessive-compulsive disorder was constructed using the BLA-DMS circuit, and a hole board test was designed to easily examine the expression of obsessive-compulsive disorder phenomena.

Based on the home base, water was placed on the right end of the acrylic plate, and 10% sucrose was placed on the other side (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">For construction of an animal model of obsessive-compulsive disorder, a method for activating the BLA-DMS circuit in mice for a long term, but not temporarily, was designed (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">AAV-retro Cre virus, which can make a retrograde infection, was injected to the DMS while AAV-DIO-hM3Dq, which specifically expresses Cre, was injected into the BLA. That is, advantage was taken of the principle that when the retrograde virus from the DMS expresses Cre in the neuron cell body (soma) of the BLA, the AAV-DIO-hM3Dq virus is induced to express hM3Dq thereat only in the presence of Cre. hM3Dq can activate neurons in cooperation with the membrane protein GPCR (G-protein-coupled receptors) upon stimulation with the drug CNO (clozapine n-oxide), whereby the specific activation of the BLA-DMS neural circuit can be achieved. After injecting different viruses into these two areas, it takes more than 4 weeks for the viruses to show their activities.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">After 4 weeks, the learning process was performed for the first 4 days on the hole board without injection of CNO (clozapine n-oxide). During this process, the mice identify and remember the location of the water and 10% sucrose. The BLA-DMS circuit was continuously activated by injecting CNO (1 mg/kg) at the same time every day for 12 days, using the behavioral values of the 4<sup>th </sup>day as a reference. For a control against CNO (clozapine n-oxide), saline was administered to the mice that had undergone the same process (injected with the same viruses). While a hole board test was conducted during this period, the saline-administered group and the CNO (clozapine n-oxide)-administered group of the mice were observed for changes in compulsive behaviors (1. checking behavior (repetitive checking), 2. repetitive nose poking (repetitively inserting the nose into the hole), 3. excessive grooming (excessive washing&#x2014;hair trimming), and 4. flexibility (cognitive flexibility)). After one day, it was observed whether the compulsive behavior was maintained even without CNO (clozapine n-oxide) administration, and the following day, a hoarding (storage disorder) pattern was observed. Subsequently, the position of water and 10% sucrose was changed, and it was observed whether there was a difference in cognitive flexibility between the saline-administered group and the CNO-administered group was observed. This lack of cognitive flexibility is a major feature of the obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicting the result, there was no difference in the frequency of heading toward water in both the saline-administered group and the CNO (Clozapine n-oxide)-administered group, but there was a significant difference between the groups in the frequency of heading toward 10% sucrose (repeated 1-way ANOVA). In particular, the checking frequency of heading toward 10% sucrose in the CNO (chlorine n-oxide)-administered group was significantly increased, compared to the control.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, it was confirmed that repetitive nose poking (the action of repeatedly inserting the nose into the hole) also showed a significant difference between the saline-administered group and the CNO (clozapine n-oxide)-administered group (repeated 1-way ANOVA). The CNO (Clozapine n-oxide)-administered group was observed to conduct nose poking at greatly increased frequencies.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, both the grooming time and frequency showed significant differences between the saline-administered group and the CNO (Clozapine n-oxide)-administered group (Repeated 1-way ANOVA). Both the time and frequency were measured to be significantly increased in the CNO (clozapine n-oxide)-administered group, compared to the saline-administered group. For reference, grooming analyzed in this experiment is an action that corresponds to excessive hand washing, known as a representative symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Among others, data from checking and nose poking show that the obsessive-compulsory disorder was maintained even on day 13 when saline and clozapine n-oxide (CNO) were not administered.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, there was no difference between the saline-administered group and the CNO (clozapine n-oxide)-administered group in the amount of 10% sucrose drank despite a significant difference in the checking frequency. These data demonstrate that the results of action conducted so far were not differences due to rewards, but repetitive behaviors due to obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In addition, the results of the cognitive flexibility test performed on the last day of the experiment (day 14) confirmed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, that the flexibility was significantly lower in the CNO (Clozapine n-oxide)-administered group than in the saline-administered group (Student t-test). In the case of flexibility, the number of times to go to water and sucrose which had swapped positions on the 18<sup>th </sup>day (day 14) was measured.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">For use in identifying hoarding patterns, two cages were attached to each other with a central passageway (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). In order to allow the mice to recognize one case as a home case, the passageway to the opposite side were blocked for one day (day 12). In the evening of the next day (day 13), food and toys were placed on the opposite side and the blocked passage was opened. In this context, water was placed in the home cage. In the morning of the last day of the experiment (day 14), differences were observed between the saline-administered group and the CNO-administered group in terms of how many food pellets and toys were brought to the home cage.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> to <b>14</b></figref>, it was observed that hoarding of both food pellets and toys was significantly increased in the CNO (Clozapine n-oxide)-administered group compared to the saline-administered group. Particularly, toys, although unnecessary, were stored in a significantly large amount in the CNO (Clozapine n-oxide)-administered group, so it can be seen that hoarding of obsessive-compulsive disorder was implemented.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Additionally, after 20 days from the last day, it was observed that the hairs around the mouth of the Clozapine n-oxide (CNO)-administered mice fell out, compared to the saline-administered mice, indicating a phenotype caused by excessive grooming (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Although particular embodiments of the present disclosure have been described herein, it should be understood that the foregoing embodiments and advantages are merely examples and are not to be construed as limiting the present disclosure or the scope of the claims.
