Typical wireless communication systems may employ multiple-access technologies capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing available system resources. Examples of such multiple-access technologies include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, and time division synchronous code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA) systems.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">These multiple access technologies have been adopted in various telecommunication standards to provide a common protocol that enables different wireless devices to communicate on a municipal, national, regional, and even global level. An example telecommunication standard is 5G New Radio (NR). 5G NR is part of a continuous mobile broadband evolution promulgated by Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to meet new requirements associated with latency, reliability, security, scalability (e.g., with Internet of Things (IoT)), and other requirements. 5G NR includes services associated with enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine type communications (mMTC), and ultra reliable low latency communications (URLLC). Some aspects of 5G NR may be based on the 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard. There exists a need for further improvements in 5G NR technology. These improvements may also be applicable to other multi-access technologies and the telecommunication standards that employ these technologies.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more aspects in order to provide a basic understanding of such aspects. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated aspects, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all aspects nor delineate the scope of any or all aspects. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more aspects in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A network may control a radio configuration for a user equipment (UE).

The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of various concepts. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these concepts may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring such concepts.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A network may control many aspects of the radio configurations for a UE. However, a UE has a better understanding of various factors than the base station. For example, the UE is aware of a power status, e.g., including an anticipated battery life. The UE is also aware of user changes to power preferences, e.g., when a user switches to a low power mode in a user menu at the UE. A UE may also be aware that an application is active or is anticipated to be active. Aspects presented herein enable a network to make more effective radio configurations for a particular UE by having the UE share information about the UE, including recommendations and/or preferences, with the base station. For example, the UE may provide recommendations/preferences regarding the UE's preferred radio configurations based on information known at the UE that is not known by the base station. The base station may then determine radio configurations for the UE based on an increased understanding of factors and preferences for the UE.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Several aspects of telecommunication systems will now be presented with reference to various apparatus and methods. These apparatus and methods will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks, components, circuits, processes, algorithms, etc. (collectively referred to as &#x201c;elements&#x201d;).

If implemented in software, the functions may be stored on or encoded as one or more instructions or code on a computer-readable medium. Computer-readable media includes computer storage media. Storage media may be any available media that can be accessed by a computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can comprise a random-access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM), optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage, other magnetic storage devices, combinations of the aforementioned types of computer-readable media, or any other medium that can be used to store computer executable code in the form of instructions or data structures that can be accessed by a computer.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a wireless communications system and an access network <b>100</b>.

Each slot may include 7 or 14 symbols, depending on the slot configuration. For slot configuration <b>0</b>, each slot may include 14 symbols, and for slot configuration <b>1</b>, each slot may include 7 symbols.

In the UL, the controller/processor <b>375</b> provides demultiplexing between transport and logical channels, packet reassembly, deciphering, header decompression, control signal processing to recover IP packets from the UE <b>350</b>.

However, a UE has a better understanding of some factors than the base station. For example, the UE is aware of the UE's power status, e.g., including an anticipated battery life. The UE is also aware of user changes to power preferences, e.g., when a user switches to a low power mode in a user menu at the UE. A UE may also be aware that an application is active or is anticipated to be active. Aspects presented herein enable a network to make more effective radio configurations for a particular UE by having the UE share information about the UE, including recommendations and/or preferences, with the base station. For example, the UE may provide recommendations regarding preferred radio configuration parameters based on information known at the UE that is not known by the base station. The base station may then determine radio configurations for the UE based on an increased understanding of factors and preferences for the UE.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example communication flow <b>400</b> between a base station <b>402</b> and a UE <b>404</b> in accordance with the aspects presented herein. As illustrated at <b>407</b>, the UE <b>404</b> may select parameters for radio configurations for the UE. The selection may be based on different purposes. The UE <b>404</b> may classify UE configuration parameters into different categories based on different purposes or user preferences. One example purpose may be a power saving purpose. Other examples of purposes may include performance, improved communication, etc. For example, the UE <b>404</b> may signal certain DRX parameters when the UE measures traffic patterns and estimates an optimal set of DRX parameters based on the measured traffic. As another example, the UE <b>404</b> may signal beam management parameters when the UE <b>404</b> will adjust its receiving beam or transmission beam. Thus, the selected parameters may correspond to preferences or recommendations from the UE <b>404</b> for UE radio parameters. At <b>409</b>, the UE may indicate the selected parameters, from <b>405</b>, to the base station <b>402</b>. The selected parameters/UE preferences for radio configurations may be referred to as assistance information, such as UE assistance information and may include UE configuration parameter(s). The assistance information may inform the base station that the UE <b>404</b> would prefer to prioritize power savings over performance, for example. When a user switches the UE <b>404</b> to a lower power mode, which will be followed by the UE component's including the modem, the UE <b>404</b> may indicate to the base station a preference for power savings over performance in the UE's radio configurations. As well, based on a power status of the UE <b>404</b>, the UE <b>404</b> may indicate preferences to the base station <b>402</b> that will affect power savings. As well, the UE <b>404</b> may select the parameters based on a knowledge of which applications are active at the UE <b>404</b> and/or will become active at the UE <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The UE <b>404</b> may provide the assistance information to the base station, such as in an Information Element (IE). For example, the assistance information may be included in a UE Assistance IE (UAI), e.g., in addition to a UE's preferred setting for a delay budget report. The delay budget report may be used by the UE <b>404</b> to indicate a UE preferred adjustment to a connected mode DRX coverage enhancement configuration.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">There may be various different parameters that a UE <b>404</b> may indicate to the base station <b>402</b> in the assistance information, e.g. comprised in the UAI. The UE <b>404</b> may send its preferred values of each of the parameters to the base station <b>402</b>, e.g., in a single UAI. In another example, the UE <b>404</b> may send a subset of the preferred parameters to the base station <b>402</b> in a first UAI. The UE <b>404</b> may send another subset of the preferred parameters to the base station <b>402</b> in another UAI. The UE <b>404</b> may send a single preferred parameter or indication to the base station <b>402</b> in the UAI. Thus, the UE <b>404</b> may communicate assistance information to the base station <b>402</b> in a grouping and order determined by the UE <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The base station <b>402</b> may use the assistance information, at <b>411</b>, to determine the radio configurations for the UE <b>404</b>. The assistance information may be one of various factors considered by the base station <b>402</b> in configuring the UE <b>404</b>. The base station <b>402</b> might not be constrained by the preferences indicated to the base station at <b>409</b>, but may be free to use the information to configure the UE <b>404</b> in a more effective manner. As well, the assistance information may indicate to the base station <b>402</b> that the UE <b>404</b> would prefer to operate using a lower power mode, and the base station <b>402</b> may determine the way to achieve the lower power mode through the UE's radio configurations. At <b>413</b>, the base station <b>402</b> may configure the UE <b>404</b> with the configuration(s) determined at <b>411</b> using the assistance information provided by the UE. The base station <b>402</b> and UE <b>404</b> may then implement the configuration(s) in communicating with each other. As illustrated at <b>415</b>, the base station <b>402</b> may communicate uplink and/or downlink communication with the UE <b>404</b> based on the configuration of the UE at <b>413</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As illustrated at <b>403</b>, the base station <b>402</b> may broadcast, or otherwise transmit, a range of available parameters for UE selection. For example, rather than broadcasting the range of available parameters, the base station <b>402</b> may indicate range(s) of available parameter(s) to the UE <b>404</b> in dedicated RRC signaling for the UE <b>404</b>. Thus, the base station <b>402</b> may indicate to the UE <b>404</b> the ranges that are possible and/or whether the base station <b>402</b> supports the UE selection of preferred radio configuration parameters. The network may determine whether to broadcast the available ranges and may also determine which available ranges to broadcast. For example, a base station <b>402</b> may broadcast values of all potential parameters or only a subset of the potential parameters. When a base station <b>402</b> does not broadcast the available range(s), it may indicate to the UE <b>404</b> that UE selection from among those parameter is not supported by the base station <b>402</b>. Thus, at <b>405</b>, the UE <b>404</b> may determine whether or not UE selection/recommendation of assistance information is supported by the base station <b>402</b> based on whether or not the UE <b>404</b> receives an indication of the range(s) of available parameter(s) from the base station. When the UE <b>404</b> does not receive any range(s) of available parameter(s) from the base station <b>402</b>, the UE <b>404</b> may determine that the UE does not support the UE selection of preferred parameter values. Thus, the UE <b>404</b> may refrain from selecting preferred values and may refrain from sending assistance information to the base station <b>402</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">If the UE <b>404</b> receives the range(s) of available parameter(s) from the base station <b>402</b>, at <b>403</b>, the UE may select, at <b>407</b>, a value from among the available ranges indicated by the base station <b>402</b>. Thus, the UE <b>404</b> may send back to the base station <b>402</b>, in the assistance information <b>409</b>, an indication of a value/parameter selected from among the range of available parameter(s) broadcast by the base station <b>402</b>. The UE <b>404</b> may use an index comprised in a message to the base station <b>402</b> to indicate the selected value from within the available range(s). For example, the index may be comprised in a UAI. The UE <b>404</b> may send back an index for each parameter for which the base station <b>402</b> provided an available range. The UE <b>404</b> may send back indexes for a subset of parameters for which the base station <b>402</b> provided available ranges. The UE <b>404</b> may even send back an index for a single parameter from among the parameters for which the base station <b>402</b> provided available ranges. The UE <b>404</b> may determine for which parameters from a plurality of possible parameters, the UE <b>404</b> will provide assistance information to the base station <b>402</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The assistance information <b>409</b> provided by the UE <b>404</b> to the base station <b>402</b> may comprise preferences/recommendation regarding any of various parameters that affect a UE's radio configuration(s). For example, the indicated parameters may comprise any combination of parameters related to the UE's DRX configuration, parameters related to the UE's bandwidth configuration, parameters related to a data channels for the UE <b>404</b>, parameters related to a control channel for the UE <b>404</b>, parameters related to beam management for the UE <b>404</b>, and/or parameters related to the UE's power status.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, the indicated parameters may comprise any combination of parameters related to the UE's DRX configuration, such as a DRX on duration, a DRX inactivity timer, a DRX long cycle, a DRX short cycle, a DRX short cycle timer, a DRX slot offset, an average data rate for traffic for the UE <b>404</b>, an average Transport Block (TB) size for traffic for the UE <b>404</b>, or an average burst duration for traffic for the UE <b>404</b>, among other examples. Such parameters related to the UE's DRX configuration may be sent in addition to, or separately from, a delay budget report that may indicate a UE preference to adjust to a connected mode DRX or a coverage enhancement configuration. For example, the delay budget report may indicate that the UE <b>404</b> would prefer to transition to a long DRX cycle. The assistance information presented herein may provide different/additional parameters relating to a UE's DRX configuration. For example, by providing information about preferences or recommendations for the UE's DRX configuration, the UE <b>404</b> may indicate to the base station <b>402</b> whether the UE <b>404</b> is prioritizing power savings or performance. The base station <b>402</b> may then configure the UE <b>404</b> for DRX, e.g., at <b>413</b>, with an understanding of which aspect the UE <b>404</b> considers more important at the time. The base station <b>402</b> may use at least one of the indicated parameters in configuring the UE <b>404</b> for DRX, or the base station <b>402</b> may adjust a DRX parameter based on the assistance information from the UE <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As another example, the indicated parameters may comprise any combination of parameters related to the UE's bandwidth configurations. For example, the UE may indicate to the base station a preference or recommendation for aggregated bandwidth across all serving cells for the UE <b>404</b>, such as for serving cells for different carrier types. The UE <b>404</b> may indicate to the base station <b>402</b> a preferred or recommended number of downlink carriers and/or uplink carriers for the UE <b>404</b>. The UE <b>404</b> may indicate to the base station <b>402</b> a preference/recommendation about a carrier type, e.g., for carrier selection between FR1 and FR2. The base station <b>402</b> may determine a bandwidth configuration for the UE <b>404</b> using the indicated bandwidth preferences from the UE <b>404</b>. The base station <b>402</b> may use at least one of the indicated parameters in the bandwidth configuration for the UE <b>404</b>, or the base station <b>402</b> may adjust a parameter of the UE's bandwidth configuration based on the assistance information from the UE <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As another example, the indicated parameters may comprise any combination of parameters related to a data channel for the UE, such as PUSCH and/or PDSCH for the UE <b>404</b>. For example, the UE <b>404</b> may indicate a preference or recommendation about a maximum TB size that the UE <b>404</b> can handle in PUSCH and/or PDSCH. The base station <b>402</b> may determine a configuration for the UE <b>404</b> for PUSCH/PDSCH based on the assistance information provided by the UE <b>404</b>, e.g., for communication based on a TB size that does not exceed the maximum indicated by the UE <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As another example, the indicated parameters may comprise any combination of parameters related to a control channel for the UE <b>404</b>, e.g., PDCCH for the UE <b>404</b>. The UE <b>404</b> may indicate a preference/recommendation for a particular TDD pattern for PDCCH. The UE <b>404</b> may indicate a preference/recommendation for a particular periodicity for PDCCH monitoring. A higher monitoring periodicity may require larger amounts of power at the UE <b>404</b>. The UE <b>404</b> may indicate a preference/recommendation for HARQ feedback from the UE <b>404</b>, e.g., information about a HARQ processing timeline. The base station <b>402</b> may determine a configuration for the UE <b>404</b> for PDCCH based on the assistance information provided by the UE <b>404</b>, e.g., by selecting the TDD pattern, monitoring periodicity, and/or HARQ parameters using the assistance information provided by the UE <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">As another example, the indicated parameters may comprise any combination of parameters related to beam management for the UE <b>404</b>. For example, the UE <b>404</b> may indicate a preference/recommendation for an antenna panel at the UE <b>404</b> and/or the base station <b>402</b>, e.g., an antenna panel or a subset of antenna panels from among a plurality of possible antenna panels.

The UE <b>404</b> may indicate information about the UE <b>404</b> that may be helpful to the base station <b>402</b> in performing beam management.

The assistance information may indicate a modem thermal level for the UE <b>404</b>. If the modem has a temperature above a certain level, the base station <b>402</b> may determine that the UE <b>404</b> would benefit from a lower power mode that would decrease activity and the UE's modem in order to help reduce the temperature of the modem. The assistance information may indicate a power preference indication. This may enable the UE <b>404</b> to communicate a power preference to the base station <b>402</b>, e.g., whether the UE <b>404</b> prefers a normal mode or a lower power mode, using a binary indication.

Optional aspects are illustrated with a dashed line. The method enables more effective configurations for a UE by having the UE provide assistance information, e.g., including UE configuration parameter(s), to the base station that can be used by the base station to configured the UE.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">At <b>804</b>, the base station receives at least one UE configuration parameter from a UE, the UE configuration parameter(s) comprising at least one preferred parameter for a UE configuration, e.g., a described in connection with <b>409</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The reception of the UE configuration parameter may be performed, for example, by the assistance information component <b>908</b> of the apparatus <b>902</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, for example. The UE configuration parameter(s) may be received by the base station in an IE from the UE. For example, the UE configuration parameter(s) may be indicated in a UAI, e.g., in addition to a preferred setting for a delay budget report that indicates whether a UE prefers a long DRX mode.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The UE configuration parameter(s) may comprise an indication for a preferred parameter for at least one of a DRX on duration, a DRX inactivity timer, a DRX long cycle, a DRX short cycle, a DRX short cycle timer, a DRX slot offset, an average data rate, an average transport block size, or an average burst duration. For example, the UE configuration parameter(s) may comprise an indication for a preferred bandwidth configuration for the UE, e.g., indicating at least one of an aggregated bandwidth across serving cells for different types of carriers, a downlink/uplink bandwidth part index for a serving cell, a number of uplink carriers, a number of downlink carriers, or a carrier type. The UE configuration parameter(s) may comprise an indication for a preferred data channel parameter, e.g., indicating a maximum transport block size for a downlink data channel or an uplink data channel. The UE configuration parameter(s) may comprise an indication for a preferred control channel parameter, e.g., comprising at least one of a TDD pattern, a control channel monitoring periodicity, or a processing timeline related to feedback processing. The UE configuration parameter(s) may comprise an indication for a beam management parameter, e.g., comprising at least one of a preferred antenna panel, a preferred beam, information about a trajectory of the UE, or a mobility parameter for the UE.

The base station may use a particular parameter indicated in the UE configuration parameter(s) from the UE or may use the UE configuration parameter(s) to determine/adjust an existing parameter determined by the base station. Thus, the network may configure a set of parameters for a UE, and during operation, a UE may suggest preferred values for the parameters.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">As illustrated at <b>808</b>, the base station may use the UE's configuration to communicate with the UE, e.g., to transmit downlink communication and/or to receive uplink communication.

The range of parameters may be transmitted, e.g., by the range component <b>912</b> of the apparatus <b>902</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.
