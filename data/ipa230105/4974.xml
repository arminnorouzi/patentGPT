These fraudulent transactions present liability issues to one or more parties involved in the transaction, such as an issuing bank, a merchant, a payment processing network, or an acquirer bank. As such, these parties are interested in fraud detection, or the ability to analyze the data surrounding a payment card transaction before authorizing the transaction. For example, in online transactions through a merchant web site or &#x201c;card-not-present&#x201d; transactions, the merchant party in the transaction may assume initial liability for certain aspects of the transaction unless, for example, certain risk-mitigating steps are taken.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One such risk-mitigating step is cardholder authentication. For example, some payment networks engage an authentication service that performs an authentication of a suspect consumer prior to authorization of the transaction. The authentication service determines if the source of the transaction is the authorized user of the payment card. In addition to the authentication system, many known systems also use a fraud scoring system to detect potentially fraudulent transactions. There exists a need for more advanced fraud detection systems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A computer-implemented method for enhancing payment transaction authentication using a merchant loyalty scheme is provided.

The description clearly enables one skilled in the art to make and use the disclosure, describes several embodiments, adaptations, variations, alternatives, and uses of the disclosure, including what is presently believed to be the best mode of carrying out the disclosure. These system and methods to enhance payment transaction authentication using a merchant loyalty scheme.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">One risk-mitigating step against fraudulent cardholder transactions is cardholder authentication. For example, some payment networks engage an authentication service that performs an authentication of a suspect consumer prior to authorization of the transaction. The authentication service determines if the source of the transaction is the authorized user of the payment card. During such authentication, the suspect consumer (i.e., the person attempting to perform the payment card transaction with the merchant) may be presented with an authentication challenge, sometimes called a &#x201c;step-up challenge.&#x201d; This step-up challenge generally requires the suspect consumer to provide a password or a passcode from a second factor device before the transaction will be processed. By obtaining this additional factor from the suspect consumer, the likelihood of the suspect consumer being a fraudulent consumer is reduced. However, this extra step presents an interruptive inconvenience, a barrier, or an interference to at least some legitimate consumers and subsequently causes at least some consumers to abandon legitimate transactions. These abandonments results in lost revenues to many parties, such as the merchant, the merchant acquirer, and the issuer.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the example embodiment, a verification computer device (also known as a verification server) includes a processor in communication with a memory. The verification computer device is in communication with a payment processing network. In some embodiments, the verification computer device may be a part of the payment processing network, for example the network interchange, or the verification computer device may be separate from the payment processing network and merely in communication with the payment processing network. The payment processing network includes a point of sale, a merchant, a merchant bank, an interchange network, and an issuing bank (also known as an issuer processor). The verification computer device is configured to determine determines if the source of the transaction is the authorized user of the payment card to assist the merchant in determining whether to approve or deny the candidate online payment transaction.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the example embodiment, the verification computer device receives authentication data from a merchant about a candidate online payment transaction. The candidate online payment transaction is for a payment card transaction through a website associated with the merchant. The authentication data includes a plurality of data elements about the candidate cardholder and the payment transaction (i.e., shipping address, billing address, and device identifiers). In the example embodiment, the verification computer device receives an authentication request message for a payment transaction originating from an originating merchant for a cardholder. The authentication request message includes a reward redemption flag indicating that the candidate cardholder redeemed a reward associated with the merchant's loyalty program. The redeemed reward was a unique reward that what uniquely tied to the candidate cardholder. The verification computer device determines if an authentication challenge is needed to authenticate the candidate cardholder. If the reward redemption flag is not set, the verification computer device transmits an authentication challenge to the user. If the reward redemption flag is set, the verification computer device determines that the authentication challenge was successfully responded to or that the authentication challenge may be bypassed. The verification computer device also considers the payment transaction to be a low-risk transaction based on the reward redemption flag being set. The verification computer device generates an authentication response message based, at least in part, on at least one of reward redemption flag and the authentication challenge. Then the verification computer device transmits the authentication response message to the originating merchant.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the example embodiment, the verification computer device receives authentication data for a candidate online payment transaction from a merchant. The candidate online payment transaction is a payment transaction that a cardholder conducts with the merchant via a website or an app (i.e., hosted on a mobile device) associated with the merchant. In the example embodiment, the candidate online payment transaction is a card-not-present transaction that occurs via a website or application, such as over the Internet. The authentication data is data used to determine if the source of the payment transaction is the authorized user of the payment card.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, authentication data includes one or more of: (1) consumer device attributes such as, for example, device attribute data (i.e., data derived from the device that the cardholder is transacting from, which can ultimately be used for creating a device fingerprint, and which may include IP address, physical address associated with IP address, device type, and phone number), and geo-location data (i.e., data from the device of the cardholder, indicating the assessed location of the device, such as GPS location, country, city, etc.); (2) data from the merchant such as, for example, consumer contact information (personally identifiable information (PII) about the cardholder associated with the payment account that the candidate online payment transaction is for, which will be used to determine the likelihood that the merchant has the correct cardholder, and which may include email address, mobile phone number, landline phone number, confirmed shipping address, and consumer identity verification (e.g., anonymous, unverified, externally scored (e.g., credit reference agency), authentic issued official ID (e.g., passport, driver's license)), and age of cardholder relationship); and (3) merchant reference data such as, for example, days account has been on file with the merchant, days since the cardholder last used the card on file, verification method of the cardholder performed by the merchant at the time of candidate online payment transaction, purchases information (i.e., type of goods/services provided-digital only, low value, high value with verified address, in-store), and a merchant risk score (i.e., a risk score derived from the merchant's risk systems and reference data, also known as a merchant fraud grading). In some embodiments, the merchant risk score may also include one or more merchant reason codes, which are codes that represent why the merchant assigned that particular merchant risk score to the candidate online payment transaction.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Many people belong to loyalty reward programs associated with merchants. The merchants associated with these loyalty programs provide rewards to each individual member based on the purchases that the member makes with the associated merchant. In many programs, a reward is provided when the member spends a certain amount of money with the merchant. For example, one loyalty program may provide the member with a $5 off reward every time the member spends $100 with the merchant. Other loyalty programs provide rewards based on the number transactions that the member completes with the merchant. The reward may be provided as a redemption code, where the redemption code is generated to be unique for the member and for the reward. For example, a single member may have received three different rewards and each one has a different unique redemption code. The unique code provides a way for the merchant to track and authenticate the redemption reward.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the example embodiment, a member uses an earned redemption reward by entering the associated reward code while at the checkout of a payment transaction. In some embodiments, the reward code may be entered at the checkout of an ecommerce transaction. In other embodiments, the reward code may be scanned from a coupon at a physical checkout, i.e., at a brick and mortar location. The merchant confirms that that reward code is associated with that member. The merchant may also confirm that the reward code has not been previously used and that the reward code is appropriate for the current transaction. If the reward code is confirmed, then the merchant reduces the transaction amount based on the reward.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">For the purposes of this application, the reward codes described herein are unique reward codes. In the example embodiment, a member purchases over $100 from a merchant associated with a loyalty program. The member receives a $5 coupon for use with transactions with the merchant. This $5 coupon is a unique coupon only for that member. In the example embodiment, the member receives a unique code as a part of the coupon. In some embodiments, this code is in the form of an alphanumeric code that the member has to enter in the shopping cart at the merchant's webstore. In other embodiments, the code is encoded in a bar code or QR code that the member could scan as a part of the purchase transaction. However, the code will only work once and is directly associated with the member and the member's loyalty program account.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The verification computer device determines whether an authentication challenge is needed based on the authentication data included in the authentication request message. In the example embodiment, the verification computer device determines that an authentication challenge is needed when the authentication data does not provide enough to confirm or authenticate the candidate cardholder. In this situation, the verification computer device determines that it will be able to finish authenticating the identity of candidate cardholder based on the results of the authentication challenge. Examples of authentication challenges, also known as step-up challenges, include but are not limited to, a static password request, a request for biometric data (i.e., fingerprint), a one-time password request, a challenge question, or any other form that requires candidate cardholder to perform an action to confirm his or her identity.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">If the reward redemption flag was not set in the authentication request message, the verification computer device transmits the authentication challenge to the candidate cardholder. The results of the authentication challenge are received by the verification computer device. In some embodiments, the verification computer device receives and compares the raw data received from the candidate cardholder in response to the authentication challenge to determine the results of the authentication challenge. In other embodiments, the determination is performed by the merchant and the verification computer device receives the results from the merchant. In some embodiments, the verification computer device transmits the authentication challenge directly to the candidate cardholder. In other embodiments, the verification computer device transmits the authentication challenge to the merchant, which transmits the authentication challenge to the candidate cardholder.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">If the redemption reward flag is set in the authentication request message, the verification computer device determines that the authentication challenge has already been successfully responded to or that the authentication challenge may be bypassed. The verification computer device considers the payment transaction to be a low-risk transaction. Therefore, the verification computer device does not transmit an authentication challenge to the candidate cardholder and authenticates the candidate cardholder.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The verification computer device generates an authentication response message. The authentication response message is based on the authentication challenges and the reward redemption flag. If the authentication challenge was transmitted and successfully answered or if the reward redemption flag was set, then the authentication response message authenticates the candidate cardholder. If the challenge question failed, then the authentication response message does not authenticate the candidate cardholder. The verification computer device transmits the authentication response message to the originating merchant.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the verification computer device also performs the validation of the unique reward code. In these embodiments, the verification computer device receives the unique reward code entered by the candidate cardholder and other identifying information about the candidate cardholder. For example, the other identifying information may be the candidate cardholder's account number for the merchant loyalty program. The verification computer device uses the identifying information to determine the merchant loyalty program account associated with the candidate cardholder. The verification computer device then compares the unique reward code with those unique reward codes associated with the candidate cardholder's account. If there is a match, where a unique reward code that matches the received unique reward code was issued to the candidate cardholder, then the verification computer device validates the unique reward code and transmits the positive validation to the merchant. In some of these embodiments, the verification computer device also confirms that the unique reward code has not been previously used and/or is still valid.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the embodiments where the verification computer device validates the unique reward code, the verification computer device may not receive a reward redemption flag in the authentication request message. In these embodiments, the validation computer device may consider the reward redemption flag to be set, based on the verification computer device's previous validation of the unique reward code.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the verification computer device is in communication with a reward validation device. The reward validation device validates the unique reward code for the merchant. In these embodiments, the verification computer device is able to transmit a request to the reward validation device to receive some or all of the information about the candidate cardholder. For example, the verification computer device may be able to access the name and address stored in the candidate cardholder's reward account. The verification computer device may then compare that information to the authentication data to authenticate the candidate cardholder.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The methods and system described herein may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware, or any combination or subset. As disclosed above, at least one technical problem with prior systems is that there is a need for enhanced payment transaction authentication. The system and methods described herein address that technical problem. The technical effect of the systems and processes described herein is achieved by performing at least one of the following steps: (a) receiving an authentication request message for a payment transaction originating from an originating merchant for a cardholder, the authorization request message includes a reward redemption flag; (b) determine a fraud score for the cardholder based on the authorization request message; (c) determine that an authentication challenge is needed based on the fraud score; (d) if the reward redemption flag is not set, transmit an authentication challenge to the user; (e) if the reward redemption flag is set, determine that the authentication challenge may be bypassed based on the reward redemption flag; (f) generate the authentication response message based, at least in part, on the fraud score, the reward redemption flag, and the authentication challenge; and (g) transmit the authentication response message to the originating merchant. The resulting technical effect is that a more accurate authentication system provides a method of using redeemed loyalty program rewards for authentication of the associated payment transaction.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;transaction card,&#x201d; &#x201c;financial transaction card,&#x201d; and &#x201c;payment card&#x201d; refer to any suitable transaction card, such as a credit card, a debit card, a prepaid card, a charge card, a membership card, a promotional card, a frequent flyer card, an identification card, a gift card, and/or any other device that may hold payment account information, such as mobile phones, Smartphones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), key fobs, and/or computers.

Embodiments described herein may relate to a transaction card system, such as a credit card payment system using the MasterCard&#xae; interchange network. The MasterCard&#xae; interchange network is a set of proprietary communications standards promulgated by MasterCard International Incorporated&#xae; for the exchange of financial transaction data and the settlement of funds between financial institutions that are members of MasterCard International Incorporated&#xae;. (MasterCard is a registered trademark of MasterCard International Incorporated located in Purchase, N.Y.).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a typical transaction card system, a financial institution called the &#x201c;issuer&#x201d; issues a transaction card or electronic payments account identifier, such as a credit card, to a consumer or cardholder <b>122</b>, who uses the transaction card to tender payment for a purchase from a merchant <b>124</b>. To accept payment with the transaction card, merchant <b>124</b> must normally establish an account with a financial institution that is part of the financial payment system. This financial institution is usually called the &#x201c;merchant bank,&#x201d; the &#x201c;acquiring bank,&#x201d; or the &#x201c;acquirer.&#x201d; When cardholder <b>122</b> tenders payment for a purchase with a transaction card, merchant <b>124</b> requests authorization from a merchant bank <b>126</b> for the amount of the purchase. The request may be performed over the telephone, but is usually performed through the use of a point-of-sale terminal, which reads cardholder's <b>122</b> account information from a magnetic stripe, a chip, or embossed characters on the transaction card and communicates electronically with the transaction processing computers of merchant bank <b>126</b>. Alternatively, merchant bank <b>126</b> may authorize a third party to perform transaction processing on its behalf. In this case, the point-of-sale terminal will be configured to communicate with the third party. Such a third party is usually called a &#x201c;merchant processor,&#x201d; an &#x201c;acquiring processor,&#x201d; or a &#x201c;third party processor.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Using an interchange network <b>128</b>, computers of merchant bank <b>126</b> or merchant processor will communicate with computers of an issuer bank <b>130</b> to determine whether cardholder's <b>122</b> account <b>132</b> is in good standing and whether the purchase is covered by cardholder's <b>122</b> available credit line. Based on these determinations, the request for authorization will be declined or accepted. If the request is accepted, an authorization code is issued to merchant <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">When a request for authorization is accepted, the available credit line of cardholder's <b>122</b> account <b>132</b> is decreased. Normally, a charge for a payment card transaction is not posted immediately to cardholder's <b>122</b> account <b>132</b> because bankcard associations, such as MasterCard International Incorporated&#xae;, have promulgated rules that do not allow merchant <b>124</b> to charge, or &#x201c;capture,&#x201d; a transaction until goods are shipped or services are delivered. However, with respect to at least some debit card transactions, a charge may be posted at the time of the transaction. When merchant <b>124</b> ships or delivers the goods or services, merchant <b>124</b> captures the transaction by, for example, appropriate data entry procedures on the point-of-sale terminal. This may include bundling of approved transactions daily for standard retail purchases. If cardholder <b>122</b> cancels a transaction before it is captured, a &#x201c;void&#x201d; is generated. If cardholder <b>122</b> returns goods after the transaction has been captured, a &#x201c;credit&#x201d; is generated. Interchange network <b>128</b> and/or issuer bank <b>130</b> stores the transaction card information, such as a category of merchant, a merchant identifier, a location where the transaction was completed, amount of purchase, date and time of transaction, in a database <b>220</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">After a purchase has been made, a clearing process occurs to transfer additional transaction data related to the purchase among the parties to the transaction, such as merchant bank <b>126</b>, interchange network <b>128</b>, and issuer bank <b>130</b>. More specifically, during and/or after the clearing process, additional data, such as a time of purchase, a merchant name, a type of merchant, purchase information, cardholder account information, a type of transaction, itinerary information, information regarding the purchased item and/or service, and/or other suitable information, is associated with a transaction and transmitted between parties to the transaction as transaction data, and may be stored by any of the parties to the transaction. In the example embodiment, when cardholder <b>122</b> purchases travel, such as airfare, a hotel stay, and/or a rental car, at least partial itinerary information is transmitted during the clearance process as transaction data. When interchange network <b>128</b> receives the itinerary information, interchange network <b>128</b> routes the itinerary information to database <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">For debit card transactions, when a request for a personal identification number (PIN) authorization is approved by the issuer, cardholder's account <b>132</b> is decreased. Normally, a charge is posted immediately to cardholder's account <b>132</b>. The payment card association then transmits the approval to the acquiring processor for distribution of goods/services or information, or cash in the case of an automated teller machine (ATM).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">After a transaction is authorized and cleared, the transaction is settled among merchant <b>124</b>, merchant bank <b>126</b>, and issuer bank <b>130</b>. Settlement refers to the transfer of financial data or funds among merchant's <b>124</b> account, merchant bank <b>126</b>, and issuer bank <b>130</b> related to the transaction. Usually, transactions are captured and accumulated into a &#x201c;batch,&#x201d; which is settled as a group. More specifically, a transaction is typically settled between issuer bank <b>130</b> and interchange network <b>128</b>, and then between interchange network <b>128</b> and merchant bank <b>126</b>, and then between merchant bank <b>126</b> and merchant <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a simplified block diagram of an example system <b>200</b> used for enhancing payment transaction authentication using a merchant loyalty scheme.
