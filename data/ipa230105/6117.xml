an optoelectronic device and to a method for producing an optoelectronic device.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to produce optoelectronic devices, light-emitting diodes (abbreviated to LEDs) are often mounted on circuit boards and electrically conductively connected thereto.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments provide an optoelectronic device which can be produced in a simplified way.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An optoelectronic device having a carrier and a multiplicity of semiconductor chips is provided. The semiconductor chips are for example intended for generating radiation in the ultraviolet, visible or infrared spectral range. For example, the semiconductor chips comprise at least one active region intended for generating radiation. The semiconductor chips of an optoelectronic device may be of the same type in respect of the radiation emitted. The semiconductor chips thus differ in terms of their spectral emission characteristic only in the scope of production-related tolerances. As an alternative, different semiconductor chips may be arranged on the carrier, for example semiconductor chips which emit radiation in different spectral ranges, for instance in the red, green and blue spectral ranges.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic device, the semiconductor chips are fastened on the carrier by a connecting means. The connecting means is used, in particular, for mechanically stable fastening of the semiconductor chips on the carrier. For example, the connecting means contains an adhesive, for instance a polymer material such as a silicone or an epoxide.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In particular, the connecting means may be electrically insulating. The connecting means is thus not used for electrical contacting of the semiconductor chips.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, the connecting means may be transmissive for the radiation to be emitted during operation of the optoelectronic device. For example, the connecting means is arranged between the semiconductor chips and a radiation exit surface of the optoelectronic device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic device, the semiconductor chips have at least one contact pad on a main surface facing away from the carrier. In particular, the semiconductor chips may comprise all the contact pads required for the electrical contacting of the semiconductor chips on this main surface. The contact pads are used for example for electrical contacting of the semiconductor chip, so that by the application of an electrical voltage between two contact pads, charge carriers enter the active region from opposite sides and can recombine there by emitting radiation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic device, the contact pads are respectively contacted electrically by an interconnecting track. In particular, the interconnecting track adjoins the contact pads directly.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The interconnecting tracks are also used, in particular, for electrical connection of the semiconductor chips to one another. For example, at least some of the semiconductor chips are connected to one another in a series circuit or a parallel circuit or a combination of a series circuit and a parallel circuit. Furthermore, some of the semiconductor chips or all the semiconductor chips may also be in a matrix interconnection, for example in the form of an active matrix or a passive matrix.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In particular, the interconnecting track is guided over an edge of the main surface of the semiconductor chip onto the carrier. The interconnecting track is, for example, configured in the form of a coating of the carrier with the semiconductor chips arranged on the carrier. Bonding wires are thus not required for the electrical contacting of the contact pads, arranged on the main surface, of the semiconductor chips. In particular, there is no gaseous medium, for example air, between the semiconductor chips and the interconnecting track.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic device, the optoelectronic device comprises a carrier and a multiplicity of semiconductor chips, the semiconductor chips being fastened on the carrier by a connecting means and the semiconductor chips respectively having at least one contact pad on a main surface facing away from the carrier. The contact pads are respectively contacted electrically by an interconnecting track, the interconnecting track being guided over an edge of the main surface of the semiconductor chip onto the carrier.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">During the production of such an optoelectronic device, the semiconductor chips may be arranged on a carrier, in which case the carrier itself may still be entirely unstructured at this time. In particular, at this time the carrier does not yet require conductor tracks by which the semiconductor chips are electrically contacted. The electrical contacting of the semiconductor chips via the interconnecting tracks may thus take place at a time at which the semiconductor chips are already fastened on the carrier. By formation of the interconnecting tracks in the form of a coating, all the interconnecting tracks may be formed simultaneously so that all the semiconductor chips can be electrically contacted in one production step.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic device, the connecting means covers a side surface of the semiconductor chip at least regionally. In a plan view of the optoelectronic device, the connecting means has a larger lateral extent than the respective semiconductor chip which is fastened on the carrier by the connecting means. For example, the connecting means encloses the respective semiconductor chip along the entire circumference of the semiconductor chip.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The term &#x201c;lateral&#x201d; refers in this case to a direction which extends parallel to a main extent plane of the carrier. Correspondingly, a vertical direction refers to a direction extending perpendicularly to the main extent plane of the carrier.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic device, the connecting means has a viscosity of between 5 Pa*s inclusive and 30 Pa*s inclusive, for example between 10 Pa*s inclusive and 20 Pa*s inclusive. It has been found that a connecting means having a viscosity in this range can cover the side surfaces of the semiconductor chips particularly reliably.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic device, the connecting means has a thixotropic index of between 2 inclusive and 8 inclusive, in particular between 3 inclusive and 5 inclusive. The thixotropic index of a material is a measure of how much the viscosity of the material changes as a result of external mechanical influences, for instance by the effect of pressure and/or shear forces. For example, the thixotropic index may be determined by the ratio between a viscosity at a low rotational speed and a viscosity at a high rotational speed of a rotational viscosimeter, the high rotational speed typically being ten times as great as the low rotational speed. The more the viscosity decreases at high rotational speeds, the higher the thixotropic index is. It has been found that a connecting means having a thixotropic index in this range may be processed particularly reliably so that the side surfaces of the semiconductor chips are covered.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic device, the interconnecting track adjoins the connecting means directly. In particular, as seen in the lateral direction, the connecting means may be the only element which lies between the side surface of the semiconductor chip and the interconnecting track.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic device, the active region of the semiconductor chip, intended for generating radiation, is covered by the connecting means on the side surface. The connecting means may thus be used for electrical insulation of the active region from the interconnecting track. The semiconductor chip itself does not therefore need to have an insulation layer, for example a passivation layer, on the side surface. Such an insulation layer may, however, additionally be present.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic device, the side surface of the semiconductor chip, as seen from the carrier, is covered with the connecting means to at least 1%, at least 30% or at least 50% or at least 80% of a height of the semiconductor chip. Furthermore, the side surface may be covered to up to 100% of the height of the semiconductor chip, for instance between 1% inclusive and 100% inclusive.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The height refers in this case to the extent of the semiconductor chip in the vertical direction, that is to say perpendicularly to the main extent plane of the carrier. The further the connecting means extends away from the carrier in the direction of the edge of the main surface of the semiconductor chips, the smaller is the height difference which has to be overcome by the interconnecting track on the edge of the semiconductor chip. Reliable production of the interconnecting track is thereby simplified, and therefore so is the electrical contacting of the semiconductor chips.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic device, an angle between the side surface of the semiconductor chip and an outer surface of the connecting means is at least locally at least 10&#xb0; or at least 30&#xb0; or at least 45&#xb0;. The outer surface is in this case that surface of the connecting means which faces away from the side surface of the semiconductor chip. With a curved outer surface, this angle changes as a function of the distance from the side surface. In this case, the angle refers to a tangent at the respective location of the outer surface in a section plane which extends perpendicularly to the main extent plane of the carrier and perpendicularly to the side surface of the semiconductor chip. For example, the angle is at least 10&#xb0; or at least 30&#xb0; at each location of the outer surface.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The greater the angle between the side surface of the semiconductor chip and the outer surface of the connecting means is, the shallower is the edge to be bridged by the interconnecting track.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic device, the interconnecting track locally adjoins the side surface of the semiconductor chip directly. For example, the interconnecting track, as seen along the side surface of the semiconductor chip, adjoins the side surface of the semiconductor chip between the edge of the main surface of the semiconductor chip and the outer surface of the connecting means in the region of the side surface of the semiconductor chip.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic device, the carrier and the connecting means are transmissive for radiation to be generated by the semiconductor chips during operation. In particular, a side of the carrier facing away from the semiconductor chips may form the radiation exit surface of the optoelectronic device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In other words, the semiconductor chips are arranged on a mounting side of the carrier, and a rear side of the carrier, opposite the mounting side, forms the radiation exit surface of the optoelectronic device.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The radiation generated in the active regions of the semiconductor chips thus passes through the connecting means and the carrier before it emerges from the radiation exit surface of the optoelectronic device.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic device, the interconnecting track has a transverse extent of at most 30 &#x3bc;m or at most 20 &#x3bc;m in a plan view of the optoelectronic device.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The transverse extent of the interconnecting track refers in this case to the extent of the interconnecting track perpendicular to a main extent axis of the interconnecting track. The main extent axis of the interconnecting track may be straight or locally curved or bent.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Interconnecting tracks having a small transverse extent are suitable particularly in conjunction with a radiation-transmissive carrier. In particular, the interconnecting tracks may be so thin that they are not disturbing for the human eye when looking through the optoelectronic device, particularly in the off state.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As an alternative, the transverse extent of the interconnecting track may also be larger. For example, the transverse extent is at most as large as an edge length of the semiconductor chip.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic device, the interconnecting tracks locally adjoin the carrier, in particular the mounting side of the carrier, directly. In particular, the interconnecting tracks adjoin the carrier directly at the locations at which the carrier is free of the connecting means in a plan view of the optoelectronic device. For example, the interconnecting tracks locally adjoin the carrier directly between neighboring semiconductor chips.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to at least one embodiment of the optoelectronic device, the connecting means is formed in one piece and is the only element between the carrier and the interconnecting track laterally with respect to the semiconductor chip. It has been found that the connecting means intended for fastening the semiconductor chips may be configured in such a way that it can additionally fulfill further functions, in particular simplified guiding of the interconnecting tracks over the edge of the semiconductor chips and/or electrical insulation of the active regions from the respective interconnecting tracks. Additional elements, for example insulation layers, which are applied after fastening the semiconductor chips on the carrier, are not required.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In alternative embodiments of the optoelectronic device, such an insulation layer may however be provided in addition to the connecting means, the insulation layer extending at least locally between the carrier and the interconnecting track.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A method for producing an optoelectronic device is furthermore provided. The method is suitable in particular for the production of an optoelectronic device as described above. Features described in conjunction with the optoelectronic device may therefore also be used for the method, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to at least one embodiment of the method for producing an optoelectronic device, a carrier is provided and a multiplicity of semiconductor chips are arranged on the carrier, the semiconductor chips respectively having at least one interconnecting surface on a main surface facing away from the carrier. Interconnecting tracks are formed on the carrier with the semiconductor chips arranged on the carrier. The formation of the interconnecting tracks thus takes place only after the semiconductor chips have already been arranged on the carrier, and in particular fastened on the carrier.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to at least one embodiment of the method, positions of the semiconductor chips, in particular positions of the interconnecting surfaces of the semiconductor chips, on the carrier are registered after arrangement on the carrier and the interconnecting tracks are configured on the basis of the positions that have been determined. For each optoelectronic device to be produced, it is thus possible to determine the positions at which the semiconductor chips have precisely been placed and where the interconnecting surfaces to be contacted by the interconnecting tracks are actually located. Manufacturing tolerances due to the process of placing the semiconductor chips on the carrier may thus be taken into account when configuring the interconnecting tracks.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In this way, reliable contacting of the semiconductor chips may be carried out with particularly narrow interconnecting tracks. In contrast thereto, in devices in which, on the carrier, there are already electrically conductive surfaces for the mounting and contacting of the semiconductor chips before the mounting of the semiconductor chips, these electrically conductive surfaces must be configured to be so large that the semiconductor chips to be electrically contacted are electrically contacted even in the event of a lateral offset within the scope of production tolerances during the placement of the semiconductor chips.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">With the described method, on the other hand, the width of the interconnecting tracks in the lateral direction is entirely independent of the accuracy of the placement method by which the semiconductor chips are arranged on the carrier.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to at least one embodiment of the method, the positions are registered by means of automatic optical inspection. The optically registered actual position of the semiconductor chips may, for example, be stored in a memory and used for the subsequent configuration of the interconnecting tracks.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to at least one embodiment of the method, the carrier is a film or contains a glass. For example, the carrier is arranged on an auxiliary carrier at least during the arranging of the semiconductor chips on the carrier and/or during the forming of the interconnecting tracks on the carrier.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, the carrier, particularly in the form of a film, is laminated onto an auxiliary carrier and removed from the auxiliary carrier after the production. In this way, the advantages of a flexible carrier may be combined with the simplified processing on a rigid carrier.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to at least one embodiment of the method, the semiconductor chips are fastened on the carrier by a connecting means during the arranging on the carrier, and the connecting means covers the side surfaces of the semiconductor chips at least locally during the fastening of the semiconductor chips.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In particular, more material of the connecting means is deliberately used per semiconductor chip than would be required purely for fastening the semiconductor chip on the carrier. The material of the connecting means which extends laterally beyond the semiconductor chips can cover the side surfaces of the semiconductor chips. The degree of coverage of the side surfaces may, for example, be adjusted via the amount of the connecting means and/or the viscosity of the connecting means and/or the thixotropic index.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">With the optoelectronic device described and the method described, the following effects in particular may be achieved.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The semiconductor chips can be electrically contacted by means of the interconnecting tracks after they have already been arranged on the carrier, and in particular fastened thereon. The carrier may in this case be rigid or flexible and may be configured to be entirely unstructured, in particular free of metal contact tracks, at the time of equipping it with semiconductor chips.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The connecting means by which the semiconductor chips are fastened on the carrier may additionally fulfill further functions, for example the function of electrically insulating the active regions of the semiconductor chips from the assigned interconnecting tracks and/or forming a ramp on the side surfaces of the semiconductor chips, over which the guiding of the interconnecting tracks can take place. Additional insulation layers on the side surface of the semiconductor chip and/or on the carrier may be obviated. Such insulation layers may, however, additionally be present. Such fastening is suitable both for rigid and for flexible carriers.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The emission of the optoelectronic device may take place through the carrier. Furthermore, the optoelectronic device may have a high transmissivity overall in the off state, so that the optoelectronic device may for example also be fastened on a window or a windshield of a vehicle, without substantially impairing vision through the window or the windshield.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">During the production of the optoelectronic device, the positions of the semiconductor chips arranged on the carrier may be registered before the interconnecting tracks are formed. The lateral structure of the coating by which the interconnecting tracks are formed may be configured specifically for the respective device with knowledge of the actual position of the semiconductor chips, so that position deviations due to alignment tolerances of the placement process can be taken into account. In this way, particularly narrow interconnecting tracks may be achieved. For a sufficient current-carrying capacity, the cross section of the interconnecting tracks may be enlarged by increasing the thickness of the interconnecting tracks, without causing significantly increased shadowing when looking through the optoelectronic device.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The optoelectronic device is generally suitable for applications in which a plurality of semiconductor chips are required, for example in a matrix-like arrangement. In particular, the devices may also be configured for mounting on curved surfaces and/or on windows or windshields, for example in a vehicle, for instance a motor vehicle.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Furthermore, the devices may easily be adapted to specific requirements in terms of the design of light sources or display devices.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Further expediencies and refinements may be found from the following description of the exemplary embodiments in conjunction with the figures, in which:</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> show an exemplary embodiment of an optoelectronic device with the aid of a detail in a sectional view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) and in plan view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>);</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref> show an exemplary embodiment of a method for producing an optoelectronic device with the aid of intermediate steps which are respectively represented in a schematic sectional view;</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> show an exemplary embodiment of a method for producing an optoelectronic device with the aid of intermediate steps in a schematic side view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) and in a schematic plan view (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>); and</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a measurement of a line profile of a semiconductor chip fastened by a connecting means.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Elements which are the same or of the same type, or which have the same effect, are provided with the same references in the figures.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The figures are respectively schematic representations and are therefore not necessarily true to scale.

The optoelectronic device <b>1</b> may comprise a multiplicity of such semiconductor chips <b>2</b>, for example at least <b>5</b> or at least <b>10</b> or at least <b>100</b>, on a carrier <b>3</b>. For example, at least some of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> are electrically connected in series with one another and/or electrically connected in parallel with one another. Furthermore, the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> or groups of semiconductor chips may be controllable individually, for example by means of a matrix interconnection, for instance an active matrix interconnection or a passive matrix interconnection.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The semiconductor chip <b>2</b> is fastened on the carrier <b>3</b> by means of a connecting means <b>4</b>. The carrier <b>3</b> comprises a mounting side <b>31</b> facing toward the semiconductor chips and a rear side <b>32</b> opposite the mounting side. In the exemplary embodiment shown, the rear side of the carrier <b>3</b> forms a radiation exit surface <b>10</b> of the optoelectronic device <b>1</b>. On a main surface <b>21</b> facing away from the carrier <b>3</b>, the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> comprises contact pads <b>25</b> for electrical contacting of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b>. The side of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> facing toward the carrier <b>3</b> is free of contacts for the electrical contacting of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">During operation of the optoelectronic device <b>1</b>, charge carriers can be injected into the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> through the contact pads <b>25</b> and recombine in an active region <b>20</b> of the semiconductor chip, for example a pn junction, by emitting radiation.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Suitable for the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> are, for example, LEDs in a so-called flip-chip geometry, in which none or at least only a small fraction of the radiation generated during operation emerges from the main surface on which the contact pads are located.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The contact pads <b>25</b> are respectively contacted electrically via an interconnecting track <b>5</b>. The contact track <b>5</b> is guided over an edge <b>210</b> of the main surface <b>21</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b>. In a plan view of the mounting side <b>31</b> of the carrier <b>3</b>, an interconnecting track <b>5</b> overlaps a contact pad <b>25</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> at least regionally.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The connecting means <b>4</b> regionally covers a side surface <b>22</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b>. In particular, the connecting means <b>4</b> covers the side surface <b>22</b> to the height of the active region <b>20</b>. The connecting means <b>4</b> electrically insulates the active region <b>20</b> from the interconnecting track <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The main surface <b>21</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> is free of material of the connecting means <b>4</b>. In a plan view of the optoelectronic device <b>1</b>, the connecting means <b>4</b> protrudes beyond the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> in the lateral direction, in particular along the entire circumference of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b>. The interconnecting track <b>5</b> adjoins the connecting means <b>4</b> directly. The interconnecting track <b>5</b> directly adjoins the mounting side <b>31</b> of the carrier <b>3</b> laterally with respect to the semiconductor chips <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The interconnecting track <b>5</b> adjoins the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> in a region of the side surface <b>22</b> which is not covered by the connecting means <b>4</b>. In particular, the connecting means <b>4</b> is the only element which is arranged between the side surface <b>22</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> and the interconnecting track <b>5</b> as seen in the lateral direction. A protective layer <b>6</b> may optionally be formed on the side of the carrier <b>3</b> facing away from the rear side <b>32</b>. For example, the protective layer <b>6</b> is laminated onto the carrier <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the exemplary embodiment shown, the carrier <b>3</b> is expediently radiation-transmissive. For example, the carrier <b>3</b> contains a plastic material, for example polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), an imide, for instance polyimide (PI), or polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), or a glass.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Such materials are also suitable in particular for a carrier <b>3</b> which is configured to be flexible in the form of a film. As an alternative, a rigid carrier <b>3</b> may also be used, and the carrier may for example contain a glass.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">A transverse extent of the interconnecting tracks <b>5</b> may be configured particularly finely. For example, the transverse extent is at most 30 &#x3bc;m or at most 20 &#x3bc;m. In conjunction with a radiation-transmissive carrier <b>3</b>, an optoelectronic device <b>1</b> which is substantially transparent laterally with respect to the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> may thus be produced. In particular, the interconnecting tracks <b>5</b> may be configured to be so thin that they are not disturbing for a human observer when looking through the optoelectronic device.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">There are thus no radiation-opaque layers, for example metal layers for the electrical contacting of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b>, between the active region <b>20</b> and the carrier <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a measurement of a line profile of a height h of a semiconductor chip <b>2</b>, which is fastened as described above on a carrier <b>3</b> by means of a connecting means <b>4</b>. This measurement confirms that a large part of the side surfaces of the semiconductor chip can be covered by the connecting means <b>4</b>. Furthermore, large angles may be produced between the side surface of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> and the outer surface of the connecting means <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The configuring of the interconnecting tracks <b>5</b> in the form of a coating is simplified by means of the connecting means <b>4</b> covering the side surfaces <b>22</b>. The further the connecting means <b>4</b> extends in the vertical direction along the side surface <b>22</b> in the direction of the edge <b>210</b> of the main surface <b>21</b>, the smaller is the height difference which has to be bridged by the interconnecting track <b>5</b> on the edge <b>210</b>. Furthermore, an outer surface <b>41</b> of the connecting means <b>4</b> may assume a relatively large angle <b>410</b>, for example at least 30&#xb0; or at least 45&#xb0;, with respect to the side surface <b>22</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b>. The reliability of the interconnecting track <b>5</b> over the edge <b>210</b> is thereby further increased.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">For example, an epoxide or a silicone is suitable as a radiation-transmissive connecting means. It is preferably an epoxide or silicone having a viscosity of between 10 and 20 Pa*s and a thixotropic index of between 3 and 5.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In a departure from the exemplary embodiment described, however, the described configuration of the connecting means <b>4</b> is also suitable for other forms of the optoelectronic device <b>1</b>. For example, the emission of the optoelectronic device <b>1</b> may also take place from the side on which the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> are located on the carrier <b>3</b>, that is to say on the mounting side. In this case, the carrier <b>3</b> may also be radiation-opaque, for example reflective for the radiation to be generated. Furthermore, the connecting means <b>4</b> may also be radiation-opaque, for example reflective.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Furthermore, a rigid carrier may also be used. Furthermore, it is also conceivable for the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> to have only one contact pad <b>25</b> on the main surface <b>21</b>, and for a further contact pad to be arranged on the opposite side of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b> from the main surface. In this case, therefore also only one contact pad per semiconductor chip can be electrically contacted by means of an interconnecting track in the form of a coating.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">An exemplary embodiment of a method for producing an optoelectronic device is shown with the aid of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>C</figref>, a device which is configured as described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> being produced by way of example.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">A carrier <b>3</b> is provided (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). In the case of a flexible carrier <b>3</b>, it is preferably arranged on an auxiliary carrier <b>7</b>. For example, the carrier <b>3</b> is adhesively bonded onto the auxiliary carrier <b>7</b>, for instance by lamination with the use of a dry resist.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Processing on the flexible carrier <b>3</b> may thus take place in a similar way to the processing on a rigid carrier.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Semiconductor chips <b>2</b> are applied onto the carrier <b>3</b> by means of a connecting means <b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). During the placement of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> on the carrier <b>3</b>, material of the connecting means <b>4</b> is displaced laterally and locally covers the side surfaces <b>22</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b>. The degree of coverage of the side surfaces <b>22</b> may be adjusted via the amount of the connecting means in combination with the viscosity of the connecting means and its thixotropic indices. For example, the connecting means is based on a polymer material, for instance an epoxide or a silicone.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">As seen in the vertical direction, the connecting means <b>4</b> is the only element between the mounting side <b>31</b> of the carrier <b>3</b> and the semiconductor chip <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The main surface <b>21</b> of the semiconductor chip <b>2</b>, in particular the contact pads <b>25</b>, remains free of the connecting means <b>4</b>.

The carrier <b>3</b> may also be processed to form optoelectronic devices in the form of a roll-to-roll method.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> show intermediate steps of a further exemplary embodiment of a method for producing an optoelectronic device. This method corresponds substantially to the exemplary embodiment described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In particular, the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> may be fastened as described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> on a carrier <b>3</b>. In principle, however, it is also conceivable for the connecting means <b>4</b> not to cover, or not to cover substantially, the side surfaces <b>22</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> and instead, for example, for an insulation layer to be applied after the semiconductor chips have been fastened on the carrier <b>3</b>, this insulation layer locally covering the side surfaces <b>22</b> of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">After the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> have been fastened, the precise positions of the semiconductor chips <b>2</b> are registered, for example optically by means of an image acquisition unit <b>8</b>.
