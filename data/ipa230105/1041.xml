Of this medical suture thread, an outer surface is coated with various resin materials for the purpose of improving operability in suturing and slidability or slide-down performance (the easiness of moving a knot upon thread tying) on a sutured portion. For example, Patent Literature 1 below discloses that a suture thread is coated with 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;MPC&#x201d;). This can enhance easiness and retainability when a surgeon ties the suture thread.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">PATENT LITERATURE 1: JP-A-2010-513678</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, there has been a problem that the suture thread described in Patent Literature 1 above is likely to remain curled after the suture thread housed in a packaging container with wound in a circular ring shape is taken out of the packaging container. In addition, there has also been a problem that it is difficult to uncurl the suture thread from a curled state.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention has been made to cope with the above-described problems. An object of the present invention is to provide a medical suture thread which is less likely to remain curled or is easily uncurled from a curled state.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to achieve the above object, as a feature of the present invention, there is provided a medical suture thread including a single thread having one or a plurality of fibrous ultrafine threads. A cover layer made of 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) is formed on an outer surface of each ultrafine thread, and the cover layer is formed to have a weight of equal to or greater than 0.05% and less than 0.3% with respect to a total weight of a filament forming each ultrafine thread, the cover layer being formed on the filament.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the feature of the present invention configured as described above, in the medical suture thread, the cover layer made of 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) is formed with a weight of equal to or greater than 0.05% and less than 0.3% with respect to the total weight of the filament forming the ultrafine thread. With this configuration, according to experiment conducted by the present inventor, operability in suturing and slidability or slide-down performance on a sutured portion are improved. In addition, it has been confirmed that the medical suture thread housed in a circular ring shape in a packaging container is less likely to remain curled or is easily uncurled from a curled state.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, as another feature of the present invention, in the medical suture thread, the cover layer is formed to have a weight of equal to or greater than 0.1% and less than 0.3% with respect to a total weight of a filament forming each ultrafine thread, the cover layer being formed on the filament.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another feature of the present invention configured as described above, in the medical suture thread, the cover layer is formed with a weight of equal to or greater than 0.1% and less than 0.3% with respect to the total weight of the filament forming the ultrafine thread. Thus, the medical suture thread can be easily formed as compared to the case of forming the cover layer with a weight of less than 0.1% with respect to the total weight of the filament.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, as another feature of the present invention, in the medical suture thread, the cover layer is formed such that part of an outer surface of the filament is exposed.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another feature of the present invention configured as described above, in the medical suture thread, the cover layer is formed such that part of the outer surface of the filament is exposed. Thus, the cover layer is not necessarily formed across the entirety of the outer surface of the filament. Consequently, the amount of MPC to be used and a burden in the process of forming the cover layer can be reduced. Accordingly, the cover layer can be efficiently formed.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Moreover, as another feature of the present invention, in the medical suture thread, the cover layer is formed to cover 50% or more of a surface area of the filament with a uniform formation density in each of an axial direction and a peripheral direction of the filament.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another feature of the present invention configured as described above, in the medical suture thread, the cover layer is formed to cover 50% or more of the surface area of the filament with the uniform formation density in each of an axial direction and a peripheral direction of the filament. Thus, the cover layer made of MPC can maintain various characteristics such as the operability, the slidability, and the slide-down performance while the amount of MPC to be used and the burden in the process of forming the cover layer can be reduced. Consequently, the cover layer can be efficiently formed.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exploded side view schematically showing the outline of an external configuration and an internal configuration of a medical suture thread according to one embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded side view schematically showing the outline of an external configuration and an internal configuration of an ultrafine thread forming each of a core thread and an outer thread in the medical suture thread shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a partially-enlarged side view showing the state of a cover layer partially formed on an outer surface of an ultrafine thread forming a medical suture thread according to a variation of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Hereinafter, one embodiment of a medical suture thread according to the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an exploded side view schematically showing the outline of an external configuration and an internal configuration of a medical suture thread <b>100</b> according to the present invention.

In the present embodiment, the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> is, as in the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b>, formed on the outer surface of the filament <b>121</b><i>a </i>with a weight of 0.1% with respect to the total weight of the filament <b>121</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">That is, the ultrafine thread <b>121</b> has the exact same configuration as that of the ultrafine thread <b>111</b> in the present embodiment. Note that the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> with a configuration different from that of the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> may be formed. Alternatively, the ultrafine thread <b>121</b> may be formed without the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b>. Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows one extracted ultrafine thread <b>111</b> and one extracted ultrafine thread <b>121</b> for the sake of easy understanding of the internal structure of the medical suture thread <b>100</b>.

A worker manufacturing the medical suture thread <b>100</b> first prepares the ultrafine thread <b>111</b> formed with no inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the ultrafine thread <b>121</b> formed with no outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b>. Specifically, the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>are prepared as bases of the ultrafine threads <b>111</b>, <b>121</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In this case, the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>are manufactured by the typical technique of manufacturing a suture thread. Thus, the worker may manufacture the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>as the bases of the ultrafine threads <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> by the worker oneself. Alternatively, a commercially-available filament may be purchased and obtained. In the present embodiment, the worker prepares the polyester filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>with a size of No. 11-0 (about 20 &#x3bc;m) (the standard for a suture thread according to the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Next, the worker forms the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> on the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a</i>. Specifically, the worker dips the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>in a solution (e.g., an ethanol solution) containing MPC. In this manner, the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> can be formed on the surfaces of the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In this case, the worker can dip the filament in the solution containing MPC in a state in which the multiple filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>are gathered and bundled, a roll state in which each of the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>is wound in an annular shape, or a state in which each of the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>wound in a roll shape is drawn in a linear shape. The concentration of the solution containing MPC and the time of dipping the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>are respectively determined as necessary according to the thicknesses of the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> to be formed.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Then, the worker performs drying treatment and sterilization treatment for the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>taken out of the solution containing MPC. In this manner, the worker can obtain the ultrafine threads <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> formed with the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> on the outer surfaces of the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a</i>, respectively. Note that the worker provides vibration to the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>or sets a drying temperature to a high temperature upon drying of the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a</i>, and in this manner, can form the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> on the surfaces of the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a </i>in a patchy manner.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, the worker forms the core thread <b>110</b>. Specifically, the worker twists two bundles of multiple gathered ultrafine threads <b>111</b> by means of a not-shown twisting machine. In this manner, the single core thread <b>110</b> is formed. In the present embodiment, the worker can form the core thread <b>110</b> with a thickness of about 0.27 mm.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Next, the worker forms the outer thread <b>120</b>. Specifically, the worker braids the outer thread <b>120</b>, which is formed of five bundles of multiple gathered ultrafine threads <b>121</b>, on the outside of the core thread <b>110</b> by means of a not-shown braiding machine. In this manner, a single thread is formed. That is, by the step of forming the outer thread <b>120</b>, the medical suture thread <b>100</b> including the core thread <b>110</b> completely covered with the outer thread <b>120</b> is formed. The medical suture thread <b>100</b> is formed with an outer diameter of about 0.6 mm in the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, the worker can complete the medical suture thread <b>100</b> through the steps of sterilizing, checking, and packing the medical suture thread <b>100</b>. In this case, the medical suture thread <b>100</b> is housed in a packaging container (not shown) in a state in which the medical suture thread <b>100</b> is wound in a circular ring shape. Alternatively, the medical suture thread <b>100</b> may be packed with a medical tool such as a suture needle being coupled to a tip end portion of the medical suture thread <b>100</b>. Note that the worker can form the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> on a medical suture thread <b>100</b> formed with no inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and no outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Specifically, the worker processes the filaments <b>111</b><i>a </i>by means of the not-shown twisting machine. After formation of the core thread <b>110</b>, the ultrafine threads <b>121</b> are braided using the not-shown braiding machine and the filaments <b>121</b><i>a</i>. In this manner, the medical suture thread <b>100</b> (i.e., a half-finished product of the medical suture thread <b>100</b>) is formed at an outer peripheral portion of the core thread <b>110</b>. Next, the worker dips the half-finished product of the medical suture thread <b>100</b> in the solution containing MPC. In this case, the worker causes a sufficient solution to penetrate the medical suture thread <b>100</b> to each ultrafine thread <b>111</b> (each filament <b>111</b><i>a</i>) forming the core thread <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this case, the worker can intermittently change tension to be applied to the half-finished product of the medical suture thread <b>100</b> in the solution containing MPC. In this manner, a sufficient solution can penetrate the medical suture thread <b>100</b> to each ultrafine thread <b>111</b> (each filament <b>111</b><i>a</i>) forming the core thread <b>110</b>. In this manner, the worker forms the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> on the outer surfaces of the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a</i>, respectively. Accordingly, the worker can obtain the medical suture thread <b>100</b> formed of the ultrafine threads <b>111</b>, <b>121</b> including these filaments and cover layers.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">(Operation of Medical Suture Thread <b>100</b>)</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, operation of the medical suture thread <b>100</b> configured as described above will be described. A user such as a doctor couples a medical tool (not shown) such as a suture needle to the medical suture thread <b>100</b> unpacked from the package. Then, the user takes medical action such as a surgery or injury treatment. In this case, in the medical suture thread <b>100</b>, the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> formed on the ultrafine thread <b>111</b> is formed with a weight of 0.1% with respect to the total weight of the filament <b>111</b><i>a</i>. Moreover, the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> formed on the ultrafine thread <b>121</b> is formed with a weight of 0.1% with respect to the total weight of the filament <b>121</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the medical suture thread <b>100</b> is less likely to remain curled. In addition, even in a case where the medical suture thread <b>100</b> remains curled, the medical suture thread <b>100</b> is uncurled from a curled state within a short period of time, and extends straight. In this case, in a state in which the medical suture thread <b>100</b> is wound in the circular ring shape, adjacent turns of the medical suture thread <b>100</b> are less likely to adhere to each other. Thus, the user can easily extend the medical suture thread <b>100</b> straight.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Moreover, the user takes medical action such as removal of the medical suture thread <b>100</b> sutured to an affected area of a patient. In this case, in the medical suture thread <b>100</b>, not only the outer thread <b>120</b> but also the core thread <b>110</b> inside the outer thread <b>120</b> are arranged, and the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> made of MPC is formed as an outer layer of each ultrafine thread <b>111</b> forming the core thread <b>110</b>. Thus, friction among the ultrafine threads <b>111</b> is reduced. Consequently, the medical suture thread <b>100</b> is easily bendable. As a result, the user can easily operate the medical suture thread <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As can be understood from description of operation above, according to the above-described embodiment, in the medical suture thread <b>100</b>, a cover layer including the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> made of MPC is formed with a weight of equal to or greater than 0.05% and less than 0.3% with respect to the total weight of the filament <b>111</b><i>a </i>forming the ultrafine thread <b>111</b>. Moreover, a cover layer including the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> made of MPC is formed with a weight of equal to or greater than 0.05% and less than 0.3% with respect to the total weight of the filament <b>121</b><i>a </i>forming the ultrafine thread <b>121</b>. With this configuration, the medical suture thread <b>100</b> housed in the circular ring shape in the packaging container is less likely to remain curled, or can be easily uncurled from the curled state.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, the embodiment of the present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment. Various changes can be made to the above-described embodiment without departing from the object of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, in the above-described embodiment, the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> are formed with a weight of 0.1% with respect to the total weight of each of the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a</i>, respectively. That is, the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> are equivalent to the cover layer according to the present invention. However, according to experiment conducted by the present inventor, it may only be required that the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> are formed within a weight range of equal to or greater than 0.05% and less than 0.3% with respect to the total weight of each of the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a</i>, respectively.

With this configuration, the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> can easily form the cover layer as compared to the case of forming such a layer with a weight of less than 0.1% with respect to the total weight of each of the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the above-described embodiment, the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> are formed as a coating completely covering the outer surfaces of the filaments <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>a</i>, respectively.

Thus, the amount of MPC to be used and a burden in the process of forming the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> can be reduced. Accordingly, the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> and the outer-filament cover layer <b>122</b> can be efficiently formed.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the above-described embodiment, in the medical suture thread <b>100</b>, the inner-filament cover layer <b>112</b> is formed on the ultrafine thread <b>111</b> forming the core thread <b>110</b>.
