Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is a multiprotein complex that is involved with the initiation phase of eukaryotic protein translation. Generally, in humans eIF2 comprises three non-identical subunits (e.g., eIF2&#x3b1;, eIF2&#x3b2;, and eIF2&#x3b3;). Typically, eIF2&#x3b1; is involved in initiation of translation, forming a ternary complex with guanosine-triphosphate (GTP) and the initiator methionyl initiator transfer RNA.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">RAN Protein Translation</heading><p id="p-0062" num="0050">Aspects of the application relate to methods and compositions for reducing the expression of repeat-associated non-ATG (RAN) proteins. A &#x201c;RAN protein (repeat-associated non-ATG translated protein)&#x201d; is a polypeptide translated from bidirectionally transcribed sense or antisense RNA sequences carrying a nucleotide expansion in the absence of an AUG initiation codon. Generally, RAN proteins comprise expansion repeats of a single amino acid, di-amino acid, tri-amino acid, or quad-amino acid (e.g., tetra-amino acid), termed poly amino acid repeats. For example, &#x201c;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&#x201d; (poly-Alanine) (SEQ ID NO: 3), &#x201c;LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL&#x201d; (poly-Leucine) (SEQ ID NO: 4), &#x201c;SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS&#x201d; (poly-Serine) (SEQ ID NO: 5), or &#x201c;CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC&#x201d; (poly-Cysteine) (SEQ ID NO: 6) are poly amino acid repeats that are each 20 amino acid residues in length. Examples of di-amino acid RAN proteins include GPGPGPGPGPGPGPGPGPGP (poly-GP) (SEQ ID NO: 7), GAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGAGA (poly-GA) (SEQ ID NO: 8), GRGRGRGRGRGRGRGRGRGR (poly-GR) (SEQ ID NO: 9), PAPAPAPAPAPAPAPAPAPA (poly-PA) (SEQ ID NO: 10), and PRPRPRPRPRPRPRPRPRPR (poly-PR) (SEQ ID NO: 11). Examples of tetra-amino acid repeats include LPACLPACLPAC (e.g., poly-LPAC) (SEQ ID NO: 12) and QAGRQAGRQAGR (e.g., poly-QAGR) (SEQ ID NO: 13). RAN proteins can have a poly amino acid repeat of at least 25, at least 30, at least 40, at least 50, at least 60, at least 70, at least 80, at least 90, at least 100, or at least 200 amino acid residues in length. In some embodiments, a RAN protein has a poly amino acid repeat more than 200 amino acid residues in length.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0051">Generally, RAN proteins are translated from abnormal repeat expansions (e.g., CAG repeats) of DNA. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, RAN protein accumulation (e.g., in the nucleus or cytoplasm of a cell) disrupts cellular function and induces cellular toxicity. In some embodiments, translation and accumulation of RAN proteins is associated with a disease or disorder, for example a neurodegenerative disease or disorder. Examples of disorders and diseases associated with RAN protein translation and accumulation include but are not limited to spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 (SCAB), myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), and C9ORF72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD). Accordingly, methods and compositions described in this application are useful, in some embodiments, for treating one or more RAN protein associated diseases or conditions in a subject in need thereof.

The identification and selection of appropriate additional therapeutic agents is within the capabilities of a person of ordinary skill in the art, and will depend upon the disease from which the subject is suffering. For example, in some embodiments one or more therapeutic agents for Huntington's disease (e.g., tetrabenazine, amantadine, chlorpromazine, etc.), Fragile X Syndrome (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, carbamazepine, methylphenidate, Trazodone, etc.), Spinocerebellar Ataxia(e.g., baclofen, riluzole, amantadine, varenicline, etc.), or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (e.g., riluzole, etc.), myotonic dystrophy type 1 (tideglusib, mexiletine, etc.) are administered to the subject.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0127">In some embodiments, an additional therapeutic agent is an antibody that binds specifically to a RAN repeat expansion or antibody that binds specifically to a unique region of a RAN protein that is C-terminal to the repeat expansion. For example, in some embodiments, the antibody binds specifically to a poly-Ser RAN repeat expansion. In some embodiments, the antibody binds to a C-terminal region of a protein comprising a poly-Ser RAN repeat expansion. In some embodiments, an anti-RAN antibody binds to an intracellular RAN protein. In some embodiments, an anti-RAN antibody binds to an extracellular RAN protein.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0128">An anti-RAN antibody can be a polyclonal antibody or a monoclonal antibody. Typically, polyclonal antibodies are produced by inoculation of a suitable mammal, such as a mouse, rabbit or goat. Larger mammals are often preferred as the amount of serum that can be collected is greater. Typically, an antigen (e.g., an antigen comprising a poly-Ser repeat region) is injected into the mammal. This induces the B-lymphocytes to produce IgG immunoglobulins specific for the antigen. This polyclonal IgG is purified from the mammal's serum. Monoclonal antibodies are generally produced by a single cell line (e.g., a hybridoma cell line). In some embodiments, an anti-RAN antibody is purified (e.g., isolated from serum).</p><p id="p-0151" num="0129">Numerous methods may be used for obtaining anti-RAN antibodies. For example, antibodies can be produced using recombinant DNA methods. Monoclonal antibodies may also be produced by generation of hybridomas (see e.g., Kohler and Milstein (1975) Nature, 256: 495-499) in accordance with known methods. Hybridomas formed in this manner are then screened using standard methods, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (e.g., OCTET or BIACORE) analysis, to identify one or more hybridomas that produce an antibody that specifically binds with a specified antigen. Any form of the specified antigen (e.g., a RAN protein) may be used as the immunogen, e.g., recombinant antigen, naturally occurring forms, any variants or fragments thereof. One exemplary method of making antibodies includes screening protein expression libraries that express antibodies or fragments thereof (e.g., scFv), e.g., phage or ribosome display libraries. Phage display is described, for example, in Ladner et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,409; Smith (1985) Science 228:1315-1317; Clackson et al. (1991) Nature, 352: 624-628; Marks et al. (1991) J. Mol.

In some embodiments, these mutant dsRNAs lead to a chronic over activation of the PKR pathway. In some embodiments, chronic activation of the PKR pathway leads to eIF2&#x3b1; phosphorylation, the use of the alternative initiation factor eIF2A, and increased RAN translation.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0153">As described in the Examples above, it was observed that RAN translation is upregulated by PKR overexpression and substantially reduced by overexpression of a dominant negative form of PKR which blocks eIF2&#x3b1;-P from the PKR pathway.

In some embodiments, this alternative eukaryotic initiation factor (e.g., eIF2A) can be used under stress conditions when eIF2&#x3b1; phosphorylation prevents canonical translation initiation with eIF2&#x3b1;. In some embodiments, because eIF2A does not require an AUG initiation codon, it allows translation initiation at multiple types of non-AUG start codons which is a feature of RAN translation.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0154">In summary, stress pathways have been identified as critical drivers of RAN translation, and as druggable targets that can be used to modulate RAN translation in disease, including but not limited to C9orf72 ALS/FTD (G4C2 and G2C4 repeats), myotonic dystrophy type 1, Huntington's disease and multiple forms of spinocerebellar ataxia (CAG and CTG repeats), and myotonic dystrophy type 2 (CCTG and CAGG repeats).

Thus, as a non-limiting example, &#x201c;at least one of A and B&#x201d; (or, equivalently, &#x201c;at least one of A or B,&#x201d; or, equivalently &#x201c;at least one of A and/or B&#x201d;) can refer, in one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0188">It should also be understood that, unless clearly indicated to the contrary, in any methods claimed herein that include more than one step or act, the order of the steps or acts of the method is not necessarily limited to the order in which the steps or acts of the method are recited.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0189">In the claims, as well as in the specification above, all transitional phrases such as &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;carrying,&#x201d; &#x201c;having,&#x201d; &#x201c;containing,&#x201d; &#x201c;involving,&#x201d; &#x201c;holding,&#x201d; &#x201c;composed of,&#x201d; and the like are to be understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean including but not limited to. Only the transitional phrases &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; and &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; shall be closed or semi-closed transitional phrases, respectively, as set forth in the United States Patent Office Manual of Patent Examining Procedures, Section 2111.03. It should be appreciated that embodiments described in this document using an open-ended transitional phrase (e.g., &#x201c;comprising&#x201d;) are also contemplated, in alternative embodiments, as &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; and &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; the feature described by the open-ended transitional phrase. For example, if the disclosure describes &#x201c;a composition comprising A and B&#x201d;, the disclosure also contemplates the alternative embodiments &#x201c;a composition consisting of A and B&#x201d; and &#x201c;a composition consisting essentially of A and B&#x201d;.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-sequence-list-doc id="SEQLST-1"><sequence-list file="US20230002753A1-20230105-S00001.XML" carriers="internal-electronic" seq-file-type="ST.25"/></us-sequence-list-doc><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00004" cdx-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00004.CDX" mol-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00004.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00005" cdx-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00005.CDX" mol-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00005.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00006" cdx-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00006.CDX" mol-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00006.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00007" cdx-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00007.CDX" mol-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00007.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00008" cdx-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00008.CDX" mol-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00008.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00009" cdx-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00009.CDX" mol-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00009.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00010" cdx-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00010.CDX" mol-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00010.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00011" cdx-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00011.CDX" mol-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00011.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00012" cdx-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00012.CDX" mol-file="US20230002753A1-20230105-C00012.MOL"/><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-61" num="01-61"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>61</b>.
