The individual signal components in the frequency bands are then &#x201c;synthesized&#x201d; into a single output signal in the time domain.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The decomposition into individual frequency bands (in combination with the final synthesis) gives rise to a latency in the signal processing, which depends on the desired frequency resolution in the frequency domain and usually has a value of about 5-8 ms.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In real-time applications such as hearing instruments, in particular in hearing aids, such a latency often results in the direct sound from the surroundings being superimposed on the output signal delayed by the latency, which is reproduced by the hearing instrument. That can result in comb filter effects. Those are usually more pronounced the more closely the direct sound from the environment resembles the output signal processed and reproduced by the hearing instrument.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Comb filter effects are often perceived as unpleasant, so they are preferably to be avoided. One way to achieve that is to significantly reduce the latency in the signal processing or to prevent it as far as possible. However, that considerably limits the options available in the frequency-resolved signal processing, since it often requires a secondary signal path (&#x201c;analysis path&#x201d;) to be used in which the signal processing is to be determined as it is to be applied to the signal processing of the signal components of the main signal path. In particular, a direction-dependent signal processing of the individual input signals generated by more than one microphone of the microphone array is difficult to carry out in the above scenario.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is accordingly an object of the invention to provide a hearing instrument and a method for directional signal processing of signals of a microphone array, which overcome the hereinafore-mentioned disadvantages of the heretofore-known instruments and methods of this general type and which should have the lowest possible latency of a generated output signal compared to the input signals of the microphone array to be processed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">With the foregoing and other objects in view there is provided, in accordance with the invention, a method for directional signal processing of signals in a microphone array which includes at least one first microphone for generating a first input signal from an ambient sound and a second microphone for generating a second input signal from the ambient sound, the first input signal is used to form a reference signal, the reference signal is transformed into the frequency domain, thereby generating a frequency-space reference signal, the first input signal and the second input signal are each transformed into the frequency domain and a first frequency-space directional signal is formed in the frequency domain using the transformed first input signal and the transformed second input signal.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is also provided that, by using a frequency-resolved comparison of the frequency-space reference signal with the first frequency-space directional signal or with a signal derived from the first frequency-space directional signal in the frequency domain, frequency-dependent first gain factors are generated, the first gain factors are used to generate a time filter in the time domain, the reference signal is filtered by using the time filter, and an output signal is generated from the reference signal filtered by using the time filter.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Advantageous embodiments, which are inventive in themselves, are the subject matter of the dependent claims and the following description.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In this case and in the following, a microphone shall include any electroacoustic input transducer which is configured to generate a corresponding input signal from the ambient sound, wherein sound pressure fluctuations of the ambient sound are converted by the input transducer into corresponding voltage or current fluctuations. A microphone array is to be understood accordingly as any spatial arrangement of at least two such input transducers, wherein the spatial distance between the input transducers allows direction-dependent signal processing.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The formation of the reference signal on the basis of the first input signal includes in particular the two cases in which, on one hand, the reference signal is formed only from the signal components of the first input signal but other signal components, in particular those of the second input signal, are not included in the reference signal, or that, on the other hand, the reference signal can be formed on the basis of the signal components of both input signals, in particular by using a time-delayed superposition of the two input signals. The reference signal in this case is a signal in the time domain.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The above-mentioned transformations of a signal into the frequency domain, i.e. in the present case, of the reference signal as well as the first and second input signals, can be carried out in particular by using an appropriately configured filter bank. In the following, the frequency domain shall also include in particular the time-discrete time-frequency domain, in which the spectral components of the individual transformed signals are updated according to a time variable.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first frequency-space directional signal can be generated from the transformed first input signal and the transformed second input signal, in particular in such a way that the resulting directivity for the first frequency-space directional signal varies across the individual frequency bands (and that, for example, a linear combination of the two transformed input signals or a linear combination of intermediate signals derived from both input signals, such as cardioid/anticardioid signals, has different linear factors across the frequency bands).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The frequency-space reference signal is compared in a frequency-resolved manner, i.e. preferably frequency-band by frequency-band, with the first frequency-space reference signal or a signal derived from it in the frequency domain, so that the frequency-dependent first gain factors are generated as a quantitative result of this comparison. This comparison can be performed by spectral division (the first gain factors can then be determined directly in individual frequency bands as the respective quotients, which are formed during the division of the frequency-space reference signal by the first frequency-space directional signal). Other comparisons, for example in the form of a relative deviation and/or in the form of a non-linear, preferably monotonic function of the frequency band-dependent deviation of the two mentioned signals from each other, can also be envisaged. For a comparison of the frequency-space reference signal with a signal derived from the first frequency-space directional signal in the frequency domain, a second frequency-space directional signal is preferably used, the signal components of which can be derived directly from the first frequency-space directional signal and preferably without adding further signal components, e.g. though a frequency band-dependent amplification of the first frequency-space directional signal.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The first gain factors, which represent a measure of the deviation of the first frequency-space signal from the frequency-space reference signal in the respective frequency band (implicitly if necessary in the case of a derived signal) are then used to generate a time filter in the time domain. The time filter is preferably a filter with a finite impulse response (FIR). In particular, the time filter can be generated by a transformation of a transfer function from the frequency domain into the time domain, which represents the frequency band-dependent application of the first gain factors in the frequency domain. The time filter in this case is particularly preferably generated as a minimum-phase filter, which thus has a minimum possible latency for a given amplitude frequency response.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">By using the time filter thus generated, the reference signal is filtered&#x2014;in the time domain&#x2014;and an output signal is generated. In particular, the output signal can now be transmitted to a receiver, recorded, or reused. If the microphone array is used in a hearing instrument, then the output signal is preferably converted into an output sound signal by a loudspeaker (in the broadest sense, an electroacoustic output transducer of the hearing instrument). Before this conversion, the output signal can be subjected to further signal processing, for example to suppress an acoustic feedback which can occur between the loudspeaker and the microphone array.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The use of a time filter, which is applied to the reference signal in the time domain, results in a significant reduction in the latency of the signal processing compared to the signal processing in the frequency domain. On the basis of the mapping of the first gain factors, obtained from the first frequency-space directional signal, onto the time filter, the information regarding the direction-dependent acoustic image in the individual frequency bands, as obtained from the generation of the first frequency-space directional signal, can be implemented in the time filter. However, the differences between the directional signal processing as applied to the first frequency-space directional signal compared to the reference signal, transformed into the frequency domain, are taken into account.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Thus, by comparing the frequency-space reference signal with the first frequency-space directional signal or with a signal preferably directly derived therefrom, it is determined which frequency band-dependent gain factors must be applied to the frequency-space reference signal (which actually represents only the reference signal transformed into the frequency domain) in order to approximate as closely as possible the frequency band-dependent sound characteristics present in the first frequency-space directional signal, particularly with regard to signal strengths and levels, etc. An application of the time filter, in particular a FIR filter, in the time domain corresponds to an application of frequency- and time-dependent attenuation or gain factors in each frequency band followed by a signal synthesis. This &#x201c;encodes&#x201d; the frequency band-dependent direction dependency encoded in the first frequency-space directional signal into the first gain factors for the frequency-space reference signal. By mapping these first gain factors (and thus the described coded information on the effect of the directivity) onto the time filter, this directional information can thus be made available to the reference signal with a very low latency.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the frequency-resolved comparison of the frequency-space reference signal with the first frequency-space directional signal, or the signal derived from the first frequency-space directional signal in the frequency domain, is carried out using a spectral division, on the basis of which the frequency-dependent first gain factors are generated. The comparison by using a spectral division can on the one hand be implemented particularly efficiently and, on the other hand, takes into account the fact that the first gain factors thus represent a transfer function between the two mentioned signals in the frequency domain. The frequency-dependent first gain factors can be generated, in particular, by dividing the magnitudes of the frequency-space reference signal and the first frequency-space directional signal or the signal derived from the first frequency-space reference signal in the frequency domain.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Advantageously, as a signal derived from the first frequency-space directional signal in the frequency domain for the frequency-resolved comparison with the frequency-space reference signal, a second frequency-space directional signal is generated by applying frequency-dependent second gain factors to the first frequency-space directional signal. The first frequency-space signal can also undergo noise suppression, e.g. by using a Wiener filter, and, if necessary, dynamic compression, so that the frequency-space reference signal for the first gain factors is compared with the resulting second frequency-space directional signal.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The time filter in this case is conveniently formed from a mapping of the frequency-dependent first gain factors into the time domain. The term &#x2018;mapping&#x2019; can mean, in particular, that a transfer function corresponding to the first gain factors, or a transfer function corresponding to a product of the first gain factors with further frequency band-dependent gain factors, is transformed from the frequency domain into the time domain. In this way, it can be efficiently ensured that a filter with the correct properties is applied to the reference signal in the time domain, i.e. with the properties that are present in the frequency domain due to the first gain factors. The time filter is generated in particular as a FIR filter.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is advantageous to determine frequency-dependent second gain factors for the first frequency-space directional signal, wherein the time filter is formed on the basis of a common mapping of the first gain factors and the second gain factors into the time domain. In particular, the frequency-dependent second gain factors for the first frequency-space directional signal are determined by using noise suppression and/or dynamic compression and/or a hearing impairment to be corrected of a recipient of the output signal. The recipient of the output signal is in particular a user of a hearing instrument which includes the microphone array.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In other words: a noise reduction and/or a dynamic compression, which is/are to be applied to the first frequency-space directional signal in a frequency band-dependent manner, determines instantaneous second gain factors for the first frequency-space directional signal according to the respective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) specifications or the maximum signal level specifications in the frequency bands (which may also be individually matched to a hearing impairment of the user of the hearing instrument including the microphone array). However, these are not applied to the first frequency-space directional signal. Instead, a common mapping of the first gain factors, which result from the comparison of the first frequency-space directional signal with the transformed reference signal, is applied into the time domain together with the second gain factors to create the time filter. The properties of the noise suppression or dynamic compression are therefore not input into the time filter by the comparison of the transformed reference signal with a second frequency-space directional signal, which results from the application of the noise suppression or dynamic compression to the first frequency-space directional signal, but in fact directly though a mapping of the second gain factors determined for the noise suppression or dynamic compression into the time domain.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It proves to be advantageous if the reference signal is only formed from signal components of the first input signal. This means in particular that no other signal components are included in the reference signal apart from the signal components of the first input signal, and that the first input signal is preferably used as a reference signal either directly or after a single-channel signal processing stage. The effect of the directional microphony thus results in forming the first frequency-space directional signal in the frequency domain (which of course contains the frequency-space reference signal, i.e. the transformed first input signal in the frequency domain), which is to be compared with the transformed reference signal. The resulting first gain factors then carry the full spectral information on how the directional microphony affects the transformed reference signal. A time filter, which is generated by mapping these first gain factors into the time domain, then transfers this spectral information to the reference signal.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an advantageous embodiment, the reference signal is formed in the time domain from the first input signal and the second input signal as a time directional signal by using directional microphony. The directional microphony in the time domain can in particular be implemented as a time-delayed, and possibly differentially weighted, superposition of the two input signals (wherein the time delay is implemented in the time domain and is in particular the same for all spectral components of the two input signals). Using such a time directional signal as a reference signal allows the directivity to be increased overall, since e.g. broadband and/or dominant noise signals in the time directional signal, which are strongly localized, can be removed. A frequency band-dependent fine tuning of the microphone directivity is then carried out based on a comparison of the transformed time directional signal (i.e. the frequency-space reference signal) with the first frequency-space directional signal though the resulting time filter.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, the microphone array for carrying out the method also includes a third microphone for generating a third input signal from the ambient sound, wherein the third input signal is transformed into the frequency domain and the first frequency-space directional signal is also formed using the transformed third input signal in the frequency domain. In particular, the microphone array can also include a fourth or larger number of microphones. The described method can be easily transferred to such a microphone array with three or more microphones.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">With the objects of the invention in view, there is also provided a method for directional signal processing in a hearing instrument including a microphone array with at least one first microphone for generating a first input signal from an ambient sound and a second microphone for generating a second input signal from the ambient sound, as well as a control unit, and wherein an output sound signal of the hearing instrument for reproduction is generated from the first input signal and the second input signal according to the method described above. The advantages specified for the method for directional signal processing of signals of a microphone array and for its refinements can be transferred mutatis mutandis to the method for directional signal processing in a hearing instrument. The method for directional signal processing of signals of a microphone array is therefore applied in particular to the input signals of a microphone array which is part of a hearing instrument.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">With the objects of the invention in view, there is concomitantly provided a hearing instrument with a microphone array which includes at least one first microphone for generating a first input signal from an ambient sound and a second microphone for generating a second input signal from the ambient sound, and also a control unit, wherein the control unit is configured to carry out the method just mentioned using the first and second input signals. The hearing instrument shares the advantages of the method for directional signal processing of signals from a microphone array. The advantages specified for the method and for its refinements can be transferred mutatis mutandis to the hearing instrument. In particular, the hearing instrument may be configured as a hearing aid which is intended and configured to treat a hearing impairment.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Other features which are considered as characteristic for the invention are set forth in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in a hearing instrument and a method for directional signal processing of signals in a microphone array, it is nevertheless not intended to be limited to the details shown, since various modifications and structural changes may be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and within the scope and range of equivalents of the claims.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The construction and method of operation of the invention, however, together with additional objects and advantages thereof will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of a hearing instrument with a microphone array and directional signal processing according to the prior art;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of an alternative embodiment of the signal processing of the hearing instrument of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to the prior art;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of an embodiment of the directional signal processing of the hearing instrument according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with reduced latency; and</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram of an embodiment of the directional signal processing with reduced latency, which is an alternative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now in detail to the figures of the drawings, in which equivalent parts and dimensions are provided with identical reference signs, and first, particularly, to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> thereof, there is seen a schematic block diagram of a hearing instrument <b>1</b> which includes a microphone array <b>2</b> with a first microphone <b>4</b> and a second microphone <b>6</b>.

The effects of frequency-selective directional microphony and noise suppression on the individual frequency bands are determined in a manner yet to be described using the reference signal <b>46</b>, and thus the time filter <b>44</b> to be applied to the reference signal <b>46</b> is specified.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The first input signal <b>8</b> as the reference signal <b>46</b> and the second input signal <b>10</b> are transformed into the frequency domain by the first filter bank <b>12</b>, in a similar way to the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, thus generating the transformed first input signal <b>14</b> as a frequency-space reference signal <b>48</b> or the transformed second input signal <b>16</b>.
