Operation of a lean-burn engine, for example a diesel engine, provides the user with excellent fuel economy due to its operation at high air/fuel ratios under fuel-lean conditions. However, diesel engines also emit exhaust gas emissions containing particulate matter (PM), unburned hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), wherein NO<sub>x </sub>describes various chemical species of nitrogen oxides, including nitrogen monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), among others. NO<sub>x </sub>are harmful components of atmospheric pollution. Various methods have been used for the treatment of NO<sub>x</sub>-containing gas mixtures to decrease atmospheric pollution.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An effective method to reduce NO<sub>x </sub>from the exhaust of lean-burn engines requires reaction of NO<sub>x </sub>under lean burn engine operating conditions with a suitable reductant in the presence of a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst component. The SCR process may use a reductant, such as ammonia or a hydrocarbon in the presence of atmospheric oxygen, resulting in the formation predominantly of nitrogen and steam:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>4NO+4NH<sub>3</sub>+O<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;4N<sub>2</sub>+6H<sub>2</sub>O (standard SCR reaction)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>2NO<sub>2</sub>+4NH<sub>3</sub>+O<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;+3N<sub>2</sub>+6H<sub>2</sub>O (slow SCR reaction)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>NO+NO<sub>2</sub>+2NH<sub>3</sub>&#x2192;2N<sub>2</sub>+3H<sub>2</sub>O (fast SCR reaction)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0009" num="0005">Current catalysts employed in the SCR process include molecular sieves, such as zeolites, ion-exchanged with a catalytic metal such as iron or copper. A useful SCR catalyst component is able to effectively catalyze the reduction of the NO<sub>x </sub>exhaust component at temperatures below 600&#xb0; C. so that reduced NO<sub>x </sub>levels can be achieved even under conditions of low load, which are associated with lower exhaust temperatures.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0006">A problem encountered in the treatment of automotive exhaust gas streams is the so-called &#x201c;cold start&#x201d; period, which is the time period at the beginning of the treatment process, when the exhaust gas stream and the exhaust gas treatment system are at low temperatures (e.g., below 150&#xb0; C.). At these low temperatures, exhaust gas treatment systems generally do not display sufficient catalytic activity for effectively treating HC. NO<sub>x </sub>and/or CO emissions. In general, catalytic components such as SCR catalyst components are effective in converting NO<sub>x </sub>to N<sub>2 </sub>at temperatures above 200&#xb0; C., but may not exhibit sufficient activities at lower temperature regions (e.g., &#x3c;200&#xb0; C.), which may be found during cold-start or prolonged low-speed city driving. Accordingly, there is a demand for catalytic components capable of capturing and storing low-temperature NO<sub>x </sub>emissions, and releasing them at higher temperatures (e.g., &#x3e;200&#xb0; C.) when catalytic components (e.g., SCR catalyst components) become effective. Considerable efforts have been made to address this problem.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0007">There are several ways to minimize NO<sub>x </sub>emissions during cold start periods. For instance, trapping systems have been developed to store these exhaust gas emissions (e.g., HC, CO and NO<sub>x </sub>gases) at low temperatures and subsequently release them at higher temperatures, w % ben the remaining catalytic components of the treatment system have attained sufficient catalytic activity. One example of such system is the Lean NO<sub>x </sub>Trap (LNT) catalyst.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0008">Lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap (LNT) catalysts contain NO<sub>x </sub>adsorbent components that trap NO<sub>x </sub>under certain exhaust conditions. For example, the NO<sub>x </sub>adsorbent components can comprise alkaline earth elements, e.g., including alkaline earth metal oxides, such as oxides of magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), and/or barium (Ba). Other LNT catalysts can contain rare earth metal oxides as NO<sub>x </sub>adsorbent components, such as oxides of cerium (Ce), lanthanum (La), praseodymium (Pr), and/or neodymium (Nd). LNT catalysts further contain a platinum group metal (PGM) component, such as platinum dispersed on a refractory metal oxide (e.g., alumina) support, for catalytic NO<sub>x </sub>oxidation and reduction. The PGM component serves to oxidize nitric oxide (NO) to nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>). The LNT catalyst operates under cyclic lean (trapping mode) and rich (regeneration mode) exhaust conditions. Under lean conditions, the LNT catalyst traps and stores NO<sub>x </sub>as an inorganic nitrate (for example, where the NO<sub>x </sub>adsorbent component is barium oxide (BaO) or barium carbonate (BaCO<sub>3</sub>), it is converted to barium nitrate (Ba(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) upon reaction with (&#x201c;trapping&#x201d;) of NO<sub>x </sub>The NO<sub>x </sub>adsorbent component then releases the trapped NO<sub>x </sub>and the PGM component reduces the NO<sub>x </sub>to N<sub>2 </sub>under stoichiometric or transient rich engine operating conditions, or under lean engine operation with external fuel injected in the exhaust to induce rich conditions. The general principle of operation of the LNT includes that certain metal compounds (e.g., alkaline earth metal carbonates) undergo a carbonate/nitrate conversion, as a dominant path, during lean/rich operations according to the following equations:</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">Oxidation of NO to NO<sub>2</sub>(Lean Condition)</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0009"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>2NO+O<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;2NO<sub>2</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">NO<sub>x </sub>Storage as Nitrate (Trapping Mode)</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0010"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>2NO<sub>2</sub>+MCO<sub>3</sub>+&#xbd;O<sub>2</sub>&#x2192;M(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>+CO<sub>2</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">NO<sub>x </sub>Release (Rich Condition)</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0011"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>M(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>+2CO&#x2192;MCO<sub>3</sub>+NO<sub>2</sub>+NO+CO<sub>2</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(3)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">NO<sub>x </sub>Reduction to N<sub>2</sub>(Regeneration Mode)</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0012"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>NO<sub>2</sub>+CO&#x2192;NO+CO<sub>2</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(4)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0017" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>2NO+2CO&#x2192;N<sub>2</sub>+2CO<sub>2</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;(5)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0018" num="0000">The LNT catalyst promotes the storage of NO<sub>x </sub>during a lean period of operation (&#x3bb;&#x3e;1.0) (e.g., according to equations (1) and (2)), and during a rich period (&#x3bb;&#x3c;1.0), it catalyzes the release and reduction of stored NO<sub>x </sub>to N<sub>2 </sub>(e.g., according to equations (3), (4), and (5)), where a represents the air/fuel ratio. In equations (2) and (3), M represents a metal cation, such as a divalent metal cation. M can also be included in a monovalent or trivalent metal compound in which case the equations need to be rebalanced.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0013">Another method of trapping NO<sub>x </sub>is with a low-temperature NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber (LT-NA). Several varieties of LT-NAs are known. One relatively new LT-NA useful for low-temperature trapping of NO<sub>x </sub>utilizes a palladium (Pd)-exchanged zeolite to trap NO without catalytic pre-oxidation to NO<sub>2 </sub>(which is slow at T&#x3c;180&#xb0; C.). In theory, a LT-NA may be used in combination with an LNT to effectively trap low temperature emissions of NO<sub>x</sub>. However, use of a LT-NA in conjunction with a LNT is complicated by the discovery that the rich purge necessary to regenerate the LNT is destructive to the NO<sub>x </sub>storage capacity of the LT-NA. To avoid such event, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2017/0096922 describes a system with a LT-NA (referred to as a passive NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber; &#x201c;PNA&#x201d;) disposed upstream of an LNT. The rich condition necessary to regenerate the LNT is produced with injection of fuel from a fuel injector placed downstream of the NO<sub>x </sub>absorber and upstream of the LNT. In this configuration, the LNT may be regenerated without exposing the upstream NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber to reducing gases. However, this configuration is inherently more complicated to implement.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0014">Accordingly, there is a need for a system to trap and remove NO<sub>x </sub>emissions generated at low temperatures by incorporating an LNT and an LT-NA in a configuration which does not require an additional fuel injection device.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0015">The present disclosure generally provides exhaust gas treatment systems which exhibit enhanced NO<sub>x </sub>adsorption tinder low temperature conditions and methods of treating exhaust gas streams containing NO using such treatment systems. Such systems generally comprise a lean-NO<sub>x </sub>trap (LNT) and a low-temperature NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber (LT-NA) suitable for adsorbing NO<sub>x </sub>at low temperatures and releasing the trapped NO<sub>x </sub>at elevated temperatures. In particular, such systems comprise a LNT followed downstream by a LT-NA Use of a LT-NA downstream from a LNT would normally be prohibited by the fact that the storage function of the LT-NA is strongly deactivated by the rich deNO<sub>x </sub>condition used to regenerate the LNT. Surprisingly, it has been found that by placing the LT-NA downstream of the LNT and controlling the composition and timing of the deNO<sub>x </sub>reducing pulse, the LT-NA is protected from exposure to the reductants by the oxygen-storage function of the LNT, thus extending the useful low temperature trapping range of the system for cold-start NO<sub>x </sub>emissions.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0016">Accordingly, in a first aspect is provided an emission treatment system for NO<sub>x </sub>abatement in an exhaust stream of a lean burn engine, the emission treatment system comprising a lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap (LNT) comprising an oxygen storage component (OSC) and a first platinum group metal (PGM) component, wherein the LNT is in fluid communication with and downstream from the lean burn engine; and a low-temperature NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber (LT-NA) comprising a molecular sieve comprising a second PGM component, wherein the LT-NA is in fluid communication with and downstream of the LNT.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0017">In some embodiments, the LNT is disposed on a first substrate, and the LT-NA is disposed on a second substrate.

In some embodiments, such systems comprise a lean-NO<sub>x </sub>trap (LNT) followed downstream by a low temperature NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber (LT-NA). Such systems are effective in trapping and storing NO<sub>x </sub>under cold-start conditions, and releasing NO<sub>x </sub>as downstream emission treatment components reach their operating temperatures. This low temperature adsorption performance is important when, for example, these NO<sub>x</sub>, adsorption components are placed upstream of a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) catalyst that is effective in converting NO<sub>x </sub>to N<sub>2 </sub>at temperatures above 200&#xb0; C., but not sufficiently active at lower temperature regions (e.g., &#x3c;200&#xb0; C.), such as during a cold-start.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0039">Use of an LT-NA downstream of an LNT may be affected as the adsorption capacity of the LT-NA can be reduced or deactivated by the rich deNO<sub>x </sub>condition used to regenerate the upstream LNT. To address this issue, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure, by placing an LT-NA downstream of an LNT, and controlling the composition and timing of the deNO<sub>x </sub>reducing pulse, the LT-NA is protected from exposure to the reductants in the exhaust gas stream by the oxygen-storage function of the LNT, thereby extending the useful low temperature trapping range of the system for abating cold-start NO<sub>x </sub>emissions.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0040">As used herein, &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; refers to one or more than one (e.g., at least one) of the following object.

Particle size refers to primary particles. Particle size may be measured by laser light scattering techniques, with dispersions or dry powders, for example according to standard test method ASTM D4464. D90 particle size distribution indicates that 90% of the particles (e.g., by number) have a Feret diameter below a certain size as measured by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) or Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) for submicron size particles; and a particle size analyzer for the support-containing particles (e.g., at micron size).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0045">The term &#x201c;catalyst&#x201d; refers to a material that promotes a chemical reaction.

For example, zeolites are supports for palladium active catalytic species. Likewise, refractory metal oxide particles may be a support for platinum group metal catalytic species. The catalytically active species are also termed &#x201c;promoters&#x201d; as they promote chemical reactions. For instance, a present palladium-containing rare earth metal component may be termed a Pd-promoted rare earth metal component. A &#x201c;promoted rare earth metal component&#x201d; refers to a rare earth metal component to which catalytically active species are intentionally added.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0046">The term &#x201c;catalytic article&#x201d; in the disclosure means an article comprising a substrate having a catalyst coating composition.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0047">The term &#x201c;crystal size&#x201d; as used herein means the length of one edge of a face of the crystal, such as the longest edge, provided that the crystals are not needle-shaped. Direct measurement of the crystal size can be performed using microscopy methods, such as SEM and TEM. For example, measurement by SEM involves examining the morphology of materials at high magnifications (such as 1000&#xd7; to 10,000&#xd7;). The SEM method can be performed by distributing a representative portion of the zeolite powder on a suitable mount such that individual particles are reasonably evenly spread out across the field of view, e.g., at 1000&#xd7; to 10,000&#xd7; magnification. From this population, a statistically significant sample of random individual crystals (e.g., 50-200) are examined and the longest dimensions of the individual crystals parallel to the horizontal line of the straight edge are measured and recorded.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0048">The term &#x201c;configured&#x201d; as used in the description and claims is intended to be an open-ended term as are the terms &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; or &#x201c;containing.&#x201d; The term &#x201c;configured&#x201d; is not meant to exclude other possible articles or elements.

A wall-flow filter consists of alternating inlet channels and outlet channels, where the inlet channels are plugged on the outlet end and the outlet channels are plugged on the inlet end. A soot-carrying exhaust gas stream entering the inlet channels is forced to pass through the filter walls before exiting from the outlet channels. In addition to soot filtration and regeneration, A CSF may carry oxidation catalysts to oxidize CO and HC to CO<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2</sub>O, or oxidize NO to NO<sub>2 </sub>to accelerate the downstream SCR catalysis or to facilitate the oxidation of soot particles at lower temperatures.

The disclosed LNT and/or LT-NA may, in some embodiments, be prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method. Incipient wetness impregnation techniques, also called capillary impregnation, or dry impregnation, are used for the synthesis of heterogeneous materials, e.g., catalysts. For example, a metal precursor (e.g., a PGM component) is dissolved in an aqueous or organic solution and then the metal-containing solution is added to the material to be impregnated (e.g., a rare earth metal oxide or molecular sieve), and which contains the same pore volume as the volume of the solution that was added. Capillary action draws the solution into the pores of the material. Solution added in excess of the material pore volume causes the solution transport to change from a capillary action process to a diffusion process, which is much slower. The impregnated material can then be dried and calcined to remove the volatile components within the solution, depositing the metal on the surface of the material. The maximum loading is limited by the solubility of the precursor in the solution. The concentration profile of the impregnated material depends on the mass transfer conditions within the pores during impregnation and drying. One of skill in the art will recognize other methods for loading the PGM components into, e.g., the OSC and molecular sieve of the present LNT and LT-NA compositions, for example, by adsorption.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0102">For example, in preparation of the LT-NA, the second PGM component may be added to the molecular sieve by any suitable means, and the manner of addition may not be critical.

In some embodiments, non-limiting examples of suitable PGM component precursors include palladium nitrate, tetraammine palladium nitrate, tetraammine platinum acetate, platinum nitrate, and combinations thereof.

The coatings are &#x201c;catalyst coating compositions&#x201d; or &#x201c;catalyst coatings.&#x201d; The terms &#x201c;catalyst composition&#x201d; and &#x201c;catalyst coating composition&#x201d; are synonymous. A LNT catalyst coating comprises the LNT as described herein in the form of a composition, which may include additional components. A LT-NA catalyst coating comprises the LT-NA as described herein in the form of a composition, which may include additional components. LNT and LT-NA catalyst compositions may be prepared using a binder, for example, a ZrO2 binder derived from a suitable precursor, such as zirconyl acetate, or any other suitable zirconium precursor, such as zirconyl nitrate. Zirconyl acetate binder provides a coating that remains homogeneous and intact after thermal aging, for example, when the catalyst is exposed to high temperatures of at least about 600&#xb0; C., for example, at about 800&#xb0; C. and higher, with water vapor environments of about 5% or more. Other potentially suitable binders include, but are not limited to, alumina and silica. Alumina binders include aluminum oxides, aluminum hydroxides, and/or aluminum oxyhydroxides. Aluminum salts and colloidal forms of alumina many also be used. Silica binders include various forms of SiO<sub>2</sub>, including silicates and/or colloidal silica. Binder compositions may include any combination of zirconia, alumina, and/or silica. Other example binders include boehemite, gamma-alumina, and/or delta/theta alumina, as well as silica sol. When present, the binder is typically used in an amount of about 1 wt. % to about 5 wt. % of the total washcoat loading. Alternatively, the binder can be zirconia-based or silica-based, for example zirconium acetate, zirconia sol, or silica sol. When present, the alumina binder is typically used in an amount of about 0.05 g/in<sup>3 </sup>to about 1 g/in<sup>3</sup>. In some embodiments, the binder includes alumina.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0118">As disclosed herein above, a substrate is coated with a catalytic (e.g., LNT or LT-NA) composition to form a catalytic article. The catalytic coating may comprise one or more thin, adherent coating layers disposed on and in adherence to least a portion of a substrate. In some embodiments, the present catalytic articles may include the use of one or more catalyst layers and combinations of one or more catalyst layers. Catalytic materials may be present on the inlet side of the substrate wall alone, the outlet side alone, both the inlet and outlet sides, or the wall itself may consist all, or in part, of the catalytic material. The catalytic coating may be on the substrate wall surfaces and/or in the pores of the substrate walls, that is &#x201c;in&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;on&#x201d; the substrate walls. Thus, the phrase &#x201c;a catalytic coating disposed on the substrate&#x201d; means on any surface, for example on a wall surface and/or on a pore surface. The catalytic coating layer(s) may comprise the individual functional components, that is, the LNT and LT-NA compositions as described herein.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0119">A catalyst composition may typically be applied in the form of a washcoat. A washcoat is formed by preparing a slurry containing a specified solids content (e.g., about 10% to about 60% by weight) in a liquid vehicle, which is then applied to a substrate and dried and calcined to provide a coating layer. If multiple coating layers are applied, the substrate is dried and calcined after each layer is applied and/or after a number of desired multiple layers are applied. In one or more embodiments, the catalytic material(s) are applied to the substrate as a washcoat. Binders may also be employed as described above.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0120">The above-noted catalyst composition(s)(e.g., LNT and LT-NA) may be independently mixed with water to form a slurry for purposes of coating a catalyst substrate, such as a honeycomb-type substrate. In addition to the catalyst particles, the slurry may optionally contain a binder (e.g., alumina, silica), water-soluble or water-dispersible stabilizers, promoters, associative thickeners, and/or surfactants (including anionic, cationic, non-ionic or amphoteric surfactants). In some embodiments, a pH range for the slurry is about 3 to about 6. Addition of acidic or basic species to the slurry can be carried out to adjust the pH accordingly. For example, in some embodiments, the pH of the slurry is adjusted by the addition of ammonium hydroxide or aqueous nitric acid.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0121">The slurry can be milled to enhance mixing of the particles and formation of a homogenous material. The milling can be accomplished in a ball mill, continuous mill, or other similar equipment, and the solids content of the slurry may be, e.g., about 20 wt. % to about 60 wt. %, such as about 20 wt. % to about 40 wt. %. In one embodiment, the post-milling slurry is characterized by a D90 particle size of about 10 microns to about 40 microns. For example, the D90 particle size may be about 10 microns to about 30 microns, or about 10 microns to about 15 microns.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0122">The slurry is then coated on the catalyst substrate using any suitable washcoat technique. In one embodiment, the catalyst substrate is dipped one or more times in the slurry or otherwise coated with the slurry. Thereafter, the coated substrate is dried at an elevated temperature (e.g., about 100&#xb0; C. to about 150&#xb0; C.) for a period of time (e.g., about 10 min to about 3 hours), and then calcined by heating, e.g., at about 400&#xb0; C. to about 600&#xb0; C., for example, for about 10 minutes to about 3 hours. Following drying and calcining, the final washcoat coating layer can be viewed as substantially solvent-free.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0123">After calcining, the catalyst loading obtained by the above described washcoat technique can be determined through calculation of the difference in coated and uncoated weights of the substrate. As will be apparent to those of skill in the art, the catalyst loading can be modified by altering the slurry rheology. In addition, the coating/drying/calcining process to generate a washcoat can be repeated as needed to build the coating to the desired loading level or thickness. For example, more than one washcoat may be applied.</p><heading id="h-0021" level="2">Coating Configurations</heading><p id="p-0130" num="0124">The washcoat(s) comprising the LNT and LT-NA compositions as disclosed herein can be applied such that different coating layers may be in direct contact with the substrate.

No. 7,229,597, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The present LT-NA and LNT catalyst compositions are generally present on the substrate at a concentration of, for instance, from about 0.3 g/in<sup>3 </sup>to about 5.5 g/in<sup>3</sup>, or from about 0.4 g/in<sup>3</sup>, about 0.5 g/in<sup>3</sup>, about 0.6 g/in<sup>3</sup>, about 0.7 g/in<sup>3</sup>, about 0.8 g/in<sup>3</sup>, about 0.9 g/in<sup>3</sup>, or about 1.0 g/in<sup>3</sup>, to about 1.5 g/in<sup>3</sup>, about 2.0 g/in<sup>3</sup>, about 2.5 g/in<sup>3</sup>, about 3.0 g/in<sup>3</sup>, about 3.5 g/in<sup>3</sup>, about 4.0 g/in<sup>3</sup>, about 4.5 g/in<sup>3</sup>, about 5.0 g/in<sup>3</sup>, or about 5.5 g/in<sup>3</sup>, based on the substrate.

As used herein, reducing gases refers to components present in the exhaust gas stream during a rich condition, and may include, for example, carbon monoxide (CO) and/or hydrocarbons (HC). By rich condition is meant that the air/fuel ratio (lambda; &#x3bb;) is below 1. In some embodiments, &#x3bb; is from about 0.80 to about 0.995. In some embodiments, &#x3bb; is from about 0.90 to 0.95. The air/fuel ratio of the exhaust gas composition may be altered to provide a rich gaseous stream (rich condition) by a number of methods known to those of skill in the art. Controllers that periodically operate the lean burn engine in a rich mode, or more directly alter the air/fuel ratio of the exhaust stream can be used. For instance, the air/fuel ratio can be made rich by periodically operating the engine in a rich mode using well known engine management controls. Alternatively, the exhaust gas stream may be rendered rich by periodically metering a hydrocarbon (e.g., diesel fuel) into the exhaust gas stream upstream of the LNT. A rich gaseous exhaust stream may also be formed by adding CO and/or hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) to the exhaust upstream of the LNT, which may be generated, for example, by treatment of a small quantity of hydrocarbon fuel in a partial oxidation reaction.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="2">Emission Treatment System</heading><p id="p-0143" num="0137">Another embodiment is provided an emission treatment system for NO<sub>x </sub>abatement in an exhaust stream of a lean burn engine, the emission treatment system comprising a lean NO<sub>x </sub>trap (LNT) as disclosed herein, the LNT in fluid communication with and downstream from the lean burn engine; and a low-temperature NO<sub>x </sub>adsorber (LT-NA) as disclosed herein, the LT-NA in fluid communication with and downstream of the LNT.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0138">The engine can be, e.g., a diesel engine which operates at combustion conditions with air in excess of that required for stoichiometric combustion, e.g. lean conditions.

In some embodiments, the method further comprises operating the lean burn engine in a rich mode for a period of time, producing a rich exhaust stream containing reducing gases comprising hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO); passing the rich exhaust gas stream through the LNT, thereby creating a reducing atmosphere therein; and regenerating the LNT in the reducing atmosphere; wherein the period of time the lean burn engine is operated in the rich mode is sufficient to regenerate the LNT without exceeding the adsorption capacity of the LNT for the reducing gases. As used herein, &#x201c;rich mode&#x201d; refers to operating the lean burn engine under a less than stoichiometric air/fuel ratio (e.g., &#x3bb;&#x3c;1) such that the hydrocarbon fuel consumed by the engine is not fully combusted. This results in an exhaust stream containing unburned or partially burned hydrocarbons, referred to herein as a &#x201c;rich condition&#x201d; or &#x201c;reducing condition.&#x201d; In contrast, &#x201c;lean mode&#x201d; refers to the normal, lean operation of the lean burn engine (e.g., &#x3bb;&#x3e;1). Operation in the rich mode is one method of producing a rich condition used to regenerate a LNT (e.g., a &#x201c;deNO<sub>x </sub>pulse&#x201d;). In the alternative, a deNO<sub>x </sub>pulse may be created by introducing hydrocarbons or other reducing gases (e.g., CO or H<sub>2</sub>) into the exhaust stream by an injector downstream of the engine and upstream of one or more of the catalytic components.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0149">As disclosed herein above, use of a LT-NA downstream of a LNT would normally be affected by the fact that the NO<sub>x </sub>adsorption capacity of the LT-NA would be deactivated by the rich condition deNO<sub>x </sub>pulse used to regenerate the LNT. However, by placing the LT-NA downstream of the LNT, and controlling the time period of the rich condition, the total quantity of the reducing gases contacting the LNT can be controlled. As such, the LT-NA can be protected from exposure to the reducing gases by the oxygen-storage function of the LNT. In some embodiments, when the exhaust gas stream is switched from the normal lean (oxidizing) condition to the rich (reducing) condition, there is a period of several seconds during which all reductant is consumed over the LNT by the oxygen-storage component (OSC). During this time, the effluent from the LNT, which enters the LT-NA, is stoichiometric (e.g., containing no O<sub>2 </sub>or reductant). If composition and timing of this reducing pulse is controlled in such a way that there is no breakthrough of reductant from the LNT, then the downstream LT-NA is protected from the negative effect of the rich (e.g., reducing) deNO<sub>x </sub>pulse. In some embodiments, the timing of the deNO<sub>x </sub>pulse is controlled by monitoring the exhaust stream effluent from the LNT, and adjusting the air/fuel ratio responsively. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the method for abating NO<sub>x </sub>in an exhaust stream from a lean burn engine further comprises monitoring the exhaust stream exiting the LNT with a lambda sensor; and returning the lean burn engine to a lean mode, ending the period of time of operating the lean burn engine in the rich mode; thereby preventing exposure of the LNT to the reducing atmosphere. One of skill in the art will recognize the standard components and their integration into the engine management system to provide such control over the deNO<sub>x </sub>pulse.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0150">The present systems and methods are suitable for treatment of exhaust gas streams from mobile emissions sources such as trucks and automobiles.
