At the turn of the millennium heart failure was widely identified as an emerging epidemic. To date 5.6 million patients in the US alone and 23 million worldwide are suffering from heart failure with 50 percent dying within 5 years after being diagnosed. Current treatment is limited to ameliorating symptoms and slowing the natural progression of the disease but fails to compensate for the loss of contractile myocardium post-injury.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The epicardium is an epithelium covering the heart, which is essential for normal cardiac development. During embryonic life, the epicardium provides signals for proliferation, survival, and maturation to the cardiomyocytes. In return, the myocardium provides signals inducing proliferation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the epicardium. The mesenchymal cells derived from the epicardium (EPDCs) invade the myocardium and become mainly cardiac fibroblasts (CF) and coronary smooth muscle cells (cSMC).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the human adult, the epicardium is quiescent. It becomes reactivated after ischemic injury but produces EPDCs that are less efficient at migrating and differentiating than their embryonic counterparts. They produce signals that activate the resident cardiac fibroblasts, inducing fibrosis but not myogenesis. Better knowledge of the human epicardium could provide a route to circumvent the regenerative limitations of the human adult heart. Mature cardiac cells in the mammalian heart proliferate very slowly limiting its regenerative capacity after injury. Accordingly, cells dying after infarction are not replaced by new ones but instead characteristic fibrotic scar tissue forms, which interferes with potential regeneration, impairs heart function, and may later result in heart failure. The epicardium is a multipotent cardiovascular progenitor source with therapeutic potential for cardiac fibroblast (CF), smooth muscle cell (SMC), and cardiomyocyte regeneration, due to its integral role in development and its ability to initiate myocardial repair in injured adult tissues.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Human epicardial cells, derived from human pluripotent stem cells, have the ability to differentiate in vitro and produce mature cell types of the heart, notably CFs and SMCs.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells have previously been proposed for use in therapy. In particular, the use of such cells together with human cardiomyocytes as a transplant composition is disclosed in WO2018/170280, incorporated herein by reference. This composition is to be used post-injury to the heart, such as after a myocardial infarction, and assists in regenerating tissues. In this work, it was assumed that the in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells are a homogenous population of cells, with the ability to form each of the differentiated progeny cells, such as cardiac fibroblasts (CF) and smooth muscle cells (SMC).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Previously, it was assumed that the in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells were a homogenous population, capable of forming the different mature cells types. However, the inventors have carefully determined that the in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells are actually a heterogeneous population of cells, with two distinct signatures, which has implications for improving the therapeutic outcome of administering these cells to a damaged heart, and further for drug testing and the like. These improvements include the ability to control the biological outcome in the production of differentiated cell types which in turn allows the ability to control fibrosis, smooth muscle repair and the protection and maturation of cardiomyocytes. Thus providing improved treatments for cardiac injury.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides methods and compositions comprising substantially pure populations of epicardial cells and mixtures thereof optionally formulated with cardiomyocytes for engraftment and subsequent regeneration of functional heart tissue which find utility in the treatment of heart injury following, for example after a myocardial infarction.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for separating in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells into a first population of cells characterised by higher levels of expression of transcription factor 21 when compared to basonuclin 1, and a second population of cells characterised by higher levels of expression basonuclin 1 when compared to transcription factor 21, the method comprising cell-sorting using a capture agent specific for a cell surface marker for the first population of cells and/or the second population of cells.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells are obtained from human pluripotent stem cells (human embryonic stem cells or human induced pluripotent stem cells).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Optionally the cell-sorting may be achieved by:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0012">a) Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS); or</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0013">b) Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS); or</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0014">c) Microfluidic cell separation; or</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0015">d) Buoyancy-activated cell sorting</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">Optionally the capture agent may be any binding partner typically an antibody, an antibody fragment such as a domain antibody, a derivative of an antibody, an engineered affinity protein such as affibody, an aptamer (peptide or nucleic acid) or any other antibody mimeticor non antibody capture agent.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">In an embodiment of the invention, the cells are separated using high stringency anti-PODXL columns. In another embodiment the cells are separated using high stringency anti-THY1 columns. In a preferred embodiment the cells eluated from the column are utilised as those cells will not have been activated by interaction with the antibody on the column. Utilising a high stringency column in such a way will ensure any cells expressing both TCF21 and PODXL will be retained on the column.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">The inventors have discovered through studies described in detail below that in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells derived from either human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) or human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) consist of two major populations. A first population is characterised by higher levels of expression of transcription factor 21 than basonuclin 1 (herein denoted TCF21<sup>high</sup>) and a second population is characterised by higher levels of expression of basonuclin 1 than transcription factor 21 (herein denoted BNC1<sup>high</sup>). These differentially expressed genes, which are both transcription factors, characterise the two different cells populations. Transcription factor (TCF21), also known as pod-1, capsulin, or epicardin, is a transcription factor essential for the determination of cardiac fibroblast lineage. It is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor very important for heart and kidney development which has been implicated in coronary artery disease and cancer. During heart development, it is particularly involved in the regulation of epicardial function and development of cardiac fibroblasts and coronary smooth muscle cells (Ao, X., Ding, W., Zhang, Y., Ding, D. &#x26; Liu, Y. TCF21: a critical transcription factor in health and cancer. <i>Journal of Molecular Medicine </i>(2020) &#x26; Hu, H., Lin, S., Wang, S. &#x26; Chen, X. The Role of Transcription Factor 21 in Epicardial Cell Differentiation and the Development of Coronary Heart Disease. <i>Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology </i>(2020)).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">BNC1 is a zinc finger transcription factor. It is highly expressed in epithelia and germ cells of testis and ovary. Some of the BNC1 deficient mice die during embryogenesis for unknown reasons while the surviving ones are overall healthy but sterile with identified abnormalities during corneal wound-healing. BNC1 expression in the epicardium of the heart was first reported by the laboratory of Nadia Rosenthal<sup>3-5</sup>. The inventors have shown that BNC1 regulates epicardial heterogeneity and allows the separation of the cells into two populations with different properties. BNC1 is expressed in the human heart during development, and it is suggested as an upstream regulator of a transcriptional hierarchy regulating cell identity. They have also observed the effect of knocking this gene down via gene silencing, since this results in the production of cells of the first population only. The majority of the epicardial cells of both populations have been observed, when exposed to conditions encouraging smooth muscle cell differentiation, to differentiate into smooth muscle cells (hPSC-epi-SMC) to the same extent. In contrast, when exposed to conditions encouraging cardiac fibroblasts, whilst the majority of the epicardial cells of the first population (TCF21<sup>high </sup>or TCF21<sup>+</sup>) differentiate into cardiac fibroblasts (hPSC-epi-CF), none or extremely few epicardial cells of the second population (BNC1<sup>high </sup>or BNC1<sup>+</sup>) differentiate into cardiac fibroblasts.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">Injections of the whole hPSC-epicardium along with hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, in comparison with injection of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes alone in the infarcted rat heart, have demonstrated beneficial effects of the whole hPSC-epicardium on the engraftment and maturation of the hPSC-cardiomyocytes and on stimulating angiogenesis in the endogenous heart tissues (Bargehr et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2019). According to bioinformatic predictions, each population are predicted to have different beneficial effects. The TCF21<sup>+</sup> population are useful for promoting angiogenesis and promoting vascularisation. The second population would be particular useful for survival and maturation of the hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. The discovery that the TCF21<sup>+</sup> population is the only one able to produce fibroblasts, provides an advantage in being able to reduce its quantity when fibrosis needs to be controlled. The capacity of the TCF21<sup>+</sup> population to promote angiogenesis had been confirmed by in vitro experiments in which the sorted TCF21<sup>+</sup> cells were able to stabilise longer than the BNC1<sup>+</sup> ones, an endothelial network generated by HUVECS cells in Matrigel. As a consequence, separating and re-mixing of the two cell types could allow for control of the repair by carefully controlling the proportions of the cell type used.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">Thus the second population (BNC1<sup>high</sup>) of cells or cells enriched with the second population form the basis of a therapeutic method for treating or repairing heart tissue damage preferably without attendant fibrosis. The risk of generating excessive CF in a transplant composition may lead to fibrosis leading to ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Therefore, it is highly desirable to minimise and control the amount of the first population of cells (TCF21<sup>high</sup>) in any therapeutic application where fibrosis should be minimised. In addition, bioinformatic analysis predicts that the BNC1<sup>high </sup>cells promote cardiomyocyte function by promoting the maturation, survival, and protection, of the cardiomyocytes.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">Nonetheless TCF21<sup>high </sup>cells find utility in the repair of cardiac tissue where angiogenesis and vascularisation is important. Relatively low levels of TCF21<sup>high </sup>cells have also been shown to promote the activity of BNC1<sup>high </sup>cells. As a consequence, mixtures in specific proportions of the two cell types allows for control of the repair by carefully controlling the proportions of the cell type used.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">Accordingly the present invention provides a composition of a substantially pure BNC1<sup>high </sup>cell population. In an alternative embodiment, a composition of a substantially pure TCF21<sup>high </sup>cell population.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">In certain embodiments the compositions of the invention may be provided with human cardiomyocytes. The human cardiomyocytes may be in vitro-differentiated. In one embodiment of this aspect, cells of the invention may be provided in suspension with cardiomyocytes, and the resulting mixture injected directly to the myocardium. In another embodiment of this aspect, a patch comprising human cardiomyocytes that are in vitro-differentiated and the cells of the invention may be grafted directly on to the epicardium.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">Conditions encouraging smooth muscle fibre differentiation or cardiac fibroblasts are known to those skilled in the art, and a non-limiting example of conditions includes culturing hPSC-epi cells for about 12 days in CDM-PVA supplemented with PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml, Peprotech) and TGF&#x3b2;1 (2 ng/ml, Peprotech) to obtain hPSC-epi-SMC and with VEGF-B (50 ng/ml, Peprotech) and FGF-2 (50 ng/ml) to get hPSC-epi-CF (as disclosed in is disclosed in WO2018/170280).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">Notably, THY1 (also known as CD90 (Cluster of Differentiation 90), originally discovered as a thymocyte antigen) may be used as a marker for the first and second populations. TCF21<sup>high </sup>cells, the first population, express THY1 (they are THY1<sup>+</sup>); whilst BNC1<sup>high </sup>cells (the second population) do not (THY1<sup>&#x2212;</sup>). The cells may be sorted on this basis, since this is a cell surface marker.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">Similarly, PODXL (Podocalyxin Like) may be used as a marker for the first and second populations. TCF21<sup>high </sup>cells, the first population, do not express PODXL (they are PODXL<sup>&#x2212;</sup>); whilst BNC1<sup>high </sup>cells (the second population) do express PODXL (PODXL<sup>+</sup>). The cells may be sorted on this basis, since this is a cell surface marker. In some cases, a small proportion of the in vitro-differentiated epicardial cells may be double-positive, whereby they express both PODXL and THY1. Additionally, a minor population of cells may be double-negative, whereby they do not express either marker.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028">Thus in a second aspect of the invention, an isolated first population (TCF21<sup>high</sup>) of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells characterised by higher levels of expression of transcription factor 21 when compared to basonuclin 1 is provided. Therefore, a substantially pure population of in vitro differentiated TCF21<sup>high </sup>cells is provided.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0029">In a third aspect of the invention, an isolated second population (BNC1<sup>high</sup>) of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells characterised by higher levels of expression of basonuclin 1 when compared to transcription factor 21 is provided. Therefore, a substantially pure population of in vitro differentiated BNC1<sup>high </sup>cells is provided.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0030">As the aforementioned studies detailed below suggest angiogenic potential for the first population (TCF21<sup>high</sup>) of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells, a tailored mixture of first and second populations of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells may have therapeutic advantages.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0031">Thus in a fourth aspect of the invention, a mixture of first (TCF21<sup>high</sup>) and second (BNC1<sup>high</sup>) populations of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells is provided, wherein the first population is characterised by expression of higher levels of transcription factor 21 when compared to basonuclin 1 and the second population is characterised by expression of higher levels of basonuclin 1 when compared to transcription factor 21, wherein the mixture is enriched with either the first or second populations of cells. As used herein, enriched may mean increased to a level above natural or normal levels, found in a heterogeneous population of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0032">In a fifth aspect of the invention, an isolated first population (TCF21<sup>high</sup>) of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells according to the second aspect of the invention or an isolated second population (BNC1<sup>high</sup>) of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells according to the third aspect of the invention or a mixture of first and second populations of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells according to the fourth aspect of the invention is provided for use as a medicament.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0033">More particularly and in a sixth aspect of the invention, an isolated first population (TCF21<sup>high</sup>) of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells according to the second aspect of the invention or an isolated second population (BNC1<sup>high</sup>) of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells according to the third aspect of the invention or a mixture of first and second populations of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells according to the fourth aspect of the invention is provided for use in treating and/or repairing cardiac tissue damage.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0034">Mixtures of the invention can be prepared by simple mixing of the two cell populations in predefined ratios, or one cell type can be added to non-sorted heterogeneous mixtures to enrich for the appropriate cell type.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0035">In a seventh aspect of the invention, an isolated first population (TCF21<sup>high</sup>) of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells according to the second aspect of the invention or a mixture of first and second populations of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells according to the fourth aspect of the invention is provided wherein the mixture is enriched with the first population of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells for use as cell therapy for cardiac repair, optionally in treating and/or repairing cardiac blood vessel, smooth muscle fibre or cardiac fibroblast damage.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0036">In an eighth aspect of the invention, an isolated second population (BNC1<sup>high</sup>) of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells according to the third aspect of the invention or a mixture of first and second populations of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells according to the fourth aspect of the invention is provided wherein the mixture is enriched with the second population of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells for use in treating and/or repairing smooth muscle fibre damage, preferably with reduced fibrosis.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0037">In a ninth aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for the production of a first population (TCF21<sup>high</sup>) of in vitro-differentiated epicardial cells, comprising the knockdown of BNC1 in human pluripotent stem cells. Said knock-down may be performed by introducing methods used to silence genes, such as RNAi (RNA interference), CRISPR, or siRNA (small interfering RNA). Alternatively a small molecule compound capable of knockdown of BNC1 expression or translation may be used. In a similar fashion TCF21 knock down may be prepared.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0038">The cells and mixtures obtainable by the methods of the invention may be put to therapeutic use, for example as a cell therapy, for example in the production of cardiac grafts, or they may be used in vitro as a research tool to assist in the developments of small molecule compounds and other therapeutic agents.

The heart is made of three major tissue layers: the endocardium, myocardium, and epicardium. The epicardium is the outermost epithelial layer of the heart and is responsible for the formation of coronary vascular smooth muscle cells. The epicardium can be re-activated to a more fetal form and/or the epicardial cells can undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in response to an acute injury to the myocardium (e.g., a myocardial infarction).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0053">Provided herein are novel epicardial cell populations and uses thereof in the treatment of cardiac injury, cardiac disease/disorder, and/or promoting vascularization and engraftment of coadministered cardiomyocytes.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0054">In a first aspect of the invention, a method for separating in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells into a first population of cells characterised by higher levels of expression of transcription factor 21 when compared to basonuclin 1, and a second population of cells characterised by higher levels of expression basonuclin 1 when compared to transcription factor 21, the method comprising cell sorting using a capture agent specific for a cell surface marker for the first population of cells and/or the second population of cells. The populations of cells can be separated based on cell surface markers: TCF21<sup>high </sup>cells, the first population, express THY1 (they are THY1<sup>+</sup>); whilst BNC1<sup>high </sup>cells (the second population) do not express this marker (THY1<sup>&#x2212;</sup>). The cells may be sorted on this basis, since this is a cell surface marker. Other cell markers include PODXL, in this case the first population do not express PODXL (thus PODXL<sup>&#x2212;</sup>), whilst the second population does express PODXL (PODXL+)</p><p id="p-0055" num="0055">The in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells are derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). These may be autologous stem cells or allogenic stem cells. Optionally the cells are induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Such cells are obtainable from mature cell types using reprogramming methods well known in the art. Alternatively, the use of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or cell lines derived from ESCs may be possible. The embryonic stem cells may be obtained from a human blastocyst without destruction of said blastocyst. The in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells may be obtained from the pluripotent stem cells by culturing the cells under the appropriate conditions in order to reach an epicardial fate. The inventors have reported Oyer D, et al. Development. 2015; 142(8):1528-1541, herein incorporated by reference) a method of generating epicardial cells from hPSCs under chemically defined conditions by first inducing an early mesoderm lineage, then lateral plate mesoderm (LM) before further specification to epicardium. They demonstrated that a combination of WNT, BMP and RA signalling promotes robust epicardium differentiation from LM. These in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells display characteristic epithelial cell morphology and express elevated levels of epicardial markers (such as TBX18, WT1 and TCF21), similar to human foetal epicardial outgrowths. Importantly, these epicardial cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and differentiate in vitro into mature and functional SMCs (SMCs), and CFs. hPSCs can be efficiently differentiated to epicardial cells by recapitulating early developmental events in vitro.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0056">As used herein, the term &#x201c;in vitro-differentiated epicardial cells&#x201d; refers to epicardial cells that are generated in culture, usually by step-wise differentiation from a precursor such as a stem cell, an early mesoderm cell, a lateral plate mesoderm cell or a cardiac progenitor cell. In one embodiment, the term &#x201c;in vitro-differentiated epicardial cells&#x201d; may exclude human tissue-derived epicardial cells obtained from a subject (primary epicardial cells). The term &#x201c;EMT&#x201d; or &#x201c;epithelial to mesenchymal transition&#x201d; refers to the transition of a cell having an epithelial phenotype to a cell having a mesenchymal phenotype. EMT usually occurs in response to an injury to the myocardium in the adult heart. An epithelial phenotype includes expression of epithelial cell markers (such as cadherin, cytokeratins, ZO-1, laminin, desmoplakin, MUC1). A mesenchymal phenotype includes expression of mesenchymal markers (such as vimentin, fibronectin, twist, FSP-1 Snail, Snai2), with increased cell mobility.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0057">The term &#x201c;differentiated progeny of epicardial cells&#x201d; may refer to any of the cells developmentally downstream of, or differentiated from, epicardial cells. Examples of differentiated progeny of most interest in the current invention are smooth muscle cells and cardiac fibroblasts, although epicardial cells may also develop into interstitial fibroblasts, mesenchymal-like cells and possibly endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes or cardiac progenitor cells. The &#x201c;differentiated progeny of epicardial cells&#x201d; may refer to any of the differentiated cells that are downstream from any of the epicardial cell populations. As described above, the inventors have determined that BNC1<sup>high </sup>or TCF21<sup>high </sup>cells can differentiate into smooth muscle cells, but only TCF21<sup>high </sup>cells in vitro have been demonstrated to differentiate into cardiac fibroblasts. The smooth muscle cells may be coronary and/or vascular.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0058">The term &#x201c;marker&#x201d; may describe a characteristic and/or phenotype of a particular cell. Markers can be used for selection and/or separation of cells comprising characteristics/phenotype of interest. Markers are characteristics, which may be morphological, structural, functional or biochemical characteristics of the cell, or molecules expressed by the cell type. Markers may be cell-surface or intracellular. Markers may be proteins. Such proteins can possess an epitope for capture agents such as antibodies, which allows for the separation of cells based on this marker. Markers may consist of any molecule found in or on a cell, including, but not limited to, proteins (peptides and polypeptides), lipids, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids. The marker may be a cell surface marker, which is preferred for the separation of the cell populations. The marker may be intracellular, such as a transcription factor. If a cell is &#x201c;positive for&#x201d; a marker this means that said marker is physically detectable above background levels on the cell using standard methods (e.g. immunofluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry methods, such as fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)), or expression of mRNA encoding the marker is detectable above background levels using standard techniques (e.g. RT-PCR). The expression level of a marker may be compared to the expression level obtained from a negative control (cells known to lack the marker). If a cell is &#x201c;negative for&#x201d; a marker (alternatively &#x201c;does not express&#x201d;) then a marker cannot be detected above background levels on the cell using standard techniques. Alternatively, the terms &#x201c;negative&#x201d; or &#x201c;does not express&#x201d; means that expression of the mRNA for a marker cannot be detected above background levels using techniques such as RT-PCR. The expression level of a cell surface marker or intracellular marker can be compared to the expression level obtained from a negative control. Thus, a cell that &#x201c;does not express&#x201d; a marker appears similar to the negative control with respect to that marker. Relative levels of expression can be determined in a similar fashion, by comparison to a control with a known expression level.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0059">In relation to separating in vitro-differentiated epicardial cells into sub-populations, the presence or absence of a cell surface marker can be used to distinguish the two populations. The cells may be separated using cell-sorting, optionally using cell surface markers that are expressed on one cell population, but not the other. Any suitable method of cell sorting is envisioned. Such methods include, but are not limited to: magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS), fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), microfluidic cell separation, or buoyancy-activated cell sorting. It is preferred that the cell sorting method relies upon a capture agent. As used herein a &#x201c;capture agent&#x201d; may be considered to be an antibody or an antibody mimetic. Optionally the capture agent may be an antibody, an antibody fragment, a derivative of an antibody, a non-antibody protein capture agent such as an affibody, an aptamer (peptide or nucleic acid) or any other antibody mimetic. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that a capture agent will be specific for a target molecule, in relation to the present invention, a marker. The use of a capture agent allows for the selective binding of cells which display said marker, and therefore allows for the cell populations to be separated and/or enriched.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0060">Within the field of cell ontogeny, the term &#x201c;differentiate/differentiating&#x201d; is relative and indicates that a &#x201c;differentiated cell&#x201d; has progressed further down the developmental pathway than its precursor. The in vitro-differentiated epicardial cells of the invention are therefore further down the developmental pathway than a pluripotent stem cell, but are still capable of further differentiation into mature cell types.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0061">An &#x201c;isolated cell&#x201d; is a cell that has been removed from an organism in which it was originally found, or a descendant of such a cell. Optionally the cell has been cultured in vitro. The cells of the invention may be isolated.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0062">As used herein, &#x201c;substantially pure,&#x201d; with respect to a particular cell population, refers to a population of cells that is at least about 75%, preferably at least about 85%, more preferably at least about 90%, and more preferably at least about 95% pure, most preferably at least 97% with respect to the cells making up a total cell population. That is, the terms &#x201c;substantially pure&#x201d; or &#x201c;essentially purified&#x201d;, with regard to a population of BNC1<sup>high </sup>or TCF21<sup>high </sup>cells, refers to a population of cells that contain fewer than about 20%, more preferably fewer than about 15%, 10%, 8%, 7%, most preferably fewer than about 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, or less than 1%, of cells that are not BNC1<sup>high </sup>or TCF21<sup>high </sup>cells, respectively.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0063">As used herein &#x201c;enriched&#x201d; may mean that the fraction of cells of one type, such as TCF21<sup>high</sup>, is increased by at least 10%, by at least 15%, by at least 20%, by at least 25%, by at least 30%, by at least 35%, by at least 40%, by at least 45%, by at least 50%, by at least 55%, by at least 60%, by at least 65%, by at least 70%, or by at least 75%, over the fraction of cells of that type in a starting preparation.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0064">Thus a TCF21<sup>high </sup>enriched population may be at least 40%, by at least 45%, by at least 50%, by at least 55%, by at least 60%, by at least 65%, by at least 70%, or by at least 75%, or by at least 80%, or at least 90% or 95% of the cells in the mixture. The rest of the mixture may comprise BNC1<sup>high </sup>cells, human cardiomyocytes, or both.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0065">Conversely a BNC1<sup>high </sup>enriched population may be at least 60%, by at least 65%, by at least 70%, or by at least 75%, or by at least 80%, or at least 90% or 95% of the cells in the mixture. The rest of the mixture may comprise TCF21<sup>high </sup>cells, human cardiomyocytes, or both.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0066">As used herein &#x201c;separation&#x201d; or &#x201c;selection&#x201d; refers to isolating different cell types (notably BNC1<sup>high </sup>or TCF21<sup>high </sup>cells) into one or more populations and collecting the isolated population as a target cell population which is enriched, for example, in a specific target cell. This can be performed using positive selection, where a target enriched cell population is retained, or negative selection, whereby non-target cell types are discarded.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0067">The cells of the invention may be used to treat conditions involved in cardiac repair. As used herein &#x201c;treating/treatment&#x201d; includes reducing or alleviating at least one adverse effect or symptom of a condition, disease or disorder. Treatment may involve administering to a subject an effective amount of a composition, e.g., an effective amount of a cell therapy composition comprising a population of BNC1<sup>high </sup>or TCF21<sup>high </sup>cells or a mixture thereof. &#x201c;Treatment&#x201d; of a cardiac disorder, a cardiac disease, or a cardiac injury (e.g., myocardial infarction) may be a therapeutic intervention that enhances cardiac function or improves the function of the heart.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0068">In one aspect, the in vitro-differentiated epicardial cells and mixtures thereof, optionally together with cardiomyocytes described herein can be admixed with or grown in or on a preparation that provides a scaffold to support the cells. Such a scaffold can provide a physical advantage in securing the cells in a given location, e.g., after implantation, as well as a biochemical advantage in providing, for example, extracellular cues for the further maturation or, e.g., maintenance of phenotype until the cells are established. Biocompatible synthetic, natural, as well as semi-synthetic polymers, can be used for synthesising polymeric particles that can be used as a scaffold material. In general, for the practice of the methods described herein, it is preferable that a scaffold biodegrades such that the cardiomyocytes and/or epicardial cells can be isolated from the polymer prior to implantation or such that the scaffold degrades over time in a subject and does not require removal. Thus, in one embodiment, the scaffold provides a temporary structure for growth and/or delivery of the cells of the invention or mixtures thereof (optionally with cardiomyocytes) to a subject in need thereof.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0069">In some embodiments, the scaffold permits human cells to be grown in a shape suitable for transplantation or administration into a subject in need thereof, thereby permitting removal of the scaffold prior to implantation and reducing the risk of rejection or allergic response initiated by the scaffold itself.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0070">Preferably the first population (TCF21<sup>high</sup>) of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells expresses at least 5, at least 8, at least 10 times more transcription factor 21 than basonuclin 1.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0071">Preferably the second population (BCN1<sup>high</sup>) of in vitro-differentiated human epicardial cells expresses at least 5, at least 8, at least 10 times more basonuclin 1 than transcription factor 21.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0072">The cell sorting method may preferably be magnetic-activated cell sorting and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, which are both well-known methods of separating cells for the skilled person in the art. Briefly, in magnetic-activated cell sorting, the cells are treated with magnetic nanoparticles conjugated to antibodies which target specific cell surface proteins. The treated cells are then passed through a column subject to a magnetic field and the cells comprising the specific cell surface proteins are retained in the column and hence are separated from those cells which simply pass through the column. In fluorescence-activated cell sorting, the cells are treated with a fluorescent moiety conjugated to an antibody which targets specific cell surface proteins. The treated cells are entrained in droplets which are then charged with a positive or negative charge depending on whether the cell fluoresces or not. Electrostatic deflection apparatus then diverts each cell into separate pots depending on the charge. Both methods rely on an antibody which targets specific cell surface proteins.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0073">Preferably the cell surface protein marker for the first population (TCF21<sup>high</sup>) of in vitro-differentiated epicardial cells is selected from the group consisting of THY1, SIPR3, PDGFRA, BAMBI, PLD3, ADAM12, TGFBR3, STRA6, SLC12A8, BEST1, SMIM3, NRP1, ITGA1, TEK, IGDCC4, CD99, ABCA1, CD9, NDRG2, IFITM1 and ACVR2A.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0074">Most preferably the cell surface marker for the first population (TCF21<sup>high</sup>) of in vitro-differentiated epicardial cells is THY1. This marker is highly expressed, optionally about at least 5, at least 8, at least 10 times higher, or 13 times higher, when compared to the second population (BNC1<sup>high</sup>) of in vitro-differentiated epicardial cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>). Thus, THY1 is a useful marker for TCF21<sup>high </sup>cells. Cells may be separated by using a capture agent specific for THY1, such as an antibody. As used in the Examples, the antibody is preferably a mouse anti-THY1 antibody clone and an anti PODXL antibody clone.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0075">The cell surface protein marker for the second population (BNC1<sup>high</sup>) of in vitro-differentiated epicardial cells is preferably selected from the group consisting of PODXL, LRP2, ITGA6, TMEM98, CDH3, CDH1, LEPROTL1, SLC34A2, PKHD1L1, AQP1, GPNMB, SLC7A7, CNTN6, CXADR, SLC4A8, PTPRF, ATP7B, ACKR3, SLC2A1, SLC16A3, OLR1, TMEM88, S100A10, CD82, PARM1, PLXNB2 and APLP2.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0076">More preferably the cell surface marker for the second population (BNC1<sup>high</sup>) of in vitro-differentiated epicardial cells is PODXL. This marker is highly expressed, optionally about at least 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 or 55 times higher, or about 53 times higher, when compared to the first population of cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>).

Preferably, more than 50, more than 60, more than 70, more than 80% of the cells in the first population of in vitro-differentiated epicardial cells differentiate forming cardiac fibroblasts.

Single-cell libraries for RNA sequencing were prepared using the Smart-seq2 protocol (Picelli et al., 2014), whereby 21 cycles were used for the cDNA library preamplification. Illumina Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit and Index Kit (Illumina Chesterford UK) was used for cDNA tagmentation and indexing. Library size and quality were checked using Agilent High-Sensitivity DNA chip with Agilent Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies Stockport UK). The pooled libraries of 96 cells were sequenced at the Babraham Institute sequencing facility on an Illumina HiSeq2500 at 100 bp per read. We used one lane per plate, resulting in 250 000 to 5 800 000 reads per sample. The quality of the raw data were assessed using FastQC [https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/] for common issues including low quality of base calling, presence of adaptors among the sequenced reads or any other overrepresented sequences, and abnormal per base nucleotide percentage. FASTQ files were mapped to the <i>H sapiens </i>genome GRCh38 using HISAT2 (Kim et al., 2015). We removed the 22 samples (over 384) for which either most of the reads (above 97%) were mapped to the ERCC spike-in, probably representing empty wells, without cells, or for which less than 80% of reads were in genes, or for which less than 2% genes were detected. This represented 2 to 13 samples per 96 wells plate. Over the remaining 362 cells, 130 were from the lateral plate mesoderm stage (hPSC-LM) and the 232 others from hPSC-epi.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0104">Preliminary analysis using Principal Component Analysis showed that a few cells were isolated, far from most of their grouped siblings. Those cells had less reads than others and a low gene count. We therefore removed 36 cells with less than 500 000 reads, and expressing less than 7 000 genes. The expression of genes was quantified using SeqMonk's RNA-Seq pipeline [https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/].

Except otherwise stated, the data from bulk cultures was produced as for the single cell libraries (see above). We sequenced the 21 libraries on two lanes.

Counts were then normalised using the rlog function of the DESeq2 R package. hPCS-epis came from two different experiments, and we found a clear batch effect, while there was none between the cells coming from two different plates sequenced on different lane. We corrected for the culture batch effect with the combat function or the sva R package.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0110">Principal Component Analysis were performed using the prcomp function of the stats R package. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) was done using the rtsne R package. Parameters were explored systematically, and the better results were obtained with a perplexity of 30, and a maximum of 2000 iterations.

Significance was set at a p-value adjusted for multiple testing of 0.01. Over-representation analyses were performed using Webgestalt and the non-redundant version of Gene Ontology Biological Process branch. The background for DESeq2-related enrichment was the list of all genes expressed in at least one cell. We retained all the terms with a p-value adjusted for multiple testing (FDR) under 0.05. The z-score for each GO term was computed as the difference between the number of genes&#x2014;annotated with this term&#x2014;upregulated in TCF21<sub>high</sub>) and those upregulated in in BNC1<sup>high </sup>divided by the square root of their sum.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0112">Network Inference</p><p id="p-0113" num="0113">Following the conclusions of the DREAMS Challenges analysis (Marbach, D., Costello, J., Kiffner, R., Vega, N., Prill, R., Camacho, D. &#x26; Allison, K. (2012) Wisdom of crowds for robust gene network inference. <i>Nature Methods</i>), we used a combination of methods based on different algorithms to infer regulatory networks. We combined the results of CLR, a mutual-information-based approach providing undirected edges, and GENIE3, a tree-based regression approach providing directed edges. Both methods were the best performers in their category at DREAMS. We applied the two methods to transcription factor gene expression coming from the bulk sequencing samples, using filtered CPM as described above. Since CLR only provides undirected edges while GENIE3 provides directed ones, the results of CLR were all mirrored with an identical score on edges in both directions. Only edges with a positive score in GENIE3's results were used. The intersect between edges present in CLR and GENIE3 results were then ranked according to the product of both algorithms' scores. This only retains edges that have either an extremely high score with one method, or consistent scores with both methods. Subnetworks were extracted using gene lists as seeds, retaining only the first neighbours above a threshold. Visualisation and analysis of the resulting networks was done using Cytoscape.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0114">Inducible Knockdown (psOPTIkd)</p><p id="p-0115" num="0115">Design and Annealing of shRNA Oligonucleotides</p><p id="p-0116" num="0116">Oligonucleotides were designed by using the TRC sequence from Sigma.

Since both antibodies suitable for the detection of TCF21 and WT1 in human cells were rabbit in origin, we were previously limited to a flow cytometry strategy in which the presence of double positive cells in the hPSC-epi was indirectly estimated Oyer et al., 2015). In the present study, we differentiated the hPSC-epi according to the protocol previously published (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). Then, we co-immunostained using an anti-TCF21 antibody plus an Alexa-568 secondary with sequential application of an anti-WT1 antibody directly conjugated to Alexa-488. This confirmed a clear heterogeneity in the hPSC-epi (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) with single- and double-positive cells. To validate the in vitro hPSC-derived model we generated explant cultures of primary epicardium from 8 week human foetal hearts; co-immunostaining revealed similar heterogeneity in the foetal explants to that observed in the hPSC-derived cells (data not shown). We then sequenced the transcriptome of the hPSC-epi at single cell resolution in order to characterize precisely the molecular cell heterogeneity of these cells and to determine its physiological regulation and functional relevance.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Example 2: scRNA-Seq Revealed WT1, TCF21 and BNC1 as Indicators of the hPSC-Epi Functional Heterogeneity</heading><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Using a Smart-Seq2 based protocol previously used to analyse mouse embryonic cells (Scialdone et al., 2016), we obtained high quality transcriptomes for a total of 232 hPSC-epi single cells. We examined the variation of TCF21 and WT1 expression in the population using scRNA-seq. As we were using a monolayer of cells obtained from a simple in vitro differentiation protocol, we expected subtle levels of heterogeneity in the sequencing data. Indeed, in a principal component analysis, the first two components only absorbed 2.5 and 2.4% of the variance respectively. Moreover, the subsequent Eigen-values were much smaller, and 195 components were needed to absorb 90% of the variance. The strongest loadings of TCF21 and WT1 were on the second component (PC2). Over-representation analyses using the 100 genes with strongest negative and positive PC2 loadings defined two different molecular signatures on the TCF21 and WT1 sides. Among the top genes on the TCF21 side (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), the strongest is coding for Fibronectin (FN1), with others coding for Thrombospondin (THBS1), THY1, CDH7, BAMBI and Adenosine receptor 2B (ADORA2B) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). On the WT1 side the strongest is coding for the Podocalyxin (PODXL), with others coding for Basonuclin (BNC1, second strongest positive loading on PC2), P-cadherin (CDH3), and E-cadherin (CDH1).</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">The distribution of expression for TCF21, WT1 and BNC1 was bimodal, with a large population of cells showing no expression at all (106, 154 and 45 cells respectively) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). It is likely that some of those &#x201c;zeroes&#x201d; are dropouts. However, the location of those cells on the PCA plot suggest that they are not randomly distributed and most of them, at least when it comes to TCF21 and BNC1 expression, reflect true subpopulations. Twenty-seven cells (12%) expressed all three markers. Colouring the PCA plot with TCF21, WT1 and BNC1 expression clearly shows two populations segregated along PC2 (Data not shown). With a few exceptions, WT1 expressing cells form a subpopulation of BNC1 expressing cells. Cells strongly expressing BNC1 are mostly devoid of TCF21 expression. Finally, immunofluorescence detection of BNC1 and WT1 confirmed the correlation between high level of WT1 and high level of BNC1 and the inclusion of WT1<sup>+</sup> cells in the BNC1<sup>+</sup> population in the hPSC-epi (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>). Immuno-staining of foetal human heart sections at 8 weeks pc demonstrated the expression of BNC1 in the epicardium and confirmed a heterogeneous distribution of the protein (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>).

We computed the Pearson correlation of BNC1, WT1 and TCF21 expression with all the expressed and variable genes. Comparing these correlations, we observe that if the expression of a gene correlates with TCF21 expression, it does not correlate with BNC1 expression (Pearson correlation of &#x2212;0.454). On the contrary, if the expression of a gene correlates with that of WT1, it also tends to correlate with BNC1 expression (Pearson correlation of 0.293).</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example 3: The hPSC-Epi is Composed of a BNC1 and a TCF21 Population</heading><p id="p-0152" num="0151">Cell subpopulations of hPSC-epis cannot be solely based on the expression of TCF21 and BNC1 due to dropouts&#x2014;genes which expression is measured as 0 not because there is no mRNA, but because the mRNA was not reverse-transcribed &#x2014;. Instead we generated cell similarities using t-SNE, exploring different parameter values. The lowest Kullback-Leibler divergence (a measure of how well the t-SNE distances represents the actual distances in genome space) corresponded with final distributions in 3 groups of cells. We attributed cells to each group using a partition around medoid approach, resulting in three clusters of different sizes (146, 62 and 24 cells, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). The largest cluster expressed considerably more BNC1 than TCF21, the intermediate showing the opposite, while the smallest cluster comprised both types of cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). We used DESeq2 to compare gene expression between each pair of clusters. Enrichment analysis on the resulting gene sets showed that the small cluster exhibits a clear signal for mitosis). When we corrected for a cell-cycle component with the single-cell Latent Variable Model before running t-SNE and clustering, the small cluster disappeared, suggesting it was not a true sub-population. To avoid confusion, these 24 mitotic cells were omitted in further analyses.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 4: Molecular Signature of BCN1<sup>high </sup>and TCF21<sup>high </sup>Populations</heading><p id="p-0153" num="0152">Differential gene expression analysis revealed that 2494 genes were differentially expressed between the largest clusters (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>): 1454 higher in the BNC1<sup>high</sup>, cells and 1040 higher in the TCF21<sup>high </sup>ones (Data not shown).

Genes encoding Podocalyxin, E cadherin and P cadherin were also strongly enriched confirming the positive loading of PCA's component 2. In addition to 4.4 fold more TCF21 expression, the TCF21<sup>high </sup>cells showed enrichments for the markers found in the negative loading of PCA's component 2. Clustering the cells using 142 strongly expressed (base mean above 100), very significantly (adjusted p-value lower than 10&#x2032;5) and strongly (enrichment over 2 fold) enriched genes, reproduced the clustering based on the whole genome (Data not shown). This means that the most differentially expressed genes are a good representation of the whole transcriptional landscape, providing confidence that the genes significantly differentially expressed between TCF21<sup>high </sup>and BNC1<sup>high </sup>are valid markers to separate the two populations.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">The top transcription factors, plasma membrane proteins and secreted factors upregulated in BNC1<sup>high </sup>and TCF21<sup>high </sup>populations are listed in Table 1.

The most overexpressed diffusible factor in BNC1high cells was Nephronectin (NPNT). Nephronectin is the functional ligand of Integrin alpha-8/beta-1, which is overexpressed in the TCF21<sup>high </sup>population, suggesting cross-talk between the two populations.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>differentially expressed transcription factors, plasma membrane, and secreted</entry></row><row><entry>proteins (only the most significant hits with a mean expression above a given level are</entry></row><row><entry>displayed, ranked by increasing adjusted p-value).</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="105pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="98pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Upregulated in BNClhigh</entry><entry>Upregulated inTCF21high</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Transcription</entry><entry>113 (BNC1, TOX3, MEOX1,1D4,</entry><entry>67 (HOPX, ZNF469, NROB1,</entry></row><row><entry>factors</entry><entry>ID2, NFATC2, ARNT2 SMAD6,</entry><entry>TCF21, TCF19, NR4A1, TBX3,</entry></row><row><entry>(base mean &#x3e; 10)</entry><entry>MYCN, WT1, DPF3, ID1, ELF3,</entry><entry>MYBL2, KLF7, AHR, MBNL3,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>ID3, MAF, TBX18, ASH2L,</entry><entry>ETS1, ETV4, HIF1A, ZNF564,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>SOX6, ZNF415, ZNF624,</entry><entry>TSC22D3, JUNB, MLLT11,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>ZFPM2, ZNF20, CUX1, NCOR2</entry><entry>NFKBIZ, MYC, HOXA13,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>. . . )</entry><entry>HOXB9, ZNF167, CAMTA2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>. . . )</entry></row><row><entry>Plasma membrane</entry><entry>356 (PODXL, LRP2, ITGA6,</entry><entry>225 (THYl, S1PR3, PDGFRA,</entry></row><row><entry>proteins</entry><entry>TMEM98, CDH3, CDH1,</entry><entry>BAMBI, PLD3, ADAM12,</entry></row><row><entry>(base mean &#x3e; 50)</entry><entry>LEPROTL1, SLC34A2,</entry><entry>TGFBR3, STRA6, SLC12A8,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>PKHD1L1, AQP1,GPNMB,</entry><entry>BEST1, SMIM3, NRP1, ITGA1,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>SLC7A7, CNTN6, CXADR,</entry><entry>TEK, IGDCC4, CD99, ABCA1,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>SLC4A8, PTPRF, ATP7B,</entry><entry>CD9, NDRG2, IFITM1,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>ACKR3, SLC2A1, SLC16A3,</entry><entry>ACVR2A, . . . )</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>OLR1,TMEM88, S100A10,</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>CD82, PARM1, PLXNB2, APLP2</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>. . . )</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Secreted factors</entry><entry>229 (SERPINE3, SEMA3E,</entry><entry>187 (THBSI, TGFBI, FN1,</entry></row><row><entry>(base mean &#x3e; 50)</entry><entry>NPNT, EDN3, PLTP, OLFML1,</entry><entry>DKKI,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>FRZB, SEMA3C, SBSPON,</entry><entry>FREM1, IGFBP3, COL1A1,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>MFGE8, APLP2, GAS6, LAMA5,</entry><entry>MGP,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>LAMB1, COL21A1, FBN2,</entry><entry>CXCL14, SERPINE2, VCAN,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>LAMC1 . . . )</entry><entry>LUM,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>COL3A1, MFAP4, CHI3L1,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>ADAM12, COL6A2, PRSS23,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>CCL2 . . . )</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 5: Gene Ontology Analysis Predicts Different Functions for BNC1<sup>high </sup>and TCF21<sup>high </sup>Populations</heading><p id="p-0156" num="0154">Gene Ontology (GO) over-representation analyses suggested a different phenotypic signature for each population, favouring migration and muscle differentiation for BNC1<sup>high </sup>and adhesion/angiogenesis for TCF21<sup>high</sup>.

THY1 was 13 times more expressed in TCF21<sup>high </sup>cells (Table 1). Immunofluorescence confirmed that the distribution of the protein THY1 was indeed negatively-correlated with WT1 in our system (Data not shown) and to WT1 and BNC1 in primary human foetal epicardial explants (Data not shown). As THY1 had not been reported before in the epicardium, we validated its expression on cryosections of human embryonic hearts at 8 weeks pc. The immunofluorescence confirmed a heterogeneous expression of THY1 in the human developing epicardium (Data not shown). We used an anti-THY1 antibody to magnetically separate the two epicardial populations from constitutive GFP-expressing (GFP+) hPSC-epi and analyse their capacity to respond to differentiation signals. To analyse the developmental potential of each population under normal conditions, we mixed each fraction with non-fractionated GFP-negative (GFP&#x2212;) hPSC-epi cells in equal proportions and recorded the exact percentage of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells at DO by flow cytometry. The two mixes made of [unfractionated GFP-hPSC-epi and GFP<sup>+</sup> THY1<sup>+</sup>hPSC-epi] or [GFP&#x2212; hPSC-epi and GFP<sup>+</sup> THY1&#x2212; hPSC-epi] were separately cultured in differentiation medium for SMC and CF. The SMC and CF differentiation media, established previously (Iyer et al., 2015), were made of CDM supplemented with TGF&#x3b2; and PDGF-BB or VEGFB and FGF-2 respectively. When subjected to SMC differentiation, the proportion of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells remained unchanged with both THY1 fractions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, n=5). We stained the cells for two well characterised markers of the SMC lineage, calponin (CNN) and transgelin (TAGLN). Amongst the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, we quantified the % of cells positive for these SMC markers and found similar % for THY1<sup>+</sup> and THY1<sup>&#x2212;</sup> origin, indicating they all differentiated well into SMCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>). In the CF differentiation medium, the proportion of GFP+ cells remained unchanged in the culture containing the THY1<sup>+</sup> population but was reduced by more than half (19.5% against 50%) in the condition containing the THY1<sup>&#x2212;</sup> population (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, n=5). We concluded that the THY1<sup>&#x2212;</sup> hPSC-epi cells did not survive well in response to FGF-2 and VEGFB. Reviewing the molecular signature of THY1<sup>+</sup> and THY1<sup>&#x2212;</sup> populations, which coincided with the TCF21<sup>+</sup> and TCF21<sup>&#x2212;</sup> cells respectively, we noted that NRP1, one of the receptors for VEGFB, is mostly expressed in the THY1<sup>+</sup> fraction (cf Table 1), which could give an advantage to THY1<sup>+</sup> cells over the THY1<sup>&#x2212;</sup> in CF conditions.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0156">Furthermore, we immunostained the cultures for synaptotagmin 4 (SYT4) and periostin (POSTN) (Data not shown).

SYT4 has been identified in our in vitro differentiation system as up-regulated in the hPSC-epi CF compared to the hPSC-epi or hPSC-epi SMC (Data not shown). POSTN is a well-established marker of CF. To assess if the surviving GFP<sup>+</sup> hPSC-epi cells coming from the THY1<sup>&#x2212;</sup> origin could acquire a CF signature, we quantified amongst the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells, the % of SYT4 or POSTN positive cells. There were equivalent numbers of SYT4<sup>+</sup> regardless of THY1 status (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>). However only 37% of the GFP+ cells expressed POSTN with a THYT origin compared to 90% with a THY1+ origin (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>). Thus, those THY1<sup>&#x2212;</sup> cells that do survive CF conditions respond poorly to the FGF-2<sup>+</sup> VEGFB stimulus to turn into CF. Since only 40% of the THY1<sup>&#x2212;</sup> cells survived under CF differentiation conditions and only 37% of the survivors expressed POSTN, then in total only 15% of the THY1<sup>&#x2212;</sup>isolated cells acquired a CF identity versus 90% for THY1<sup>+</sup>. Given that we used positive selection to isolate the TCF21/THY1<sup>high </sup>population, it is likely that a number of TCF21/THY1<sup>low </sup>cells will have been present in the so-called THY1<sup>&#x2212;</sup> fraction; we hypothesise that the CF cells generated from the THY1<sup>&#x2212;</sup>fraction originated in fact from those TCF21/THY1<sup>low </sup>cells. Regardless, we can conclude that the THY1<sup>+</sup> hPSC-epi had a higher propensity (at least 6 times higher with the current data) to become CF than the THY1<sup>&#x2212;</sup> fraction.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 7: A Core Epicardial Transcriptional Network is Coordinated by BNC1, TCF21 and WT1</heading><p id="p-0159" num="0157">Network inference methods applied to our system positioned BNC1 as a master regulator, sitting on top of an epicardial regulatory network. To better understand the implications of BNC1, TCF21 and WT1 in the regulation of the epicardial development and function, we inferred a directed transcriptional regulatory network using a combination of methods, CLR and GENIE3, as described in the materials and methods. The variation in the system was generated by using the bulk sequencing transcriptomic data from different stages of cell development including SMC differentiated from hPSC-derived lateral plate mesoderm (pre-epicardial stage in our system), hPSC-epi, hPSC-epi-CF and hPSC-epi-SMC. We retained the top 100 predicted functional interactions between any TF and each of BNC1, TCF21 and WT1. BNC1 and TCF21 shared 3 interactors, BNC1 and WT1 shared 17 interactors, and WT1 and TCF21 shared 21 interactors. 11 TFs are interacting with the three baits. The top 100 influences involving TCF21 showed a balanced picture with 48 influences originating from TCF21, and 52 targeting TCF21, many influences being bidirectional. The image was similar for WT1. On the contrary 68% of influences involving BNC1 originated from this gene (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, Table 2), the imbalance being even more striking in the 50 strongest interactions, where only 9 influences targeted BNC1.

Heterogeneity</heading><p id="p-0161" num="0158">To investigate the function of BNC1 in hPSC-epi, we generated hPSCs which were genetically modified with tetracycline (TET)-inducible shRNA for BNC1 knock-down. The cells were treated with TET from the last day of the lateral plate mesoderm stage and during the entire differentiation to hPSC-epi. QPCR, Western-blotting and immunofluorescence showed robust BNC1 silencing under TET treatment (more than 90% by RT-PCR) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, B, C). BNC1 is necessary for epicardial heterogeneity. We measured the expression of WT1 and TCF21. WT1 was down-regulated four-fold (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>) while TCF21 was up-regulated six-fold (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>F</figref>) when the hPSC-epi was differentiated under low level of BNC1. Double-immunostaining against TCF21 and WT1 confirmed that the low-BNC1 hPSC-epi contained a majority of TCF21<sup>high </sup>cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>E</figref>). As expected there was also significant increase in THY1<sup>+</sup> cell proportions (from 35% to 63%) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>E</figref> and G).</p><p id="p-0162" num="0159">We also tested the effect of BNC1 knock-down in human foetal samples by transfecting primary epicardial cultures derived from foetuses over 10 weeks with small interfering RNA. In line with the results obtained in the hPSC-epi, the silencing of BNC1 induced a significant (p=0.02) five-fold increase in in TCF21 expression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>H</figref>, I, J).</p><p id="p-0163" num="0160">In conclusion in the absence of BNC1, the hPSC-epi behaves as a TCF21<sup>high </sup>population. Therefore, by suppressing the expression of a single transcription factor, we have modified the cell heterogeneity of the hPSC-epi. Thus we are able to generate a pure TCF21<sup>high </sup>epicardial population, without requiring sorting methods, as an important step to generate fine-tuned sub-populations of epicardial cells with more specific biological activities.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 8: Epicardial Subtype Isolation</heading><p id="p-0164" num="0161">Both the anti-THY1 antibody and anti-PODXL antibody based selection processes are improved further by the use of high stringency depleting columns. Previously, THY1<sup>low</sup>PODXL<sup>low </sup>(double-positive) epicardial cells, which express both markers at a low frequency, were present in the negatively selected cell population due to low affinity interactions with the low stringency depleting column. The use of high stringency depleting columns mitigates this, as the double-positive cells are retained in the positively selected population, producing a pure population of negatively selected cells. Where an anti-PODXL antibody is combined with a high-stringency depleting column, a pure population of PODXL-(i.e. THY1+ and TCF21<sup>high</sup>) cells, absent of antibody activation can be isolated. Where an anti-THY1 antibody is combined with a high-stringency depleting column, a pure population of THY-cells (i.e. PODXL+ and BNC1<sup>high</sup>), absent of antibody activation can be isolated.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0162"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows sorting of THY1<sup>+</sup> cells with LD column and anti-PODXL antibody. The unique specifications of LD columns, given by specific shape and matrix, result in a slower flow rate, as compared with the flow rate of LS columns. Thus, also weakly PODXL<sup>+</sup> labelled cells are retained with high efficiency and the eluate is purer in THY1<sup>+</sup> cells. With LS columns, the PODXL<sup>+</sup> weakly labelled cells do not stay in the column and contaminate the THY1<sup>+</sup> flow through fraction. These unactivated and better sorted epicardial subtypes will be used for the following experiments which were to be completed but have been delayed due to Covid 19 restrictions.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 9: To Test the Ability of the Two Specified Subpopulations to Support Endothelial Network Formation</heading><p id="p-0166" num="0163">We will seed HUVECs together with the sorted epicardial subtypes on Matrigel and measure network formation as previously reported (Bargehr et al. Stem Cells Trans Med 2016). We will also test the ability of the sorted epicardial subtypes to support angiogenesis in a chick chorioallantoic membrane assay (Bargehr et al Nature Biotech 2019).</p><p id="p-0167" num="0164">We expect that different subpopulations of epicardial cells will have different effects on endothelial network formation, survival and mural cell recruitment, showing the utility of the separation protocol for developing better cell therapy reagents.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0165">Experiment 2. To Determine the Ability of Sorted Epicardial Subtypes to Improve Cardiomyocyte Function in 3D-Engineered Heart Tissues (3D-EHT) In Vitro.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0166">Using our previously described methods (Bargehr et al Nature Biotech 2019) we will seed human pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes in a collagen gel together with epicardial cell subtypes. The constructs will be allowed to mature and then measured for contraction, Ca2+ flux, cardiomyocyte maturity and electrical integration.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-sequence-list-doc id="SEQLST-1"><sequence-list file="US20230002734A1-20230105-S00001.XML" carriers="internal-electronic" seq-file-type="ST.25"/></us-sequence-list-doc><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
