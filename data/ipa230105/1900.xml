level="1">1. Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a device and method for determining failure of a solenoid valve in a brake system. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a device and method for determining failure of a solenoid valve in a brake system for determining mechanical failure of the solenoid valve used for hydraulic control of the brake system.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Discussion of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The content described in this part simply provides background information on the present disclosure and does not constitute the prior art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, a brake system includes an anti-lock brake system (ABS) for preventing wheel slipping during braking, a brake traction control system (BTCS) for preventing slippage of driving wheels when a vehicle starts or accelerates rapidly, and an electronic stability control system (ESC) for maintaining the driving state of a vehicle stably by controlling a brake oil pressure by combining the anti-lock brake system and the traction control.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An ESC integrated brake system includes a reservoir, a pedal cylinder, a master cylinder, a motor, a wheel cylinder, a control unit, and a plurality of hydraulic control valves. A pedal displacement sensor detects a driver's brake pedal operation and drives the motor, the rotational driving force of the motor is converted into linear motion through a ball screw to advance a piston in the main master cylinder, and a braking pressure is generated in the master cylinder by the advance of the piston. Since a brake pedal operation is transmitted as an electrical signal through a pedal displacement sensor, a motor, and the like, a pedal simulator is provided as a means to provide pedal force or pedal feel to the driver, and the pedal simulator forms a hydraulic reaction force in the pedal cylinder so that the driver can feel an appropriate pedal force or pedal feel when operating the brake pedal.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The ESC integrated brake system includes a plurality of hydraulic control valves, and the valve that controls opening and closing of a flow path between the pedal cylinder and the master cylinder is always closed during braking. Accordingly, if the valve is mechanically closed and stuck due to failure, there is a problem that a backup pressure cannot be transmitted.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, the mixing valve that controls opening and closing of a flow path between a front wheel circuit and a rear wheel circuit is always open during braking. Accordingly, if the mixing valve is mechanically open and stuck due to failure, there is a problem in that the entire amount of brake oil is exhausted in a circuit leak situation, which makes braking impossible.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to at least one embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method for determining failure of a solenoid valve in a brake system, the method comprising: a first valve operation process of opening a backup valve that controls opening and closing of a flow path disposed between a master cylinder and a pedal cylinder and opening and closing a plurality of valves of the brake system excluding the backup valve in a preset manner;
