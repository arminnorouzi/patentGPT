These on-body medical devices must be detached from their users upon expiration and replaced with replacement on-body medical devices. Examples of such on-body medical devices include medicament delivery devices, such as insulin pumps, and glucose monitors, such as continuous glucose monitors (CGMs).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The switchover from an expiring on-body medical device to a replacement medical device can have some problems. For example, with insulin pumps, there may be a period of time where an expiring insulin pump has been deactivated and a replacement pump is attached to the user but not yet operative. This situation arises in part because the insulin pump has a long warm-up period after being activated before the insulin pump becomes operative. The situation also arises in part because it may take a non-negligible amount of time (e.g., approximately 20 minutes) to establish wireless communications between the replacement insulin pump and a glucose monitor. Since the replacement insulin pump relies on readings from the glucose monitor to determine what insulin doses to deliver, the replacement insulin pump is not operative until the wireless communications are established and a current blood glucose concentration reading is received from the glucose monitor. As a result, a user may not have an operative insulin pump for the period between the expiring insulin pump being deactivated and the replacement insulin pump being operative.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another example of a problem concerns on-body glucose monitors. When an expiring on-body glucose monitor is replaced by a replacement on-body glucose monitor, there is a period before the replacement on-body glucose monitor can provide accurate readings. This period is known as the &#x201c;stabilization period.&#x201d; The stabilization period typically is in the range of 60 to 120 minutes. During the stabilization period there are no accurate blood glucose concentration readings, and thus, there is no way of knowing if the user is at risk of imminent hypoglycemia during the stabilization period.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Other problems arise when an on-body medical device expires, and the user is unable to immediately replace the expired on-body medical device with a replacement device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with an inventive aspect, a method that is performed by a processor includes preparing a second on-body medicament delivery device with the processor to replace a first on-body medicament delivery device that has an expiration while the first on-body medicament delivery device is positioned on a user and is operational to deliver a medicament to the user. The preparing includes placing the second on-body medicament delivery device in a standby mode with the processor where the second on-body medicament delivery device is not operational to deliver the medicament to the user but is powered up. The preparing by the processor also includes receiving and storing data and communication information from the first on-body medicament delivery device at the second on-body medicament delivery device and priming a pump of the second on-body medicament delivery device so that the pump is ready to deliver the medicament to the user. The second on-body medicament delivery device is activated by the processor to become operational to deliver the medicament to the user based on the expiration of the first on-body medicament delivery device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The medicament may be one of insulin, glucagon or a glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 receptor agonist, for example. The medicament may include at least one of: a chemotherapeutic agent, a pain relief agent, a blood thinner agent, a hormonal agent, a pharmaceutical agent or a therapeutic agent. The received and stored data may include blood glucose history for the user and delivery history of the agent for the user. The method may include notifying the user that the second on-body medicament delivery device is ready for activating after the preparing is complete. The second on-body medicament delivery device may have a controller, and the controller may perform the placing of the second on-body medicament delivery device in a standby mode. The activating may be responsive to a received communication. The preparing may further include initiating communication set up between a sensor and the second on-body medicament delivery device at a predetermined period of time before expiration of the first on-body medicament delivery device. The sensor may be a glucose monitor for monitoring blood glucose levels of the user.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with another inventive aspect, a method is provided for preparing a second on-body sensor for use with a user while a first on-body sensor is in use. Per the method, the second on-body sensor that is attached to the user is placed in a warming-up mode while the first on-body sensor is attached to the user and is sensing an analyte or other physical characteristic. The warming-up mode prepares the second on-body sensor to be activated to sense the analyte or the other physical characteristic while attached to the user. The second on-body sensor is calibrated to accurately sense the analyte or the other physical characteristic while still in the warming up mode.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The method may include activating the second on-body sensor to begin sensing the analyte or other physical characteristic while attached to the user. The on-body sensors may include a continuous blood glucose monitor, a lactate sensor, a heart rate sensor or other type of sensor. The analyte or other sensed physical characteristic may be one of lactate, a hormone, a drug concentration, heart rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin response, respiration rate, concentration of a substance in blood of the user, or presence of a substance in the blood of the user. The method may include receiving at the second on-body sensor a reading of the analyte or of the other physical characteristic from the first on-body sensor to be used in calibrating the second on-body sensor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The calibrating may include determining a delta between the received reading of the analyte or of the other physical characteristic from the first on-body sensor and a current reading of the analyte or of the other physical characteristic read by the second on-body sensor and using the delta in the calibrating of the second on-body sensor. The first on-body sensor and the second on-body sensor may be positioned a known or pre-instructed distance apart on the user by the user, and the calibrating may be based in part upon a time it takes for a tracer solution introduced into the user to be sensed by the respective first and second on-body sensors. The calibrating may be based on the user ingesting a calibration liquid or a predetermined quantity of commercially available liquid drink and monitoring a change in blood glucose concentration with the second on-body sensor. The calibrating may include communicating with a controller device to obtain information to calibrate the second on-body sensor.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with an additional inventive aspect, an on-body medical device includes a storage for storing processor-executable instructions and a processor for executing the instructions. The processor executes the instructions to prepare a second on-body medical device to replace the first on-body delivery device while a first on-body medical device that has an expiration is positioned on a user and is operational. The prepping includes placing the second on-body medical device in a standby mode where the second on-body medical device is not fully operational but is powered up and establishing wireless communications with at least another device. The processor also executes the instructions to transition from the standby mode to an operational mode in which the on-body medical device is fully operational. The second device may refrain from being fully operational during preparation to allow the first medical device to run to expiration and to enhance the life of the second medical device, such as a sensor on the second medical device, for example.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an illustrative medicament delivery system suitable for exemplary embodiments.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a flowchart of illustrative steps that may be performed in exemplary embodiments to switchover from an expiring on-body medicament delivery device to a replacement on-body medicament delivery device.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a user with an attached expiring on-body medicament delivery device and an attached replacement on-body medicament delivery device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts a flowchart of illustrative steps that may be performed in exemplary embodiments to prepare for a switchover.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> depicts a flowchart of illustrative steps that may be performed in exemplary embodiments to prepare the replacement on-body medicament delivery device.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> depicts a flowchart of illustrative steps that may be performed in exemplary embodiments to initialize communications with the sensors.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts a flowchart of illustrative steps that may be performed in exemplary embodiments to initialize wireless communications with sensors.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> depicts a flowchart of illustrative steps that may be performed in exemplary embodiments in accordance with a first option to inform the user of expiration and activate the replacement on-body medicament delivery device.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> depicts a flowchart of illustrative steps that may be performed in exemplary embodiments in accordance with a second option to inform the user of expiration and activate the replacement on-body medicament delivery device.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref> depicts a flowchart of illustrative steps that may be performed in exemplary embodiments in accordance with a third option to inform the user of expiration and activate the replacement on-body medicament delivery device.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts a flowchart of illustrative steps that may be performed in exemplary embodiments in accordance with a first option to perform a switchover from an expiring on-body sensor to a replacement on-body sensor.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts a diagram of a user with an expiring on-body sensor and a replacement on-body sensor attached to different sides of his/her lower back.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts a flowchart of illustrative steps that may be performed in exemplary embodiments in accordance with a second option to perform a switchover from an expiring on-body sensor to a replacement on-body sensor.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> depicts a flowchart of illustrative steps that may be performed in exemplary embodiments in accordance with a third option to perform a switchover from an expiring on-body sensor to a replacement on-body sensor.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> depicts a flowchart of illustrative steps that may be performed in exemplary embodiments in accordance with a fourth option to perform a switchover from an expiring on-body sensor to a replacement on-body sensor.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The exemplary embodiments may improve the transition from expiring on-body medical devices to replacement on-body medical devices. For example, the exemplary embodiments may improve this transition for on-body medicament delivery devices, like insulin pumps. The exemplary embodiments may activate a replacement on-body medicament delivery device while an expiring on-body medicament delivery device is still attached to a user and still operative. This allows the replacement medicament device to warm up while the expiring on-body medicament delivery device is still operative. The replacement on-body medicament delivery device may receive communication information needed for communication with other devices and other data needed for operation from the expiring on-body medicament delivery device. The initialization of wireless communications with other devices may begin before expiration of the expiring on-body medicament delivery device.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As a result, the replacement on-body medicament device may be ready to begin operation at the time of expiration and/or time of removal of the expiring on-body medicament device from the user. The exemplary embodiments may reduce the down time of the replacement on-body medicament delivery device. The exemplary embodiments also may eliminate the need to replace the expiring pumps at inopportune times; rather, with the exemplary embodiments, the replacement on-body medicament device may be automatically activated without user input at the appropriate time (e.g., upon expiration of the first or expired on-body medicament device) and the expiring on-body medicament delivery device may be removed when it is convenient.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The exemplary embodiments additionally enable communications with other devices to smoothly transition to the replacement on-body medicament delivery device. Communication handoffs from the expiring on-body medicament delivery device to the replacement on-body medicament delivery device for communications with devices, such as glucose monitors, may be initiated a set period of time before the replacement occurs. This provides sufficient time so that the steps needed to realize the handoff are completed in time for the transition.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The exemplary embodiments may also facilitate a smooth transition between an expiring on-body sensor, such as a glucose monitor, and a replacement on-body sensor. In the exemplary embodiments, the replacement sensor is inserted into the user and allowed to warm up. To shorten the period of time it takes for the on-body sensor to warm up, the exemplary embodiments may provide techniques for quickly calibrating the replacement sensor so that the warm-up period may be shortened substantially. In one exemplary embodiment, the expiring on-body sensor communicates with the replacement on-body sensor to calibrate the replacement on-body sensor. In another exemplary embodiment, a management device calibrates the replacement on-body sensor. In still another exemplary embodiment, the calibration of the replacement on-body sensor entails introducing an agent into the user that has a known effect on sensed analyte levels and calibrating the replacement on-body sensor from analyte levels sensed by the replacement on-body sensor after introduction of the agent.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an illustrative medicament delivery system <b>100</b> that is suitable for delivering a medicament to a user <b>108</b> in accordance with exemplary embodiments.

Difficulties also arise with switchovers between expiring on-body sensors and replacement on-body sensors. The exemplary embodiments may eliminate these difficulties by speeding up the time for the on-body sensors to be ready for use after deployment. For example, conventional sensors or CGMs take 1 or 2 hours after being inserted into the users to be operative and providing proper readings. This is due in part to the time it takes for stabilization so that the CGM may be properly calibrated to yield accurate values.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts a flowchart <b>800</b> of illustrative steps that may be performed in the exemplary embodiments according to a first option.

At <b>1102</b>, the replacement on-body sensor <b>906</b> is attached to the user <b>108</b> at a known distance relative to the expiring on-body sensor <b>904</b>. At <b>1104</b>, A tracer solution is delivered to the user <b>108</b> such as by injection at an injection site on the user or a calibration liquid is delivered to the user <b>108</b>. The injection site is a known distance from the site of the replacement on-body sensor <b>906</b>. The tracer solution may be, for example, a sugar solution. The calibration liquid may be, for example, a fast absorbing carbohydrate drink. The quantity of the fast absorbing carbohydrate drink ingested by the user may be gauged by the weight of the user. Thus, the quantity ingested or injected is known, the expected rise in blood glucose concentration is known and the expected time for the rise in blood glucose is known based on the distance between the injection site and the sensor or the expected time for the ingested drink to result in blood glucose in the user. At <b>1106</b>, the impact of the tracer solution or the calibration liquid on the analyte level sensed by the replacement on-body sensor <b>906</b> is detected. The time it takes for the expiring on-body sensor and time it takes for the replacement on-body sensor to detect the rise in blood glucose concentration resulting from the tracer solution. These times may depend on where the on-body sensors are located. For example, an on-body sensor on the lower abdomen may detect a rise in blood glucose concentration prior to an on-body sensor or the arm. At <b>1108</b>, the detected impact is used to calibrate the replacement on-body sensor <b>906</b> relative to the known expected rise in blood glucose concentration. The difference in time of detection by the expiring on-body sensor and the replacement on-body sensor is observed and noted in calibrating the replacement on-body sensor. For example, if there is a five-minute delay in observed changes in the on-body sensors, this delay is noted and used in calibrating the replacement on-body sensor.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> depicts a flowchart <b>1200</b> of illustrative steps that may be performed in exemplary embodiments per a fourth option for the on-body sensor switchover.
