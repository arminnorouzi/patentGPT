to the technical fields of biomedicine or biopharmaceuticals, and more particularly to a nanobody targeting CAIX antigen and its application.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">CAIX is a transmembrane protein expressed in various solid tumor cells. The main function of CAIX is to maintain the homeostasis of intracellular pH under hypoxic conditions common in solid tumors. The expression of CAIX in tumor cells is considered to be a hypoxic marker protein of the tumor environment and poor prognosis of patients. Common tumor types expressing CAIX include cervical cancer, kidney cancer, brain cancer, head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, bowel cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, bladder cancer, etc. In normal tissues, CAIX is mainly expressed in epithelial cells of bile duct and small intestine, as well as gastric epithelial cells, etc. However, unlike tumor cells, CAIX expressed in normal tissues is mainly localized in the cytoplasm. Therefore, CAIX is an ideal therapeutic target for targeted therapy.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">At present, the two fastest-growing antibody drugs targeting CAIX antigen have progressed to the clinical stage. One is Girentuximab, a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody drug developed by Wilex AG, which is currently used for clinical diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma in phase III clinical trials (NCT03849118); the other one is a CAIX-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (CA9-ADC) jointly developed by Bayer AG, Morphosys and Seattle Genetics, whose clinical trial has been advanced to clinical phase I for the clinical treatment of solid tumors. In addition, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute has also developed a CAIX-targeting CAR-T therapy, which is currently in preclinical research.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It has become an urgent problem to develop an anti-CAIX nanobody with better specificity and better clinical efficacy, which can be easily produced with a reduced production cost so as to reduce the medication burden of patients.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CONTENTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The purpose of the present invention is to provide an anti-CAIX single-domain antibody and its application.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Specifically, the purpose of the present invention is to provide a single-domain antibody with good inhibitory effect on solid tumors and good specificity.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The first aspect of the present invention provides a complementarity determining region CDR region of an anti-CAIX single-domain antibody VHH chain, and the complementarity determining region CDR of the VHH chain comprises:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">CDR1 shown in SEQ ID NO.5n+1,</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">CDR2 shown in SEQ ID NO. 5n+2, and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">CDR3 shown in SEQ ID NO.5n+3;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">wherein each n is independently 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 11;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">wherein, any one of the above amino acid sequences further comprises a derivative sequence that optionally comprises an addition, deletion, modification and/or substitution of at least one amino acid, and can retain a binding affinity of CAIX.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another preferred embodiment, the CDR1, CDR2 and CDR3 are separated by framework regions FR1, FR2, FR3 and FR4.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The second aspect of the present invention provides a VHH chain of an anti-CAIX single-domain antibody, wherein the VHH chain comprises a framework region FR and the complementarity determining region CDR described in the first aspect of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another preferred embodiment, the framework region FR comprises:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">(a) a FR1 shown in SEQ ID NO.4m+71, a FR2 shown in SEQ ID NO.4m+72, a FR3 shown in SEQ ID NO.4m+73, and a FR4 shown in SEQ ID NO.4m+74;

The experimental results show that the single-domain antibodies of the present invention can specifically recognize CAIX, and can bind with high affinity to CAIX protein or CAIX-positive cells. It is easy to generate the single-domain antibody of the present invention. Thus, the present invention has been completed.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0146">Specifically, in the present invention, after immunizing alpacas with CAIX antigen, the RNA in the peripheral lymphocytes of the alpacas was extracted and inverted into cDNA to construct a yeast screening library of CAIX nanobodies. The yeast library was screened by magnetic beads and enriched by flow cytometry to obtain CAIX-specific binding antibodies. The antibody obtained from the preliminary screening was expressed and prepared, and the affinities of the CAIX antigen at the protein level and the cell level were determined, respectively, which laid the foundation for the next step of drug development.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0147">Terms</p><p id="p-0146" num="0148">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;single-domain antibody of the present invention&#x201d;, &#x201c;anti-CAIX antibody of the present invention&#x201d;, &#x201c;CAIX single-domain antibody of the present invention&#x201d;, &#x201c;anti-CAIX single-domain antibody&#x201d; have the same meaning, and can be used interchangeably, which all refer to a single-domain antibody that specifically recognizes and hinds to CAIX (including human CAIX).

Each light chain is linked to the heavy chain by a covalent disulfide bond, and the number of disulfide bonds varies between heavy chains of different immunoglobulin isotypes. Each heavy and light chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. At one end of each heavy chain is a variable region (VH) followed by a number of constant regions. Each light chain has a variable domain (VL) at one end and a constant domain at the other end; the constant domain of light chain is opposite to the first constant domain of heavy chain, and the variable domain of light chain is opposite to the variable domain of heavy chain. Particular amino acid residues form the interface between the variable regions of the light and heavy chains.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0150">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;single-domain antibody&#x201d;, &#x201c;VHH&#x201d;, &#x201c;nanobody&#x201d;, &#x201c;single domain antibody&#x201d; (sdAb, or nanobody) have the same meaning and are used interchangeably, and refers to heavy chain variable region of cloning antibody, a single-domain antibody (VHH) constructed with only one heavy chain variable region by cloning antibody heavy chain variable region, which is the smallest antigen-binding fragment with complete functions. Usually, an antibody that naturally lacks light chain and heavy chain constant region 1 (CH1) is obtained first, and then the variable region of the antibody heavy chain is cloned to construct a single-domain antibody (VHH) consisting of only one heavy chain variable region.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0151">As used herein, the term &#x201c;variable&#x201d; means that certain portions of variable regions of antibody differ in sequence, which contributes to the binding and specificity of each particular antibody for its particular antigen. However, the variability is not evenly distributed throughout the antibody variable region. It is concentrated in three segments called complementarity determining regions (CDRs) or hypervariable regions in the light and heavy chain variable regions. The more conserved parts of the variable regions are called framework regions (FRs). The variable regions of native heavy and light chains each contain four FR regions, which are roughly-folded in &#x3b2;-configuration, linked by three CDRs that form a linking loop; in some cases, a partially folded &#x3b2;-configuration could be formed. The CDRs in each chain are tightly packed together by the FR regions and together with the CDRs of the other chain form the antigen-binding site of the antibody (see Kabat et al., NIH Publ. No. 91-3242, Vol. 1, pp. 647-669 (1991)). The constant regions are not directly involved in the binding of the antibody to the antigen, but they exhibit different effector functions, such as involvement in antibody-dependent cytotoxicity of the antibody.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0152">As known to those skilled in the art, immunoconjugate and fusion expression product includes a conjugates that is formed by binding a drug, toxin, cytokine, radionuclide, enzyme and other diagnostic or therapeutic molecule to the antibody of the present invention or fragment thereof.

These CDRs form a circular structure, and the &#x3b2;-sheets formed by the FRs in between are spatially close to each other, and the CDRs on the heavy chain and the CDRs on the corresponding light chain constitute the antigen-binding site of the antibody. By comparison with the amino acid sequence of the same type of antibody, it can determine which amino acids make up the FR or CDR regions.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0160">The heavy chain variable regions of the antibodies of the present invention are of particular interest because at least some of them are involved in binding antigen. Thus, the present invention comprises those molecules having CDR-bearing antibody heavy chain variable regions, as long as their CDRs are more than 90% (preferably more than 95%, optimally more than 98%) homologous to the CDRs identified herein.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0161">The present invention comprises not only an intact antibody, but also an antibody fragment with immune activity or a fusion protein formed by the antibody with other sequences.

The polypeptide fragment, derivative or analog of the present invention may be (i) a polypeptide having a substitution of one or more conservative or non-conservative amino acid residues (preferably conservative amino acid residues), and such substitution of amino acid residues may or may not be encoded by a genetic code, or (ii) a polypeptide having one or more amino acid residues with a substituent group, or (iii) a mature polypeptide formed by the fusion of a mature polypeptide with another compound (e.g., a compound that prolongs the half-life of the polypeptide, e.g. polyethylene glycol), or (iv) a polypeptide formed by the fusion of an additional amino acid sequence to the polypeptide sequence (e.g., a fusion protein formed with a leader sequence or a secretory sequence or a sequence used to purify the polypeptide or a proprotein sequence, or with 6His-tag). These fragments, derivatives and analogs are well known to those skilled in the art in light of the teachings herein.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0163">The antibody of the present invention refers to a polypeptide comprising the above-mentioned CDR region and having the CAIX-binding activity. The term also comprises variant forms of the polypeptides comprising the above-mentioned CDR regions and having the same function as the antibody of the present invention.

Different from traditional antibodies, single-domain antibody is only composed of heavy chain, and its antigen-binding region is only a single-domain connected to the Fc region through a hinge region, and this antigen-binding region still has the ability of binding antigen after it is separated from the antibody. Single-domain antibody has the characteristics of small molecular weight and good stability. Compared with traditional common normal antibodies, they have good tissue infiltration, flexible administration methods, high degree of humanization, easy transformation to obtain recombinant proteins, and many other advantages in drug development and diagnostic reagent development.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0230">All documents mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in the present application as if each document were individually incorporated by reference.
