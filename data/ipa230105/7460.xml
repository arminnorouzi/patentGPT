These guidelines may restrict access of reduced capability user equipment to certain portions of a wireless network. The reduced capability user equipment (e.g., as defined by the 3GPP) may include user equipment that has a reduced number of receive chains (e.g., cascades of electronic components and sub-units used to receive wireless signals which may include amplifiers, filters, mixers, attenuators, and so on) than a full capability or &#x201c;baseline&#x201d; radio frequency devices). However, these guidelines or rules may lead to the network rejecting emergency-related network access requests (e.g., 911 calls, police calls) based on the number of antennas or receive chains and without first learning whether the network access request was an emergency-related network request.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A summary of certain embodiments disclosed herein is set forth below. It should be understood that these aspects are presented merely to provide the reader with a brief summary of these certain embodiments and that these aspects are not intended to limit the scope of this disclosure. Indeed, this disclosure may encompass a variety of aspects that may not be set forth below.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, a method of operating a base station may include the base station receiving a random access preamble from user equipment corresponding to a connection request. The random access preamble may include a first indication of a number of receive branches associated with the user equipment. The base station may include a second indication from the user equipment that indicates that the connection request is associated with an emergency. The base station may determine to fulfill the connection request based on the first indication and the second indication and may transmit a contention resolution response in response to determining to fulfill the connection request.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another embodiment, reduced capability user equipment may include one or more antennas coupled to a transmit branch and only one receive branch. The user equipment may include processing circuitry that transmits, using the transmit branch, a random access preamble to a base station, where the random access preamble includes a first indication of the only one receive branch and a second indication of a request for emergency-service access. The processing circuitry may also receive, using the only one receive branch, a contention resolution response from the base station to establish a connection with the base station in response to the base station accepting the request for emergency-service access.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In yet another embodiment, a base station may include a transceiver and processing circuitry that may receive, via the transceiver, a connection request from an electronic device to establish communication over a desired frequency range used by the transceiver. The processing circuitry may determine that the desired frequency range indicated in the connection request is outside of a preferred frequency range. In response to determining that the desired frequency range is outside of the preferred frequency range, the processing circuitry may determine that the connection request corresponds to an urgent service fulfillment, and in response to determining that the connection request corresponds to the urgent service fulfillment, the processing circuitry may establish communication with the electronic device over the desired frequency range.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various refinements of the features noted above may exist in relation to various aspects of the present disclosure. Further features may also be incorporated in these various aspects as well. These refinements and additional features may exist individually or in any combination.

In an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, not all features of an actual implementation are described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">When introducing elements of various embodiments of the present disclosure, the articles &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to mean that there are one or more of the elements. The terms &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having&#x201d; are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements. Additionally, it should be understood that references to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; of the present disclosure are not intended to be interpreted as excluding the existence of additional embodiments that also incorporate the recited features. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. Use of the term &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; &#x201c;near,&#x201d; &#x201c;about&#x201d;, and/or &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; should be understood to mean including close to a target (e.g., design, value, amount), such as within a margin of any suitable or contemplatable error (e.g., within 0.1% of a target, within 1% of a target, within 5% of a target, within 10% of a target, within 25% of a target, and so on).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In wireless (e.g., cellular) communication, user equipment (e.g., a cell phone, a smartphone, a tablet, a wearable device, a laptop, and so on) may communicate on a channel of a frequency band (e.g., a frequency range 1 (FR1) band (0.41 gigahertz (GHz) to 7.125 GHz) band, a frequency range 2 (FR2) band (24.25 GHz to 52.6 GHz), and so on) with a network (e.g., a wireless communication network) through one or more communication nodes (e.g., base stations). In particular, according to the current Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard, when establishing communication with the network via base station, the user equipment may detect network coverage (e.g., at a cell supported by the base station) and receive system information including a frequency of a channel from the base station. If the user equipment supports the frequency, the user equipment indicates as such to the base station, and the network may allocate the channel to the user equipment, noting that the user equipment supports a frequency band (e.g., an FR1 band, an FR2 band, and so on) that includes the frequency of the channel. When performing a handover event (e.g., transferring network coverage of the user equipment from the base station to another base station), the base station may indicate (e.g., to the other base station) that the user equipment supports the frequency band based on the user equipment indicating that it supports the frequency of the channel.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The Release 17 (Rel-17) New Radio (NR) work plan of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is considering supporting reduced capability (RedCap) devices, which would be a change from previous iterations that mandated user equipment having multiple receiver (RX) chains or branches (e.g., two RX branches, four RX branches). Indeed, a current work item (RP-210918) mandates network support for devices with one receiver (RX) chain (e.g., one antenna and one receiver), which are referred to herein as RedCap devices. In particular, Rel-17 defines the RedCap devices based on a number of RX branches of a full capability or &#x201c;baseline&#x201d; device. According to Rel-17, for frequency bands where a baseline NR device is required to be equipped with a minimum of two RX branches (e.g., FR2, certain frequency bands in FR1), a RedCap device is only required to have one RX branch. The specification also supports 2 RX branches for a RedCap UE in these bands. For frequency bands where a baseline NR device is required to be equipped with a minimum of four RX branches (e.g., certain frequency bands in FR1), the minimum number of RX branches supported by specification for a RedCap UE is 1. The specification also supports 2 RX branches for a RedCap UE in these bands. Table 1 below illustrates a comparison of device capabilities between baseline NR devices (as defined by the Release 15 NR work plan of the 3GPP) and RedCap devices as defined by Rel-17.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="126pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="98pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>FR1</entry><entry>FR2</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Baseline device</entry><entry>RedCap device</entry><entry>Baseline device</entry><entry>RedCap device</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Maximum device</entry><entry>100 MHz</entry><entry>20 MHz</entry><entry>200 MHz</entry><entry>100 MHz</entry></row><row><entry>bandwidth</entry></row><row><entry>Minimum number</entry><entry>2 or 4, depending on</entry><entry>1 or 2 for bands</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry>of device RX</entry><entry>frequency band</entry><entry>where a baseline</entry></row><row><entry>branches</entry><entry/><entry>NR device is</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>required to have 2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>1 or 2 for bands</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>where a baseline</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>NR device is</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>required to have 4</entry></row><row><entry>Maximum number</entry><entry>2 or 4, depending on</entry><entry>1 for RedCap device</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>1</entry></row><row><entry>of MIMO layers</entry><entry>frequency band</entry><entry>with 1 RX branch;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>2 for RedCap device</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>with 2 RX branches</entry></row><row><entry>Maximum downlink</entry><entry>256 QAM</entry><entry>64 QAM</entry><entry>64 QAM</entry><entry>64 QAM</entry></row><row><entry>modulation order</entry></row><row><entry>Duplex operation</entry><entry>FD-FDD, TDD</entry><entry>UE may implement</entry><entry>TDD</entry><entry>TDD</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>HD-FDD, FD-FDD,</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>TDD</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">In particular, a baseline NR device is required to support 100 megahertz (MHz) in FR1, and 200 MHz in FR2, for transmission and reception. For a RedCap device, these requirements are reduced to 20 MHz and 100 MHz, respectively. Additionally, because the number of RX branches may be related to the number of RX antennas, reducing the number of RX branches results in a reduction in the number of RX antennas and cost saving. The requirements on the minimum number of RX branches may depend on frequency bands. Some frequency bands (most of the FR1 frequency-division duplex (FDD) bands, a handful of FR1 time-division duplex (TDD) bands, and all FR2 bands) require a baseline NR device to be equipped with two RX branches, whereas some other frequency bands, mostly in the FR1 TDD bands, require the baseline NR device to be equipped with four receive branches. As previously mentioned, for the bands where a baseline NR device is required to be equipped with a minimum of two RX branches, a RedCap device is only required to have one RX branch while two RX branches is also supported. For the bands where a baseline NR device is required to be equipped with a minimum of four RX branches, a RedCap device is required to have one or two RX branches.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">Moreover, the maximum number of downlink multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) layers for a RedCap device is the same as the number of RX branches it supports. This is a reduction compared to the requirements for a baseline device. A baseline NR device is also required to support 256 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) in the downlink in FR1. For a RedCap device, the support of downlink 256 QAM is optional. For FR1 uplink and FR2, both downlink and uplink, a RedCap device is required to support 64 QAM, same as the requirement for a baseline device.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">Regarding duplex operations, a baseline NR device is required to support a full duplex (FD) operation in an FDD band (e.g., transmitting and receiving on different frequencies at the same time). A full-duplex device may incorporate a duplex filter to isolate the interference between the device's transmit and receive paths. In practice, the same device may need to support multiple FDD bands; therefore, multiple duplex filters may be needed to support the FD-FDD operation.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">For a RedCap device, the support of FD-FDD is optional (e.g., it is not required to receive in the downlink frequency while transmitting in the uplink frequency, and vice versa). Instead, the RedCap device may support half duplex FDD (HD-FDD) operation, which obviates the need for duplex filters. Instead, a switch can be used to select the transmitter or receive to connect to the antenna. As a switch is less expensive than multiple duplexers, cost savings are achieved. Furthermore, a RedCap device is expected to operate in a single band at a time and will not support carrier aggregation and dual connectivity. Thus, supporting RedCap devices through Rel-17 enables devices that have reduced material cost and complexity when compared to a baseline NR device to access network resources.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">A base station may deny user equipment access (e.g., RRC connection rejection, cell barring) to its network based on its number of RX branches, an amount of ongoing cell loading, signal quality considerations, or other network conditions occurring or anticipated to occur in response to accepting the user equipment on the network. For example, a base station may deny user equipment access to the network when the user equipment has a different number of RX branches than what is preferred.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">This denial may occur when the base station receives an indication of the number of RX branches and before the user equipment transmits an indication that it is requesting emergency-service access, such as making a 911-related emergency call, a call to a police station, a panic-button-initiated communication, or the like. Indeed, if the user equipment (UE) transmits the early indication of the number of RX branches in a random access request (MSG1), the base station may ignore the random access request from the user equipment and not transmit a random access response (MSG2), thereby causing the UE to time out and to attempt to access another base station. Furthermore, if the user equipment transmits the early indication of the number of RX branches in the random access request (MSG1) or in a request to set up a radio resource control connection (e.g., an RRCSetupRequest (MSG3)), the base station may decide to reject the RRC connection request by sending an RRCReject message in its contention resolution response (MSG4). Moreover, if the user equipment does not transmit the early indication of the number of RX branches but transmits a UE capability with the number of supported RX branches in a subsequent UECapabilityInformation RRC message, the base station may decide to release or suspend the RRC connection with the RRCRelease message, thereby causing the user equipment to enter an IDLE state and to initiate cell selection procedures, or the base station may decide to initiate a handover procedure for the user equipment with the RRCReconfiguration message. In each of the three above-examples, the base station may reject requests for emergency services that otherwise are mandated by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) guidelines for completion by the network provider when denying the request of the user equipment before receiving an indication of whether the request is for emergency-service access.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">Under FCC governance, FCC guidelines dictate how a base station is to handle a request from user equipment for emergency-service access. For example, the base station may be required to grant access to the user equipment requesting emergency-service access under FCC 47 C.F.R. Part 9, with clause 9.10 specifying requirements for commercial mobile radio services. RRC specifications further define emergency service handling operations. For example, the 38.331 technical specification (TS38.331) of 3GPP defines information elements related to when a user equipment identifies a request as being for emergency services and the 38.00 technical specification (TS38.00) defines network behavior as related to requests for emergency services. In particular, TS38.00 defines that a base station is to classify an access attempt associated with an emergency request with relatively higher priority and to reject these access attempts on in relatively extreme network load condition that may threaten base station stability itself.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">Embodiments of the present disclosure are directed toward complying with FCC guidelines for emergency-service access requests and with 3GPP standard changes to support RedCap devices and cell barring. To comply with both, the base station may deny access to the user equipment based on a preferred number of RX branches after confirming that the request from the user equipment is not for emergency-service access.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">For example, the base station may receive a first indication of whether emergency-service access is requested with a second indication of the number of RX branches from the user equipment. To do so, the first indication may indicate whether the RRC connection was established with a connection cause that may include an emergency-service access request or has a relatively elevated priority or urgency for fulfilment, such as an emergency connection cause (e.g., for emergency call subscribers), an mps-PriorityAccess connection cause (e.g., for Multimedia Priority Services subscribers), or an mcs-PriorityAccess connection cause (e.g., for Mission Critical Services subscribers). Based on these indications, the base station may grant or deny access to the network to the user equipment.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">Using these indications may be beneficial in many use cases. For example, a jogger carrying a RedCap &#x201c;smart&#x201d; watch (e.g., internet or cellular network-enabled watch) may use the watch for 5G NR network connectivity to stream music, maps, health applications, and so on, may benefit from the smart watch, which may only have one RX branch, not being denied access to a network when placing an emergency request, even if the smart watch is not communicatively coupled to a smart phone. As another example, an emergency responder (e.g., police, firefighter, medic) may request emergency-service access via a RedCap wearable (e.g., smart watch, a cellular-connected headset) in the absence of a cellular phone being nearby or connected.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">Different systems and methods may be used to improve how a base station responds to the first indication and the second indication and to reduce a likelihood that the base station prematurely denies an emergency-service access request from a reduced capability (RedCap) device. In one case, a random access preamble (MSG1) message may include the first indication indicating whether the RRC connection was established as an emergency-service access request or has a relatively elevated priority or urgency for fulfillment and the second indication of a number of RX branches, both of which may be appended to other network setup information (e.g., random access preamble information). In some cases, the first indication and the second indication may be included in a RRCSetupRequest (MSG3) message information, or in a UECapabilityInformation message. As a second example, the user equipment may transmit the first indication with the random access preamble (MSG1) and the second indication as part of an RRCSetupRequest (MSG3). In the second example, the base station may have limited responses to the random access preamble (MSG1) while awaiting arrival of the second indication in the RRCSetupRequest (MSG3), as to avoid early termination of an emergency request. As a third example, the user equipment may connect to the base station on a frequency layer that is not permitted for RedCap devices. However, the base station may permit the user equipment to use that frequency layer to make an emergency call and ignore barring in this case.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">Furthermore, as a fourth example, as the RedCap device moves from a first coverage area supported by a first base station to a second coverage area supported by a second base station, the first base station may attempt to hand network coverage of the user equipment over to the second base station. If the first base station is capable of and providing emergency services to the RedCap device, then the first base station may confirm that the second base station is also capable of providing emergency services to the RedCap device. In particular, when performing the handover procedure, the first base station may receive a system information block (SIB) from the second base station that may indicate whether the second base station supports emergency services (e.g., an ims-Emergency Support message). The first base station may handover the RedCap device to the second base station only if the second base station supports emergency services, ensuring that the RedCap device may not be disconnected from the network due to having an insufficient number of RX branches and ensuring that the RedCap device's communications receive higher priority due to their emergency nature.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">Keeping this in mind, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an electronic device <b>10</b>.

It is noted that the user equipment <b>74</b> may include any of various types of computer systems or computing devices which may communicate with the base station <b>72</b>A or the base station <b>72</b>B. Examples of the user equipment <b>74</b> are any suitable portable electronic devices, mobile telephones, smartphones, portable gaming devices, laptops, wearable devices, or the like.

The network <b>70</b> and a base station (e.g., <b>72</b>A) may implement any suitable network technology or standard, such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE) or 4th Generation (4G) cellular network through eNodeB (eNB) base stations, a New Radio (NR) or 5th Generation (5G) cellular networks through next generation NodeB (gNB) base stations, and so on.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">The network <b>70</b> may generate a schedule, including time periods to perform uplink (UL) and downlink (DL)) operations. In some embodiments, the base station <b>72</b>A may then instruct the user equipment <b>74</b> to configure its transmitter <b>52</b> and/or receiver <b>54</b> according to the schedule.

For example, the network <b>70</b>A may have frequency communication preferences, RX branch preferences, geospatial preferences, or the like, according to which the network <b>70</b>A accepts, rejects, or handovers the user equipment <b>74</b> to another network <b>70</b>. However, FCC guidelines may limit when the network <b>70</b>A may reject a request from the user equipment <b>74</b>, for example, by barring rejections of an emergency-service access request from RedCap devices. Including a first indication of whether emergency-service access is requested with a second indication of the number of RX branches in a message from the user equipment <b>74</b> may provide the network <b>70</b>A a suitable amount of information to accept or reject the user equipment <b>74</b> while complying with 3GPP standards and FCC guidelines.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">Additionally, user equipment <b>74</b> may sometimes be moved or move from a first coverage area (e.g., <b>76</b>A) supported by a first base station (e.g., <b>72</b>A) to a second coverage area (e.g., <b>76</b>B) supported by a second base station (e.g., <b>72</b>B).

Such a handover event may occur when the user equipment <b>74</b> moves between cells <b>76</b> of the respective base stations <b>72</b>, when overloading on one base station (e.g., <b>72</b>A) triggers offloading of the user equipment <b>74</b> to another base station (e.g., <b>72</b>B), or the like.

In particular, the user equipment <b>74</b> may detect the base station <b>72</b>A by receiving a radio frequency (RF) signal when the user equipment <b>74</b> enters the coverage area or cell <b>76</b>A of the base station <b>72</b>A. The RF signal may include timing alignment information, among other information. Before requesting the SIB, the user equipment <b>74</b> may synchronize to the base station <b>72</b>A by aligning its timing with the timing alignment information of the base station <b>72</b>A. The transmission of the request for the SIB may be done so in response to user input interacting with a control feature of the user equipment <b>74</b>, such as a graphical or physical button (e.g., panic button, call button) on the display <b>18</b> and/or touchscreen that, when pressed, causes the user equipment <b>74</b> to place an emergency call, and thus trigger the operations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>.

The SIB may include system information indicative of frequency subranges supported by the base station <b>72</b>A. The SIB may also indicate whether the base station <b>72</b>A is capable of processing or handling emergency-service access requests, such as whether the base station <b>72</b>A bars certain frequency ranges or types of communication requests, whether the base station <b>72</b>A has privileges or access to emergency-service frequencies or whether the base station <b>72</b>A is capable of processing emergency-service access requests with urgency relative to normal, non-emergency access requests. The system information conveyed in the SIB may additionally include timing specification, power specifications, Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates, and/or any other applicable information.

The indication of emergency may indicate to the base station <b>72</b>A that the request is for urgent or prioritized service fulfillment, and thus may itself be considered an indication of urgent service fulfillment or an indication of a status corresponding to urgent service fulfillment operations. The base station <b>72</b>A, after determining to communicate with the user equipment <b>74</b>, may advance communications related to the indication of emergency in fulfillment queues, use dedicated frequency ranges, increase channel throughput or bandwidth, reduce traffic on a channel with the user equipment <b>74</b>, or the like, to prioritize transmission of the emergency-related or high urgency request relative to normal requests, less urgent requests, or non-emergency requests. It is noted that the random access preamble (MSG1), UL scheduling information (MSG2) message, RRCSetupRequest (MSG3) message, and RRCSetup (MSG4) message may correspond to messages transmitted during a contention-based random access procedure; RRCSetupRequest (MSG3), RRCSetup message (MSG4), and RRCSetupComplete (MSG5) message may correspond to messages used as a RRC connection establishment procedure; and UECapabilityInformation (MSG7) may correspond to a UE capability transfer procedure, as may be appreciated.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">At block <b>90</b>, the base station <b>72</b>A may receive the random access preamble (MSG1) from the user equipment <b>74</b>. The indication of an emergency may include a flag, appended data, a signal, or the like included in a message (random access preamble (MSG1) in this case) to indicate that a connection request has an emergency or relatively high urgency establishment cause. Different message types or signals may be used to indicate the emergency-nature or urgency of the request. In the random access preamble (MSG1), the user equipment <b>74</b> may transmit a request for specific resources from the base station <b>72</b>A for communicating on the network <b>70</b>, the first indication, and the second indication to the base station <b>72</b>A. Thus, the random access preamble (MSG1) includes the request of a random access preamble, as well as the first indication of whether emergency-service access is requested, and the second indication of the number of RX branches in a message, wherein the number of RX branches may equal a number of antennas in the user equipment <b>74</b> (e.g., the RedCap electronic device <b>10</b>). The random access preamble (MSG1) may be considered an early warning or an early indication of desired configurations requested by the user equipment <b>74</b>. The base station <b>72</b>A may receive the early notice since the first indication indicates whether a scheduled communication from the user equipment <b>74</b> is an emergency-service access request before communication is fully established with the network <b>70</b>A.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">After receiving the random access preamble (MSG1), the base station <b>72</b>A determines compatibility between the request, network <b>70</b> preferences, and/or network <b>70</b> conditions. To elaborate, at block <b>92</b>, the base station <b>72</b>A determines whether the indications transmitted with the random access preamble (MSG1) indicate that the user equipment <b>74</b> has a reduced number of RX branches (e.g., 1 RX branch of a RedCap NR device reduced relative to 2 RX branches or 4 RX branches of a baseline NR device). The base station <b>72</b>A may compare a number of RX branches indicated by the user equipment <b>74</b> to a threshold number of RX branches (e.g., a non-reduced number of RX branches corresponding to a baseline NR device). When the base station <b>72</b>A determines that the user equipment <b>74</b> has a reduced number of RX branches (e.g., a number of RX branches less than or equal to the threshold number of RX branches), the base station <b>72</b>A may delay denying any access to the user equipment <b>74</b> and continue onto block <b>94</b>. When the base station <b>72</b>A determines that the user equipment <b>74</b> does not have a reduced number of RX branches, the base station <b>72</b>A may continue on to perform default operations, such as determining, at block <b>96</b>, whether ending a connection with the user equipment <b>74</b> is desired. This may include the base station <b>72</b>A determining whether the user equipment <b>74</b> requested via the random access preamble (MSG1) communication that meets communication preferences of the base station <b>72</b>A. When the base station <b>72</b>A determines to maintain the connection with the user equipment <b>74</b>, the base station <b>72</b>A, at block <b>98</b>, may continue to perform operations to continue establishing the connection with the user equipment <b>74</b>. However, when the base station <b>72</b>A determines to end the connection, the base station <b>72</b>A, at block <b>100</b>, may end the connection. For example, the base station <b>72</b>A may deny or hand over the user equipment <b>74</b> to another base station <b>72</b> or frequency layer compliant with the random access preamble (MSG1).

The random access preamble (MSG1) may include the indication of emergency. When an emergency is not indicated, the base station <b>72</b>A proceeds to determine, at block <b>96</b>, whether ending a connection with the user equipment <b>74</b> is desired. However, when an emergency is indicated, the base station <b>72</b>A may be barred from denying the request of the user equipment <b>74</b> and is to fulfill the request.

By doing so, the base station <b>72</b>A determines to accept the request from the user equipment <b>74</b> and may configure its resources to settings provided by the user equipment <b>74</b> in the random access preamble message. For example, the base station <b>72</b>A may configure one or more resources to the frequency subranges supported by the user equipment <b>74</b> and the base station <b>72</b>A. Once the resources are configured and a connection is established between the user equipment <b>74</b> and the base station <b>72</b>A, the base station <b>72</b>A responds with the UL scheduling information (MSG2).

In response to exchanging the RRCSetupComplete (MSG5) message, at block <b>116</b>, the base station <b>72</b>A may initiate and perform one or more access stratum security activation operation(s).

Any suitable device (e.g., a controller) that may control components of the user equipment <b>74</b>, the base station <b>72</b>A, and the terrestrial network, such as the processor <b>12</b> of each of these devices or systems, may perform the method <b>150</b>. In some embodiments, the method <b>150</b> may be implemented by executing instructions stored in a tangible, non-transitory, computer-readable medium, such as the memory <b>14</b> or storage <b>16</b>, using the processor <b>12</b>. For example, the method <b>150</b> may be performed at least in part by one or more software components, such as an operating system, one or more software applications, and the like, of the user equipment <b>74</b>, the base station <b>72</b>A and/or the base station <b>72</b>B, and the terrestrial network. In this way, the method <b>150</b> is described relative to user equipment <b>74</b> communicating with the base station <b>72</b>A, however it should be understood that these methods apply to any suitable user equipment or electronic device <b>10</b> communicating with any suitable base station <b>72</b>.

During the active communications, the base station <b>72</b>A may, at block <b>154</b>, receive an indication or determine to handover the user equipment <b>74</b>. For example, it may be desired to perform the handover when the user equipment <b>74</b> is moved outside a coverage area (<b>76</b>A), or when network conditions, such as load or current demand, change.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">The base station <b>72</b>A, at block <b>160</b>, may determine whether user equipment <b>74</b> indicated an emergency, or whether the user equipment <b>74</b> is communicating to receive emergency support. When not indicated, the base station <b>72</b>A, at block <b>162</b>, may handover the connection to the target base station (e.g., <b>72</b>B). However, when an emergency is indicated, the base station <b>72</b>A may not handover the user equipment <b>74</b> before confirming that the target base station (e.g., <b>72</b>B) supports emergency services. Thus, the base station <b>72</b>A, at block <b>164</b>, may determine whether a target base station <b>72</b>B indicates that it is able to support emergency-related or high urgency requests in its SIB. To determine this, the base station <b>72</b>A may request and receive the SIB from the target base station <b>72</b>B and determine whether data, a flag, an indication, or the like is included in the SIB to communicate its ability to handle emergency, high urgency, or high priority requests. This indication may be an ims-EmergencySupport data field.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">When the target base station <b>72</b>B does not handle emergency requests, the base station <b>72</b>A, at block <b>158</b>, may maintain the connection with the user equipment <b>74</b>. However, when the target base station <b>72</b>B does handle emergency requests, the base station <b>72</b>A, at block <b>166</b>, may handover the user equipment <b>74</b> to the target base station <b>72</b>B. The base station <b>72</b>A may transmit an indication of the emergency request to the target base station <b>72</b>B when handing over the user equipment <b>74</b> such that the indication of emergency is not lost in the handover. After the handover, the target base station <b>72</b>B fulfils the connection request of the user equipment <b>74</b> as though it was a new random access preamble (MSG1). Once fulfilled, the user equipment <b>74</b> may receive a confirmation message from the base station <b>72</b>B. The confirmation message may trigger the user equipment <b>74</b> to communicate on the network <b>70</b>B of the base station <b>72</b>B and/or to perform some of the operations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> to verify the connection with the base station <b>72</b>B. Thus, the method <b>150</b> may ensure that the user equipment <b>74</b> connecting for emergency purposes is handed over to a base station (e.g., <b>72</b>B) that can support the emergency.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">In some cases, a network provider may desire to bar RedCap devices from a certain frequency layer. The network provider may indicate such barring in the SIB for one or more corresponding base stations <b>72</b>. However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> provides a method for overriding this preference when a RedCap device places an emergency call or request, which may prevent the base station <b>72</b>A from rejecting the request to connect for emergency purposes. Indeed, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method <b>188</b> for enabling the user equipment <b>74</b> to operate on a non-preferred or barred frequency layer for emergency purposes, even if it is a RedCap device, according to embodiments of the present disclosure. Any suitable device (e.g., a controller) that may control components of the user equipment <b>74</b>, the base station <b>72</b>A, and the network <b>70</b>, such as the processor <b>12</b> of each of these devices or systems, may perform the method <b>188</b>.

While the method <b>188</b> is described using steps in a specific sequence, it should be understood that the present disclosure contemplates that the described steps may be performed in different sequences than the sequence illustrated, and certain described steps may be skipped or not performed altogether.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">At block <b>190</b>, the base station <b>72</b>A may receive an indication from the user equipment <b>74</b> to establish communication over a desired frequency range. This indication may be part of ongoing communications of the base station <b>72</b>A and the user equipment <b>74</b>. The desired frequency range may correspond to a range of frequencies used by the antenna <b>55</b> of the user equipment <b>74</b> (e.g., a RedCap device) to transmit or receive wireless signals. The desired frequency range for a RedCap device may be defined by the 3GPP standards in RP-210918 as those in the NR FR1 and/or FR2 frequency bands (e.g., as shown in Table 1 above). In some embodiments, the user equipment <b>74</b> may transmit the request in response to being disconnected from its preferred frequency layer, but has discovered or determined another frequency layer not permitted for RedCap devices with respect to the base station <b>72</b>A. For example, the user equipment <b>74</b> may transmit the request in response to being redirected to a certain frequency layer (e.g., due to load balancing). The user equipment <b>74</b> may also or alternatively transmit the request in response to being operated into a limited service mode, where the user equipment <b>74</b> may have found another cell <b>76</b> from a same or different network <b>70</b> through which it may potentially establish the connection.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">At block <b>192</b>, the base station <b>72</b>A may determine whether the desired frequency range of the user equipment <b>74</b> is within a preferred frequency range of the base station <b>72</b>A and/or of the network <b>70</b>. To do so, the base station <b>72</b>A may access its memory <b>14</b> or storage <b>16</b> to access stored indications of communication preferences of the network <b>70</b> for which the base station <b>72</b>A is to comply. The base station <b>72</b>A may compare the stored indications to the desired frequency range indicated by the user equipment <b>74</b> to determine if the desired frequency range of the user equipment <b>74</b> is compatible with the stored indications that correspond to preferences of the network <b>70</b>A.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">When the desired frequency range falls within the frequency range preferences of the network <b>70</b>, the base station <b>72</b>A, at block <b>194</b>, may establish communication with the user equipment <b>74</b> over the desired frequency range. To do so, the base station <b>72</b>A may follow some of the operations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref> (e.g., at least blocks <b>98</b>-<b>126</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). However, when the desired frequency range falls outside of the frequency range preferences of the network <b>70</b>A, then the base station <b>72</b>A, at block <b>196</b>, may determine whether an indication of an emergency been received from the user equipment <b>74</b> (e.g., as part of the random access preamble (MSG1), the RRCSetupRequest (MSG3), a RRCResumeRequest, the UECapabilityInformation (MSG7), and so on). If the indication of an emergency has been received, then the base station <b>72</b>A proceeds to fulfill the request from the user equipment <b>74</b> regardless of its frequency range preferences (e.g., as long as it is capable of fulfilling the request). And thus, operations of method <b>188</b> continue at block <b>194</b> with the base station <b>72</b>A establishing communication with the user equipment <b>74</b> over the desired frequency range of the user equipment <b>74</b>. If the indication of an emergency has not been received, then the base station <b>72</b>A, at block <b>198</b>, may determine to redirect the request of the user equipment <b>74</b> to its preferred frequency range (e.g., if the user equipment <b>74</b> is capable of communication using the preferred frequency range). Alternatively, the base station <b>72</b>A may handover the request of the user equipment <b>74</b> to another base station (e.g., <b>72</b>B) that prefers to communicate using the desired frequency range of the user equipment <b>74</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">In any of these cases, the RedCap user equipment <b>74</b> may end up on a frequency layer not permitted for RedCap devices. These barring rules on frequency layers may organize network demand and help to silo user equipment <b>74</b> with differing number of RX branches onto different frequency layers. The user equipment <b>74</b> may request connection to a frequency layer not permitted for its number of RX branches (e.g., a RedCap device trying to connect to a frequency range designated for devices with 2 RX branches), for example, when the user equipment <b>74</b> loses its preferred frequency layer and does not find another frequency layer permitted for its own number of RX branches. Alternatively, the user equipment <b>74</b> may request connection to a frequency layer not permitted for its number of RX branches when redirected by the base station <b>72</b>A to a different frequency layer, such as due to load balancing operations. Furthermore, the user equipment <b>74</b> may land on a frequency layer not permitted for its number of RX branches when operating in a limited service mode and when it attempts to connect to an incompatible base station <b>72</b>. For example, a RedCap user equipment <b>74</b> may request connection to a cell <b>76</b> that does not support RedCap devices but may still attempt to establish its emergency-related communication with the base station <b>72</b> corresponding to the cell <b>76</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">If the user equipment <b>74</b> continues to attempt to make the emergency-service access request on the barred frequency layer, the base station <b>72</b> may override the barring of the frequency layer and use the frequency layer to fulfill the emergency-service access request. As shown in block <b>198</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, if the user equipment <b>74</b> is not attempting an emergency-service access request, the user equipment <b>74</b> remains barred from the frequency layer. This may be captured as a clarification or note in the TS38.300 defining that a RedCap user equipment initiating an emergency call or transmitting an emergency-service access request may ignore the barring rules on frequency layers or in TS38.304 by defining that a cell indicating that a RedCap user equipment <b>74</b> may select any cell <b>76</b> when the RedCap user equipment <b>74</b> is to make an emergency call or emergency request. Furthermore, TS38.331 may define further procedural clarifications that a user equipment <b>74</b> may ignore cell <b>76</b> barring once transmitting an emergency-service access request (e.g., initiating an emergency call).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">It is noted that, as described above, the base station <b>72</b>A accepts or handovers the request of the user equipment <b>74</b>. However, it is also noted that when the base station <b>72</b>A deems the request of the user equipment <b>74</b> as incompatible with its preferred operations or operational configurations, the base station <b>72</b>A may deny the user equipment <b>74</b> access as long as the request was not for emergency services. The base station <b>72</b>A may deny access in several different ways. For example, at block <b>86</b>, the base station <b>72</b>A may deny access by not transmitting the UL scheduling information (MSG2). In this way, upon reception and decoding of expanded MSG1, the network may ignore the random access request by the user equipment <b>74</b> and not transmit the random access response (MSG2), thereby causing the user equipment <b>74</b> to time out and to attempt to access another cell <b>76</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the base station <b>72</b>A may deny the request by, upon reception and decoding of the expanded MSG3 RRCSetupRequest, sending an RRCReject message in its contention resolution response MSG4. Furthermore, the base station <b>72</b>A may yet reject the message after receiving and decoding the UECapabilityInformation message. Indeed, the base station <b>72</b>A may decide to release or suspend the RRC connection using a RRCRelease message, thereby causing the user equipment <b>74</b> to enter an IDLE state and to initiate cell selection procedures.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">Some of these described operations may be applied to different received messages. In this way, a first electronic device may follow operations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> with a base station <b>72</b>A while a second electronic device follows operations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> with the base station <b>72</b>A. The same applies to operations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>8</b></figref>. Furthermore, an electronic device may operate to communicate with the base station according to operations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> for a first request and according to operations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> for a later request, and vice versa. In this way, a transceiver <b>30</b> may receive a subsequent connection request from another electronic device <b>10</b> to establish communication. In response to receiving the subsequent connection request, a base station <b>72</b> may determine that the subsequent connection request does not correspond to an urgent service fulfillment (e.g., emergency request) and may redirect the subsequent connection request to the desired frequency range used by the transceiver <b>30</b>, even if an ongoing or prior communication from the electronic device <b>10</b> or a different electronic device <b>10</b> was or was not for urgent service fulfillment.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">Technical effects of the present disclosure include systems and methods to reduce or eliminate a likelihood that a base station rejects a request from a user equipment on the basis of the number of RX branches the user equipment uses before considering whether the request is for emergency-service access. Several systems and methods may improve handling of emergency requests from user equipment by a base station. In one case, the user equipment may transmit the first indication and the second indication with a random access preamble (MSG1). In another case, the user equipment may transmit the first indication with the RRCSetupRequest (MSG3) and the second indication with the random access preamble (MSG1). In a third case, the base station may transmit the first indication to a target base station when handing over the user equipment requesting emergency access as to not lose the first indication when transferring the user equipment. And, in a fourth case, a base station may fulfill an emergency request of user equipment even when the request was made on a less desired or barred frequency layer of its network. By operating in any of these ways, a likelihood of a base station outright preventing a request from user equipment for network access to an emergency service from being prematurely rejected, thereby improving network operation.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">The specific embodiments described above have been shown by way of example, and it should be understood that these embodiments may be susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms.
