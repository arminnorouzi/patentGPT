Then, in general, it takes time to transfer information, so there occurs an adverse effect that decision-making is delayed.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a specific example of the adverse effect, there is a case where a section chief may have to make an explanation to a department manager, the department manager may have to coordinate between departments, and a subordinate may have to wait for a decision. In addition, there is a case where the number of meetings increases, no matter how many meeting rooms are, there is a shortage, many meetings increase the absence time of the boss, and the subordinate may not have the opportunity to report, contact, and consult. In addition, if the subordinate is under a boss who is not good at coordinating with other departments, the subordinate may be busy with coordination between departments and may not be able to perform his/her original work.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, if the boss lacks the quality of a manager, the subordinate may be swayed by the boss's idea or may not receive appropriate work instructions. In this case, the subordinate may want to hesitate to report, contact, or consult with the boss, and may also have a dislike for the boss. The same can also be said for a case where the communication ability or the like of the subordinate is low, contrary to the boss.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, even if important items that need to be discussed quickly at the management layer are noticed, they may be delayed or concealed for the above reasons. For the right manager, problems and failure cases that occur in the company can be said to be a valuable opportunity to create improvement, but salaried workers (bosses and subordinates) who care about their positions may not report the same for the above reasons. It is a big loss for the company.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, as a method of connecting the intentions and minds of the founders and retired meritors to the future, a company philosophy, education, and the like may be exemplified but these may not be enough.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, it is assumed that smooth work execution is hindered due to language differences, time differences, and response delays due to remote locations, such as when the communication partner is a foreigner or overseas.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As a result, the efficiency at work is reduced and the attractiveness to work and organization is also reduced. In situations where communication with others is required, such as a relationship between a boss and a subordinate in a company, it is necessary to ask the other party's free time and mood because the other party is a person. At the same time, it is necessary to consider the other party's position, the other party's personality, language, time difference, whereabouts, and the like.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, there has been a need for a system that enables appropriate issuing of instructions to subordinates and communication with subordinates and improvement of relationships between subordinates, regardless of the quality of the boss and the scale of the organization.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, in private, there may be a case where there is no suitable counselor, and therefore, it is not possible to make consultations or to ask questions. Therefore, there has been a need for a system that enables appropriate consultations and questions, regardless of the environment of the questioner.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the related art, various technologies have been proposed for such problems. For example, suggested is a system in which various information, proposals, and improvement proposals obtained by all employees are utilized in collective administrative management (refer to PTL 1). However, there is no description about communication between employees and managers, and the problem of the present invention has not been solved.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">PTL 1: JP2006-209602A</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In view of the problems that it is not possible to appropriately perform issuing of instructions to subordinates, communication with subordinates and improvement of relationships between subordinates, the present invention is to use AI and big data and to execute work performed by an existing management layer (human).

The information used in AI learning, such as general information and company internal information, or information newly acquired from the outside is stored.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The general information is generally known information that may be used for responses, such as a biography, words of successful persons, a questions and answers (so-called wisdom bag), a self-development book, a specialized book, gelotology, humorology, a current-affairs material, a national language, arithmetic, science, society, English, laws and regulations, ministerial ordinances, standards such as ISO and JIS, and intellectual property information (patent, trademark, copyright and the like).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The reason to use a biography and words of successful persons is that they contain highly effective contents as responses of advice and encouragement to the inquirer. The reason to use a questions and answers (wisdom bag), a self-development book and a specialized book is that, when an inquiry is about a technical check or a check of a direction of technology improvement, they contain contents that can be advised. The reason to use gelotology and humorology is that they are effective in including an element that relaxes an inquirer. The reason to use a current-affairs material is that it is effective in making a response added with a change in the current of times. A national language, arithmetic, science, society and English are used because they are necessary in generating a response, based on basic knowledges. Laws and regulations, ministerial ordinances, standards such as ISO and JIS and intellectual property information are used because they are necessary in generating a response, based on deeper knowledges.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Note that, if all information can be randomly obtained as the general information, a possibility is assumed in which false information and even information derived from thoughts and feelings that deviate from common sense may be obtained, and as a result, common-sense determination may not be made. In addition, since it is assumed that the required information may differ depending on the use aspect and use situation of the present system, the field, type, range, and amount of required general information are preferably determined as appropriate in advance or later by a user, a manager and the like. By adopting such an aspect, it is possible to guarantee exclusion of information harmful to the determination/response generation in AI, and it is also possible to give the AI a specialty and/or a character desired by the user or the manager.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The company internal information is information of high importance level in a company, such as a company philosophy, a company culture, a company regulation, a policy, a history, a contract, a specification, a procedure manual, a story of a successive in-house successful person, customer information, management information, a business trip report of a business traveler, minutes of internal and external meetings, and employee competence information such as qualification, experience, performance record, and etc. The company philosophy is the basis for creating a company's style, in many cases. The story of a successive in-house successful person may be helpful in determining the direction of work. The customer information and the management information are information directly related to work contents of employees. The business trip report of a business traveler and the minutes of internal and external meetings are accumulated as company internal information over time. The employee competence information may be used as a reference when giving responses (advices) tailored to individual's individuality and characteristics, forming a well-balanced team, and performing personnel affairs in the right place.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Note that, in addition to being used within one company, the present invention can be assumed to be used among a plurality of companies such as joint companies and group companies.

However, responses from an AI group based on relatively small information may also be enumerated and selected.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">For example, by giving a weighting to information, such as a case where it is wanted to give a priority to an advice from Jobs' analects, it is possible to build an AI system that further meets the inquirer.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In the present embodiment, a common sense person AI, a founder AI, a Jobs AI, an Ieyasu AI, and the like are prepared as AI, and the weight of AI is changed.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The weight is 80% for the common sense person AI, 10% for the founder AI, 10% for the Jobs AI, and 0% for the Ieyasu AI (C<b>402</b>).</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">As an inquiry from the terminal, a consultation &#x201c;I am not confident in my work.&#x201d; is transmitted. The AI response unit <b>10</b> receives the inquiry (S<b>401</b>), performs phrase decomposition (S<b>402</b>) and context analysis (S<b>403</b>), and inputs the inquiry content to each AI (S<b>404</b>).</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The AI group uses the common sense person AI, the founder AI, and the Jobs AI.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Each AI outputs a response and a recommendation level (S<b>405</b>). The response from the common sense person AI is &#x201c;Let's review the contents of the work.&#x201d;, and the recommendation level is 5 out of 100. The recommendation level is a percentage of confidence with respect to the response. The recommendation level of 5 means that the confidence is low.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">The response from the founder AI is &#x201c;There was such a time for seniors.
