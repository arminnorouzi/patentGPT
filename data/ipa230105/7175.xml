id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Chinese Patent Application No. 201911209175.2, filed with the China National Intellectual Property Administration on Nov. 30, 2019 and entitled &#x201c;CAMERA MODULE AND ELECTRONIC DEVICE&#x201d;, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of this application relate to the field of photographing technologies, and in particular, to a camera module and an electronic device.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As a photographing function of a smartphone camera becomes increasingly powerful, auto focus (auto focus, AF) and an optical image stabilizer (optical image stabilizer, OIS) gradually become one of main selling points and competitive edges of the smartphone camera.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The auto focus is configured to make images of objects at different distances clear on an image sensor. A conventional camera module usually controls an optical camera lens (lens) to shift in an optical axis direction to adjust a distance between the camera lens and the image sensor, thereby implementing the auto focus.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The optical image stabilizer is configured to detect and feed back jitter of a smartphone in real time within a specific frequency and amplitude range, and perform reverse compensation on the jitter during photographing. Because the compensation is usually obtained by correcting an optical path through an optical lens (lens), compared with improving a gain by using a software algorithm, the optical image stabilizer greatly ensures a good image quality with minor loss.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Currently, a common auto focus and optical image stabilization motor of the conventional camera module is mainly a voice coil motor (voice coil motor, VCM). The voice coil motor includes a motor frame, a carrier, and five pairs of actuating members, and the carrier and the actuating members are located within the motor frame. Each pair of actuating members include  a magnet and a coil. One pair of actuating members are used as auto focus actuating members, are formed in the carrier, and are configured to actuate the camera lens to shift in the optical axis direction relative to the carrier, thereby implementing auto focus. The other four pairs of actuating members are used as optical image stabilization actuating members, and are separately located around the carrier. One of the magnet and the coil in each pair of actuating members is fastened to the carrier, and the other is fastened to the motor frame. Controlling on/off and a magnitude of a current passing through the coils of the four pairs of actuating members enables the carrier together with the camera lens to shift on a plane perpendicular to an optical axis of the camera lens. This implements optical image stabilization in a camera lens shift (lens shift) manner.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the voice coil motor shifts the camera lens, electromagnetic forces between the voice coils and the magnets are required to actuate the camera lens, the auto focus actuating members, the carrier, and the four pairs of voice coils or the four pairs of magnets fastened to the carrier to shift at the same time. Consequently, such a heavy load leads to a high power consumption of the voice coil motor.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An objective of e ribodiments of this application is to provide a camera module with a low power consumption and an electronic device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a first aspect, embodiments of this application provide a camera module. The camera module includes a module frame, a camera lens, an image sensor, and an SMA motor, where the camera lens, the image sensor, and the SMA motor are stacked within the module frame.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The camera lens is fixedly connected to the module frame. The SMA motor is located on an out-light side of the camera lens. The image sensor is located between the camera lens and the SMA motor and is fastened to the SMA motor. The SMA motor is configured to actuate the image sensor to shift in a direction parallel to an optical axis of the camera lens. The SMA motor is further configured to actuate the image sensor to shift on a plane perpendicular to the optical axis of the camera lens, and/or actuate the image sensor to rotate to tilt relative to the optical axis of the camera lens.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Compared with a conventional voice coil motor solution, this embodiment provides the camera module that implements auto focus and optical image stabilization by shifting the SMA  motor and/or rotating the image sensor. An actuation load of the SMA motor is greatly reduced, so that a power consumption of the SMA motor is reduced. Therefore, a power consumption for the camera module to implement auto focus and optical image stabilization is low. In addition, the camera module further simplifies a motor structure to miniaturize the module, and implements both auto focus and image stabilization functions by using a non-electromagnetic force principle to eliminate magnetic interference.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, due to a light convergence effect of the camera lens, compared with a conventional solution of shifting a camera lens to perform auto focus and optical image stabilization, this embodiment provides the camera module that requires a shorter compensated distance and a smaller compensated angle to actuate the image sensor to perform optical path compensation via the SMA motor. In this way, the power consumption of the SMA motor is further reduced, so that the power consumption for the camera module to implement auto focus and optical image stabilization is lower. In other words, under a same power consumption, the camera module in this embodiment has better auto focus performance and better optical image stabilization performance than the conventional solution.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">When same auto focus performance and same optical image stabilization performance are achieved, how much the compensated distance and the compensated angle of the image sensor decrease by compared with a compensated distance and a compensated angle of a conventional camera lens is related to a lens structure of the camera lens. An expected compensated distance range and an expected compensated angle range of the image sensor may be obtained by optimizing the camera lens structure, so that the camera module has better performance, for example, a lower power consumption, a higher image stabilization feedback speed, and the like.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the camera module may feed back an actual location of the image sensor during focus and image stabilization by using cable resistance of an SMA cable of the SMA motor, to implement a closed-loop control effect. Compared with a conventional solution, this embodiment needs no Hall sensor to be disposed. This simplifies a module structure and implements a better control effect.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an optional embodiment, the SMA motor includes a motor frame, a carrier, and eight SMA cables. The motor frame is fastened within the module frame, the carrier is located within the motor frame, and the image sensor is fastened to one side of the carrier facing the camera lens. The SMA cables shrink when being electrified and heated. </p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this embodiment, heat generated when the SMA cables are electrified leads to a. temperature rise of the SMA cables, so that a low-temperature martensite phase is transformed into a high-temperature austenite phase through a reverse phase transformation. The SMA cables are restored to what they were before deformation. In this way, the SMA cables shrink. When the SMA cables are not electrified and are in the low-temperature martensite phase, the SMA cables may be deformed under an external force. A length change due to shrinkage of the SMA cables is essentially caused by a transformation between material crystal phase structures, to be specific, the transformation between martensite and austenite. Gravity generated due to a crystal structure change (that is, a gap change between atoms) between microscopic particles makes a pulling force generated when the macro SMA cables shrink much greater than electromagnetic forces between common magnet coils. Therefore, the SMA cables may shrink to actuate a heavier load, that is, may implement a large load. In this way, the SMA motor can implement a large actuation force with a small size.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The SMA cables may shrink when being electrified and heated, to generate a corresponding pulling force on the carrier. The camera module may control electrical signals in the eight SMA cables, so that the eight SMA cables apply a combined force to the carrier in an expected direction. In this way, the carrier together with the image sensor is actuated to shift and/or rotate to an expected position in the expected direction, so that the camera module may implement auto focus and optical image stabilization by shifting and/or rotating the image sensor.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an optional embodiment, the eight SMA cables are disposed in pairs, and each SMA cable includes a movable end and a fixed end. The movable ends of the four pairs of SMA cables are respectively fastened to four sides of the carrier, and the fixed ends of the four pairs of SMA cables are respectively fastened to different positions of the motor frame. Two pairs of SMA cables and the other two pairs of SMA cables are symmetrically disposed relative to a first reference plane. Two pairs of SMA cables on a same side of the first reference plane are symmetrically disposed relative to a second reference plane. Two SMA cables of a same pair are symmetrically disposed relative to a third reference plane. Both the first reference plane and the second reference plane are traversed by the optical axis of the camera lens, and the third reference plane is perpendicular to the optical axis of the camera lens.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this embodiment, a position relationship among the eight SMA cables is limited, so that the camera module can control the combined force applied by the eight SMA cables to the  carrier to actuate the carrier to shift along the first reference plane, shift along the second reference plane, shift in a direction parallel to the optical axis of the camera lens, and rotate to tilt relative to the optical axis of the camera lens by controlling the electrical signals in the eight SMA cables, Therefore, the carrier has a triaxial shift degree of freedom and a rotation degree of freedom when actuated by the eight SMA cables. The carrier together with the image sensor can shift and/or rotate to any position in an XY plane within a stroke range of the carrier, to implement auto focus and optical image stabilization of the image sensor.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an optional embodiment, the carrier includes a first side, a second side, and a fourth side, where the second side and the fourth side are respectively connected to two sides of the first side. The first side and the second side are symmetrically disposed relative to the second reference plane. The first side and the fourth side are symmetrically disposed relative to the first reference plane. The third reference plane intersects with the first side, the second side, and the fourth side.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The eight SMA cables include a first SMA cable, a second SMA cable, a third SMA cable, a fourth SMA cable, a fifth SMA cable, a sixth SMA cable, a seventh SMA cable, and an eighth SMA cable. Both a movable end of the first SMA cable and a movable end of the second SMA cable are fastened to an end of the first side close to the second side, a fixed end of the first SMA cable is close to the second side relative to the movable end of the first SMA cable, and a fixed end of the second SMA cable is close to the second side relative to the movable end of the second SMA cable. The first SMA cable intersects with the second SMA cable, and the first SMA cable and the second SMA cable are symmetrically disposed relative to the third reference plane,</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The third SM.A cable and the first SMA cable are symmetrically disposed relative to the second reference plane, and the fourth SMA cable and the second SMA cable are symmetrically disposed relative to the second reference plane. The fifth SMA cable and the third SMA cable are symmetrically disposed relative to the first reference plane, and the sixth SM.A cable and the tburth SMA cable are symmetrically disposed relative to the first reference plane. The seventh SMA cable and the fifth SMA cable are symmetrically disposed relative to the second reference plane, and the eighth SMA cable and the sixth SMA cable are symmetrically disposed relative to the second reference plane.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this embodiment, one end of the SMA cable is fastened at a diagonal position of the carrier. The other end of the SMA cable is fastened at a diagonal position of the motor frame, so that the SMA cable may have a sufficient length when space in the SMA motor is limited. In this  way, the SMA cable has a sufficient amount of expansion, so that the SMA motor may have a larger actuation stroke range to lead to a better image stabilization performance of the camera mod tile,</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an optional embodiment, the SMA motor further includes a circuit board, the circuit board is located between the motor frame and the module frame, and the image sensor is electrically connected to the circuit board through a plurality of bonding wires. The bonding wires may be gold wires or the like. Each bonding wire is long. When the image sensor shifts and/or rotates together with the carrier relative to the motor frame, the image sensor shifts and/or rotates relative to the circuit board, and the bonding wires are adaptively deformed with a shift and/or rotation of the image sensor. The long bonding wires are easier to be deformed and are unlikely to break, so that the bonding wires are highly reliable, and a service life of the camera module is long.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an optional embodiment, the SMA motor further includes a circuit board, the circuit board is located between the motor frame and the module frame, the image sensor is electrically connected to the carrier through a plurality of bonding wires, and the carrier is electrically connected to the circuit board through a connecting wire. In this case, a corresponding connection circuit is formed on the carrier, and the connection circuit is used to connect the bonding wire to the connecting wire.

For example, there are eight second electric-conductors, one first electric-conductor, one conductive connecting piece, and one third electric-conductor. Each of the eight second electric-conductors is respectively connected to one end of each of the eight SMA cables, and the other end of each of the eight SMA cables is connected to the first electric-conductor and the conductive connecting piece. In this embodiment, channels of different SMA cables have different positive inputs and a same negative output, and the channels of the different SMA cables may still input different electrical signals.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The first electric-conductor, the second electric-conductor and the third electric-conductor each may have a plurality of implementation structures, including but are not limited to a conducting wire, a conductive patch, a conductive mechanical part, or the like. Each electric-conductor may be formed by electroplating, by bonding a flexible circuit board, or by embedding metal through insert molding.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an optional embodiment, the conductive connecting piece is a conducting wire, and the conductive connecting piece is connected to the circuit board. In this embodiment, the carrier is directly connected to the circuit board through the conductive connecting piece of the conducting  wire structure, so that a transmission path through the motor frame can be omitted. This simplifies a circuit structure of the SMA motor. For example, there may be one or more conducting wires.

Therefore, the SMA motor has a  small actuation load and a low power consumption.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In addition, due to a light convergence effect of the camera lens, compared with a conventional solution of shifting a camera lens to perform auto focus and optical image stabilization, this embodiment provides the camera module that requires a shorter compensated distance (that is a stroke) and a smaller compensated angle to actuate the image sensor to perform optical path compensation via the SMA motor.

The SMA motor <b>3</b> includes a motor frame <b>31</b>, a carrier <b>32</b>, and eight SMA cables <b>33</b>. The motor frame <b>31</b> is fastened within the module frame <b>1</b>. The carrier <b>32</b> is located within the motor frame <b>31</b>. The image sensor <b>4</b> is fastened to a side of the carrier <b>32</b> facing the camera lens <b>2</b>. The SMA cables <b>33</b> shrink when being electrified and heated.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The SMA cable <b>33</b> is made of a shape memory alloy (shape memory alloy. SMA) material, for example, a nickel-titanium alloy material. Shape memory alloys are a kind of metals with a shape memory effect. Generally, a metal material first has elastic deformation while being applied with an external three, and may be restored to its original shape after the external force is removed. If the external force continues to be applied, the metal material may have plastic deformation after reaching its yield point, and may not be restored to its original shape even though heated, as the plastic deformation is permanent after the external force is removed. The shape memory alloy is a kind of alloy material which can completely eliminate its deformation at a lower temperature and can be restored to its original shape after being heated. A basic working principle of a shape memory alloy material is to perform shape memory training (training) on the material by heating the material to a critical temperature and deforming the material to a specific extent. After a martensite phase is generated by cooling and then is heated to the critical temperature again, a low-temperature martensite phase is transformed into a high-temperature austenite phase through a reverse phase transformation (that is, a reverse phase change). In this way, the material is restored to what it was before deformation.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In this embodiment, heat generated when the SMA cables <b>33</b> are electrified leads to a temperature rise of the SMA cables <b>33</b>, so that the low-temperature martensite phase is transformed into the high-temperature austenite phase through a reverse phase transformation. The SMA cables are restored to what they were before deformation. In this way, the SMA cables <b>33</b> shrink. When the SMA cables <b>33</b> are not electrified and are in a low-temperature martensite phase, the SMA cables may deform under external force. A length change due to shrinkage of the SMA cables <b>33</b>  is essentially caused by a transformation between material crystal phase structures, to be specific, the transformation between martensite and austenite. Gravity generated due to a crystal structure change (that is, a gap change between atoms) between microscopic particles makes a pulling force generated when the macro SMA cables shrink <b>33</b> much greater than electromagnetic forces between common magnet coils. Therefore, the SMA cables <b>33</b> may shrink to actuate a heavier load. that is, may implement a large load. In this way, the SMA motor <b>3</b> can implement a large actuation force with a small size.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In this embodiment, the SMA cables <b>33</b> may shrink when being electrified and heated, to generate a corresponding pulling force on the carrier <b>32</b>.

Therefore, a stroke capacity of the auto focus function is associated with a stroke capacity of the optical image stabilization function.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a characteristic diagram of a stroke capacity of an auto focus function and a stroke capacity of an optical image stabilization function of the SMA motor <b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, a rectangular box represents a carrier <b>32</b>, and a black dot represents a center of gravity of the carrier <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">When a maximum shrinkage rate of a single SMA cable <b>33</b> that is powered on is kept unchanged, that is, when a cable length of the SMA cable <b>33</b> that is powered off is constant, a maximum shrinkable length of the SMA cable <b>33</b> is constant. When the SMA cable <b>33</b> shrinks upon power-on, a shifting distance of the carrier <b>32</b> is proportional to a shrinkage length of the SMA cable <b>33</b>. When the maximum shrinkage rate of each SMA cable <b>33</b> is constant (that is, a driving electrical signal is constant), it is assumed that the maximum shrinkage length is L. When the center of gravity of the carrier <b>32</b> shifts for a certain distance in the vertical direction (that is, an auto focus stroke is generated, as shown in a process <b>1</b> in the figure), a part of the shrinkage length Li of the SMA cable <b>33</b> is already consumed. On this basis, if the center of gravity of the carrier <b>32</b> shifts in the horizontal direction (that is, an optical image stabilization stroke is generated, as shown in processes <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> in the figure), a remaining maximum shrinkage cable length left in the horizontal direction is L-L1. When L1 is small, L-L1 is large. When L1 is large, L-L1 is small. To be specific, when the auto focus stroke is larger, the optical image stabilization stroke is smaller, When the carrier <b>32</b> is in a power-on natural position and uses the power-on natural position as a reference surface, there is no auto focus stroke, and a corresponding optical image stabilization stroke is maximum. When the carrier <b>32</b> is at the first end or the second end, the auto focus stroke is maximum, and a corresponding optical image stabilization stroke is 0. For another example, the carrier <b>32</b> is rectangular, and an included angle between two SMA cables <b>33</b> in a same pair is less than 45&#xb0;. Therefore, for a same shrinkage length, a shrinkage length obtained through splitting in the vertical direction is greater than a shrinkage length in the horizontal direction. In other words, an auto focus stroke is greater than an optical image stabilization stroke. In this way, the auto focus stroke and the optical image stabilization stroke may coexist, with a symmetric diamond-shaped relationship shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">It can be imagined that, when the center of gravity of the carrier <b>32</b> is controlled to only  shift in the vertical direction, to not shift in the horizontal direction, the maximum shrinkage cable length is all used for shrinkage in the vertical direction. Therefore, the shift in the vertical direction may reach the maximum, that is, the auto focus stroke may reach the maximum. In other words, if there is no requirement for an optical image stabilization effect, the auto focus stroke may be maximized. Similarly, when a large auto focus stroke is not required, a larger optical image stabilization stroke (for example, a front-facing camera) may be implemented. Generally, when an included angle and a cable length of two crossed SMA cables <b>33</b> (for example, the first SMA cable <b>331</b> and the second SMA cable <b>332</b>) are determined, and a maximum shrinkage rate of the cable length is constant, a maximum auto focus stroke and a maximum optical image stabilization stroke even correspond to a specific vertical distance, that is, a specific auto focus stroke. In this case, the maximum optical image stabilization stroke is also determined.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Therefore, when the length and the included angles of the SMA cables <b>33</b> are determined, the camera module <b>10</b> may highlight an auto focus stroke capacity based on an actual requirement, to reach an auto focus stroke more than 800 &#x3bc;m, and to have an excellent auto focus performance capability, may highlight an optical image stabilization stroke, or may integrate both optical image stabilization performance and auto focus performance.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> again.

In this way, the module structure is simplified, the structure reliability is improved, the costs are reduced and the power consumption is reduced on the basis that long-focus performance, auto-focus performance, and optical image stabilization performance are achieved.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">For example, the camera module <b>10</b> further includes a prism frame <b>8</b>, the prism frame <b>8</b> is fastened to the module frame <b>1</b>, and the prism <b>7</b> is fastened to the prism frame <b>8</b>. The prism <b>7</b> is shaped as a triangular prism. Ambient light enters the prism <b>7</b> through a cathetus side <b>71</b> of the prism <b>7</b> facing the in-light hole <b>13</b>, is reflected on a hypotenuse side <b>72</b> of the prism <b>7</b>, is emitted from another cathetus side <b>73</b> of the prism <b>7</b> facing the camera lens <b>2</b> to the image sensor <b>4</b> through the camera lens <b>2</b>,</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">For example, the camera module <b>10</b> may further include an optical stop <b>14</b>. The optical stop <b>14</b> is mounted on the module frame <b>1</b> and covers the in-light hole <b>13</b>. The optical stop <b>14</b> may be used for light guiding, dust prevention, appearance decoration, and the like.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a structure of a camera module <b>10</b> in a third embodiment according to an embodiment of this application. The following mainly describes differences between this embodiment and the foregoing embodiments, and most content of this embodiment that is the same as the content of the foregoing embodiments is not described again.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In this ethbodiment, the prism <b>7</b> is directly fastened to the module frame I. The hypotenuse side <b>72</b> of the prism <b>7</b> faces both the in-light hole <b>13</b> and the camera lens <b>2</b>. After being emitted from the hypotenuse side <b>72</b> of the prism <b>7</b>, ambient light directly enters the camera lens <b>2</b>, and no longer enters the prism <b>7</b>. In this case, such a small loss of the ambient light in a transmission process helps improve imaging quality of the camera module <b>10</b>. </p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">For example, the camera module <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> may be applied to a small environment in which long-focus photographing, auto focus, and optical image stabilization are required. For example, the camera module <b>10</b> may be used as a camera module <b>10</b> of a rear-facing camera assembly <b>400</b> of an electronic device <b>1000</b>. This is not strictly limited in this application.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">The foregoing descriptions are merely specific implementations of this application, but are not intended to limit the protection scope of this application.
