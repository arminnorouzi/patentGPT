The shelf life of a typical <sup>82</sup>Sr/<sup>82</sup>Rb generator varies from 30 to 90 days. The recharge time between two successive infusions varies from 2 to 16 minutes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generator columns used in nuclear medicine are usually made of plastic. Manufacturers prefer to stay away from metallic materials as they may release cations under certain conditions. However, plastic columns are not resistant to high temperature and cannot be easily sterilized. Therefore, when using plastic column, the whole loading process must be made under sterile conditions. Another disadvantage of the plastic columns is that the high level of radiation generated by the radioisotope loaded therein may cause degradation of the plastic material resulting in yellow coloring, deformation and cracks.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There remains an outstanding need for generator columns prepared from materials that avoid the disadvantages highlighted above, and for new processes for the preparation of generator columns.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present inventors have identified multiple advantages of non-plastic columns and developed new processes for the preparation of generator columns.

The DESO Swagelok&#xae; quick connect may contain two O-rings made of Viton&#xae; rubber that tolerates high temperature including temperature for sterilization and depyrogenation.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0072">In an aspect of the invention, the ion exchange matrix material comprises inorganic or organic ion exchange matrices. A preferred ion exchange matrix comprises alpha-stannic acid, zirconium oxide, titanium oxide, aluminum oxide, or silica gel, without limitation. Preferably, the ion exchange matrix material comprises alpha-stannic acid. According to an embodiment of the invention, a combination of two or more matrices can be used to load the column.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0073">In another aspect, the amount of ion exchange matrix filled inside the generator column is from about 1 g to about 20 g, preferably from about 4 g to about 10 g, and more preferably from about 5 g to about 7 g, about 6 g&#xb1;0.2 g, or about 7 g&#xb1;0.2 g.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0074">In another aspect, prior to being loaded in the column, the ion exchange matrix is preferably washed and decanted with a buffer several times, in order to remove fines. In a preferred embodiment, the matrix is washed and decanted about seven times in a beaker. The buffer is preferably an ammonium hydroxide solution. The ammonium hydroxide solution is in a concentration of about 0.05M to 0.5M, and preferably of about 0.1M. An example of wash and decant procedure is described below in Example 1.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0075">For loading the matrix in the column, the matrix is preferably wet with the remaining buffer left in the beaker after the last decantation. According to an embodiment, the inlet port (<b>10</b>) of the column (<b>2</b>) is upwardly extended by a funnel or a filling tube (<b>18</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in order to conduct the matrix in the column. Said funnel or filling tube is preferably made of silicone.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0076">According to a preferred embodiment, a step of measuring the backpressure is performed once the column is filled with the matrix in order to verify the quality of packing of the matrix and the packing consistency between several prepared columns.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0077">In another aspect, after the ion exchange matrix is filled inside the generator column, the matrix is preferably conditioned with the elution of a &#x201c;relatively concentrated&#x201d; solution. The elution is preferably made at a slow flow rate during the conditioning step. The flow rate during the conditioning step is preferably of about 0.02-1.0 mL/hour, and preferably of about 0.5 mL/hour. The solution is preferably a buffer or an ionic solution or a solution with a basic pH. For instance, the solution can be a NH<sub>4</sub>OH/NH<sub>4</sub>Cl buffer, a solution of ammonium hydroxide, or a solution of sodium hydroxide. Preferably, the solution is &#x201c;relatively concentrated&#x201d;, i.e., between 1M and 3M, and preferably about 2M.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0078">After the conditioning step, a rinsing step is preferably performed wherein the same solution is eluted at a faster flow rate and in a more diluted concentration. For instance, If 2M sodium chloride at 0.5 mL/min is used for the conditioning step, then the rinsing step can be performed by the elution of 0.9% sodium chloride at a flow rate of 10 mL/min. The rinsing step contributes to removing fine particles from the column.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0079">In another aspect, the generator column is loaded with an ion exchange matrix, conditioned and rinsed, and then held (or stored) until being charged with the parent radioisotope.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0080">In accordance with any embodiment disclosed herein, instead of loading completely the column with the full amount of ion exchange matrix, an alternative is to load a partial amount of matrix in the column, and hold or store the column until completion. For example, the column may first be filled at about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, or 85% of the total capacity of the column. In accordance with this alternative, completion of the loading can be performed in various ways. One way is to perform the completion by loading the remaining amount of matrix until the column is completely filled, and then charging the parent radioisotope thereon. Another way for performing the completion is by charging the remaining amount of matrix with the parent radioisotope outside the column, and then loading the same in the column. After the remaining amount of ion exchange resin is added to the column, the column may be packed in accordance with the packing step. Thus, any of the generator and elution systems otherwise disclosed herein may be modified so that the column is partially filled with an ion exchange matrix that is free of parent radioisotope, then filled with an additional portion of ion exchange matrix that is pre-charged with the parent radioisotope or not, and then subjected to the loading step.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0081">For charging the parent radioisotope on the matrix that is loaded in the column, the radioisotope is preferably diluted in order to provide the desired concentration in a suitable solution. For instance, a solution of strontium-82 is prepared with 0.1N HCl and Tris buffer. The total amount of strontium is preferably diluted in a solution of 5 mL to 20 mL. Charging the solution of parent radioisotope on the matrix in the column is preferably performed by eluting a solution of parent radioisotope at a very slow flow rate, which is preferably from about 0.5 mL/h to about 5.0 mL/h. For instance, 20 mL of a solution of strontium-82 is preferably charged on the matrix in the column at a flow rate of about 1 mL/h.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0082">After the parent radioisotope is charged on the column, an elution step is preferably performed that can be embodied by an elution wherein the flow rate increases in staircase manner or in a constant manner. As an example, the staircase manner elution step can be achieved by consecutively eluting a) 120 mL of 0.9% NaCl at 1 mL/min, b) 240 mL of 0.9% NaCl at 2 mL/min, c) 240 mL of 0.9% NaCl at 6 mL/min, and d) 360 mL of 0.9% NaCl at 10 mL/min.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0083">In another aspect, provided are elution systems according to any preceding embodiment that further comprise a flow regulator that is set to provide a flow rate of about 10 mL/hour to about 1000 mL/hour, preferably 10 mL/hour to about 100 mL/hour, and more preferably 10 mL/hour to about 60 mL/hour.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0084">In another aspect, a test for generator performance is used to ensure proper column performance during the shelf life of the column.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0085">In another aspect, the generator column is subjected to periodic quality assurance tests.
