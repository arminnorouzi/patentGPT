Specifically, the present disclosure relates to compounds represented by formula (IV) and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0003">Protein kinases play an important role in human body, and widely participate in the proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, apoptosis and other processes of various cells in human body. Oncogenic forms of protein kinases are abundantly expressed in a variety of different human tumor types and are highly responsive to a number of specific kinase inhibitors. C-rosoncogenel receptortyrosinekinase (ROS1) belongs to insulin receptor superfamily, which is widely involved in cell growth, proliferation and transformation by regulating the main signal pathways such as RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT and STAT3, and may be involved in the development and maturation of organs. Abnormal expression of ROS1 kinase, such as gene point mutation, over-expression and gene fusion, can result in dysregulated kinase activity and is associated with many human cancer types.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">A ROS1 fusion kinase loses the extracellular domain, but retains the transmembrane and intracellular tyrosine kinase domains. It can be activated constitutively without ligand binding, induce tumorigenesis and drive the survival and proliferation of tumor cells by phosphorylating substrate proteins. The CD74-ROS1 gene fusion was first discovered in NSCLC patients in 2007, and more than 14 partner genes have been identified so far. ROS1 gene fusion is another clear NSCLC driver gene after EGFR mutation and ALK fusion. The positive incidence rate in East Asia is about 2 to 3%, and that in Europe and America is about 1 to 2%. In March 2016, based only on the data from 50 patients (PROFILE 1001), FDA approved Crizotinib for the treatment of ROS1 gene fusion NSCLC. The curative effect of the crizotinib is remarkable (objective response rate is 72%), but it will develop to drug resistance after about one year. Wherein, brain metastasis (up to 47%) and drug resistance mutations in ROS1 kinase (about 50 to 60%, with solvent front mutation G2032R accounting for about 40%) are proved to be the main drug resistance mechanisms of the crizotinib. For patients with brain metastasis, although the drugs Entrectinib (RXDX-101) and Lorlatinib which can enter the brain may bring further PFS benefits, it is inevitable that there will still be acquired drug resistance mutations. After the failure of first-line or second-line treatment, there will be no drug available. For patients with acquired G2032R solvent front drug resistance mutation, there are currently no marketed targeted drugs available. Among the ROS1 inhibitors under clinical research, only Repotrectinib (TPX-0005) developed by TP Therapeutics has been proven effective in patients with G2032R solvent front drug resistance mutations. However, like all other clinical ROS1 inhibitors, Repotrectinib (TPX-0005) is also a multi-kinase inhibitor, which has significant off-target side effects. In particular, Entrectinib (RXDX-101) and Repotrectinib (TPX-0005) are both strong pan-NTRK inhibitors, and both have widespread clinical side effects such as taste disorder, dizziness, paresthesia, and weight gain. These side effects may be related to the off-target caused by their strong inhibition of Trk kinase. For patients with only ROS1 gene fusion, in addition to the target-related side effects, they also need to bear additional side effects caused by off-target, which will affect the treatment effect and patient experience.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">Therefore, for the clinical treatment of NSCLC with ROS1 gene fusion, there is an urgent need for a class of selective ROS1 inhibitors with low off-target side effects, which can break through the blood-brain barrier and be effective for drug resistance mutations in the current market.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="35.22mm" wi="62.15mm" file="US20230002410A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><heading id="h-0003" level="2">Content of the Present Invention</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0006">The present disclosure provides a compound represented by formula (IV) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,</p><p id="p-0010" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="34.54mm" wi="68.41mm" file="US20230002410A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0011" num="0007">wherein,</p><p id="p-0012" num="0008">R<sub>1 </sub>is selected from H, F, Cl, Br, I, OH, NH<sub>2</sub>, CN and C<sub>1-3 </sub>alkyl optionally substituted with 1, 2 or 3 R<sub>a</sub>;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0009">R<sub>2 </sub>is selected from H and C<sub>1-3 </sub>alkyl optionally substituted with 1, 2 or 3 R<sub>b</sub>;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0010">L<sub>1 </sub>is selected from &#x2014;C<sub>1-3</sub>alkyl-, &#x2014;C<sub>3-6</sub>cycloalkyl- and &#x2014;C<sub>3-6 </sub>cycloalkyl-C<sub>1-3</sub>alkyl-, and the &#x2014;C<sub>1-3 </sub>alkyl-, &#x2014;C<sub>3-6 </sub>cycloalkyl- and &#x2014;C<sub>3-6 </sub>cycloalkyl-C<sub>1-3 </sub>alkyl- are optionally substituted with 1, 2 or 3 R<sub>c</sub>;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0011">L<sub>2 </sub>is selected from &#x2014;C<sub>1-3 </sub>alkyl- and &#x2014;O&#x2014;;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0012">R<sub>a</sub>, R<sub>b </sub>and R<sub>c </sub>are each independently selected from F, Cl, Br and CH<sub>3</sub>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0013">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the R<sub>1 </sub>is selected from H, F, Cl, Br, I, OH, NH<sub>2</sub>, CN and CH<sub>3</sub>, and the CH<sub>3 </sub>is optionally substituted with 1, 2 or 3 R<sub>a</sub>, and other variables are defined in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0014">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the R<sub>1 </sub>is selected from F, and other variables are defined in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0015">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the R<sub>2 </sub>is selected from H and CH<sub>3</sub>, and other variables are defined in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0016">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the L<sub>1 </sub>is selected from &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, &#x2014;CH(CH<sub>3</sub>)CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;, -cyclopropyl-CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;
