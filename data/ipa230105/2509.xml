A host of conditions can either reduce the maximal number of alveoli or increase the rate of alveolar loss leading to respiratory insufficiency. Since the 1990s, surfactant replacement therapy and advances in neonatal intensive care has permitted the survival of increasingly premature infants who often have bronchopulmonary dysplasia and reduced peak alveolar number&#x2014;which many predict will lead to premature respiratory compromise as this population ages.<sup>1 </sup>Patients with &#x3b1;-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency presumably have a normal peak number of alveoli but un-opposed proteolytic activity accelerates alveolar loss and leads to emphysema in the 4th and 5th decades of life. A subset of smokers will develop COPD with emphysema being a major element of this disease, and a subset of these patients will experience rapidly progressive emphysema despite smoking cessation.<sup>2 </sup>In these and other clinical situations, the ability to halt or slow progressive airspace destruction could substantially improve respiratory quality of life. Thus, there is a need for compositions and/or methods for addressing one or more of the aforementioned needs in the art.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Disclosed herein are compositions and methods for the treatment of one or more progressive lung diseases, which may include, but are not limited to, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and AAT deficient lung disease.

With the exception of &#x3b1; 1-antitrypsin (AAT) replacement therapy there are no disease modifying therapies for progressive emphysema. Applicant has previously reported that alveolar type 2 (AT2)-cell synthesized CELA1 is neutralized by AAT and that CELA1 is necessary for emphysema in AAT-deficiency. Here, Applicant has used mouse models and human tissues to show that CELA1 is required for progressive emphysema. In mice, lung injury was induced with tracheal porcine pancreatic elastase. Cela1 began increasing at 21-days, and Cela1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice were protected from continued airspace enlargement at 42 and 84 days (p&#x3c;0.01). Aged Cela1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice had less airspace simplification than aged WT mice (p&#x3c;0.05). In humans and mice, CELA1 mRNA and protein were present in subsets of conducing airway epithelial and AT2 cells. COPD lungs had 3-fold more CELA1 protein than control (p&#x3c;0.05). Among COPD-associated proteases, only CELA1 was positively and significantly correlated with lung elastolytic activity (p&#x3c;0.001). Rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal anti-CELA1 antibodies inhibited elastolytic activity of CELA1 mRNA-high but not CELA1 mRNA-low human lungs. CELA1 mRNA levels increased exponentially with age, and smoking reduced that ratio of AAT-neutralized:native CELA1 (p&#x3c;0.05). CELA1 binding to lung tissue increased 6-fold with biaxial strain (p&#x3c;0.05). It is proposed that CELA1 predisposes to progressive emphysema via (1) increased expression with age, (2) reduced AAT neutralization with smoking, and (3) increased CELA1-binding to lung matrix with strain. Thus, it is believed that anti-CELA1 therapies may provide a novel disease modifying therapy to prevent emphysema progression.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Applicant has found that Chymotrypsin-like Elastase 1 (CELA1) is responsible for progressive airspace destruction in multiple mouse emphysema models, have shown that human lung CELA1 expression and binding to lung matrix are associated with known emphysema risk factors, and have demonstrated that anti-CELA1 antibodies largely inhibit lung elastolytic activity in CELA1 mRNA-high lung specimens.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Disclosed herein are compositions and methods for the treatment of progressive lung disease.

Elastic fiber destruction is a hallmark of emphysematous disease, and a host of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and serine proteases have been implicated in different emphysematous disorders.<sup>4 </sup>With the possible exception of AAT replacement therapy in AAT-deficient emphysema, targeted protease inhibition strategies in humans have failed.<sup>5 </sup>Applicant tested the role of a novel serine protease, Chymotrypsin-like Elastase 1 (CELA1) in emphysema. Here, Applicant has established that CELA1 is developmentally regulated, reduces postnatal lung compliance and is required for emphysema in a murine model of AAT-deficiency.<sup>6,7 </sup>Applicant has found that, unlike other emphysema-related proteases, CELA1 plays no role in early lung injury, but rather, is believed to be responsible for progressive airspace destruction after injury and in the normal alveolar loss associated with aging. Applicant has found that CELA1 mRNA levels correlate strongly with the proteolytic state of the human lung and that the elastolytic activity of CELA1-high lung can be reduced with anti-CELA1 antibodies. Applicant has further found that CELA1 can account for the age, smoking and preceding-injury risk factors of emphysema in that its mRNA levels increase with age, its neutralization by AAT is reduced with smoking, and its binding to lung matrix is increased with strain.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Late Increase in Cela1 After Lung Injury</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Applicant assessed Cela1 expression in the murine tracheal PPE model of emphysema. Increased Cela1 mRNA was noted in several specimens in the days after PPE, but it was significantly increased at 42 and 84 days post-PPE with median values 2.7 and 2-fold increased respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, panel A). Proximity ligation in situ hybridization (PLISH) for Cela1 mRNA demonstrated very few positive cells in PBS-treated lung (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, panel B), rare clusters of expressing cells at 3 days post-PPE (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, panel C), and substantially increased numbers of Cela1-expressing cells in a subset of conducting airways at 21, 42, and 84 days (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, panel D, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). Applicant has previously shown that the &#x2dc;70 kDa Cela1 species in mouse lung was Cela1+AAT protein.<sup>7 </sup>At 1 and 3 days post-PPE Cela1+AAT protein was elevated, perhaps related to leak of serum proteins into airspaces. At 21 and 42 days, native Cela1 protein levels were increased &#x2dc;3-fold (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, panels E&#x26;F). Overall, these data show that Cela1 expression begins increasing between 3 and 6 weeks following lung injury with localization to some but not all of the conducting airways.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Cela1 Mediates Emphysema Progression in Mouse PPE Model</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Applicant assessed emphysema at 21, 42, and 84 days post-PPE in WT and Cela1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice. Cela1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> and WT mice had the same degree of airspace destruction up until 21 days, but Cela1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice were protected from the progressive airspace destruction observed in WT mice at 42 and 84 days. Consistent with reports of increased susceptibility of females to emphysema (8-10) female mice tended to have worsened emphysema, though this was not statistically significant (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). These data show that in this murine model of emphysema, Cela1 does not play an important role in early airspace injury, but Cela1 is necessary for the emphysema progression that occurs after 21 days.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Cela1 in Murine Age-related Airspace Simplification. A hallmark of aging in humans and in mice is alveolar loss and progressive airspace simplification.<sup>8 </sup>Since Cela1 appeared to be involved in late lung remodeling, Applicant evaluated the lungs of aged WT and Cela1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice. The Cela1 protein levels of young adult (8-10 weeks) and aged mouse lung (70-75 weeks) were no different (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>); however aged Cela1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> lung had 45% more soluble tropoelastin (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) and similarly increased insoluble elastin (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) with less destruction of elastin architecture (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> panels B&#x26;C). Cela1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice were largely protected from the age-related airspace simplification seen in WT mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, panels D-F). As cellular senescence is known to be important in the pathogenesis of emphysema and other lung diseases<sup>9 </sup>Applicant evaluated protein levels of p16/p19, p21, and p53. Applicant found no significant differences in the whole lung levels of these factors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). These data implicate CELA1 in the lung remodeling processes of aging.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">CELA1 in Human Emphysema</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Applicant previously demonstrated the presence of CELA1 mRNA in human lung and that a high molecular weight species of CELA1 (&#x2dc;70 kDa) was a covalent complex of Cela1 and AAT. To further evaluate CELA1 in COPD, Applicant first performed immunohistochemistry. Counting of CELA1-protein-positive cells in tile scan sections of COPD and control lung section showed 97 vs 5 CELA1-positive cells per mm<sup>2 </sup>respectively (n=3&#x26;4 respectively, p=0.01 by Welch's t-test). These cells were largely localized to conducting airways (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, panels A&#x26;B). Western blot showed increased high and low molecular weight CELA1 species in COPD lung (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>). PLISH of non-lung organ donor lung and COPD lung demonstrated scattered regions of CELA1 mRNA in the lung periphery, but subsets of conducting airways with CELA1 mRNA in epithelial cells and CELA1 protein both in these cells and in the underlying matrix (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>) Immunohistochemistry showed that peripheral CELA1-expressing cells were alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>), as Applicant demonstrated in AAT-deficient emphysema.<sup>7 </sup>The CELA1-mRNA levels of COPD specimens were greater than smokers, but some control lung specimens had elevated CELA1 mRNA levels as well (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, panel F). These protein and mRNA data show that CELA1 is present in a subset of conducing airways in human lung just as in mice and that there is generally more CELA1 in COPD lung than non-COPD lung. The clinical status of non-smoker organ donor lung makes comparison between control and COPD difficult.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">CELA1 Inhibition Reduces Lung Elastolytic Activity</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Applicant used lung specimens from 7 COPD subjects, 9 smokers without COPD, and 14 non-lung organ donors to correlate lung elastolytic, gelatinase, and protease activity with mRNA levels of proteases and anti-proteases important in emphysema. CELA1 was the only gene with mRNA levels significantly correlated with lung proteolytic activity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, panel A). Using the median CELA1 mRNA level as a cutoff, CELA1-low and high specimens had 14% and 20% inhibition of elastolytic activity respectively when incubated with rabbit serum with an additional 1% and 5% inhibition when incubated with post-CELA1 immunization rabbit serum (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, panel B). Correlating CELA1 expression with antibody-mediated inhibition, specimens with higher levels of CELA1 had greater inhibition of lung elastolytic activity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, panel C). These data show that CELA1 is an important determinant in human lung elastolytic activity and suggest the benefit of anti-CELA1 therapies.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Anti-CELA1 Monoclonal Antibodies</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Since rabbit polyclonal antibodies do not represent a viable therapy for human emphysema, applicants developed hybridomas from mice immunized against CELA1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, panel A) and tested these antibodies as was done for rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Hybridoma screening yielded twenty positive clones which were tested for inhibition of the elastolytic activity of recombinant human CELA1 with validation of the most promising clones (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, panels B&#x26;C). Hybridomas of the four clones with the greatest inhibition of CELA1 elastolytic activity were expanded and the ability of antibodies purified from the supernatants of these hybridomas tested for ability to inhibit human lung elastolytic activity. All four inhibited between 60 and 100% of lung elastolytic activity in non-smoker, smoker, and COPD lung homogenates (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, panel D). These data suggest that antibody inhibition of CELA1 can alter human lung elastolytic activity.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Genomics of Human CELA1</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">If CELA1 were important in emphysema, Applicant considered why it had not been previously identified in large COPD genomics studies.<sup>10-12 </sup>One hundred and fifteen CELA1 variants were identified in Broad Institute,<sup>13 </sup>dbGap,<sup>14 </sup>and ClinVar<sup>15 </sup>databases, but only five have allele frequencies of &#x3e;1%, and none of these were predicted loss of function mutations by SIFT and PolyPhen-2.<sup>16 </sup>The most common predicted loss-of-function mutation (51735071, AG-&#x3e;A) has an allele frequency of 0.03% with one Caucasian and one Latino homozygote reported. This conservation of CELA1 function is consistent with the invariant conservation of CELA1 in the placental mammal lineage.<sup>7 </sup>Thus, as CELA1 loss-of-function mutations are rare, they would be unlikely to have been identified as protective in population-level genomics studies.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Human Lung CELA1 Increases with Age</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Given data that Cela1 was important in age-related mouse lung remodeling, Applicant assessed CELA1 mRNA and protein levels in aged human lung. Although levels were variable, CELA1 mRNA levels increased exponentially with age and were not associated with sex or smoking status (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, panel A). Despite mRNA findings, naive CELA1 protein levels were no different in young and aged lung (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, panels B&#x26;C), but AAT-bound CELA1 tended to be less in aged lung. Since this difference appeared to be driven by smoking, Applicant compared 7 aged non-smoker lungs to 7 aged smoker lungs. Smoking reduced CELA1+AAT levels in these aged lung specimens. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). Immunofluorescence of aged human lung showed regionalization of CELA1 protein with many of these CELA1-positive cells being club cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, panel E). This data indicates that CELA1 expression increases with age and that AAT neutralization of CELA1 is reduced by smoking. Both age and smoking are risk factors for COPD and emphysema.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Binding of CELA1 to Human Lung Tissue is Enhanced by Stretch</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Applicant previously reported a stretch-inducible elastase activity in freshly sectioned mouse lungs,<sup>17 </sup>that Cela1 protein bound to these areas of activity,<sup>18 </sup>and that Cela1-deficient lung lacked stretch-inducible lung elastase, activity.<sup>7 </sup>Archived lungs from non-lung organ donors and patients with COPD were analyzed for stretch-inducible lung elastase activity using a fluorescent elastin in situ zymography substrate and for quantification of recombinant CELA1 and bovine serum albumin using a 3D-printed biaxial stretching device (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). Elastase activity, albumin binding (control) and CELA1 binding signals were normalized to tissue autofluorescence and measured as change in normalized signal divided by bidirectional strain or the time equivalent for unstretched sections (i.e. slope of a plot of signal vs strain for each section. Applicant identified no evidence of stretch-inducible lung elastase activity or increased biding of albumin to lung tissue with stretch, but there was a significant increase in the binding of CELA1 to lung tissue with stretch (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). CELA1 binding to human lung tissue is enhanced with stretch although this binding is less in COPD than healthy lung perhaps owing to fibrotic changes and/or altered stretch mechanics in end-stage COPD lung. This data in combination with Applicant's work showing that hydroxyproline cross links inhibit CELA1-mediated elastolysis<sup>7 </sup>suggest that stretching enhances the accessibility of lung elastin fibers to CELA1.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Discussion</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">It is believed that this disclosure is the first to report a role for CELA1 in lung matrix remodeling in non-AAT-deficient emphysema. Based on Applicant's findings in mouse and human lung, Applicant proposes a 3-step mechanism by which CELA1 mediates progressive airspace destruction. First, CELA1 must be expressed. The increased expression of CELA1 with age could be an important factor in both age-related airspace simplification and the increasing risk of developing COPD with aging. Second, there must be reduced neutralization of CELA1 by AAT. The reduction in AAT-bound CELA1 in aged smoker lung suggest that this might be an important mechanism for emphysema development among smokers. Third, disruption of normal lung architecture increases regional strain, enhances binding of CELA1 to lung elastin and causes additional tissue destruction. This three-step mechanism is consistent with the known COPD risk factors of age, smoking, and preceding lung injury and also explains why individuals with emphysema can experience disease progression despite smoking cessation. Applicant is unaware of any other protease or anti-protease with expression levels that change with age. AAT levels are relatively stable throughout life,<sup>19 </sup>and to the best of Applicant's knowledge, age-related changes in other emphysema-associated proteases have not been studied.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">AAT neutralizes a host of serine proteases.<sup>19 </sup>Applicant previously showed that Cela1 deficient mice were protected from emphysema in an anti-sense oligonucleotide model of AAT deficiency,<sup>7 </sup>and Applicant's associative data in humans suggests that reduced AAT levels in smokers could be a risk factor for increased CELA1 proteolytic activity. While multiple studies have shown that mutations in AAT strongly predispose to emphysema even in the absence of AAT deficiency,<sup>20 </sup>no such correlative data exists for CELA1. Given the rarity of CELA1 loss of function alleles (the most common has an allele frequency 0.03% and thus homozygous loss of function frequency would be predicted to be 0.09 per 1,000,000), it is not surprising the CELA1 should not have been identified in COPD GWAS studies. It is unclear why CELA1 should be so highly conserved since Cela1<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> mice are viable, fertile, and born at expected Mendelian ratios.<sup>7 </sup></p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The binding of CELA1 to lung matrix with strain is consistent with previous reports that pancreatic elastase binds lung elastin fibers as a vector of strain.<sup>21 </sup>Elastin degradomic data demonstrated that elastin cross-linking domains retarded CELA1-mediated elastolysis<sup>7 </sup>suggesting that mechanical perturbation of elastin fibers permits CELA1 access to previously hidden sites. The levels of strain used in Applicant's study likely exceed that in human lung physiology, but the time course of the experiment was also necessarily shorter than the years over which emphysema progresses in humans Such dynamic studies of ex vivo human lung are a novel approach to understanding human lung physiology.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Applicant's CELA1 inhibition experiment demonstrates that anti-CELA1 therapies may be used to reduce the proteolytic activity of emphysematous lung. Specimens with higher levels of CELA1 mRNA had a greater reduction in lung elastolytic activity when incubated with control rabbit serum. This likely represented greater neutralization of CELA1 by AAT in the rabbit serum. However, these same specimens had additional lung elastase inhibition after incubation with serum from rabbits immunized with CELA1 peptide while CELA1 mRNA-low specimens did not have additional inhibition. Furthermore, specimens with the highest CELA1 mRNA levels had proportionately more inhibition when incubated with post-immunization serum. Using mouse monoclonal antibodies, Applicant identified four hybridoma clones producing antibodies that inhibit the majority of human lung elastolytic activity. Thus, anti-CELA1 therapies may be used to slow or halt progressive emphysema in established disease.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Methods</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Animal Use</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Animal Housing</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Animal use was approved by the CCHMC Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee (2017-0064).
