Shisha devices may include one outlet, or more than one outlet so that the device may be used by more than one consumer at a time. Use of shisha devices is considered by some to be a leisure activity and a social experience.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, traditional shishas are used in combination with a substrate, sometimes referred to in the art as hookah tobacco, tobacco molasses, or simply as molasses. Traditional shisha substrates are relatively high in sugar (in some cases, up to &#x2212;50% vs. the &#x2212;20% typically found in conventional tobacco substrates, such as in combustible cigarettes). The tobacco used in shisha devices may be mixed with other ingredients to, for example, increase the volume of the vapor and smoke produced, to alter flavor, or both.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditional shisha devices employ charcoal, such as charcoal pellets to heat and sometimes combust the tobacco substrate to generate an aerosol for inhalation by a user. Using charcoal to heat the tobacco may cause full or partial combustion of the tobacco or other ingredients. Additionally, charcoal may generate harmful or potentially harmful products, such as carbon monoxide, which may mix with the shisha vapor and pass through the water basin to the outlet.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One way to reduce the production of carbon monoxide and combustion by-products is to employ e-liquids rather than tobacco. Shisha devices that employ e-liquids eliminate combustion by-products but deprive shisha consumers of the traditional tobacco-based experience.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other shisha devices have been proposed that employ electric heaters to heat, but not combust, tobacco. Such electrically heated heat-not-burn shisha devices heat the tobacco substrate to a temperature sufficient to produce an aerosol from the substrate without combusting the substrate, and therefore reduce or eliminate by-products associated with combustion of tobacco.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Shisha devices may employ a cartridge for housing an aerosol-forming substrate. The cartridge may be filled with such aerosol-forming substrate. The aerosol-forming substrate may comprise tobacco, preferably shisha substrate, such as molasses&#x2014;a mixture of tobacco, water, sugar, and other components, such as glycerine, flavors, etc. The heating system of the electrically heated shisha device heats the contents of the cartridge to generate aerosol, which is conveyed through an airflow path to a user.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to facilitate airflow through the cartridge and the flow of the aerosol from the cartridge, a shisha cartridge may have one or more holes through one or more walls. The cartridge may include one or more holes at the top, one or more holes at the bottom, or both one or more holes at the top and one or more holes at the bottom. Alternatively, the top may be open, that is, the top wall may be partially or completely absent. Any holes or openings in the top and bottom walls may be closed by a removable (for example, peelable) sealing layer, such as a film, sticker, or liner, during storage. The removable layer may protect the contents (for example, the molasses) from exposure to air and oxygen. The removable layer may be removed (for example, pulled or peeled off) by a user prior to first use of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Shisha devices may be described as having a main longitudinal axis. Shisha substrates of cartridges are typically inserted longitudinally into the top part of the shisha device into a heating chamber. In order to efficiently heat the cartridge, a heating element should be positioned very close to the cartridge or in contact with the cartridge. When a user finishes using a cartridge, the cartridge is often immediately extracted from the shisha device and may be replaced by a new cartridge. If a new cartridge is not inserted, removing the used cartridge may be beneficial to prevent leakage of the cartridge's contents. The cartridge is typically removed in the reverse of insertion, which may present a risk for the user as the cartridge and its surroundings have been heated to temperatures sufficient to generate aerosol.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It would be desirable to have an insertion system for a shisha device that allows for practical positioning of the cartridge containing shisha substrate for heating and withdrawal of the cartridge to reduce the risk of burns while maintaining effective heating of the cartridge to provide a consistent smoking experience.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Various embodiments of the present disclosure provide aerosol-generating devices having cartridge insertion systems. The cartridge or the heating element may be moved between a first position and a second position. The first position may be a heating position. The first position may be a position for heating during use of the aerosol-generating device. The second position may be a non-heating position. The second position may be a position for retrieval of the cartridge by the user. Cartridge insertion systems may comprise a drawer. Cartridge insertion systems may comprise a heating element. Cartridge insertion systems may comprise a repositioning assembly. I In the heating position, the device may be configured such that a cartridge received therein is spaced from walls of the drawer. Advantageously, this reduces heating of the drawer to facilitate safe withdrawal. The repositioning assembly may move the heating element or the cartridge. The repositioning assembly may be for configured approximating the cartridge and the heating element. The heating element may be flexible.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, an aerosol-generating device may comprise a housing. The housing may comprise a drawer receptacle. The device may also comprise a drawer receivable in the drawer receptacle.

The device may also comprise a heating element. The heating element may be configured for heating the aerosol-forming substrate in a cartridge. The heating element may be configured for heating the aerosol-forming substrate in a cartridge when a cartridge is received in the cartridge receptacle and the drawer is in the closed position. The aerosol-generating device may comprise a shisha device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, an aerosol-generating device comprises a housing. The housing comprises a drawer receptacle. The device also comprises a drawer receivable in the drawer receptacle. The drawer comprises a cartridge receptacle to removably receive a cartridge.

The drawer may define a cartridge receptacle for removably receiving the cartridge comprising the aerosol-forming substrate. The drawer may be movable between an open position and a closed position. The drawer may include one or more air flow apertures in fluid communication with the drawer receptacle and the interior of the vessel. A repositioning assembly may approximate a received cartridge and heating element to reduce a distance between the received cartridge and the heating element. The repositioning assembly may move a received cartridge or the heating element into a position for heating. The heating element may be in direct contact with or proximate to the cartridge in the heating position. The aerosol-generating device may be configured to release a spent cartridge from the aerosol-generating device.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The term &#x201c;aerosol&#x201d; is used herein to refer to a suspension of solid particles or liquid droplets, or a combination of solid particles and liquid droplets in a gas.

The aerosol-generating device may include any suitable power supply. For example, a power supply of an aerosol-generating device may be a battery or set of batteries. The batteries of the power supply may be rechargeable, removable and replaceable, or rechargeable and removable and replaceable. Any suitable battery may be used. For example, heavy duty type or standard batteries existing in the market, such as used for industrial heavy-duty electrical power-tools. Alternatively, the power supply may be any type of electric power supply including a super or hyper-capacitor. Alternatively, the assembly may be connected to an external electrical power source, and electrically and electronically designed for such purpose. Regardless of the type of power supply employed, the power supply preferably provides sufficient energy for the normal functioning of the assembly for at least one shisha session until aerosol is depleted from the aerosol-forming substrate in the cartridge before being recharged or needing to connect to an external electrical power source. Preferably, the power supply provides sufficient energy for the normal functioning of the assembly for at least about 70 minutes of continuous operation of the device, before being recharged or needing to connect to an external electrical power source.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The aerosol-generating device includes an air inlet channel in fluid connection with the cartridge receptacle. In use, when the substrate inside the cartridge is heated, aerosol former components in the substrate vaporize. Air flowing from the air inlet channel through the cartridge becomes entrained with aerosol generated from the aerosol former components in the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Some electrically heated aerosol-generating devices employ pre-heated air and typically employ an airflow path such that the air travels in the vicinity of the heat source upon puffing. Further, some electrically heated aerosol-generating devices employ elements that increase radiation heat transfer by increasing the heated surface area.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The air inlet channel may include one or more apertures through the cartridge receptacle such that air from outside the aerosol-generating device may flow through the channel and into the cartridge receptacle through the one or more apertures. If a channel includes more than one aperture, the channel may include a manifold to direct air flowing through the channel to each aperture. Preferably, the aerosol-generating device includes two or more air inlet channels.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As described above, the cartridge includes one or more openings (such as inlets or outlets) formed in the body, allowing air to flow through the cartridge. If the cartridge receptacle includes one or more inlet apertures, at least some of the inlets in the cartridge may align with the apertures in the top of the cartridge receptacle. In some embodiments, the one or more air inlet apertures are formed in the heating element. The cartridge may include an alignment feature configured to mate with a complementary alignment feature of the cartridge receptacle to align the inlets of the cartridge with the apertures of the cartridge receptacle when the cartridge is inserted into the cartridge receptacle.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Air that enters the cartridge may flow across or through, or both across and through the aerosol-forming substrate, entraining aerosol, and exiting the cartridge and cartridge receptacle via an aerosol outlet. In some embodiments, one or more aerosol outlets may be formed in the drawer, such as a bottom wall of the drawer. From the aerosol outlet, the air carrying the aerosol enters a vessel of the aerosol-generating device.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The aerosol-generating device may define a longitudinal axis. The longitudinal axis may be defined to extend between the housing and the vessel.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The aerosol-generating device may include any suitable vessel defining an interior volume configured to contain a liquid and defining an outlet in a headspace above a liquid fill level. The interior volume may be in communication with the cartridge receptacle and the outlet. The vessel may include an optically transparent or opaque housing to allow a consumer to observe contents contained in the vessel. The vessel may include a liquid fill demarcation, such as a liquid fill line. The vessel housing may be formed of any suitable material. For example, the vessel housing may include glass or suitable rigid plastic material. Preferably, the vessel is removable from a portion of the shisha assembly comprising the aerosol-generation element to allow a consumer to fill, empty or clean the vessel.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The vessel may be filled to a liquid fill level by a consumer. The liquid preferably includes water, which may optionally be infused with one or more colorants, flavorants, or colorants and flavorants. For example, the water may be infused with one or both of botanical and herbal infusions.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Aerosol entrained in air exiting the aerosol outlet of the cartridge receptacle may travel through a conduit positioned in the vessel. The conduit may be described as an aerosol conduit. The conduit may convey aerosol from the cartridge receptacle to below the liquid fill level in the vessel. The conduit may be coupled to the aerosol outlet of the aerosol-generating element and may have an opening below the liquid fill level of the vessel, such that aerosol flowing through the vessel flows through the opening of the conduit, then through the liquid, into headspace of the vessel and exits through a headspace outlet, for delivery to a consumer.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The headspace outlet may be coupled to a hose comprising a mouthpiece for delivering the aerosol to a consumer. In particular, the headspace outlet may be in communication with the headspace. The mouthpiece may include an activation element, such as a switch activatable by a user, a puff sensor arranged to detect a user puffing on the mouthpiece, or both a switch activatable by the user and a puff sensor. The activation element is operably coupled to the control electronics of the aerosol-generating device. The activation element may be wirelessly coupled to the control electronics. Activation of the activation element may cause the control electronics to activate the heating element, rather than constantly supplying energy to the heating element. Accordingly, the use of an activation element may serve to save energy relative to devices not employing such elements to provide on-demand heating rather than constant heating.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, the activation element may be activated by moving the drawer to a closed position. For example, a sensor may be embedded in heating element to ensure contact with a cartridge wall before activating. In some embodiments, the activation element may be activated upon detecting that the heating element is in contact with the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Any suitable type of sensor may be used. Non-limiting examples include a contact sensor configured to detect a conductive wall of the cartridge to close an electrical circuit or an optical sensor to detect a distance to the cartridge wall.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">For purposes of example, one method for using an aerosol-generating device as described herein is provided below in chronological order. The vessel may be detached from other components of the aerosol-generating device and filled with water. One or more of natural fruit juices, botanicals, and herbal infusions may be added to the water for flavoring. The amount of liquid added should cover a portion of the conduit but should not exceed a fill level mark that may optionally exist on the vessel. The vessel is then reassembled to the aerosol-generating device. The cartridge may be prepared by removing any removable layer (if present). A portion of the aerosol-generating element may be opened to allow the cartridge to be inserted into the cartridge receptacle. In particular, the drawer may be moved to an open position to receive the cartridge. The drawer may be moved to the closed position to close the aerosol-generating element. One or both of the cartridge and the heating element are repositioned to bring the heating element and the cartridge in contact or proximate to one another.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The device may be turned on. Turning on the device may initiate a heating profile of a heating element, to heat the aerosol-forming substrate to a temperature at or above a vaporization temperature but below a combustion temperature of the aerosol-forming substrate. The aerosol forming compounds of the aerosol-forming substrate vaporize, generating an aerosol. The user may puff on the mouthpiece as desired. The user may continue using the device as long as desired or until no more aerosol is visible or being delivered. In some embodiments, the device may be arranged to automatically shut off when the cartridge or a compartment of the cartridge is depleted of usable aerosol-forming substrate. In some embodiments, the consumer may refill the device with a new cartridge after, for example, receiving the cue from the device that the aerosol-forming substrate in the cartridge is depleted or nearly depleted. The aerosol-generating device may be turned off at any time by a consumer by, for example, switching off the device.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The aerosol-generating device may have any suitable air management. In one example, puffing action from the user will create a suction effect causing a low pressure inside the device which will cause external air to flow through an air inlet of the device, into the air inlet channel, and into the cartridge receptacle. The air may then flow through the cartridge in the cartridge receptacle and become entrained with aerosol produced from the aerosol-forming substrate. The air with entrained aerosol then exits the aerosol outlet of the cartridge receptacle, flows through the conduit to the liquid inside the vessel. The aerosol will then bubble out of the liquid and into headspace in the vessel above the level of the liquid, out the headspace outlet, and through the hose and mouthpiece for delivery to the consumer. The flow of external air and the flow of the aerosol inside the aerosol-generating device may be driven by the action of puffing from the user.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In general, the aerosol-generating device may be configured to move at least one of the heating element and the cartridge when the cartridge is received in the cartridge receptacle in a repositioning direction to reduce a distance between the heating element and the cartridge in response to moving the drawer from the open position to the closed position. In some embodiments, the repositioning direction may be different than the first direction corresponding to moving the drawer from the open position to the closed position, different than another direction corresponding to moving the drawer from the closed position to the open position, or different than both the first direction and the another direction.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The repositioning assembly may be coupled to the heating element, the cartridge, or both the heating element and the cartridge. A repositioning assembly coupled to the heating element may be described as a heating element repositioning assembly. A repositioning assembly coupled to the cartridge may be described as a cartridge repositioning assembly.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The repositioning assembly may be configured to move the heating element, the cartridge, or both the heating element and the cartridge. In some embodiments, the repositioning assembly may move at least one of the heating element and the cartridge in the repositioning direction to approximate, or reduce a distance between, the heating element and the cartridge. The repositioning assembly may move at least one of the heating element and the cartridge in response to movement of the drawer. In some embodiments, the repositioning assembly may position the heating element in contact with or proximate to the cartridge, position the cartridge in contact with or proximate to the heating element, or position both the heating element and the cartridge in contact with or proximate to one another. For example, the repositioning assembly may be configured to move the heating element into a heating position that is in contact with or proximate to the cartridge in response to the drawer moving from the open position to the closed position. The repositioning assembly may be biased, for example, using a spring, to move the heating element and the cartridge away from each other in response to the drawer moving from the closed position to the open position.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some embodiments, the repositioning assembly may be configured to rotate the heating element into contact with or in proximity to the cartridge, linearly translate the heating element into contact with or in proximity to the cartridge, or both rotate the heating element and linearly translate the heating element, which may bring the heating element into contact with or in proximity to the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The repositioning assembly may use mechanical motion of the drawer to power movement of the heating element or uses sensor data to initiate movement of the heating element. In other words, the repositioning may utilize a mechanical mechanism to convert the mechanical power from opening or closing the drawer to initiate or power movement of the heating element, the cartridge, or both the heating element and the cartridge in the repositioning direction.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some embodiments, the repositioning assembly may comprise a first arm positioned in the path of the drawer, a second arm coupled to the heating element, and a pivot joint, which may be described as an axle, coupled to the housing between the first arm and the second arm. The drawer may push the first arm when moving from the open position to the closed position to rotate the second arm about the pivot joint, which may move the heating element toward the cartridge and into the heating position. The pivot joint may maintain the same or substantially the same angle between the first and second arms. The repositioning assembly may be biased, for example, using a spring, such that when the drawer is moved from the closed position to the open position, the second arm rotates about the pivot joint to move the heating element away from the cartridge and into a non-heating position.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some embodiments, repositioning assembly may include a presence sensor configured to sense, or capture, the position of the drawer and a piston assembly configured to reposition the heating element in a direction orthogonal to the first direction. The presence sensor may include any suitable sensor, such as a laser sensor, an infrared (IR) sensor, or a Hall effect sensor. Activation of the sensor may trigger the piston to push the heating element toward the cartridge and into the heating position. The piston assembly may include a pressure sensor to stop movement of the piston of the piston assembly in response to a sufficient amount of pressure being placed on the cartridge by the heating element. In some embodiments, the movement of the drawer in the first direction toward the closed position may be described as a lateral movement, whereas movement of the piston and the heating element may be described as longitudinal movement.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some embodiments, the repositioning assembly includes one or more gears. The drawer may include a gear-like surface connected to a rotating axle having mating female gears. The axle may have a threaded connection with a cantilever connected to the heating element. The cantilever may be prevented from rotating, for example, by being connected to a fixed tube going through it. Moving the drawer from the open position to the closed position may rotate the axle, which may cause the cantilever and the heating element coupled to the cantilever to move closer to the cartridge. Moving the drawer from the closed position to the open position may cause the cantilever and the heating element to move away from the cartridge. In some embodiments, the movement of the drawer in the first direction toward the closed position may be described as a lateral movement, whereas movement of the cantilever and the heating element may be described as longitudinal movement.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some embodiments, the repositioning assembly includes one or more selective spacing elements used with a flexible heating element. The one or more selective spacing elements may be configured to allow the heating element to move into the heating position when the drawer is in the closed position and to move the heating element away from the cartridge when the drawer is in the open position.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The repositioning assembly may comprise a platform. The platform may be extendable into the cartridge receptacle to move the cartridge from the cartridge receptacle into a heating position, for example, when the drawer is moved from the open position to the closed position. The cartridge may be received into the drawer receptacle on the platform. The platform may move the cartridge closer to the heating element, for example, when the heating element is positioned in a heating chamber outside of the cartridge receptacle or even outside of the drawer. The repositioning assembly may move the cartridge at least partially into the heating chamber when the drawer is in the closed position. In some embodiments, the cartridge may be moved vertically, or along the longitudinal axis, upward or downward, to position the cartridge at least partially in the heating chamber.
