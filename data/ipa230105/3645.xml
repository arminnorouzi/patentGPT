In particular, the invention relates to an apparatus and an analytical method for identifying and quantifying certain proteins in a mixture, for instance in a mixture of different proteins eluted from a size exclusion chromatography column, or flowing through a tube.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The effective chromatographic separation of protein-based biopharmaceuticals from other biomolecules, based on their size, charge, hydrophobicity or binding affinity is essential at manufacturing scales, for achieving consistently high product quality. At analytical scales, it also enables detailed product quality profiling, for example to assess formulations in accelerated degradation studies, or to monitor the product during storage. During batch manufacturing, a protein is eluted from the column, and collected in fractions that are then assessed for quality prior to pooling. Chromatography was also one of the first bioprocessing steps to be amenable to continuous manufacturing, and thus also the potential to implement process analytical technology (PAT), in which the product quality is preferably continuously monitored to enable feedback control of the process parameters to achieve a consistent product profile. To achieve this, the elution profile needs to be monitored to detect changes in the product profile that result from variability in the feedstream, column reagents, or from degradation of the column itself, to ensure that the properties of the product can be maintained within defined limits.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The adoption of continuous manufacturing by the biopharmaceutical industry, for example, is a route to bringing down the cost of therapeutic drugs and encouraging investment into new drug candidates. However, the biopharmaceutical industry has lagged behind other industries in adopting continuous manufacturing, which requires sophisticated process analytical technologies to monitor key process parameters and critical product attributes, in real time. Keeping these parameters within strict bounds is important for ensuring a consistently high product quality. However, developing these analytical technologies has proven to be a major challenge.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A major barrier to implementing the PAT approach for chromatography, or on other flowing samples in a continuous manufacturing pipeline, is the availability of real-time and robust, in-line or on-line sensors, that can distinguish the product from biophysically similar proteins that tend to co-elute or co-exist with the product. Such proteins may derive from the host cell, or could be variants of the product protein including those that result from proteolysis, alternative post-translational modifications, oxidation, mis-folding, alternative conformational states, aggregation, and deamidation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a typical industrial bioprocess, chromatography is the key step for purifying the product from other proteins, cellular debris and components of the media. Manufacturers using chromatography in the biologics/biopharmaceuticals sector have two key ambitions, each of increasing complexity: 1) an ability to obtain more detail on the contents of the &#x201c;product&#x201d; elution peak, without the need for offline independent analysis; 2) an ability to make real-time measurements on the chromatography elution that reveal hidden species within a single peak, and then use this information in real-time to control the peak fractionation points (batch or continuous mode) and/or the process control parameters (in continuous mode), to optimally control the product purity and yield.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The standard technique for monitoring proteins eluted from a chromatography column is UV absorbance. While this, and related techniques, can be used for real-time measurements and process control, it is usually not possible to distinguish different proteins based on their UV absorbance alone. For instance, if two proteins co-elute, where protein 1 is a strong absorber and protein 2 is a weak absorber, and only absorbance is measured, there is no way to determine whether there is a low concentration of only protein 1, or a high concentration of only protein 2, or some mix of the two proteins giving the same total absorbance. There are numerous research groups trying to resolve this problem using sophisticated curve-fitting algorithms, and analysis of multi-wavelength absorbance spectroscopy (e.g. Hubbuch group [1], [2], [3]). However, there is limited innovation in this area in terms of new modes of detection. Consequently, manufacturers tend to &#x201c;over-purify&#x201d; their product with narrow peak fractionation and a resulting loss of yield, or they &#x201c;under purify&#x201d; by including other proteins hidden within part of their product peak. If they could make smarter fractionation and pooling decisions based on accurate quantitation of each co-eluting protein species in real time, then they would be able maximise yield and avoid over-contaminated batches, by controlling the process in real time to obtain a predefined purity of the product. For these reasons at least there is a need for an improved method of detection.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">On-line UV-absorption or refractive index measurements are often used to monitor chromatography. In-batch chromatography also forms the basis for deciding which fractions to pool. However, if there are two or more overlapping peaks in the chromatogram then these techniques cannot readily be used to quantify the relative amounts of the co-eluting proteins. Therefore, off-line analytical methods such as protein gels, orthogonal analytical chromatography modes, or mass-spectrometry, are used to assess the protein purity. In a continuous manufacturing process, it is especially important to identify co-eluting contaminants to provide real-time feedback to the manufacturing process.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Co-eluting protein species can be resolved by measuring absorption spectra and analysing the data with advanced tools, such as partial least squares regression for example. However, this typically involves extensive off-line calibration and the spectral shifts between proteins are often subtle, making it difficult to resolve more than two co-eluting proteins.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other common detection modalities, such as fluorescence intensity and electrical conductivity, are also typically univariate and therefore suffer the same drawback as UV-absorption measurements, such as the difficulty in resolving mixtures of protein species.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for identifying eluted proteins, but the sample is destroyed, the analysis of the spectra is complex, and the costs of purchasing and maintaining the equipment are high.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Nuclear magnetic resonance is an effective technique for ensuring that the eluted proteins are folded into the anticipated conformation, but is relatively slow, typically limited to small proteins, and the fixed capital and variable costs are very high.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, the practical usefulness of the aforementioned techniques for on-line monitoring of proteins in production processes is severely limited.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Time-resolved intrinsic fluorescence (hereafter referred to as TRF or TRIF) is a well-established spectroscopic technique that can identify proteins based on the time profile of their intrinsic fluorescence. This is dependent on the number, location and microenvironment of their aromatic residues, and is widely applicable since only 1% of proteins do not contain any aromatic residues (i.e., neither a tryptophan nor tyrosine).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) is the most common technique for measuring fluorescence decay times. However, unless analysing very dilute solutions, TCSPC is susceptible to the &#x201c;pile-up&#x201d; problem, which makes it poorly suited to simultaneously measuring the fluctuations in the fluorescence intensity. In this technique, a clock starts when a pulse of excitation light is emitted in the direction of the sample and the clock stops when a photon of fluorescent light is registered by detection electronics. The time difference between the clock starting and stopping is measured many thousands or even millions of times and the resulting set of data can be analysed to work out the fluorescence lifetime. The weakness of the technique is that the clock stops when it detects the first photon to arrive at the detector, which statistically biases the measurement towards shorter time decays. If the fluorescence is too intense, then the distribution of counted photons becomes statistically biased towards shorter times, undermining the accuracy of the decay time measurement, and also its ability to resolve multiple decay components. In order to circumvent this problem, the intensity of the light reaching the detector must be reduced so that on most occasions no light is detected at all. In this low-intensity-light situation, when a photon of light is detected the probability of a second photon of light arriving at the detector is low so the statistical bias is not significant. However, operating at low levels of light is an unacceptable trade-off if the intensity must also be measured since the error of the intensity measurement would be increased and dynamic range of the measurement would be limited. Typically, this is not an issue contemplated by researchers using TCSPC in a lab setting because they are only interested in measuring the fluorescence lifetime and are not interested in also monitoring fluorescence intensity. For bioprocess monitoring it would be necessary to track the total protein content by the fluorescence intensity, while simultaneously identifying proteins in the mixture using their decay times.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Fluorescence occurs when a sample absorbs light of a specific wavelength and emits light at a different wavelength. In most cases, such as with proteins, the emitted light wavelength is longer than the absorbed light. It is known in the art that intrinsic fluorescence of the proteins is attributed from the weak fluorescence from aromatic residues, such as tryptophan and tyrosine in response to excitation with UV light (typically in the 250 nm to 290 nm wavelength region). Labelling of proteins with extrinsic fluorescent dyes provides more sensitivity, but is not considered for manufacturing as the product cannot be used as a human therapy if modified in this way.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Moreover, intrinsic fluorescence of proteins has been well-studied by measuring i) fluorescence intensity, ii) time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) lifetimes, iii) anisotropy, iv) fluorescence correlation spectroscopy etc. However, with the exception of simple fluorescence intensity measurements, the use of these techniques for chromatography monitoring has been limited, in particular for proteins.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As such, there is a need for a method that chromatographically monitors the intrinsic fluorescence of proteins whilst also satisfying all of the following criteria:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0018">(a) The method is able to detect and quantify multiple proteins within the same sample, or within the same chromatography peak, where the shape of the peak does not necessarily reveal their presence.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0019">(b) The method provides a fast data acquisition and analysis time, as the minimum resolution required for practical analytical or preparative chromatography of proteins is in the region of 1-10 seconds.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0020">(c) The method is adequately sensitive, as the samples must be detectable above the background buffer signal and also the background noise, at minimum concentrations practical for analytical or preparative chromatography (e.g. sensitive at a protein concentration range of 0.01 mg/ml to 1 mg/ml).</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0021">(d) The method provides a dynamic range, as the samples must be detectable with a signal that is linearly proportional to quantity of sample in the peak, from the minimum to the maximum concentrations desired for analytical or preparative chromatography (e.g. at a protein concentration range of 0.01 mg/ml to 500 mg/ml).</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0022">(e) The method is cost-effective, as the detector should ideally use components that make the detection method of comparable cost to other detectors in use for chromatography monitoring.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0019" num="0023">A known problem in the art is that existing fluorescence intensity measurement techniques do not meet the above-mentioned criterion (a) at least. Fluorescence intensity measurements are available for chromatography, including at wavelengths suitable for protein intrinsic fluorescence intensity measurements. However, simple fluorescence intensity measurements cannot resolve the relative contributions to the signal from multiple proteins, and so cannot distinguish the presence of multiple proteins within the same sample or elution peak. Two-dimensional (2D) fluorescence intensity spectroscopy has been described for bioprocess monitoring, which scans emission spectra across a range of excitation wavelengths. While this method may be useful for identifying the presence of very different biological fluorophores (e.g. cofactors versus proteins), it is not able to resolve multiple proteins which have essentially the same 2D fluorescence spectra.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0024">Other known problems in the art are that existing anisotropy and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy methods do not meet the above-mentioned criteria (b) to (d). Furthermore, existing fluorescence lifetime measurement methods, such as TRF or TCSPC, do not meet the criteria set out in criteria (b) to (d), and this becomes particularly acute when considering criterion (e).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0025">The present invention has been devised in light of the above considerations.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0026">In realising the inventions of the present application, the inventors have developed a method and apparatus for continuously monitoring of protein species in a flowing sample, or as they are eluted from a chromatographic column even when they fully co-elute with other protein species and without making any assumption about the elution profile. To achieve this, the inventors designed and constructed a TRIF lifetime chromatograph and established an analytical framework for deconvolving and quantifying distinct but co-eluting protein species. This technology has immediate relevance as a process analytical technology for continuous bioprocessing.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0027">According to one aspect of the invention, there is a method of quantifying the concentration of a protein of interest, or of a concentration of a conformational state of the protein of interest, in a mixture, wherein the protein of interest or conformational state has an intrinsic fluorescence decay signature. It is the intrinsic fluorescence of the proteins that is being measured, rather than any kind of fluorescent tag or label.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0028">The method comprises: addressing the mixture with one or more pulses of light, wherein the light has a wavelength in the 240-295 nm range, preferably in the 250-280 nm range, further preferably wherein the light has a wavelength of 266 nm.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0029">The method further comprises: taking a series of measurements of the fluorescence intensity of the mixture at a series of time points where the time interval between a fluorescence measurement and a preceding light pulse is recorded. The series of measurements comprises measurements for which the time intervals differ from each other by less than a nanosecond, and where the difference between largest and smallest time intervals is at least 5 nanoseconds (ns) and/or a sufficient time to detect a decay of the fluorescence intensity towards a baseline level, such that the series of measurements defines a fluorescence decay curve. The method further comprises quantifying the concentration of the protein of interest or the concentration of the conformational state of the protein of interest in the sample by reference to the fluorescence decay curve.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0030">The term fluorescence &#x201c;decay signature&#x201d; and &#x201c;optical signature&#x201d; are used interchangeably throughout this application and may refer to a unique (&#x201c;signature&#x201d;) optical signal that may be used to characterise a particular species of protein (e.g. a protein of interest) from other (e.g. different) proteins species contained in the same mixture. It may also be used to quantify a concentration and/or a conformational state of that protein of interest. The present invention advantageously solves multiple problems associated with known analytical apparatus, methods and data fitting routines used to monitor chromatographic eluants using TRF. Furthermore, the present invention advantageously enables real-time deconvolution of the contributions from multiple protein species. For example, the TRF approach provides an alternative technique to TCSPC that negates the &#x201c;pile-up&#x201d; problem and enables simultaneous measurement of fluctuations of both the time decay and the fluorescence intensity repeatedly, in the order of every few seconds, and preferably at intervals of under 5 seconds (meaning that the time period between two fluorescence decay curve measurements is less than 5 seconds). In some embodiments, the time decay and fluorescence intensity is measured at intervals of under 10 seconds (meaning that the time period between two fluorescence decay curve measurements is less than 10 seconds). In other embodiments, the time interval between fluorescence decay and intensity measurements (the time period between two fluorescence decay curve measurements) is more than 30 seconds, less than 30 seconds, less than 20 seconds, less than 15 seconds, less than 3 seconds, less than 2 seconds, about 1 second, or less than 1 second.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0031">The present invention is applicable to protein solutions at a wide range of concentrations relevant to bioprocessing. The inventors have also developed algorithms that can fit the data concurrently with data acquisition, enabling real-time product monitoring and pooling decisions. In this way, the present invention provides an analytical tool that can quantify individual protein species in a sample, e.g. in a volume of liquid that is eluted from a column, even if the protein species fully co-elutes with another protein species, without making any assumptions about the elution profile. As such, the present invention is a method that uses fluorescence lifetime measurement that meets all of the previously mentioned criteria (i.e. criteria (a) to (e)).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0032">In devising a method of the present invention that can quantify the concentration of a protein of interest, or of a conformational state of a protein of interest, in a mixture, the inventors had to overcome a number of technical hurdles, as summarised below:</p><p id="p-0029" num="0033">In a mixture there are two unknowns, namely the concentration and the identity of each protein. As such, one measurement cannot uniquely determine both the concentration and identity at the same time. Therefore, a second simultaneous measurement is required to uniquely determine both unknowns. There are many known analytical methods which measure different aspects of the fluorescence. For instance, a fluorimeter can measure emission spectra, fluorescence lifetimes and fluorescence anisotropy, and techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) are also commonly used.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0034">In their research, the inventors found spectral measurements to be unsuitable as the spectra of different proteins are not different enough to straightforwardly deconvolve them. The inventors also found FCS and fluorescence anisotropy to also be unsuitable as these methods are less capable of differentiating between protein variants of broadly similar size and shape within a mixture. However, the inventors have found that the lifetimes of different proteins are often unambiguously different and that simultaneously measuring the intensity is effective. Taking this finding, the inventors have overcome several technical challenges to realise the method of the present invention which uses fluorescence lifetime measurements in combination with fluorescence intensity measurements.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0035">Measuring the fluorescence lifetime is often a challenging-enough measurement given the nanosecond decay times. To illustrate, the most conventional technique for making fluorescence lifetime measurements is TCSPC, which does not provide a reliable intensity measurement due to the &#x201c;pile-up&#x201d; problem, as discussed herein. The most obvious strategy for making a time-resolved measurement is simply to employ a detector and detector electronics with a very high bandwidth so that the fluorescence emission could be measured with a &#x201c;sufficiently-high&#x201d; resolution. High-bandwidth digital oscilloscopes are known in the art and have been used to directly measure the fluorescence lifetimes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds (PAHs) but would not be suitable for the detection of proteins due to their shorter decay times. The inventors estimated, from theoretical calculations, that this &#x201c;sufficiently-high resolution&#x201d; would require an oscilloscope with greater than 1 gigahertz (GHz) or even 2 GHz bandwidth, which may be significantly costly and therefore impractical from an economic perspective (e.g. satisfies criterion (e), as previously described).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0036">In view of the above considerations, the inventors have reduced costs by using a digitizer (i.e. a machine that converts an analog signal into a digital format) in the form of a sampling oscilloscope, which is a well-known instrument, but not commonly used in the context of the application of this invention. Advantageously, the sampling oscilloscope may for example measure the voltage after a certain period of time has elapsed from receiving the trigger signal, and that period of time increments by &#x2dc;50 to 100 picoseconds (ps) after every excitation pulse until the full lifetime has been built up over 256 or 512 pulses, for example.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0037">The decision made by the inventors to employ a sampling oscilloscope was motivated by economic considerations at the time of the invention. Any suitable digitizer (e.g. a high-bandwidth digitizer) that is capable of accurately representing the analog signal in a digital format would be sufficient. Such a high-bandwidth digitizer might be manifested, for instance, as a high-bandwidth digital oscilloscope, a high-bandwidth analog-to-digital converter on a printed circuit board, or a high-bandwidth sampling oscilloscope. As such, as the skilled person will appreciate, the employment of a sampling oscilloscope described in this application may be replaced by using any high-bandwidth digitizer.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0038">As noted herein, the fluorescence intensity of the mixture is measured at a series of time points and the time interval between a fluorescence measurement and a preceding light pulse may optionally be recorded. The difference between the largest and smallest time intervals will be sufficient to detect a decay of the fluorescence intensity towards a baseline level. In practice, this timespan can be determined for a particular protein of interest using the methods disclosed herein. In general, the difference between the largest and smallest time intervals will be at least 10 nanoseconds (ns). However, in some embodiments, the difference between the largest and smallest time intervals may be about 5 nanoseconds (ns), about 6 ns, about 7 ns, about 8 ns, about 9 ns, about 10 ns, about 11 ns, about 12 ns, about 13 ns, about 14 ns, about 15 ns, about 16 ns, about 17 ns, about 18 ns, about 19 ns, about 20 ns, about 25 ns, about 30 ns, about 40 ns or about 50 ns. In some embodiments, the difference between the largest and smallest time intervals may be at least 5 nanoseconds (ns), at least 6 ns, at least 7 ns, at least 8 ns, at least 9 ns, at least 10 ns, at least 11 ns, at least 12 ns, at least 13 ns, at least 14 ns, at least 15 ns, at least 16 ns, at least 17 ns, at least 18 ns, at least 19 ns, at least 20 ns, at least 25 ns, at least 30 ns, at least 40 ns or at least 50 ns. The difference between the largest and smallest time intervals may be defined as being a time selected from a range of possible times, wherein the upper and lower bounds of that range may be defined by a value listed herein.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0039">The apparatus may comprise a beam splitter configured to split the emitted pulses of light (the excitation light) into first and second portions, where the first portion is directed to a photodiode and the second portion is directed towards the protein of interest in the mixture of proteins.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0040">In an example embodiment, the light source (or light arrangement) may be any coherent or incoherent-light source, such as a light emitting diode (LED) for example. Preferably, the light source may be a monochromatic light source, such as a laser. The laser may output an electronic trigger, which is an electronic signal generated in response to the emission of the excitation pulse. However, there may be some variation in the time between the light pulse being emitted and the trigger being sent. This is called trigger jitter and it may decrease the accuracy of the measurements. For this reason, the inventors have advantageously devised an alternative strategy for generating the trigger. To do this, a beam splitter is placed in the path of the excitation light which partially reflects some of the light onto a photodiode, and the voltage across a load resistor in response to the light pulse is then used as the trigger for the sampling oscilloscope or a high-bandwidth digitizer.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0041">In this way, the method can accurately build-up the fluorescence decay curve by taking each measurement following a separate light pulse (optionally 256 or 512 pulses), while maintaining data accuracy, as random errors in the time-interval recordings are minimised. Thus, the present invention provides advantages over known analytical methods which use frequency-domain measurements, which is the most common strategy employed in PAH detection. To illustrate, frequency-domain measurements require continuous-wave, instead of pulsed excitation sources, and therefore either require significantly more sensitive detectors, or require much higher excitation powers for signal recovery. Moreover, these known methods are also required to be optically and electronically isolated from the environment to eliminate DC noise sources and contributions from common electrically frequencies such as 50 Hz, and the modulation of the excitation source are required to be purely sinusoidal in order to prevent the generation of harmonics.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0042">The quantification of the concentration of the protein of interest or of the concentration of the conformational state of the protein of interest may comprise deconvoluting the fluorescence decay curve to quantify the contribution of the intrinsic fluorescence decay signature from different proteins species or conformational states of the protein species to the fluorescence decay curve.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0043">The inventors have developed algorithms that can fit the data concurrently with data acquisition, enabling real-time product monitoring and pooling decisions. The inventors have also developed analytical tools that can quantify individual proteins species as they are eluted from the column, even if they fully co-elute with another protein species, and without making any assumptions about the elution profile. In this way, the method of the present invention advantageously allows for a contribution (or proportion) of each protein of interest to total protein in the mixture to be calculated from the fluorescence decay curve.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0044">The quantification of the concentration of the protein of interest or concentration of the conformational state of the protein of interest may comprise calculating the area under the deconvoluted portion of the fluorescence decay curve that corresponds to the intrinsic fluorescence decay signature of the protein of interest or of a concentration of the conformational state of the protein of interest. The deconvoluted fluorescence signal is linearly proportional to the amount of that protein in the sample and thus the relative and absolute amount of the proteins may be determined at one instance in time, with no prior knowledge as to the specific amounts the protein. Thus the method of the present invention advantageously allows the absolute quantity of the protein of interest to be estimated as the area under the curve may be proportional to the concentration. The fluorescence intensity may be calculated from determining the area under the fluorescence lifetime curve, and this correlates with the amount of protein. The identity of the proteins may be determined from the fluorescence lifetime characteristics. In short, the fluorescence lifetime data may be fitted to a model which has three parameters that are characteristic to the protein. For example, these three parameters may therefore be an optical signature for the protein.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0045">Preferably, the mixture is a liquid comprising the protein in solution. The mixture may be a portion of an eluate from a chromatography column. The methods of the invention can be used to analyse proteins in the eluate (or wash fraction) from all types of chromatography columns, e.g. ion exchange columns, size exclusion columns, affinity columns, etc. Many important protein and peptide products are purified by chromatography, for instance antibodies and other biopharmaceuticals.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0046">The mixture may comprise more than one protein, which each have a different intrinsic fluorescence decay signature.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0047">The deconvoluted fluorescence signal is linearly proportional to the amount of that protein in the sample and thus the relative and absolute amount of the two proteins may be determined at one instance in time with no prior knowledge as to the specific amounts of each protein.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0048">Advantageously, the method of the present invention can quantify proteins in a mixture and may not just be limited to chromatography.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0049">For example, decay-associated chromatograms (DACs) may be used for this analysis. In this way, decay parameters/optical signatures of the two proteins may be already known, and each fluorescence lifetime measurement may be curve fitted by summing together two decay curves, each corresponding to the lifetime expected for one or the other of the proteins based on their respective optical signatures. The amount of each decay curve required to accurately fit a particular lifetime curve may determine how much of each protein is present at that time, and this may be plotted in the DAC.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0050">The concentration of the protein of interest or the concentration of the conformational state of the protein of interest may be calculated multiple times, to determine a change in the concentration of the protein of interest over time and/or to determine the concentration of the protein of interest in more than one eluate fraction. For example, the fluorescence decay curve may be measured multiple times, to allow a change in the concentration of the protein of interest over time and/or to determine the concentration of the protein of interest in more than one eluate fraction to be determined.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0051">A time period of each of the multiple calculations may be less than 10 seconds. For example, a time period between two fluorescence decay curve measurements may be less than 10 seconds (e.g. satisfies criterion (b), as previously described). Furthermore, this advantageously enables the profiling of a chromatography peak in addition to the potential of creating a feedback control. For example, the chromatography peaks may be fractionated based on meeting certain composition criteria.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0052">In this way, the method provides a fast data acquisition and analysis time and meets the minimum resolution requirement for practical analytical or preparative chromatography of proteins. In another example embodiment, the instrument may collect a series of fluorescence lifetime measurements every 4 to 5 seconds. However, there may be a short lag time, typically less than 1 second, for the method to interpret the data and generate chromatograms.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0053">In an example embodiment, the method may acquire a series of fluorescence lifetime measurements independently from the data analysis which happens in parallel. Therefore, there may be no time lag between one fluorescence lifetime measurement and the next due to the data analysis. Once a lifetime measurement is completed it may be added to a queue to be analysed. The data analysis may not be instantaneous so there may be a time lag between the fluorescence lifetime measurement being acquired and the completion of the data analysis.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054">For example, if lifetime measurements are acquired every 4 seconds, then the data analysis from the previous measurement is complete before the latest measurement arrives in the queue and so every new measurement is always at the start of the queue. However, if the time period between measurements were shortened sufficiently then the size of the queue may exceed 1 lifetime measurement. If the signal is too low to analyse, for instance if there were no protein present in the sample, then the lifetime measurement is not added to the queue. By decoupling the data acquisition and data analysis such that they can advantageously happen in parallel. In this way, the inventors have demonstrated a method of decay chromatogram (DC) analysis on-the-fly. As the skilled person will appreciate, decay-associated chromatogram (DAC) may also be possible on-the-fly. The total experiment time is not impacted by the method of data acquisition. In the context of a chromatographic separation experiment, the time taken to generate a complete chromatogram for a protein species may be determined by the column and pump configuration and the analysis time, and not the detector. For example, if it takes 1 min for a protein to elute from a column, then it takes 1 min plus any lag time to analyse the data to generate the chromatogram if measuring on-the-fly.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0055">The concentration of more than one protein may be quantified. Thus, the method of the present invention is advantageously applicable to mixtures comprising multiple different varieties, or types, of proteins. The method is also advantageously applicable to at a wide range of protein concentrations which ensures that it may be relevant to the fields of bioprocessing or food industry research, for example.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0056">The concentrations of the proteins may be quantified by deconvoluting more than one intrinsic fluorescence decay signature from a single fluorescence decay curve.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0057">The method of the present invention may not be limited to analysing two protein species. For example, the optical signatures of three species of protein may be input instead of two species of protein. A lifetime measurement of an ensemble of different proteins may be acquired and the data can be fitted as though there are just one additional protein species present in the sample along with a target protein of interest. For example, the method may be able to attribute an optical signature to the cell lysate, and then generate DACs as previously described, except that one curve may be the cell lysate and the other may be the protein of interest.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0058">The concentrations of the proteins may be quantified by deconvoluting an intrinsic fluorescence decay signature from a first mixture and an intrinsic fluorescence decay signature from a second mixture, wherein the first and the second mixtures may eluate from a column at different elution times. Alternatively, the concentrations of the proteins are quantified by deconvoluting a first intrinsic fluorescence decay signature and a second intrinsic fluorescence decay signature from a single mixture, which contains both proteins.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0059">The light source (or light arrangement) may be any coherent or incoherent-light source, such as a light emitting diode (LED), for example a white-light LED. Preferably, the light source is a monochromatic light source, such as a laser (or laser system). The one or more pulses of light may have a pulse width which may be less than 10 ns, preferably less than 5 ns, further preferably less than 2 ns. For example, the pulse width may be preferably more than 1 ns but less than 2 ns, and more preferably approximately 1.1 ns.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0060">Ideally, the excitation pulse needs to be as short as possible because this is a TRF measurement. However, the inventors have devised a method which advantageously provides a trade-off between the energy of the pulse, its pulse length, and the cost of the laser system. For example, using a nanosecond pulsed laser may affect the data analysis as the pulse length (e.g. in the region of &#x2dc;1 ns) may be longer than a typical first decay components (e.g. in the region of 0.4 ns to 0.9 ns), and not much shorter than a typical second decay component (e.g. in the region of 2 ns to 7 ns). Consequently, the output may be a convolution of the time profile of the excitation pulse, the fluorescence lifetime of the sample, and the instrument response of the detector electronics. This impacts the data analysis because the data then has to be fitted to a different model. It also affects the apparatus design because a mechanism for measuring the impulse response of the system has to be devised. In this way, the inventors have designed the apparatus configuration to make it possible to detect very subtle differences between the proteins. In general, the more accurately the lifetime measurements can be acquired, the more accurately the optical signatures can be initially determined, and the more accurately the amount of each protein at a given time can be calculated.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0061">The fluorescence decay curve may be fitted to a single-exponential or double-exponential model. More than two exponentials could also be envisaged if the complexity of the sample requires it. For example, a fixed third exponential model (e.g. an exponential with a very low amplitude and a very long time decay) may be used such that it effectively acts as a dummy exponential, while two other exponential models obtain fluorescence decay curve information.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0062">The intrinsic fluorescence decay signature of the protein of interest may be determined by addressing a sample comprising the protein of interest and essentially no other proteins with the one or more pulses of light as defined in the previous statements, and taking the series of measurements of the fluorescence intensity of the sample as defined in the previous statements.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0063">The deconvoluton of the fluorescence decay curve may comprise statistical modelling of the fluorescence decay curve for quantifying more than two co-eluting proteins.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0064">There may be two ways that the invention &#x201c;quantifies&#x201d; more than two co-eluting protein species. Firstly, if one protein species is a constant mixture of protein species (constant in the sense that the relative proportion of each constituent protein species is not changing). Secondly, if the protein species are not completely overlapping (i.e. they are partially co-eluting). For example, if three protein species elute at exactly the same time, then quantifying all three may not be possible, but if one and two overlap partially, and two and three partially overlap, and one and three do not overlap, then all three may be quantified. In this way, the inventors have developed algorithms to quantify three species when there is a higher degree of overlap. Advantageously, the method of the present invention can therefore quantify at least two co-eluting protein species as it enables simultaneous measurement of changes in both the time decay and the fluorescence intensity.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0065">The contribution of a background noise signal, I<sub>background(t)</sub>, may be calculated using the following equation:</p><p id="p-0062" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>I</i><sub>background</sub>(<i>t</i>)<i>=c&#x3b8;</i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0063" num="0000">where c is a baseline offset value and &#x3b8; is a width of the time window of a high-bandwidth digitizer or a sampling oscilloscope.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0066">In other words, the fluorescence intensity of the background signal (or noise), I<sub>background (t)</sub>, is the product of the baseline offset c and the width of the time window &#x3b8;, which advantageously accounts for electrical noise of the apparatus and improves the accuracy of the measurements. The baseline offset c may be empirically determined or calculated by taking the median of a preselected number of initial data points. In preferred embodiments, the baseline offset c may be empirically determined or calculated by taking the median of the first 5 points, the first 6 points, the first 7 points, the first 8 points, the first 9 points, the first 10 points, the first 11 points, the first 12 points, the first 13 points, the first 14 points, or the first 15 points of the digital signal, which correspond to a region of time before the excitation pulse has arrived at the sample or sample capillary.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0067">In another embodiment of the present invention, the method may further comprise a generation of one or more decay chromatograms, DCs, by fitting a double, DC-2, exponential model to the fluorescence decay curve.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0068">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the method may further comprise a generation of one or more decay-associated chromatograms, DACs, by fitting equation (8) to the fluorescence decay curve, and calculating the contribution of each proteins species to the fluorescence intensity measured across the time window using equation (14).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0069">In another embodiment, the method may further comprise quantifying more than two co-eluting proteins by simultaneous measurement of both a time decay and the fluorescence intensity.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0070">In yet another embodiment, each protein species has a characteristic &#x3c4;<b>1</b>, &#x3c4;<b>2</b> and &#x3b2; that can be used to identify that species, where in a sum of two exponential decays model, &#x3c4;<b>1</b> and &#x3c4;<b>2</b> are the first and second fluorescence decay times and &#x3b2; is the contribution of the first decay component.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0071">The invention also provides apparatus for performing the methods of the invention.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0072">Accordingly, another aspect of the invention provides an apparatus for measuring the concentration of a protein of interest in a mixture of proteins. The apparatus comprising: a light source capable of addressing the mixture with pulses of light at a wavelength in the range 240-290 nm, preferably in the range 250-280 nm, further preferably at a wavelength of 266 nm. The apparatus further comprising one or more detectors are responsive to light at wavelengths between 300 nm and 400 nm and are configured to measure the fluorescence intensity of the mixture, where said one or more detectors are capable of taking a series of measurements, each measurement spanning a sub-nanosecond time interval, and a trigger system capable of initiating the first measurement before the signal from the fluorescence measurements arrives at a digitizer.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0073">In this way, the trigger system may be capable of initiating measurements, where the trigger system is preferably triggered by the onset of the excitation-light pulse.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0074">In realising the apparatus of the present invention, the inventors have constructed an experimental analytical set-up to monitor mixtures (e.g. chromatographic eluants) using TRF that enables the real-time quantification of the contributions of a protein of interest, or even the contributions of multiple protein species. The inventors have designed the optical configuration, selected the light sources, the detectors, the optical components, and have written the software to analyse the data.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0075">In the broadest terms, the layout of the apparatus comprises the following: a sample, comprising a protein of interest in a mixture of proteins, addressed by an excitation light pulse. A fluorescence emission is collected and directed to one or more detectors via optical filters which block the excitation light, and the detector converts the light to an electrical current. The electronics converts the current to a voltage which is then recorded, and the output is analysed. To illustrate, the inventors used a light arrangement in the form of a nanosecond pulsed laser with emission in the region 250 nm to 290 nm. This advantageously generated pulses with sufficient energy for the resulting fluorescence to be measurable across the range of protein concentrations of interest (e.g. between 0.01 and 500 mg/ml). The light source may be a single light emitting diode (LED), an array of LEDs, and/or a laser. If using a laser light source, the laser is preferably a diode pumped Q-switched solid state laser.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0076">Lasers provide a readily available source of monochromatic light. Diode pumped Q-switched solid state lasers can advantageously produce a pulsed output beam where each light pulse has an extremely high (e.g. kilowatt peak) power. Advantageously, this is a much higher power output than would be produced by the same laser if it are operating in a continuous wave (constant output) mode. In an exemplary embodiment, the diode pumped Q-switched solid state laser is a frequency quadrupled diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser used to generate light at 266 nm.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0077">The intrinsic fluorescence decay emission may be reflected towards the one or more detectors by a reflector or a lens. In some embodiments, the fluorescence decay emission is reflected by an ellipsoidal reflector. The decay emission may be reflected via a long-pass and/or short-pass optical filter, towards the one or more detectors. Preferably, the long-pass and/or short-pass optical filters are dielectric optical filters. In this way, the decay emission passes through (and is not reflected by) the optical filters towards the one or more detectors. In an example embodiment, the optical filters may have a dielectric coating, whereas the ellipsoidal reflector may not necessarily be coated.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0078">In devising the present invention, the inventors realised that stray light may enter the sample. For instance, when using the Q-switched frequency-quadrupled diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser to generate light at 266 nm, stray light at 532 nm and 1064 nm wavelengths was found to enter the sample. This stray light can be problematic as it makes it difficult to distinguish between signals generated by fluorescence from the sample, and by background light (e.g. light generated by the light source itself). The inventors solved this problem by introducing a filter assembly for blocking light, particularly at 266 nm, but also at 532 nm and 1064 nm wavelengths. Thus, the use of optical filters described herein prevents light from the light source from impinging on the one or more detectors. In an example embodiment, the filter assembly may be a long-pass dielectric filter. In light of this disclosure, the skilled person can perform the necessary optical and electronic calculations and select a laser accordingly.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0079">The one or more detectors may be one or more photodiodes. In realising the present invention, the inventors found &#x201c;ultrafast&#x201d; photodiodes (hereafter referred to as &#x201c;UF-PDs&#x201d;) to be optical suitable detectors. A rise time may be the time taken by a signal to change from a specified low value to a specified high value. Throughout the present application, the term &#x201c;ultrafast&#x201d; is used to signify that the photodiodes have a bandwidth that is &#x201c;high&#x201d; and/or have a rise time that is &#x201c;short&#x201d;. In other words, the bandwidth of the photodiode may be &#x201c;high&#x201d;, or alternatively the rise time of the photodiode may be &#x201c;short&#x201d;, or the photodiode has both a &#x201c;high&#x201d; bandwidth and a &#x201c;short&#x201d; rise time. For example a &#x201c;high&#x201d; bandwidth may be a bandwidth with a GHz order of magnitude, whereas a &#x201c;short&#x201d; rise time may be a rise time with a nanoscale order of magnitude or lower. For example, the UF-PDs used in the present invention may have a sub-nanosecond rise time. Alternatively, or additionally, the UF-PDs may have a bandwidth in the range between 2 GHz and 12 GHz. In this way, the UF-PDs can provide a sufficiently high bandwidth and responsivity to light at wavelengths between 300 nm and 400 nm.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0080">The one or more ultra-fast photodiodes may comprise a high bandwidth transimpedance amplifier. Preferably, the one or more ultra-fast photodiodes may be configured to provide a rise time of less than 175 ps.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0081">In the literature, photomultipliers tubes (PMTs) are often used when the detector has been explicitly stated. In those cases where it was not stated, measurements are instead made with a stand-alone spectrometer. A drawback of PMTs are that they typically have rise times longer than 1 ns. It is a known problem in the art to try to eliminate background signals, due to the sensitivity of PMTs to low light levels. The UF-PDs used in the present application may be connected to high bandwidth transimpedance amplifiers. For example, the high bandwidth transimpedance amplifiers may provide a rise time of less than 175 ps. As such, the UF-PD advantageously do not suffer the rise time problems of PMTs. Moreover, the additional sensitivity provided by PMTs are not required since protein concentrations are relatively high in most purification procedures, and since the present invention utilises a pulsed laser light measurement.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0082">In the course of the development of the apparatus of the present invention, the inventor's realised a conflict between wanting to increase the intensity of the laser to boost the signal detected by the detector, and the need to decrease the intensity of the light source, to reduce damage to the capillary. Advantageously, the light is focused into the flow cell to increase the intensity of the pulse within the flow cell, while avoiding damage to the flow cell itself.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0083">As such, the inventor's also found that reflectors can enhance the sensitivity of the apparatus of the invention. For instance, an ellipsoidal reflector may be used to surround the capillary to collect as much light as possible from a solid angle and direct it towards the detector. As the skilled person will appreciate, other shaped light reflectors and lenses may also be used to direct a large proportion of the fluorescent light towards the detector.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0084">Moreover, the laser had unexpected consequences for the design of the liquid flow system of the apparatus of the present invention. For example, the inventors found that if the laser is focused to a spot on the capillary then it etches away the glass and eventually causes the capillary to break. The inventors solved this problem by focusing the laser to a point which was not coincident with the capillary so that a larger area on the capillary is illuminated and therefore the energy per unit area is reduced. For instance, the light source may be focused either in front of or behind the capillary. In the course of development of the apparatus of the present invention, the inventors' also trialed a curved-capillary design to limit shadowing of the emission by the capillary, but this design is particularly prone to damage, and so a straight capillary is used instead.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0085">The invention includes the combination of the aspects and preferred features described except where such a combination is clearly impermissible or expressly avoided.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0084" num="0086">Embodiments and experiments illustrating the principles of the invention will now be discussed with reference to the accompanying figures in which:</p><p id="p-0085" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic of the apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>show distinct fluorescence decay curve generated for BSA and Ova respectively.

In this way, the apparatus <b>100</b> forms a TRIF chromatograph comprising a liquid flow, optical, electronic, and signal processing sub-assemblies, as detailed below.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0104">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the apparatus <b>100</b> comprises: a light arrangement <b>108</b> capable of emitting pulses <b>110</b> of light at a wavelength in the range 240-290 nm. In a preferred embodiment, the light arrangement <b>108</b> is capable of emitting pulses <b>110</b> of light at a wavelength in the range in the range 250-280 nm. In another preferred embodiment, the light arrangement <b>108</b> is capable of emitting pulses <b>110</b> of light at a wavelength of 266 nm. The one or more detectors <b>112</b> are responsive to light at wavelengths between 300 nm and 400 nm and are configured to measure the fluorescence intensity of the sample of interest <b>103</b>. The one or more detectors <b>112</b> are capable of taking a series of measurements, each measurement spanning a sub-nanosecond time interval. The apparatus <b>100</b> further comprises a trigger system capable of initiating the first measurement before the signal from the fluorescence measurements arrives at the digitizer.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0105">The apparatus <b>100</b> may comprise a sample <b>103</b> of interest, comprising a protein of interest in a mixture of proteins, addressed by an excitation light produced by the light arrangement <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0106">The labelled line indicates a light path <b>110</b> as travelled and directed by beam shaping optics of the apparatus <b>100</b> arrangement of the present invention. In other words, the light path <b>110</b> indicates a light beam path of the excitation light directed towards the sample <b>103</b> of interest. The light paths <b>109</b> indicate two example trajectories taken by the fluorescent light emitted by the sample <b>103</b> of interest after the sample <b>103</b> has been addressed by an excitation light <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0107">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the beam shaping optics may comprise the following optical components: a beam splitter <b>114</b>, beam shaping lenses <b>106</b>, beam steering mirrors <b>105</b>, and a focusing lens <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example trajectory of excitation light <b>110</b> in the apparatus <b>100</b>, which is as follows: i) the excitation light <b>110</b> is emitted by the light arrangement <b>108</b>, ii) the excitation light <b>110</b> is reflected by a first beam steering mirror <b>105</b> towards a beam splitter <b>114</b>, iii) the beam splitter <b>114</b> splits a first portion of the excitation light <b>110</b> off towards a photodiode <b>107</b>, and iv) the remaining (second) portion of the excitation light <b>110</b> traverses two beam shaping lenses <b>106</b>, and is v) directed by a second and third beam steering mirrors <b>105</b>, towards the focusing lens <b>104</b>, vi) the focusing lens <b>104</b> focusses the remaining portion of the excitation light <b>110</b> onto the sample <b>103</b> of interest. As the skilled person will appreciate, the apparatus <b>100</b> may comprise variations of the optical configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, the previously described beam shaping optics may comprise a variation in the type, number, or order of the optical components used.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0108">In this embodiment, the light arrangement <b>108</b> outputs an electronic trigger, which is an electronic signal generated in response to the emission of the excitation light pulse <b>110</b>. However, there may be some variation in the time between the excitation light <b>110</b> (or excitation light pulse <b>110</b>) being emitted and the trigger being sent. This is called trigger jitter and it may decrease the accuracy of the measurements. For this reason, the inventors have devised an alternative strategy for generating the trigger. To do this, the beam splitter <b>114</b> is placed in the path of the excitation light <b>110</b> which partially reflects some of the light onto the photodiode <b>107</b>, and the voltage across a load resistor in response to the excitation light pulse <b>110</b> may then be used as the trigger for the sampling oscilloscope or the high-bandwidth digitizer. In other words, the apparatus comprises a beam splitter <b>114</b> configured to split the emitted pulses of laser light (or the excitation light <b>110</b>) into first and second portions, where the first portion is directed to a photodiode and the second portion is directed towards the protein of interest in the mixture of proteins.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0109">Light paths <b>109</b> represents the intrinsic fluorescence emission signal as emitted by the protein of interest and other proteins in the mixture of proteins due to the excitation of the aromatic residues belonging to those proteins. The sample <b>103</b> of interest is preferably a protein of interest in a mixture of proteins, such as that eluted from a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) column <b>111</b>. For example, the SEC column <b>111</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is connected to a capillary <b>113</b>, via tubing (not shown in the Figures), through which the eluate is flowed. In this way, the proteins flow from the SEC column <b>111</b>, through the tubing, and into the capillary <b>113</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the SEC column <b>111</b> is a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) column connected to a FPLC pump, and the capillary is a polymer coated UV-fused silica capillary. A FPLC column is used in instead of a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column. HPLC columns are used extensively in the art, but are often not appropriate for protein purification because the high pressures and solvents required cause proteins to irreversibly denature. The inventors chose FPLC over HPLC as FPLC is more appropriate for manufacturing of proteins, but as the skilled person will appreciate, HPLC and other modes of liquid chromatography could be used instead of FPLC. Advantageously, by using the SEC column <b>111</b> the elution times correlate appropriately with the hydrodynamic volume of the proteins.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0110">A time interval between the fluorescence measurement and the preceding input trigger plus a fixed time may optionally be recorded. The time interval between the preceding light pulse and the input trigger may be fixed (or is a constant) for each measurement.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0111">To illustrate an example operation of the previously described embodiment; the light arrangement <b>108</b> (e.g. a laser) emits a pulse of light <b>110</b>. The beam splitter <b>114</b> directs some of this pulse of light <b>110</b> to the photodiode <b>107</b>. A cable length running from the photodiode <b>107</b> to the sampling oscilloscope has a constant length, and the distance between the laser <b>108</b> and the photodiode <b>107</b> is constant. As such, the time between the pulse <b>110</b> being emitted from the laser <b>108</b> and the input trigger arriving at the sampling oscilloscope is also constant. Once the input trigger arrives at the sampling oscilloscope it may start taking measurements. In this way, the apparatus optionally comprises a trigger system capable of initiating measurements, where the trigger system is preferably triggered by the onset of the excitation-light pulse. For example, if the trigger system takes longer to trigger the sampling oscilloscope than the time taken for the fluorescence signal to arrive at the sampling oscilloscope, then the cable between the photodiode <b>107</b> and the sampling oscilloscope may simply be shortened to compensate for this time difference. If the time taken for the trigger system to trigger the sampling oscilloscope is much shorter than the time taken for the fluorescence signal to arrive at the sampling oscilloscope, then the cable between the photodiode <b>107</b> and the sampling oscilloscope may simply be lengthened to compensate for this time difference.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0112">Alternatively, the sampling oscilloscope may not be required to start measuring immediately, and may instead operate after a time delay (e.g. via programming the oscilloscope's operational software) so that it is configured to &#x201c;wait&#x201d; for the sample's fluorescence signal <b>109</b> to arrive at the sampling oscilloscope. As such, the &#x201c;start time&#x201d; is initiated before the fluorescence signal <b>109</b> has arrived at the sampling oscilloscope and is the same constant time after the laser pulse <b>110</b> is emitted from the laser <b>108</b>. In this way, data files may record the time since the &#x201c;start time&#x201d; which is the relevant time quantity. As such, there may be no requirement for the apparatus to measure the time between the preceding light pulse <b>110</b> and the &#x201c;start time&#x201d;. Advantageously, this avoids the length of the cables between the photodiode <b>107</b> and the sampling oscilloscope being a critical parameter in the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0113">In an optional embodiment, the capillary <b>113</b> may be initially optically covered by a polymer coating which prevents any incident light reaching the sample <b>103</b> of interest in order to avoid a fluorescence emission being induced, and escaping from the sample <b>103</b>, prematurely. The sample <b>103</b> of interest may subsequently be exposed in a controlled way by removing (e.g. melting an area) of the polymer coating on the capillary <b>113</b> with a flame to create an optical window, for example. In this way, the incident excitation light <b>110</b> is subsequently exposed to the proteins eluted into the capillary <b>113</b> from the SEC column <b>111</b> which then induces the intrinsic fluorescence emission <b>109</b> in a controlled way. One advantage of this embodiment is that scattered excitation light cannot be reflected to another point along the material through which the liquid is being flowed and optically excite the proteins. This is advantageous because, if that were to happen, it can make the data analysis more complicated and it might also lead to photobleaching or quenching of the sample <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0114">An optical reflector <b>102</b> is positioned around the sample <b>103</b> of interest in order to collect and direct (e.g. by optical reflection) the emission <b>109</b> of the sample <b>103</b> towards one or more detectors <b>112</b> of the apparatus <b>100</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an ellipsoidal reflector <b>102</b> (as produced by Newport&#x2122;) is used, however as the skilled person will appreciate, other shaped reflectors or mirrors or lenses may also be possible. The one or more detectors <b>112</b> then converts the detected light of the emission <b>109</b> into an electrical current and/or voltage output signal which is then recorded and analysed.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0115">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the one or more detectors <b>112</b> may comprise one or more ultra-fast photodiodes (UF-PDs). In this way, the ellipsoidal reflector <b>102</b> reflects the fluorescence emission <b>109</b> towards the one or more UF-PDs <b>112</b> connected to an electronic sub-assembly (not labelled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The inventors used an ellipsoidal reflector <b>102</b> to collect as much emitted light as possible. This is advantageous as the UF-PDs <b>112</b> are less responsive to light than a PMT and no additional shielding from environmental light is required. As the skilled person will appreciate, there are numerous options for achieving the same goal though, for instance 4&#x3c0; techniques or even confocal optics with a UV-fused silica objective.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0116">In realising the apparatus <b>100</b> of the present invention, the inventors have constructed an experimental analytical set-up to monitor chromatographic eluants using TRF that enables the real-time quantification of the contributions from multiple protein species to the fluorescence decay measurement. The inventors have designed the optical configuration, selected the light sources, the detectors, the optical components, and have written the software to analyse the data. In the broadest terms, the layout of the apparatus <b>100</b> comprises the following: a sample <b>103</b>, comprising a protein of interest in a mixture of proteins, addressed by an excitation light <b>110</b>. To illustrate, the inventors used a light arrangement <b>108</b> in the form of a nanosecond pulsed laser with emission in the region 250 nm to 290 nm. This advantageously generated excitation light pulses <b>110</b> with sufficient energy for the resulting fluorescence to be measurable across the range of protein concentrations of interest (e.g. between 0.01 and 500 mg/ml).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0117">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the light source <b>108</b> is a diode pumped Q-switched solid state laser <b>108</b>. For example, the laser <b>108</b> may be a solid-state laser system (as produced by CryLaS&#x2122;) that produces pulsed laser light <b>110</b>, as indicated by the excitation light <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In this way, the laser <b>108</b> produces excitation light <b>110</b> in the form of excitation pulses with a certain pulse width at a wavelength of 266 nm. The laser pulse width may be less than 10 ns, preferably less than 5 ns, further preferably less than 2 ns. For example, the laser pulse width may be preferably more than 1 ns but less than 2 ns, and more preferably approximately 1.1 ns.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0118">The excitation light <b>110</b> may be focused, via the focusing lens <b>104</b>, on to an optical transparent window (not shown in the figures) located on the capillary <b>113</b>. In an example embodiment, the optical transparent window may be a capillary with a 360 &#x3bc;m bore. Preferably the pulse energy of each pulse of the excitation light <b>110</b> is 55 microjoules (&#x3bc;J) and has a repetition rate is 70 Hz. As the skilled person will appreciate, these parameter values may vary, and were chosen for optimisation reasons. For example, 55 &#x3bc;J is chosen as it is the maximum pulse energy of the laser <b>108</b> used. Through trial and error, the inventors found that a frequency of 70 Hz to be a good repetition rate for maintaining laser stability of the laser <b>108</b>. In future manifestations, much higher repetition rates, and possibly lower excitation pulse energies, may be used. Advantageously, a higher repetition rate may allow for more measurements to be taken, whereas using lower pulse energies may be less damaging to the optics and capillary. As the skilled person will further appreciate, there may be some pulse-to-pulse variability in the excitation energy and period of the laser <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0119">Diode pumped Q-switched solid state lasers can advantageously produce a pulsed output beam of excitation light <b>110</b>, where each light excitation pulse <b>110</b> has an extremely high peak power (e.g. a kilowatt peak power, 50 &#x3bc;J/1 ns=50 kW). Advantageously, this is a much higher power output than would be produced by the same laser if it are operating in a continuous wave (constant output) mode. In an example embodiment, the diode pumped Q-switched solid state laser is a frequency quadrupled diode-pumped neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:Y<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>) or &#x2018;Nd:YAG&#x2019; laser that generates light at 266 nm.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0120">In a preferred embodiment, the emission <b>109</b> passes through a filter assembly <b>114</b> before it reaches one or more UF-PDs <b>112</b> of the apparatus <b>100</b>. Since the filter assembly <b>114</b> is positioned before (e.g. in front of) the one or more UF-PDs <b>112</b>, they block any excitation light <b>110</b> from entering the one or more UF-PDs <b>112</b>. In devising the present invention, the inventors realised that stray light may enter the sample, particular at 532 nm and 1064 nm wavelengths. This stray light can be problematic as it makes it difficult to distinguish between signal generated by fluorescence from the sample and by background light (e.g. light generated by the light source itself). The inventors solved this problem by introducing a filter assembly for blocking light, particularly at 266 nm, but also at 532 nm and 1064 nm wavelengths. This advantageously prevented light from the laser impinging on the one or more detectors. In an example embodiment, the filter assembly <b>114</b> comprising the long-pass and/or short-pass filters, as previously described. Alternatively, or additionally, the filter assembly <b>114</b> may comprise a band-pass dielectric filter. In this way, the inventors performed the necessary optical and electronic calculations and selected a laser accordingly. In addition, considerable trial and error went into focusing the laser onto the flow cell to increase the intensity of the pulse within the flow cell, while avoiding damage to the flow cell itself.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0121">In an example embodiment, the filter assembly <b>114</b> may be a long-pass and a short-pass dielectric filter (as produced by Semrock&#x2122;). In this way, the intrinsic fluorescence decay emission may be reflected by an ellipsoidal reflector <b>102</b>, via the filter assembly <b>114</b>, and towards the one or more UF-PDs <b>112</b>. Alternatively, the filter assembly <b>114</b> may be a neutral density filter (as produced by Thorlabs&#x2122;) that enables enough light to impinge the one or more UF-PDs <b>112</b> for the excitation to be detectable so that the pulse width of the excitation can be accurately measured using the same detector electronics.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0122">In the literature, photomultipliers tubes (PMTs) are often used when the detector has been explicitly stated. In those cases where it was not stated, measurements are instead made with a stand-alone spectrometer. A drawback of PMTs are that they typically have rise times longer than 1 ns. It is a known problem in the art to try eliminate background signals, due to the sensitivity of PMTs to low light levels. The one or more UF-PDs <b>112</b> used in the present application may be connected to high bandwidth transimpedance amplifiers (not shown in the figures). For example, the high bandwidth transimpedance amplifiers may be configured to provide a rise time of less than 175 ps. As such, the UF-PD advantageously do not suffer the slow rise time problems of PMTs. Moreover, the additional sensitivity provided by PMTs is not required since protein concentrations are relatively high in most purification procedures, and since the present invention utilises a pulsed laser light measurement. In an example embodiment, the current output from the one or more UF-PDs <b>112</b> is amplified by a 2.2 GHz transimpedance amplifier in order to generate a voltage for digitization by a 12 GHz sampling oscilloscope (as produced by Pico Technology&#x2122;).</p><p id="p-0121" num="0123">In realising the present invention, the inventors selected UF-PDs <b>112</b> with a sufficiently high bandwidth and responsivity to light at wavelengths between 300 nm and 400 nm.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0124">The inventors also realised that there is some stray light at 532 nm and 1064 nm. This may have been problematic as it makes it difficult to distinguish signal generated by the fluorescence and signal generated by the background light from the laser. The inventors solved this problem by introducing a filter assembly <b>114</b> so that the apparatus not only blocked the 266 nm light but also the 532 nm and 1064 nm light from the laser from impinging on the ultra-fast photodiode. In this way, the inventors performed the necessary optical and electronic calculations and selected a laser accordingly. In addition, considerable trial and error went into focusing the laser onto the flow cell to increase the intensity of the pulse within the flow cell, while avoiding damage to the flow cell itself.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0125">In a preferred embodiment, the sampling oscilloscope has a 16 bit ADC resolution and measures sub-nanosecond (&#x3c;200 ps) time intervals when triggered at times corresponding to when the excitation pulse <b>110</b> is emitted. This allows the method of the present invention to advantageously remove background noise compared to a continuous-wave system, where 1 s of background is measured every second.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0126">The sampling oscilloscope may optionally have a time resolution of 120 ps and voltage resolution of 16 bit from <b>256</b> excitation pulses in less than 5 seconds. The maximum and minimum voltage may be adjusted between lifetime measurements to maximise the voltage resolution without saturating the digitizer. Preferably, a voltage range of the digitizer (e.g. a sampling oscilloscope) may be scalable in order to modulate, or adjust, the detection sensitivity to signal strength (e.g. in accordance with different protein concentrations). The scaling of the voltage range is done such that the signal advantageously fills the digitizer without exceeding the maximum or minimum voltages, but the intensity of signal changes between measurements. In an example embodiment, an operational software of the invention may comprise two &#x2018;layers&#x2019; of software that work together; an operational software of the sampling oscilloscope and another software program (written by the inventors). The operational software of the sampling oscilloscope may be responsible for sending commands that result in the voltage range being adjusted. The other software program (written by the inventors) works out what the voltage range should be, and then communicates this with the operational software of the sampling oscilloscope in order to initiate the appropriate voltage range adjustments. For example, the operational software of the sampling oscilloscope may be configured to adjust the voltage range before each measurement begins, so that the voltage range is suitable for the upcoming measurement. To illustrate a working example, if the peak of the signal is at 0.07 V, then it is undesirable to set a maximum voltage of 1 V because many of the levels of the digitizer would not be used. Instead, in this scenario, a maximum voltage of 0.1 V would provide a better resolution because more the levels of the digitizer are used. Later on, the maximum voltage may be set to 0.4 V, in which case the signal would not be fully recorded if the maximum was 0.1 V, so it would need to be updated prior to the measurement.

In this way, the fluorescence decay curve may be fitted to a single-exponential or double-exponential model. More than two exponentials could also be envisaged if the complexity of the sample requires it.

DC-2 shows the first (triangle symbols) and second (square symbols) exponential decay times also known as decay components. The single exponential (DC-1) model may be fitted retrospectively to the decay curves after they had all been recorded, or it may be fitted in real-time. In the experiments carried out in the development of the present invention, the decays times from the 2 decay-component model determined for BSA were found to be 0.520 ns and 7.10 ns, and for Ova were found to be 0.900 ns and 5.66 ns, respectively (and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>c </i>and <b>4</b><i>d</i></figref>); the first decay-component contribution from the 2 decay-component model determined for BSA was found to be 0.030, and for Ova was found to be 0.178, respectively (and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>e</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0135" num="0137">The DAC shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>f </i></figref>illustrates the variation in the total fluorescence intensity associated with each individual protein species, as a function of the elution volume. In this example, the DAC is generated by fitting the a double decay-component model similar to the DC-2 to each decay curve, but with the time decays and first decay-component contribution fixed to the characteristic values for BSA and Ova determined previously from a retrospective DC-2 analysis. Two factors of the resulting fitted model are each then proportional to the total fluorescence intensity emitted by one or the other of the two protein species, and so DAC quantifies the elution profile of each protein species. In this example, the DAC is calculated after all of the decays curves had been recorded, but if the characteristic decay times of the proteins species are known in advance, by measuring standard materials for example, then the DAC could be generated in real-time. The resolving power of the apparatus <b>100</b> of the present invention may be realised by measuring the TFCs, DCs and DACs (e.g. for BSA and Ova) when they are deliberately co-eluted from the SEC column <b>111</b>, as is described later.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0138">The mixture may comprise more than one protein, which each have a different intrinsic fluorescence decay signature.

Advantageously, the method of the present invention can quantify proteins in a mixture and may not just be limited to chromatography. For example, the DACs may be used for this analysis. In this way, decay parameters/optical signatures of the two proteins may be already known, and each fluorescence lifetime measurement may be curve fitted by summing together two decay curves, each corresponding to the lifetime expected for one or the other of the proteins based on their respective optical signatures. The amount of each decay curve required to accurately fit a particular lifetime curve may determine how much of each protein is present at that time, and this may be plotted in the DAC.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0139">Deconvolution Analysis Algorithms:</p><p id="p-0138" num="0140">In realising the present invention, the inventors devised a deconvolution analysis algorithms of evaluating data recorded by the previously described apparatus <b>100</b>.

The inventors have therefore advantageously developed algorithms that can fit the data concurrently with data acquisition, enabling real-time product monitoring and pooling decisions (and performing the data analysis thereby may form part of the methods of the invention). The inventors have also developed analytical tools that can quantify individual proteins species as they are eluted from the column, even if they fully co-elute with another protein species, and without making any assumptions about the elution profile. In this way, the method of the present invention advantageously allows for a contribution (or proportion) of each protein of interest to total protein in the mixture to be calculated from the fluorescence decay curve. For example, software has been written that implements curve fitting in real-time as the data was being collected, and the acquisition time of each data point in the chromatogram may be between &#x2dc;3 s and &#x2dc;6 s, depending on the temporal resolution requested. The software may also be configured to store the data onto a memory (on a computer-readable memory, for example) for off-line analysis or further analysis at a later time.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0160">Deconvolution Analysis Method:</p><p id="p-0177" num="0161">According to another of the invention, there is a method of quantifying the concentration of a protein of interest, or of a conformational state of a protein of interest, in a mixture, wherein the protein of interest or conformational state has an intrinsic fluorescence decay signature.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0162">The method comprises: addressing the mixture with one or more pulses of light, wherein the light has a wavelength in the 240-295 nm range, preferably in the 250-280 nm range, further preferably wherein the laser light has a wavelength of 266 nm.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0163">The method further comprises: taking a series of measurements of the fluorescence intensity of the mixture at a series of time points where the time interval between a fluorescence measurement and the preceding light pulse is recorded.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0164">The series of measurements comprises measurements for which the time intervals differ from each other by less than a nanosecond, and where the difference between largest and smallest time intervals is at least 10 nanoseconds (ns) and/or a sufficient time to detect a decay of the fluorescence intensity towards a baseline level, such that the series of measurements defines a fluorescence decay curve.

For the DACs, the darker shaded traces represents the TFC minus the background contribution as determined by equation (16), and the lighter shade traces represent the elution profiles of BSA and Ova, respectively.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0174">In one example, BSA is injected 4 ml before Ova and the TFC contains two distinct peaks (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a</i></figref>) which could be identified as BSA or Ova from the accompanying DC-1 trace, which contained two flat traces at the characteristic decay time of each protein species (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>b</i></figref>). The DC-1 trace may be flat across the elution volume for each TFC peak, indicating that each peak contained pure protein. The widths of the elution peaks in the TFCs resulted in loss of base-line separation when the volume separating the injection of each protein species may be less than 2.0 ml. The DC-1 traces transitioned between the two characteristics decay constants, appearing sloped, where the TFC peaks partially overlapped, indicating that mixtures of the two proteins are being eluted. The DC-1 traces converged to flat lines when the peaks ceased to overlap, demonstrating that the DC-1 traces can be used to assess protein purity.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0175">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, when BSA is injected 0.8 ml before Ova, the two protein species co-eluted almost exactly, such that only a single peak is observed in the TFC. The DC-1 trace contained a sharp change in the decay time, which indicated that the single TFC peak did not contain a single, pure protein species, and that it contained at least two poorly resolved proteins.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0176">The goodness-of-the-fit to lifetime measurements is typically improved by using a two decay-component model instead of a single decay-component model, so the combination of the fluorescence decay times &#x3c4;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x3c4;<sub>2 </sub>(as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>c </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>d </i></figref>respectively) alongside the weighting &#x3b2; of the first decay component (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>e</i></figref>) can be used to characterise the time-profile of the intrinsic fluorescence of different protein species. The parameters &#x3c4;<sub>1</sub>, &#x3c4;<sub>2</sub>, and &#x3b2; can be used to uniquely characterise different proteins species as they are dependent only on the optical properties of the aromatic residues of the proteins in their environment only. This can be utilised to construct the DACs which trace the contribution of each of j protein species to the TFC. DACs require prior information on the &#x3c4;<sub>j1</sub>, &#x3c4;<sub>j2 </sub>and &#x3b2;<sub>j </sub>parameters for each of the j protein species eluted from the chromatographic column but do not make any assumptions about the elution profile of each species. DACs are prepared by fitting the lifetime measurements with equation (8) with &#x3b2;, &#x3c4;<sub>j1 </sub>and &#x3c4;<sub>j2 </sub>fixed and the parameters &#x3b3;<sub>j </sub>free to vary. The contribution of the j<sup>th </sup>protein species could then be calculated using equation (14), which is then plotted against elution volume (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>f</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0193" num="0177">For example, the data set from the experiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may be re-analysed to determine the &#x3c4;<sub>1</sub>, &#x3c4;<sub>2 </sub>and &#x3b2; parameters for BSA and Ova since there is no overlap in their elution profiles in this run.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0178">The parameters used for the DAC analysis are the fit parameters for the decay measurements closest to the peak positions in the TFC, which are determined by fitting the TFC using an exponentially modified Gaussian function. For BSA: &#x3c4;1=0.520327 ns, &#x3c4;2=7.10122 ns, and &#x3b2;3=0.03012; and for Ova: &#x3c4;1=0.900353 ns, &#x3c4;2=5.65585 ns, and &#x3b2;=0.17753. The DAC shows the variation in the total fluorescence intensity associated with each individual protein species, as a function of the elution volume (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>f</i></figref>). In this example, the DAC is calculated after all of the decays curves had been recorded, but if the characteristic parameters of the proteins species are known in advance, by measuring standard materials for example, then the DAC could be generated in real-time.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0179">In this way, the method may optionally use 256 or 512 pulses to build-up a measurement of the fluorescence lifetime and provides an accurate readout of the fluorescence intensity.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0180">The present invention has numerous advantages over known analytical methods which use frequency-domain measurements, which is the most common strategy employed in PAH detection, for example. To illustrate, frequency-domain measurements require continuous-wave, instead of pulsed excitation sources, and therefore either require significantly more sensitive detectors, or require much higher excitation powers for signal recovery. Moreover, these known methods are also required to be optically and electronically isolated from the environment to eliminate DC noise sources and contributions from common electrically frequencies such as 50 Hz, and the modulation of the excitation source would have needed to be purely sinusoidal to prevent the generation of harmonics. In this way, the present invention realises many advantages over known detection methods.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0181">The DAC trace, which represents the amplitudes for each decay in the signal, is able to resolve the two proteins regardless of whether there is full, partial or no overlap between the TFC peaks, providing in fine detail, the elution profile of each protein species that contributed to the overall elution profile shown in the TFC.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0182">There are secondary peaks in the elution profiles of both individual protein preparations, which are most likely non-covalently formed dimers. These species could be monitored accurately with DAC but not by DC or TFC. For instance, when Ova is injected 0.8 ml after BSA, the DAC trace shows that the secondary peak of Ova fully co-elutes with BSA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>f</i></figref>, column <b>5</b>), whereas this could not be deduced from the TFC or DC traces.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0183">The inventors tested whether DACs could accurately determine the concentration of each co-eluting protein species by injecting different concentrations of BSA and Ova into the apparatus <b>100</b> such that they always fully co-eluted from the SEC column <b>111</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a quantification of co-eluting protein species. In two experiments, a series of BSA and Ova samples at different concentrations are injected into the SEC column <b>111</b> such that the BSA and Ova elution profiles are fully overlapping.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0184">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the TFCs of the (a) first and (c) second experiment, the separate elution profiles are indistinguishable, but in the DACs (b) and (d) traces for BSA and Ova can be deconvoluted. Moving from left to right along the X-axis (as indicated by the arrow), the BSA concentrations are 1 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL and 0.5 mg/mL, and the Ova concentrations are 5 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, 3 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL. For the second experiment, the BSA concentrations are 5 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL, 4 mg/mL, 3 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL, and the Ova concentrations are 0.5 mg/mL, 2 mg/mL, 4 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0185">For each set of injections, only a single primary peak is visible in the TFC (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>a </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>c</i></figref>) but the elution of each protein species could be tracked in the accompanying DAC (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>b </i></figref>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>d</i></figref>). Since the DAC traces deconvolves the TFC into separate elution profiles for each protein species without making assumptions about the elution profile, it is possible to fit the DACs using a peak shape function to quantity each protein species. The DAC peaks may be fitted using an exponentially modified Gaussian function.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0186"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a graph of peak areas (as measured in arbitrary units a.u.) plotted against protein concentration (as measured in &#x3bc;M). More specifically, the area under each of the primary peaks for the DAC traces for BSA (diamond-shaped scatter points) and Ova (triangle-shaped scatter points) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> have been plotted against the known concentration of the injected sample <b>103</b> in the SEC column <b>111</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the linear fits for the BSA (dark line) and Ova (light line) to the different scatter plots illustrate how the peak area is linearly proportional to the concentration of each protein species.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0187">The quantity of each proteins species is proportional to the area under the peak, which varies linearly with the protein concentration injected (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). The gradient depended on the number of aromatic residues per protein and their quantum yield with pumping at 266 nm. In this way, the quantification of the concentration of the protein of interest or of a concentration of the conformational state of the protein of interest may comprise calculating the area under the deconvoluted portion of the fluorescence decay curve that corresponds to the intrinsic fluorescence decay signature.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0188">In this way, the method of the present invention advantageously allows the absolute quantity of the protein of interest to be estimated as the area under the curve may be proportional to the concentration. The fluorescence intensity may be calculated from determining the area under the fluorescence lifetime curve, and this correlates with the amount of protein. The identity of the proteins may be determined from the fluorescence lifetime characteristics. In short, the fluorescence lifetime data may be fitted to a model which has three parameters that are characteristic to the protein. These three parameters may therefore be an optical signature for the protein.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0189">In one embodiment, a time period of each of the multiple calculations may be less than 10 seconds. In another example embodiment, the instrument may collect a series of fluorescence lifetime measurements every 4 to 5 second, but this then needs to be interpreted to generate chromatograms for the individual proteins.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0190">The concentration of more than one protein may be quantified. In this way, the method of the present invention is advantageously applicable to protein solutions comprising multiple different varieties, or types, of proteins. The method is also advantageously applicable to at a wide range of protein concentrations which ensures that it may be relevant to the fields of bioprocessing or food industry research, for example.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0191">The concentrations of the proteins may be quantified by deconvoluting more than one intrinsic fluorescence decay signature from a single fluorescence decay curve. The method of the present invention may not be limited to analysing two protein species. For example, two optical signatures may be input, but more than two protein species may be identified. A lifetime measurement of an ensemble of different proteins may be acquired and the data can be fitted as though there may only be one additional protein species present in the sample along with the target protein of interest (e.g. in the sample of interest <b>103</b>). For example, the method may be able to attribute an optical signature to the cell lysate, and then generate DACs as previously described, possibly without the chromatography column, except that one curve may be the cell lysate and the other may be the protein of interest.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0192">Ideally, the excitation pulse would be as short as possible because this is a time-resolved measurement. However, the inventors have devised a method which advantageously provides a trade-off between the energy of the pulse, its pulse length, and the cost of the laser system. For example, using a nanosecond pulsed laser may affect the data analysis as the pulse length (e.g. in the region of &#x2dc;1 ns) may be longer than a typical first decay components (e.g. in the region of 0.4 ns to 0.9 ns), and not much shorter than a typical second decay component (e.g. in the region of 2 ns to 7 ns). Consequently, the output may be a convolution of the time profile of the excitation pulse, the fluorescence lifetime of the sample, and the instrument response of the detector electronics. This impacts the data analysis because the data has to be fitted to a different model. It also affects the apparatus design because a mechanism for measuring the impulse response of the system has to be devised. In this way, the inventors have designed the apparatus configuration to make it possible to detect very subtle differences between the proteins. In general, the more accurately the lifetime measurements can be acquired, the more accurately the optical signatures can be initially determined, and the more accurately the amount of each protein at a given time can be calculated.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0193">In one embodiment, the intrinsic fluorescence decay signature of the protein of interest may be determined by addressing a sample of interest <b>103</b>, comprising the protein of interest and essentially no other proteins, with a laser pulse <b>110</b> (or excitation pulse <b>110</b>) as described previously, and taking the series of measurements of the fluorescence intensity of the sample of interest <b>103</b> as described previously.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0194">In another embodiment, the deconvolution of the fluorescence decay curve comprises statistical modelling of the fluorescence decay curve for quantifying two, or more than two co-eluting proteins. Advantageously, the method of the present invention can quantify more than two co-eluting proteins enabled by simultaneous measurement of both the time decay and the fluorescence intensity.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example Application (Experimental Method)</heading><p id="p-0211" num="0195"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example experimental application of the previously described apparatus <b>100</b> of the present invention when used in combination with the previously described deconvolution analysis, and when applied to two co-eluting protein species, namely BSA and Ova. Sample preparation of the sample of interest <b>103</b> includes dissolving BSA and Ova (as supplied by Sigma Aldrich UK) into one or more buffer solutions. Each buffer solution may be prepared by dissolving buffer salts (as supplied by Sigma Aldrich UK) in ultrapure water (&#x3e;18 M&#x3a9;&#xb7;cm).

For each experiment, a new fluorescence intensity and lifetime measurement would begin as soon as the previous measurement finished as the sample is continuously eluted from the chromatographic column. For example, the width of the elution peak is typically much wider than the &#x2dc;33 &#x3bc;L eluted between measurements. Each lifetime measurement is tagged with a record of the time that the measurement is taken.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0197">In the present invention, the elution volume of each protein species is controlled by injecting them into the column at different times, with a fixed flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. In one example, BSA is injected 4 ml before Ova, and the TFC contained two distinct peaks which could be identified as BSA or Ova from the accompanying DC trace, which contained two flat traces at the characteristic decay time of each protein species.

Additionally, by generating decay-associated chromatograms (DACs) in real-time, the elution profile of two different protein species can be monitored independently, even when they fully or partially co-elute. This overcomes a major shortcoming of chromatograms measured by UV-absorption or intrinsic fluorescence intensity, as these can only monitor the total amount of protein eluted. Whilst the capital cost of a TRF chromatogram is often greater than that of a conventional UV-absorption chromatogram due to the UV laser and the high bandwidth electronics, the cost of operation is comparable. TRF-based chromatography is well placed to be used as a process analytical technology for monitoring the product concentration in continuous manufacturing processes, or for making accurate peak-cutting and fraction pooling decisions in batch purification processes. In this way, the concentration of the protein of interest or the concentration of a conformational state of the protein of interest may be calculated multiple times, to determine a change in the concentration of the protein of interest over time and/or to determine the concentration of the protein of interest in more than one eluate fraction.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0204">Computer Systems</p><p id="p-0221" num="0205">The systems and methods of the above embodiments may be implemented in a computer system (in particular in computer hardware or in computer software) in addition to the structural components and user interactions described.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0206">The term &#x201c;computer system&#x201d; includes the hardware, software and data storage devices for embodying a system or carrying out a method according to the above described embodiments.
