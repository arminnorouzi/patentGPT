The basin <b>12</b> is configured to be mountable to a supporting structure, such as a post or tree, so that the basin <b>12</b> is substantially horizontal. A drain <b>18</b> is positioned in the basin <b>12</b> and is configured to drain water from the basin <b>12</b>. A fastener <b>20</b> is engaged to a back <b>22</b> of the basin <b>12</b> and is configured to selectively engage the supporting structure so that the basin <b>12</b> is removably mounted to the supporting structure. The fastener <b>20</b> may comprise a strap <b>24</b>, or other fastening means, such as, but not limited to, clamps, brackets, and the like. The strap <b>24</b> has opposed ends <b>26</b>, which are engaged to the back <b>22</b> of the basin <b>12</b>. The strap <b>24</b> is configured to be positioned around the supporting structure and tightened to mount the basin <b>12</b> to the supporting structure. The present invention anticipates the strap <b>24</b> being tightened by means of a ratchet (not shown), or other tightening means. The strap <b>24</b> also is configured to be positioned over a shoulder of a user, allowing the user to transport the basin <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The reservoir <b>14</b> is configured to be mountable to a supporting element, such as a post, a tree, or a branch of the tree, so that the reservoir <b>14</b> is positioned above the basin <b>12</b>. The present invention also anticipates a dedicated support structure (not shown), which is designed specifically to support the basin <b>12</b> and the reservoir <b>14</b>. The faucet module <b>16</b> is engaged to the basin <b>12</b> and is selectively operationally engageable to the reservoir <b>14</b>. The faucet module <b>16</b> is configured to selectively dispense water from the reservoir <b>14</b> into the basin <b>12</b> for use in washing hands, food, and the like, as well as for other cleaning and rinsing purposes. The reservoir <b>14</b> has a top <b>28</b>, which is open. A lid <b>30</b> is selectively engageable to the reservoir <b>14</b> to sealably close the top <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A connector <b>32</b> is engaged to the reservoir <b>14</b> and is configured to selectively engage the supporting element so that the reservoir <b>14</b> is removably mounted to the supporting element. The connector <b>32</b> may comprise a hook <b>34</b>, or other connecting means, such as, but not limited to, straps, brackets, and the like.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A power module <b>36</b> may be engaged to and positioned in the reservoir <b>14</b>. The power module <b>36</b> may comprise a battery <b>38</b>, although the present invention also anticipates the power module <b>36</b> comprising a power cord (not shown) connectable to a source of alternating current. A pump <b>40</b> is engaged to and positioned in the reservoir <b>14</b>. The pump <b>40</b> is operationally engaged to the power module <b>36</b> and is configured to pressurize the reservoir <b>14</b>.

A receptacle <b>54</b> is engaged to the pipe <b>52</b> distal from the basin <b>12</b> so that the receptacle <b>54</b> is fluidically engaged to the basin <b>12</b>. The receptacle <b>54</b> is configured to receive water draining from the basin <b>12</b> through the drain <b>18</b> and the pipe <b>52</b>. The pipe <b>52</b> is rigid so that the pipe <b>52</b> and the receptacle <b>54</b> are positioned to support the basin <b>12</b>, potentially without use of the fastener <b>20</b>. An S-bend <b>56</b> may be positioned in the pipe <b>52</b> so that a segment <b>58</b> of the S-bend <b>56</b> is configured to fill with water to prevent escape of gasses from the receptacle <b>54</b> through the pipe <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the portable sink assembly <b>10</b> also may comprise a shell <b>60</b>, which can be used for showering. The shell <b>60</b> comprises a top piece <b>62</b>, a bottom piece <b>64</b>, and a panel <b>66</b>. The panel <b>66</b> is engaged to and extends between a perimeter <b>68</b> of the top piece <b>62</b> and a circumference <b>70</b> of the bottom piece <b>64</b>. The panel <b>66</b> is pleated and thus is selectively positionable in a deployed configuration and a stowed configuration. In the deployed configuration, the top piece <b>62</b> is positioned distally from the bottom piece <b>64</b>. In the stowed configuration, the top piece <b>62</b> is positioned proximate to the bottom piece <b>64</b>. The bottom piece and the top piece may be rectangularly cup shaped, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, or alternatively shaped, such as circularly cup shaped, ovally cup shaped, and the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">An opening <b>72</b> is positioned in the panel <b>66</b> and is configured for entry of a user. A flap <b>74</b> is engaged to the shell <b>60</b> and is positioned to selectively close the opening <b>72</b>. A closure <b>76</b> is engaged to the shell <b>60</b> and is positioned to selectively engage the flap <b>74</b> to retain the flap <b>74</b> over the opening <b>72</b>. The closure <b>76</b> may comprise a zipper <b>78</b>, or other closing means, such as, but not limited to, magnets, hook and loop fasteners, and the like.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A spray head <b>80</b> is positioned in the shell <b>60</b> and is engaged to the top piece <b>62</b>. A coupler <b>82</b> is engaged to the top piece <b>62</b>. The coupler <b>82</b> is operationally engaged to the spray head <b>80</b> and is positioned to selectively engage the hose <b>50</b> so that the spray head <b>80</b> is fluidically engaged to the reservoir <b>14</b> and is configured to spray a user positioned in the shell <b>60</b>. A tube <b>84</b> is engaged to the bottom piece <b>64</b> and is configured to drain water from the shell <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In use, the portable sink assembly <b>10</b> is transported to a location lacking water and where water is required for handwashing, food preparation, and the like. The basin <b>12</b> and the reservoir <b>14</b> are mounted so that the reservoir <b>14</b> is positioned above the basin <b>12</b>. The pipe <b>52</b> is connected to the basin <b>12</b> and the receptacle <b>54</b>. A user can rely on gravity for flow of water from the reservoir <b>14</b>, or the user can actuate the pump <b>40</b> using the switch <b>42</b> to obtain water under pressure. Used water flows through the drain <b>18</b> and the pipe <b>52</b> and is collected in the receptacle <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of an embodiment enabled by the disclosure, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the disclosure.
