Vehicle members are manufactured by press forming, but not only a forming load is increased but also the formability deteriorates as the strength of a steel sheet is increased. For this reason, the formability of a high-strength steel sheet into a member having a complicated shape becomes an issue. In order to solve this issue, the application of hot stamping technology in which press forming is performed after a steel sheet is heated up to a high temperature of an austenite range where the steel sheet softens is in progress. Hot stamping is attracting attention as technology that achieves both the formability of a steel sheet into a vehicle member and the strength of a vehicle member by performing the hardening of the steel sheet in a die at the same time as press working.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to obtain a higher effect of reducing the weight of a vehicle body from a vehicle member into which a steel sheet is formed by hot stamping, it is necessary to obtain a member that has high strength and is also excellent in collision characteristics.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Document 1 discloses a hot-dip galvanized steel sheet and a hot-dip galvannealed steel sheet that are stabilized by the concentration of C and Mn and are improved in strength. uniform deformability, and local deformability by containing 10% by volume or more of residual austenite, and methods of manufacturing the hot-dip galvanized steel sheet and the hot-dip galvannealed steel sheet.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Document 2 discloses a hot-dip galvannealed steel sheet that is improved in strength, uniform deformability, and local deformability by including residual austenite of 10% by volume or more and including high-temperature tempered martensite and low-temperature tempered martensite at predetermined volume percentages.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Document 3 discloses a high-strength hot press-formed member that is improved in ductility and bendability by including composite structure as the structure of steel and controlling a ratio of each structure of the composite structure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A vehicle member that has excellent strength and is more excellent in collision characteristics than the related art is desired in terms of safety.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">[Patent Document 1] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, First Publication No. 2017-53001</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">[Patent Document 2] PCT International Publication No. WO2016/199922</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">[Patent Document 3] PCT International Publication No. WO2018/033960</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">An object of the present invention is to provide a hot-stamping formed body that is excellent in strength and collision characteristics.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problem</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The gist of the present invention is as follows.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">[1] A hot-stamping formed body according to an aspect of the present invention includes, as a chemical composition, by mass %:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">C: 0.30% to 0.50%;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Si: 0.50% to 3.00%;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Mn: 0.50% to 3.00%;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Al: 0.0002% to 2.000%;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">P: 0.100% or less;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">S: 0.1000% or less;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">N: 0.0100% or less;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Nb: 0% to 0.150%;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Ti: 0% to 0.150%;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Co: 0% to 2.00%;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Mo: 0% to 1.00%;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Cr: 0% to 1.00%;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Cu: 0% to 1.00%;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">V: 0% to 1.00%;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">W: 0% to 1.00%;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Ni: 0% to 3.00%;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Mg: 0% to 1.00%;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Zr: 0% to 1.00%;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Sb: 0% to 1.00%;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Ca: 0% to 0.10%;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">REM: 0% to 0.30%;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">B: 0% to 0.0100%; and</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">a remainder consisting of Fe and impurities; and</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">microstructure which includes residual austenite of which an area ratio is 5% or more and less than 10%, bainite and tempered martensite of which a total area ratio exceeds 90% and is 95% or less, and a remainder in microstructure of which an area ratio is less than 5%, among grain boundaries of crystal grains of the bainite and the tempered martensite, a ratio of a length of a grain boundary having a rotation angle in a range of 55&#xb0; to 75&#xb0; to a total length of a grain boundary having a rotation angle in a range of 4&#xb0; to 12&#xb0;, a grain boundary having a rotation angle in a range of 49&#xb0; to 54&#xb0;, and a grain boundary having a rotation angle in a range of 55&#xb0; to 75&#xb0; to the &#x3c;011&#x3e; direction as a rotation axis is 30% or more.

When austenite is transformed into bainite or martensite, strain associated with the transformation is generated. In a case where austenite before transformation has high hardness or a case where prior austenite grains cannot be deformed, a high angle boundary, which is highly effective in relieving strain, is likely to be formed. The inventors have found that by applying pressure in a predetermined temperature range after hot stamping to make austenite in the state of undeformable, many high angle boundaries can be formed in a case where austenite is transformed into bainite or martensite.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">A hot-stamping formed body according to this embodiment will be described in detail below.

On the other hand, in a case where the Si content exceeds 3.00%, the amount of ferrite is increased. As a result, a desired microstructure is not obtained.
