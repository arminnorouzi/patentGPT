More specifically, the present disclosure relates to vertebral inserts, devices, systems, and methods for repairing and/or replacing intervertebral discs of a patient.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A common procedure for handling pain associated with intervertebral discs that have become degenerated due to various factors such as trauma or aging is the use of intervertebral spacers to fuse, e.g., one or more adjacent vertebral bodies. Generally, to fuse the adjacent vertebral bodies, the native intervertebral disc is first partially or fully removed. An intervertebral spacer is then typically inserted between neighboring vertebrae to maintain normal disc spacing and restore spinal stability, thereby facilitating an intervertebral fusion.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are a number of known conventional intervertebral spacers and methodologies in the art for accomplishing the vertebral fusion. These include screw and rod arrangements, solid bone implants, and intervertebral spacers which include a cage or other implant mechanism which, typically, may be packed with bone and/or bone-growth inducing substances. These devices are implanted between adjacent vertebral bodies in order to fuse the vertebral bodies together, potentially alleviating any associated pain.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, there are drawbacks associated with the known conventional intervertebral spacers and methodologies. For example, some conventional intervertebral spacers may lack sufficient surface area to optimally fuse adjacent vertebral bodies.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure relates to examples of interbody vertebral inserts and related methods of use.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a vertebral insert. The vertebral insert may include a first linkage, a second linkage, and a third linkage. The first, second, and third linkages may at least partially defining a cavity. The insert may be movable between a collapsed configuration and an expanded configuration, and the movement of the first and second linkages with respect to one another may be configured to reciprocally move the insert between the collapsed and expanded configurations.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method of installing an expandable vertebral insert. The method may include inserting the vertebral insert between two vertebral bodies while the vertebral insert is in a collapsed configuration. The vertebral insert may include a first linkage, a second linkage, and a third linkage. The first, second, and third linkages may at least partially define a cavity. The insert may be movable between a collapsed configuration and an expanded configuration. The movement of the first and second linkages with respect to one another may be configured to reciprocally move the insert between the collapsed and expanded configurations. The method also may include expanding the vertebral insert to an expanded configuration such that a cavity defined by the vertebral insert is larger in the expanded configuration than in the collapsed configuration.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a vertebral insert. The vertebral insert may include a support member having a superior surface, an inferior surface, a first groove disposed between the superior surface and inferior surface on a first lateral side, a second groove disposed between the superior surface and inferior surface on a second lateral side, and a first keel extending from one of the superior and inferior surfaces. The vertebral insert also may include a first lateral spacer having a portion configured to extend within the first groove, and a second lateral spacer having a portion configured to extend within the second groove.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a vertebral spacer system. The system may include a vertebral spacer, and a bracket coupled to the vertebral spacer. The system also may include a first plate, and a second plate coupled to the first plate and the bracket. The second plate may be movable relative to the first plate, and the second plate may define a cavity through which the vertebral spacer extends.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method of treating a patient. The method may include attaching a first plate to a first vertebral body, and attaching a second plate to a second vertebral body. The first plate and the second plate may be coupled to one another. The method also may include moving the first and second plates away from one another to distract the first and second vertebral bodies, and inserting a vertebral insert through a cavity defined by the second plate.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In yet another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method of treating a patient. The method may include inserting a vertebral insert into the intervertebral space between two adjacent vertebral bodies, and expanding the vertebral insert to distract the adjacent vertebral bodies. The method also may include inserting a spacer into the intervertebral space, and laterally coupling the spacer to the vertebral insert after expanding the vertebral insert.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate various exemplary embodiments and together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the disclosed embodiments.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a vertebral insert in accordance with an example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of a support member disposed between adjacent vertebral bodies in accordance with an example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>9</b></figref> depict an exemplary method of installing a vertebral insert in accordance with an example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an exploded view of a vertebral insert in accordance with an example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a top view of the vertebral insert of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> with an endplate removed.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is perspective view of a vertebral insert in accordance with an example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>16</b></figref> depict an exemplary method of installing a vertebral insert in accordance with an example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>20</b></figref> depict a vertebral insert in accordance with an example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is a perspective view of a spacer assembly in accordance with an example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>-<b>24</b></figref> are perspective views of a plate assembly in accordance with an example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>-<b>27</b></figref> are perspective views of a bracket and spacer in accordance with an example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>-<b>36</b></figref> depict an exemplary method of installing a spacer assembly in accordance with an example of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Reference will now be made in detail to examples of the present disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.

Support member <b>106</b>, and first and second lateral inserts <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> may be formed from a rigid, bio-compatible material such as, e.g., titanium or polyetheretherketone (PEEK), among others. Support member <b>106</b> and first and second lateral inserts <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> may be formed of the same or different materials. In one example, support member <b>106</b> may be formed from titanium while first and second lateral inserts <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> are formed from PEEK. Components that contact bone, including support member <b>106</b>, and first and second lateral inserts <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, may be treated with a titanium and/or hydroxyapatite plasma spray coating to encourage bony on-growth, improving the strength and stability of the connection between the respective component and the underlying bone (e.g., a vertebral body).

As spacer <b>802</b> is moved between the vertebral bodies, bracket <b>800</b> may abut second plate <b>608</b> of plate assembly <b>600</b>. Further, locking elements <b>676</b> and <b>678</b> may be positioned to extend through elongate cavities <b>806</b> and <b>810</b>. The locking elements <b>676</b> and <b>678</b> may then be moved from an insertion configuration to a locking configuration, thereby securing spacer <b>802</b> between vertebral bodies <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Spacer assembly <b>500</b> may provide one or more of the following advantages, including: an increased tactile feel while distracting, an increased range of distraction height, increased bone graft size and placement, improved radiolucent viewing, decreased stress on endplates and reduced chance of subsidence, and the potential elimination of the need for posterior fixation.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Any aspect set forth in any example may be used with any other example set forth herein. Every device and apparatus set forth herein may be used in a suitable medical procedure, such as, e.g., a vertebral disc replacement procedure, and may be advanced through any suitable body lumen and body cavity.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the disclosed systems and processes without departing from the scope of the disclosure.
