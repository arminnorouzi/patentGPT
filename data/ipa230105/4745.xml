Also, the term &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;have,&#x201d; or &#x201c;having&#x201d; when used in this disclosure specifies the presence of the stated elements, but do not preclude the presence or addition of other elements.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Users may use highlighter pens to physically place highlighting marks on documents. The highlighting marks are used to identify regions of interest to the user. As used here, a &#x201c;highlighting mark&#x201d; can refer to any visual indicator added to focus on a respective image content portion of a document. An &#x201c;image content portion&#x201d; can include text and/or graphics.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A &#x201c;document&#x201d; can refer to a physical substrate (e.g., paper, transparency foil, etc.) on which image content has been printed or an electronic representation that includes image content.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Highlighting marks can be according to various different colors, such as fluorescent colors or other colors. In some cases, a user may highlight different parts of a document by using highlighter pens of respective different colors.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In further examples, instead of using physical highlighter pens to highlight image content portions on a physical document, a user may use a computer or another electronic device to perform highlighting of image content portions of a document (that is in electronic form) while viewing a displayed version of the document. The user can then print the highlighted document using a printer, followed by scanning an image of the highlighted document using a scanner.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">When a highlighted document is scanned, a degradation of the color of a highlighting mark and/or an image content portion highlighted by the highlighting mark may result. In some cases, a scanned version of the documents can produce a scanned image in which the highlighting mark is barely visible or has a muted color.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some examples, a scanner may employ image processing programs of a scanner library (which may be loaded in the scanner) to apply image processing on scanned images in attempts to improve the general quality of the scanned images, for example, reducing noise, sharpening lines and text, and so forth. However, in some cases, image processing programs of a scanner library may further degrade specific areas of image content that contain highlighting marks. The degradation of such areas may result in highlighting marks becoming less visible or less apparent, and/or the image quality of image content portions highlighted by the highlighting marks being reduced.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with some implementations of the present disclosure, techniques or mechanisms are employed to detect a highlighted area in an image content of a document, where the highlighted area includes a portion of the image content, and a highlighting mark that highlights (e.g., using a vivid highlighter color) the portion of the image content (e.g., the highlighting mark has a color that can be very different from a color of the highlighted image content portion). In some examples, the highlighting mark that highlights the portion of the image content is superimposed with (overlays or underlays) the portion of the image content. Note that the highlighting mark (e.g., a highlighting band or other visual artifact of any of various shapes) can be drawn over an image content portion that is already present in a document. In this case, the highlighting mark overlays the image content portion. Alternatively, the highlighting mark may be drawn first in the document, followed by the image content portion being placed in the region of the highlighting mark. In this latter case, the highlighting mark underlays the image content portion.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A highlighting mark can be larger than or smaller than an image content portion that is highlighted by the highlighting mark.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some examples of the present disclosure, a color adjustment process can be applied in the highlighted area. The color adjustment process is not applied in another area of the image content; in other words, the color adjustment process may be restricted to just highlighted area(s) of a document. The color adjustment process adjusts the color of an image content portion highlighted by the highlighting mark. This color adjustment process can boost the image quality of the highlighted area that includes the image content portion superimposed with the highlighting mark. The color of the highlighting mark is enhanced to improve the visibility of the highlighting mark, which effectively enhances the image quality of the overall highlighted area that includes the highlighting mark and the image content portion superimposed with the highlighting mark.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In further examples, the detection of the highlighted area can be based on clustering of highlighting colors to identify highlighter color clusters.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an arrangement that includes a highlighted area color adjustment engine <b>102</b> according to some examples. As used here, an &#x201c;engine&#x201d; can refer to a hardware processing circuit, which can include any or some combination of a microprocessor, a core of a multi-core microprocessor, a microcontroller, a programmable integrated circuit, a programmable gate array, or another hardware processing circuit. Alternatively, an &#x201c;engine&#x201d; can refer to a combination of a hardware processing circuit and machine-readable instructions (software and/or firmware) executable on the hardware processing circuit.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The highlighted area color adjustment engine <b>102</b> can be implemented using a computer or a collection of computers.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some examples, the highlighted area color adjustment engine <b>102</b> includes a highlighter colors clustering logic <b>104</b>, a highlighted areas detection logic <b>106</b>, and a color adjustment logic <b>108</b>. A &#x201c;logic&#x201d; of the highlighted area color adjustment engine <b>102</b> can refer to a portion of the hardware processing circuit of the highlighted area color adjustment engine <b>102</b>, or to machine-readable instructions executable by the highlighted area color adjustment engine <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example where the various logic <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, and <b>108</b> are part of the highlighted area color adjustment engine <b>102</b>, it is noted that the various logic <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, and <b>108</b> may be part of separate engines, which may be implemented using respective different computers, possibly at the same geographic location or at different geographic locations and/or owned by different entities or the same entity.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The highlighter colors clustering logic <b>104</b> applies pre-processing to identify multiple highlighter color clusters of various different highlighter colors that can be used for highlighting image content portions of documents. Examples of highlighter colors can include green, yellow, blue, magenta, orange, and various different shades of the foregoing, along with other colors.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Based on the clustering, the highlighter colors clustering logic <b>104</b> generates information <b>110</b> of the highlighter color clusters, which can be stored in a data repository <b>112</b>. The data repository <b>112</b> can be implemented using a storage device or a collection of storage devices. A storage device can include any or some combination of the following: a disk-based storage device, a solid-state storage device, a memory device, and so forth. An example of the information <b>110</b> of the highlighter color clusters is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> (discussed further below).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The information <b>110</b> of the highlighter color clusters is provided as an input to the highlighted areas detection logic <b>106</b>. Another input to the highlighted areas detection logic <b>106</b> is an input document <b>114</b>, which has a number of highlighted areas <b>116</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>116</b>-N. Although N is assumed to be 2 in examples discussed herein, it is noted that in other examples, the input document <b>114</b> can include just one highlighted area. The highlighted areas detection logic <b>106</b> is able to detect the highlighted areas <b>116</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>116</b>-N based on the information <b>110</b> of the highlighter color clusters.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">An example of a highlighted area <b>116</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. The highlighted area includes an image content portion <b>130</b> that has text <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> and a graphical element <b>130</b>-<b>2</b>. The image content portion <b>130</b> is highlighted by a highlighting mark <b>132</b>, which in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> has a generally rectangular profile that overlays the image content portion <b>130</b>. In other examples, the highlighting mark <b>132</b> can have a different shape, depending upon how a user draws the highlighting mark <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Information of the detected highlighted areas <b>116</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>116</b>-N is provided by the highlighted areas detection logic <b>106</b> to the color adjustment logic <b>108</b>. The color adjustment logic <b>108</b> can perform an adjustment of colors of the highlighted areas <b>116</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>116</b>-N. For example, the color adjustment logic <b>108</b> can adjust colors of highlighting marks in the highlighted areas <b>116</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>116</b>-N.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The color adjustment performed by the color adjustment logic <b>108</b> in the highlighted areas <b>116</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>116</b>-N can be referred to as &#x201c;highlighted area color adjustment.&#x201d; In some examples, the highlighted area color adjustment adjusts color values of multiple color components in an HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The HSV color space describes colors in terms of hue (dominant wavelength or point in color wheel), saturation (which corresponds to an amount of gray) and a brightness value. In such examples, the HSV color space can also be referred to as an HSB color space, in which Brightness (B) is substituted for Value (V).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In examples according to the present disclosure, an HSV color space can also refer to an HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color space. In the HSL color space, the V component is replaced with the L component.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the HSV color space, the highlighted area color adjustment can adjust the S and V components (the saturation component and the brightness or lightness component). The highlighted area color adjustment applied to the S and V components can include a gamma correction or a different type of color adjustment (discussed further below).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">More generally, the highlighted area color adjustment applied by the color adjustment logic in a highlighted area includes an adjustment of color values of multiple color components of a specified color space, such as the HSV color space or another color space.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">After adjusting the colors of highlighting marks in the highlighted areas <b>116</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>116</b>-N, the image quality of the combination of the highlighting marks and the respective superimposed image content portions is improved. Performing the highlighted area color adjustment of multiple color components of the specified color space can produce better results in terms of the image quality of the respective color adjusted highlighted area, since the color adjustment considers more than one color component of a color space. For example, by applying a gamma correction with different parameters for each of the S and V color components of the HSV color space (discussed further below), a more vivid color can be obtained in the highlighted area than would be possible based on applying the same gamma transformation to S and V components or applying a color transformation to a grayscale conversion of an image.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Based on the color adjustment performed by the color adjustment logic <b>108</b>, the highlighted area color adjustment engine <b>102</b> produces an output document <b>18</b> that includes color adjusted highlighted areas <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>120</b>-N, which correspond to the highlighted areas <b>116</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>116</b>-N of the input document <b>114</b>. In other words, the color adjusted highlighted area <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> is based on a color adjustment (performed by the color adjustment logic <b>108</b>) of the highlighted area <b>116</b>-<b>1</b>, the color adjusted highlighted area <b>120</b>-N is based on a color adjustment (performed by the color adjustment logic <b>108</b>) of the highlighted area <b>116</b>-N, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For improved efficiency, the color adjustment logic <b>108</b> restricts the application of the highlighted area color adjustment to the highlighted areas <b>116</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>116</b>-N, without applying the highlighted area color adjustment in other areas of the input document <b>114</b> that are outside of the highlighted areas <b>116</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>116</b>-N. By skipping the highlighted area color adjustment in the other areas, less burden is placed on physical resources (e.g., processing resources, storage resources, communication resources, etc.) of a computer (or computers).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">It is noted that the highlighter colors clustering performed by the highlighter colors clustering logic <b>104</b> can be performed once. Once the highlighter clustering is performed, the highlighted areas detection logic <b>106</b> can use the information <b>110</b> of the highlighter color clusters to perform highlighted areas detection for multiple input documents.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some cases, the highlighter colors clustering may be re-iterated if new highlighter colors are added, or if highlighter colors are changed or deleted.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some examples, the clustering applied by the highlighter colors clustering logic <b>104</b> is a K-means clustering that produces K (K&#x2265;2) highlighter color clusters.

CIEXYZ is also a device-independent color space, and expresses tristimulus values represented by X, Y, and Z.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Assuming the L*a*b* color space is employed, the information of the highlighter colors can represent the different colors using different combinations of L, a, b color values.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The highlighter colors clustering process <b>300</b> applies (at <b>306</b>) K-means clustering using the information of the highlighter colors, to produce K color clusters. In some examples, the K-means clustering is based on the L, a, b values of the respective highlighter colors. K-means clustering partitions observations that are in the form of multi-dimensional vectors. For a highlighter color, a multi-dimensional vector that includes the L, a, b values of the highlighter color. The observations are partitioned into K sets of observations (K clusters).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Each set of observations has a cluster centroid that represents the respective cluster. The cluster centroid is calculated as an arithmetic mean of the observations of the respective cluster, or more specifically for highlighter colors, a cluster centroid has L, a, b values that is an arithmetic mean of the L, a, b values of the observations that are part of the respective highlighter color cluster.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Assuming K is set to 6, then 6 highlighter color clusters <b>204</b> are identified, as shown in in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. For example, a first highlighter color cluster can include the G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, G6, and G7 colors, a second highlighter color cluster can include the Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, Y5, Y6, and Y7 colors, a third highlighter color cluster can include the S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6 colors, a fourth highlighter color cluster can include the P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, and P7 colors, a fifth highlighter color cluster can include the B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, and B6 colors, and a sixth highlighter color cluster can include the O1 color.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Each highlighter color cluster is associated with threshold ranges of a and b values. For example, for cluster <b>1</b>, the threshold range for a values is between 118 and 131, and the threshold range for b values is between 144 and 154. A threshold range of values is based on the observations included in each highlighter color cluster. For example, if a given highlighter color cluster includes M observations (including respective L, a, b values for respective M highlighter colors), then the threshold range for a values and the threshold range for b values is based on the L, a, b values of the M observations in the given highlighter color cluster.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The threshold ranges of a and b values for the corresponding different highlighter color clusters are used for determining (by the highlighted areas detection logic <b>106</b>) whether highlighting marks according to respective highlighter colors are present in an input document.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow diagram of a process <b>400</b> performed by the highlighted areas detection logic <b>106</b> and the color adjustment logic <b>108</b> according to some examples. It is assumed that the process <b>400</b> is performed after the highlighter colors clustering process <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> has been completed to identify the highlighter color clusters.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The process <b>400</b> receives (at <b>402</b>) an input document containing highlighted areas, such as the input document <b>114</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In some examples, it is assumed that image data of the input document is in the RGB color space. In other examples, the image data of the input document can be in a different color space.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The process <b>400</b> converts (at <b>404</b>) the image data of the input document from the RGB color space to each of the L*a*b color space and the HSV color space, to produce a corresponding L*a*b image <b>420</b> and a corresponding HSV image <b>422</b>. Although reference is made to processing performed in the L*a*b and HSV color spaces, it is noted that other examples can perform processing in different color spaces.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The highlighted areas detection logic <b>106</b> applies highlighted areas detection (<b>406</b>) in the L*a*b image <b>420</b> to detect highlighted areas in the image data of the input document.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The highlighted areas detection (<b>406</b>) identifies (at <b>406</b>-<b>1</b>) areas in the L*a*b image <b>420</b> containing highlighter colors that fall within any of the K highlighter color clusters, based on comparing colors in the L*a*b image <b>420</b> to the threshold ranges for the a and b values of the highlighter clusters (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The identification (at <b>406</b>-<b>1</b>) searches for a collection of pixels that have colors that fall within any of the K highlighter color clusters. For example, a collection of pixels is identified as being a highlighted area if the colors of the pixels in the collection of pixels have a and b values that fall within threshold ranges of the a and b values for a given highlighter color cluster. In some examples, for a collection of pixels to be identified as being a highlighted area, the collection of pixels has a size (e.g., a length and/or a width, a diameter, etc.) that exceeds a specified size threshold. A collection of pixels having a size less than the specified size threshold is not identified as a highlighted area.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The highlighted areas detection (<b>406</b>) produces (at <b>406</b>-<b>2</b>) a mask that represents the identified highlighted areas. In some examples, the mask can have coordinates (e.g., X and Y coordinates in the X-Y geometric space) that fall within the dimensions (width and length in the X and Y axes) of the L*a*b image <b>420</b>. In some examples, the mask is a binary mask that includes 0s and 1s at respective locations of the L*a*b image <b>420</b>, where 0 indicates a location of the L*a*b image <b>420</b> that is not part of a highlighted area, and 1 represents a location of the L*a*b image <b>420</b> that is in a highlighted area. A &#x201c;location&#x201d; assigned a 0 or 1 can refer to a pixel or a group of pixels in the L*a*b image <b>420</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In other examples, a different type of mask (with more than two binary values) or any other representation of indicators of highlighted areas can be used.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The highlighted areas detection (<b>406</b>) can apply noise filtering (at 406-3) to reduce noise in the mask. For example, a median filter or another type of noise filter can be applied to the mask. A median filter is a non-linear digital filter that removes noise from an image or signal. In other examples, other types of noise filtering can be applied. Noise filtering is applied to smooth out boundaries of the identified highlighted areas. A noisy image on which the highlighted areas detection (<b>406</b>) is applied can cause irregular boundaries (e.g., jagged edges, etc.).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The highlighted areas detection (<b>406</b>) also applies image dilation (at <b>406</b>-<b>4</b>) on the noise filtered mask, in which a dilation operator is applied to the mask to expand sizes of the highlighted areas. The noise filtering applied may cause an erosion in the boundaries of the highlighted areas represented in the mask. The image dilation causes the boundaries of the highlighted areas represented in the mask to increase in size.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, the highlighted areas detection (<b>406</b>) can apply hole removal (at <b>406</b>-<b>5</b>) to remove holes that may be present in the highlighted areas represented in the noise filtered, dilated mask. For example, within an area of neighboring locations in the mask, there may be a hole or multiple holes in the form of a 0 or multiple 0s in a collection of 1s. When such holes are detected, these locations that are initially assigned 0s in the mask are changed to 1s.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">After the application of the noise filtering, mask dilation, and hole removal, the highlighted areas detection logic <b>106</b> produces an output mask <b>424</b> with indicators (e.g., collections of 1s) that represent respective highlighted areas.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the process <b>400</b>, the color adjustment logic <b>108</b> applies, based on the output mask, a color adjustment (<b>408</b>) on the HSV image <b>422</b> in the HSV color space. The color adjustment (<b>408</b>) that is applied can include gamma correction. The output mask is used by the color adjustment logic <b>108</b> to determine where in the HSV image the highlighted areas are located. The HSV image can have the same geometric coordinates in the X-Y geometric space as the L*a*b image, so that the output mask would employ the same geometric coordinates as the HSV image. The color adjustment (<b>408</b>) is applied in those highlighted areas of the HSV image indicated by the output mask, and not in other areas of the HSV image.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">A gamma correction is a nonlinear operation that transforms input color values (such as color values of the S and V components of the HSV color space). In some examples, the gamma correction is expressed using the following power-law expression:</p><p id="p-0070" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>R=AI</i><sup>&#x3b3;</sup>,&#x2003;&#x2003;(Eq. 1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0071" num="0000">where I is an input value (e.g., a color value such as a color value of an S or V component), R is an output value, A is a predefined constant (e.g., <b>1</b> or another value), and &#x3b3; is a power value that can be empirically set based on historical observed data relating to highlighter colors and how scanning of such highlighter colors affects their appearance. Different values of &#x3b3; can be used for different types of scanners and/or contexts.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069">In some example, the power value &#x3b3; used for gamma correction of the color values of the S component is 2.2, while the power value &#x3b3; used for gamma correction of the color values of the V component is 1.2. In other examples, other power values, &#x3b3;, can be employed.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070">As part of the gamma correction, the color adjustment (<b>408</b>) builds (at <b>408</b>-<b>1</b>) lookup tables to map input color values of the HSV image to their respective gamma values (as computed according to Eq. 1). A first lookup table <b>426</b> can be used to map input color values of the S component of the HSV color space to respective gamma values, and a second lookup table <b>428</b> can be used to map input color values of the V component of the HSV color space to respective gamma values.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0071">Assuming 8-bit gamma correction is employed, the input color values (I) are 8 bits in length, which means that the input color value (I) of the S component or V component of the HSV image <b>422</b> can range between 0 and 255. In other examples, input color values can be of other lengths.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0072">The color adjustment (<b>408</b>) applies gamma correction (at <b>408</b>-<b>2</b>) to the S and V components of the HSV image <b>422</b> using the lookup tables <b>426</b> and <b>428</b>. For each pixel of the HSV image <b>422</b>, the gamma correction (<b>408</b>-<b>2</b>) uses the S value of the pixel to retrieve a corresponding S-component gamma value from the first lookup table <b>426</b>, and uses the V value of the pixel to retrieve a corresponding V-component gamma value from the second lookup table <b>428</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0073">The color adjustment (<b>408</b>) produces an enhanced HSV image <b>430</b> based on the gamma correction, in which the colors in the highlighted areas of the input document are color adjusted to use the S-component gamma values and the V-component gamma values instead of the input S-component and V-component values of the input document.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0074">In other examples, instead of or in addition to applying gamma correction, the color of the pixels mapped to the different highlighter colors can be changed to a designated target color for each highlighter color cluster. For example, assume there are 6 highlighter color clusters. Six designated different highlighter colors can be assigned to the 6 highlighter color clusters. The color adjustment (<b>408</b>) can replace highlighter colors in the highlighted areas of the HSV image <b>422</b> with respective colors of the 6 designated different highlighter colors.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0075">The process <b>400</b> converts (at <b>410</b>) the enhanced HSV image <b>430</b> from the HSV color space to the RGB color space, to produce a highlighted areas adjusted output RGB image <b>432</b> that includes color adjusted highlighted areas, such as those in the output document <b>118</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram of a non-transitory machine-readable or computer-readable storage medium <b>500</b> storing machine-readable instructions that upon execution cause a system (a computer or multiple computers) to perform various tasks.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0077">The machine-readable instructions include highlighted area detection instructions <b>502</b> to detect a highlighted area in an image content, the highlighted area including a portion of the image content, and a highlighting mark that highlights the portion of the image content.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0078">The machine-readable instructions include color adjustment application instructions <b>504</b> to apply a color adjustment process in the highlighted area, where the color adjustment process includes adjusting a color of the highlighted area including the portion of the image content highlighted by the highlighting mark, and where the adjusting of the color of the highlighted area includes adjusting color values of plural color components in a first color space (e.g., an HSV color space).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0079">In some examples, the color adjustment process is not applied in another area of the image content outside of the highlighted area.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0080">In some examples, highlighter colors are clustered to identify highlighter color clusters.
