Where diet and the microbiome helped to enable the development and evolution of humankind, dysbiosis has been the cause of many human diseases. Diet, use of synthetic antimicrobials, and exercise shape our microbiome and define us, however when the oral or nasal flora balance is deleteriously affected there can be a systemic price that is paid in shifting or disrupting the microbiome. (Eugene Rosenberg et al., Microbes Drive Evolution of Animals and Plants: the Hologenome Concept, mBio. 2016 Mar 31;7(2)). It has also been found that the microbiome of professional athletes differs from that of more sedentary subjects in composition and particularly at the functional metabolic level (S. F. Clarke et al., Exercise and associated dietary extremes impact on gut microbial diversity Gut 2014; 63:1913-1920). It is well established that certain periodontal bacteria are connected with human diseases such as dementia (P. gingivitis), cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and increased death rates. The care and treatment of the human body should thus be guided by the principal of returning to a healthy microbiome.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the majority of plants, the main glucide transported is saccharose, but in certain plants, polyols are also transported. (F. W. Marlowe and J. C. Berbesque, (2009), Tubers as fallback foods and their impact on Hadza hunter-gatherers. Am. J. Phys. Anthropol., 140: 751-758.) There are significant differences between European children and rural African children in gut microbiota, with a high fiber African diet resulting in a population with an abundance of the bacteria from the genus <i>Prevotella</i>. (Carlotta De Filippo et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2010 Aug 17; 107(33): pp. 14691-14696.) Polyols have been shown to act as prebiotics to these commensal bacteria and at the same time can hinder some of the pathogenic oral bacteria and result in growth inhibition for cariogenic bacteria. (Siin Koljalg et al., Scientific Reports volume 10, Article number: 6297, 2020). In particular, it has been found that oral treatment with a polyol results in a high growth inhibition effect on cariogenic bacteria.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">At present time, current caries prevention therapy largely consists of fluoride therapy, which has been a ubiquitous halogen in dental products for several generations and is generally known to act to affect the surface hardness of teeth. However, it has been shown that fluoride can affect children's neurodevelopment and cause neurotoxicity at high levels. (A. Choi et al., Environ. Health Perspect. 2012 October; 120(10): 1362-1368). In addition, Jiang et al. showed that developmental neurotoxicity of fluoride may be closely associated with glucose utilization and glial acidic protein and increased levels of neurotrophic factor in the rat brains leading to neurodegenerative changes. (C. Jiang et al., Neuromolecular Med. 2014 Mar;16(1):94-105). Another study found that that mothers with high fluoride exposure in pregnancy had babies with associated lower IQ scores in 3 and 4 year olds (R. Green et al., JAMA Pediatr. 2019; 173(10):940-948). Many other concerns about the deleterious effects of fluoride on human health abound and are brought to our attention frequently. While fluoride has done some good in reducing caries largely by affecting the tooth, it does not address the root causes of the caries which is the modern diet, sedentary lifestyle, increase in non-obligate mouth breathing, and disruption of the oral microbiome.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The tiny radical nitric oxide (NO) participates in a vast number of physiological functions including vasodilation, nerve transmission, pain response, host defence and cellular energetics. Classically produced by a family of specific enzymes called NO synthases (NOSs), NO signals via reactions with other radicals or transition metals. An alternative pathway for the generation of NO is the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway in which the inorganic anions nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>) and nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub>)<sup>&#x2212;</sup> are reduced to NO and other reactive nitrogen intermediates. Nitrate and nitrite are oxidation products from NOS-dependent NO generation but are also constituents in our diet, found mainly in leafy green vegetables. Various nitrate reducing bacteria are found in the mouth, including but not limited to <i>Neisseria flavescens, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Neisseria mucosa, Prevotella melaninogenica, Granulicatella adiacens, Veillonella dispar, Veillonella atypica, Veillonella parvula, Neisseria sicca, Prevotella salivae, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyses oris</i>, and <i>Neisseria </i>subflava. (Charlene E. Goh et al., Journal of the American Heart Association. 2019, Vol. 8, No. 23) Irrespective of origin, active uptake of circulating nitrate in the salivary glands, excretion in saliva, and subsequent reduction to nitrite by oral commensal bacteria are important steps for NO generation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The central role of the oral cavity in regulating NO generation from nitrate presents a new and intriguing aspect of the human microbiome in health and disease. Recent studies have shown that nitrite and nitrate play an important role in cardiovascular and gastrointestinal homeostasis through conversion back into NO via a physiological system involving enterosalivary recirculation, bacterial nitrate reductases, and enzyme catalyzed or acidic reduction of nitrite to NO. (J. Jones et al., Pediatric Research, 2015 Jan; 77(0): pp. 173-181.) Nitrite synthesis by commensal oral bacteria is also a key mechanism to induce the vascular response to exercise over the first period of recovery thereby promoting lower blood pressure and greater muscle oxygenation. (C. Cutler et al.; Free Radical Biology and Medicine, Vol 141, November 2019, pp. 252-259) Oral bacteria in a healthy microbiome normally reduce enterosalivary nitrites, however when their amounts are reduced by routine mouthwash use there can be an increased risk for pre-diabetes and diabetes. (K. J. Joshipura et al., Nitric Oxide, Vol 71, December 2017, pp. 14-20) Broad spectrum antiseptic mouthwashes have also been found to reduce oral nitrite production by 90% and plasma nitrite levels by 25% compared to controls. (V. Kapil et al., Free Radical Biology and Medicine, Vol. 55, February 2013, pp.93-100)</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">With the use of probiotics it is possible to supplement humans with nitrates to encourage the endogenous NO synthesis cascade. This can result in a reduction in blood pressure, protection against cardiac ischemia reperfusion damage, restoration of nitric oxide homeostasis, and associated cardiovascular protection, increased vascular regeneration after chronic ischemia, and a reversal of vascular dysfunction in the elderly. While it may be a worthwhile procedure to bring back a healthy microbiome after disruption, it would be beneficial to sustain or increase the commensal bacteria in the first place while reducing the prevalence of harmful bacteria.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The monosaccharide xylitol has been used in nasal sprays to treat congestion, irritation, inflammation, and upper respiratory infections such a otitis media, sinusitis. In one example, United States patent U.S. Pat. No. 6,258,372 to Jones describes a nasal composition comprising by weight 100 parts of water, between 65 parts to 1 part of xylitol/xylose, and between 0.95 and 0.45 parts of sodium chloride.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Iodine has been in continuous use by the human race for 5,600 years when seaweed sponges were utilized to shrink goiters. Povidone iodine (PVP-I) released in 1955 is a brown, aqueous solution containing several different species of iodine (including iodide, iodate, triiodide, hypo-iodous acid and molecular iodine) bound to a large organic molecule, polyvinylpyrrolidone (povidone). Povidone, being highly soluble in water, carries the different iodine species, which have varying degrees of solubility, into solution along with it. 10% PVP-I (common brand:Betadine&#xae;) is used in hospitals, medical and dental offices worldwide and contains over 30,000 ppm of total iodine but only 1-3 ppm of molecular iodine which is the biocidal active species. All of the other species of iodine present in PVP-I contribute to staining, toxicity and irritation, but are not biocidal.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Molecular iodine (I<sub>2</sub>) can be used as a topical antibiotic and is safe for human use, and stable in solution in a clear, almost tasteless, and biocidal product. In one example, United States patent U.S. Pat. No. 10,092,006 to Kolsky et al. describes an aqueous composition comprising a combination of molecular iodine (I<sub>2</sub>), a source of iodate (IO<sub>3</sub>), and an acid, that can be used as a disinfecting solution, germicide and/or biocide on various surfaces including living and inanimate surfaces. By maintaining iodate at a greater concentration than iodide and buffering it to a pH between 2.0-6.5, the molecular iodine is stabilized in solution for an extended period of up to 5 years. I<sub>2 </sub>is also an essential element, natural, non-staining, organic, safe for chronic use, and is priced with the most affordable of all the antimicrobials. Kolsky et al. demonstrated that molecular iodine at the tested concentrations has the ability to inactivate rhinovirus, a resilient, non-enveloped virus largely responsible for upper respiratory infections in 30 seconds.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">There remains a need for a composition that provides antibiotic activity for deleterious bacteria as well as probiotic activity to encourage commensal bacteria. There also remains a need for a non-toxic composition for surface treatment and control of infection caused by microbes, viruses, fungi, and other pathogens.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">This background information is provided for the purpose of making known information believed by the applicant to be of possible relevance to the present invention.

Molds are a large and taxonomically diverse number of fungal species where the growth of hyphae results in discoloration and a fuzzy appearance, especially on food. Molds are considered to be microbes and can generally found in the divisions of Zygomycota and Ascomycota. Molds often cause biodegradation of natural materials, which can be unwanted when it becomes food spoilage and/or damage to property. Molds also cause disease in animals and humans often resulting from allergic sensitivity to mold spores, from growth of pathogenic molds within the body, or from the effects of ingested or inhaled toxic compounds (mycotoxins) produced by molds. There are thousands of known species of molds, which have diverse life-styles including aprotrophs, mesophiles, psychrophiles and thermophiles and some are opportunistic pathogens of humans. Molds require moisture for growth and some live in aquatic environments. Like all fungi, molds derive energy from the organic matter on which they live, utilizing heterotrophy. Typically, molds secrete hydrolytic enzymes, which degrade complex biopolymers such as starch, cellulose and lignin into simpler substances which can be absorbed. In this way molds play a major role in causing decomposition of organic material, enabling the recycling of nutrients. Molds often grow on stored food for animals and humans, making the food unpalatable or toxic and are thus a major source of food losses and illness. Many prior art strategies (salting, pickling, jams, bottling, freezing, drying) are used to prevent or slow mold growth as well as growth of other microbes. Molds reproduce by producing large numbers of small spores, which can be inhibited and/or eliminated by the compositions according to the present invention. Common molds include <i>Acremonium, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Mucor, Penicillium, Rhizopus, Trichoderma </i>and Stachybotrys, among others.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The term &#x201c;membrane&#x201d; as used herein refers to any biological surface to which compositions according to the present invention can be applied and on which may be used for its disinfectant, antimicrobial and/or biocidal activity.

The concentration of uncomplexed molecular iodine serves as a disinfectant, biocidal, preservative and/or antimicrobial in the composition, and the polyol provides both pre-biotic and pro-biotic activity to the composition for beneficial bacteria on the membrane being treated. The composition can act as a pre-biotic, pro-biotic, and can be used as both a preventative therapy and a therapeutic treatment to promote growth of beneficial bacteria and act as a biocide for microorganisms including detrimental bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Without being bound by theory, it has been found that the present composition is also known to spare and/or support the commensal and nitrite and nitrate reducing oral bacteria due to the presence of the polyol, and is particularly useful in oral formulations to preserve populations of beneficial oral bacteria. In particular, while simultaneously being selectively biocidal to pathogenic bacteria in humans to advance oral and systemic health, the present composition can preserve and promote a healthy oral microbiome. The activity of the present composition as a result of the stabilized concentration of free molecular iodine in solution in combination with the advantages provided by the polyol provides a prebiotic and probiotic composition with high activity, low environmental impact, long term storage stability, and low toxicity. In addition, the present composition is effective against pathogenic bacteria, while limitedly disrupting essential commensal bacteria, such as nitrate-reducing and nitrite producing bacteria, and in a manner that utilizes naturally occurring ingredients that are already approved for human use.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Compositions of the present invention can be used for treating and/or preventing viral, bacterial (both gram negative and positive), parasite, fungal and spore-based infections, especially including Norovirus, Poliovirus, Coronavirus, Hepatitis A, <i>Klebsiella </i>pneumonie, Staphyloccus <i>aureus, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Acinetobacter boumanni</i>, and <i>Candida albicans </i>in subjects or patients in need.

In particular, eradication of commensal oral bacteria in a broad spectrum, indiscriminate fashion has been found to decrease the nitrate and nitrite reducing bacteria available in the mouth. There are at least fourteen species of oral bacteria that have been found to have substantial nitrate or nitrite-reducing capabilities and these bacteria may provide a mechanism to help to explain the oral systemic link we are searching for. (Nathan S. Bryan et al., (2011) Nitrite and Nitrate in Human Health and Disease pp. 23-31, Humana Press ISBN: 978-1-60761-615-3; E. R. Hyde et al., (2014) Metagenomic Analysis of Nitrate-Reducing Bacteria in the Oral Cavity: Implications for Nitric Oxide Homeostasis. PLoS ONE 9(3): e88645; E. Soderling et al., (2000), Influence of Maternal Xylitol Consumption on Acquisition of <i>Mutans </i>Streptococci by Infants. Journal of Dental Research, 79(3):882-887.) While probiotics can replenish and normalize a microbiome, it is far better not to use products that disrupt commensal oral flora. Polyols act as prebiotics and are protective for these commensal bacteria, while at the same time, they also act to inactivate some of the problematic and pathogenic oral bacteria, including <i>Streptococcus mutans </i>which is indicated as contributing to tooth decay. (Kaumudi J. Joshipura et al., Nitric Oxide, Volume 71, 1 Dec. 2017, Pages 14-20)</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In oral compositions, the combination of stabilized molecular iodine and a polyol are effective by inhibiting the specific bacteria that lead to tooth decay, thereby treating the underlying cause of dental caries, as well as supporting the health of commensal oral bacteria. The halogen fluoride, which is traditionally used in oral cane prevention, can be replaced with molecular iodine in combination with polyol to inhibit growth of the specific bacteria that cause tooth decay while preserving the health of commensal oral bacteria. Orally applied polyol has also been demonstrated to have the remarkable ability to remineralize teeth which allows for healing of dental caries or lesions.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The present invention provides compositions of uncomplexed molecular iodine and polyols that are stable, non-irritating, non-toxic and capable of being placed into commercial distribution channels with extended storage stability (months or years). In one embodiment, the compositions described in this application: (a) provide a constant thiosulfate titratable level of iodine over the shelf-life of the product and (b) exhibit a chemical activity of molecular iodine that is at least about 50% (at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, at least about 80%, at least about 85%, 90%, 95% or more) of an equivalent concentration of molecular iodine (based upon the total atoms of iodine) as measured potentiometrically in a 0.1 N HCl solution. Thus, the present compositions provide an unexpectedly high level of activity of molecular iodine as an uncomplexed species in combination with a beneficial concentration of polyol in a composition which is storage stable.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Polyols</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The amount of polyol in the composition includes a 1%-30% mixture of polyols, especially xylitol and erythritol with the ratio varying on by the purpose of the solution. Preferably the polyol is at least 3% by weight in the concentration, and preferably up to about 30% by weight or more, and more preferably up to 25% by weight of the composition. Polyols are products of photosynthesis and are found in fruits and vegetables, including tubers and leafy green vegetables. More than 10,000 years ago, humans who settled in Sweden chewed gobs of sticky &#x201c;pitch,&#x201d; which was a tar like material extracted from Birch bark, a tree that is a good source of xylitol, and the population saw little tooth decay. Polyols can also be produced by certain bacteria, yeasts, algae, and lactic acid bacteria. Polyols include the sugars mannitol, erythritol, sorbitol, dulcitol, inositol, xylitol, lactitol, ribitol, and arabitol. Polyols can affect oral biofilm formation, have dental remineralization potential, and inhibit adherence and growth of bacteria such as oral streptococci. In one study, Soderling et al. showed that 4% of xylitol or erythritol both had effects of inhibiting certain oral pathogenic bacteria and also affected adherence of biofilm. (Eva M. Soderling et al., Current Microbiology 60(1):25-9, September 2009) In a review by Zhan, it was shown that xylitol and erythritol can serve as good components of anti-caries regiments as oral microbiome modifiers, sugar substitutes, and agents to prevent Strep. <i>Mutans </i>transmission. (L. Zhan, Adv Dental Research; 2018, Feb 29, 110-116)</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Xylitol has been incorporated into candies, oral and nasal compositions, toothpaste, troches, lozenges, mints, and chewing gum after modern day studies demonstrated that it affected Strep. <i>Mutans </i>and <i>Lactobacillus </i>and lowered caries rates and inhibited oral biofilm formation. Xylitol also tastes great and has a nice cool &#x201c;mouth feel&#x201d;. Xylitol also has humectant capabilities that can help with &#x201c;dry mouth&#x201d; symptoms, and is also a probiotic and promotes the growth and metabolic activity of butyrate producing bacteria in the large colon. (T. Sato et al., FEMS Microbiol Ecol. 2017 January;93(1)) Nitrate reducing bacteria are also encouraged with xylitol and erythritol, and it has been shown that salivary bacterial nitrates are protective against caries (J. J. Doetl et al., European Journal of Oral Sciences. 2004 Oct;112(5):424-8) On skin, xylitol has been shown to improve barrier function and suppress the growth of certain potential skin pathogens. (K. Salli, et al. Nutrients. 2019 August; 11(8): 1813)</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Erythritol is a four-carbon polyol which occurs naturally in small quantities in alcoholic beverages, mushrooms, and fruits such as pears, grapes, and watermelons. Erythritol has been shown to be beneficial when used in oral composition for lowering plaque growth, reducing local concentrations of acetic acid and propionic acid, and decreasing <i>streptococcus Mutans </i>over a three-year study. (P. de Cock et al., International Journal of Dentistry, Volume 2016, Article ID 9868421, 15 pages). In vitro studies indicated that erythritol impedes biofilm formation with <i>Streptococcus mutans</i>, oral inhabitant <i>Streptococcus gordonii</i>, and the periodontal pathogen <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis </i>(D. A. Rzechonek et al., Critical Reviews in Biotechnology, Volume 38, 2018-Issue 4). The combination of xylitol and erythritol has also been shown to have both singular and synergistic effects in the oral cavity. (S.

Molecular iodine is used in the present composition as a biocidal and antimicrobial. In an aqueous environment iodine exists in several forms or species. These species include iodide (11, molecular iodine (I<sub>2</sub>), hypoiodous acid (HOI), iodate (IO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>), triiodide (I<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>) and polyiodides (e.g., I<sub>5</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup> or I<sub>7</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>). Each of these species have different physical and chemical properties. While molecular iodine has been historically unstable in aqueous solution and can be inactivated by many additives, Kolsky et al. have described formulations of uncomplexed molecular iodine that are stable, non-irritating, non-toxic and capable of being placed into commercial distribution channels with extended storage stability (months or years). (United States patent U.S. Pat. No. 10,092,006)</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the present composition, iodate generates molecular (uncomplexed) iodine within the composition for use as a disinfectant/biocide/antimicrobial pursuant to the present invention. By relying on iodate to produce uncomplexed molecular iodine on an ongoing basis, the concentration of uncomplexed molecular iodine within the present composition remains within a range of concentration which maximizes biocidal/germicidal and disinfectant activity for unexpectedly long periods of time. For example, depending upon the amount of acid and the buffered pH of the composition (note that a lower pH within the range of the present compositions will tend to result in greater stability and a more efficient formation of molecular iodine from iodate than a higher pH), from at least a week to about 5 years, about two-three weeks to about 3-4 years, about a month to about 2-2.5 years, or at least 3-6 months to a year within this range.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">It has been further demonstrated that the use of polyols has little to no effect on the biocidal activity of the iodine or the stability of the iodine in solution. By marrying together stabilized molecular iodine with one or more polyol in the composition of this invention, the beneficial effects of both species can be obtained while at the same time only minimally disturbing the vital and essential commensal oral/nasal bacteria.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Molecular iodine (I<sub>2</sub>) and a source of iodate (IO<sub>3</sub>) are present in the composition in a molar ratio of about 0.1 to about 25, or preferably from about 1.5 to about 5.0, about 0.25 to about 10, about 1.25 to 5.0, about 1.0 to 7.5, about 1.25 to 5.0, about 1.25 to about 5.0, or more preferably from about 1.5 to about 5.0. The concentration of uncomplexed molecular iodine (I<sub>2</sub>) acts as a disinfectant, biocide and/or antimicrobial and is effective in an amount in the composition ranging from about 0.5 ppm to about 2500 ppm, and is preferably in the composition in an amount of between about 1 ppm to about 1000 ppm, about 10 pm to about 500 ppm, about 20 ppm to about 350 ppm and about 25 ppm to about 300 ppm, about 35 ppm to about 250 ppm, about 50 ppm to about 200 ppm, the concentration of acid in the composition is effective to provide a buffering pH in the composition ranging from about 1.5 to about 6.5 (often about 2.0 to about 6.5 within this range), preferably 2.0 to about 5.5, often about 2.0 to about 5.0). An effective concentration of biocompatible acid in the composition, either inorganic or organic, is effective to provide a buffering pH in the composition. One or more polyols are provided in the range of 3-50% of the total solution to enhance taste as well as for their biological properties. Preferable polyols are xylitol and erythritol, individually or in combination, at a concentration of about 1-30% by weight of the composition, more preferably between 3-25% by weight.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Compositions according to the present invention can be stored stably for unexpectedly long periods of time, up to about 2-5 years, and at least for about 2-5 weeks and up to years without refrigeration at ambient temperatures. Iodine concentration measurements of the present compositions including polyol have remained stable over a period of two years with little or very low reduction in iodine concentration in solution. It is noted that extreme heat and direct light can cause degradation of the iodine, however the stability of the iodine is not significantly affected by the addition of the polyol to the composition.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Uses of the Composition</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The present composition can be used as a disinfecting solutions in mucous membranes, in biological cavities, and topically on skin, specifically as a germicide and/or biocide (e.g. antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, antispore etc.).

Some examples of flavours that may be use include but are not limited to mint, cinnamon, licorice, fruit flavours, bubble gum, and any other flavour acceptable for mouthwash or dental products. The addition of glycerin to the composition can further act as a sweetener, dietary suppressant and preservative. The addition of surfactant, natural or synthetic, has also been found to increase the biocidal efficiency. A recommended regimen for usage for children over 6 years of age, adolescents, and adults is twice daily (preferably morning and night) vigorous rinsing with approximately 30 millilitres (1 ounce) of the composition each time for 30 seconds. Other dosage regimens can be prescribed by doctors, dentists, or other medical professionals, to reduce harmful oral microbiological load.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0102">Throat Spray</p><p id="p-0105" num="0103">Throat spray can be useful for reducing pathogenic microbiological load in the mouth and alimentary canal and preventing infection.
