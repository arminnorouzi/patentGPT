THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The field of the disclosure relates to contact lenses, and more particularly to photochromic contact lenses that are configured to change from a clear, non-darkened normal state to a darkened state when activated by exposure to UltraViolet (UV) and/or High-Energy Visible (HEV) light.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Eyeglasses exist that have photochromic lenses, also referred to as &#x201c;Transitions&#x201d; lenses. Photochromic lenses include a material(s) that reacts to and darkens in response to exposure to UltraViolet (UV) and/or High-Energy Visible (HEV) light. The reaction of the lens darkening serves to filter out across the visible light spectrum, including blocking UVA and/or UVB radiation that can be harmful to the eyes. The earliest glass photochromic lenses relied on silver chloride or silver halide to react to UV light and darken. Today's photochromic lenses use compounds that undergo chemical reactions (e.g. via Claisen Rearrangement) shifting the chemical structure into an open state equilibrium allowing the lens to darken based on the intensity and wavelengths of the UV and/or HEV light and the thermal conditions. Removal of the light exposure will cause the compound to shift to a more closed state equilibrium causing the photochromic lenses to return to a normal, clear, non-darkened state.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Soft contact lenses have been available since the 1980s. Recently, soft contact lenses have been designed by Johnson &#x26; Johnson Vision Care, Inc. under the brand name ACUVUE&#xae; OASYS with Transitions&#x2122; that include photochromic materials to adapt and darken in response to exposure to UV and/or HEV light. An example of this photochromic contact lens is discussed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2014/0225049 entitled &#x201c;PHOTOCHROMIC MATERIALS HAVING EXTENDED PI-CONJUGATED SYSTEMS AND COMPOSITIONS AND ARTICLES INCLUDING THE SAME,&#x201d; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. These photochromic contact lenses provide contact lens wearing patients the opportunity to enjoy the benefits of reducing bothersome light. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a picture of packaged ACUVUE&#xae; OASYS with Transitions&#x2122; (photochromic) soft contact lenses <b>100</b> manufactured by Johnson &#x26; Johnson Vision Care, Inc. in individual contact lens packages <b>102</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is picture of a photochromic soft contact lens <b>100</b>N in a normal, non-darkened state and another photochromic soft contact lens <b>100</b>T in a darkened state after exposure to UV and/or HEV light.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, the amount of a photochromic material needed to achieve a desired optical effect when incorporated into a composition or article will depend, in part, on the amount of actinic radiation that the photochromic material absorbs on a per molecule basis. That is, the more actinic radiation that the photochromic material absorbs on a per molecule basis, the more likely (i.e., the higher the probability) the photochromic material will transform from the closed-form to the open-form. Photochromic compositions and articles that are made using photochromic materials having a relatively high molar absorption coefficient (or &#x201c;extinction coefficient&#x201d;) for actinic radiation may generally be used in lower concentrations than photochromic materials having lower molar absorption coefficients, while still achieving the desired optical effect.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As discussed above, removal of UV/HEV light exposure from photochromic lenses causes the lenses to return to a normal, non-darkened state. Photochromic materials used in photochromic lenses adjust from a non-darkened state to a darkened when exposed to UV light. Due to the thermal sensitivity of photochromics, the fade rate going from the darkened state to the non-darkened state will be faster at body temperature than ambient temperature, which inherently will affect the level of darkness. For example, a photochromic lens may change from a normal, non-darkened state to a very darkened state when exposed to UV light when the lens is at room temperature. The photochromic lens may then fade back to a non-darkened state slowly versus if the lens were in contact with the cornea at ocular temperature (i.e., body temperature) causing the lens to become less dark when exposed to light, and thus fading back to a non-darkened state significantly faster. This can make the demonstration of a photochromic contact lens to represent on-eye performance by a doctor or other technician to potential purchaser patients difficult due to unrealistic darkness levels and slow fade rates.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Aspects disclosed herein include light-sensitive photochromic contact lens demonstration devices, and related methods. The photochromic contact lens demonstration device facilitates the easy and convenient demonstration of the adaptation of a photochromic contact lens from a normal, non-darkened (e.g., clear) state to a darkened state without having to go outside to expose the lens to sunlight. For example, it may be desired by a doctor or technician to be able to demonstrate the change of a photochromic contact lens to a patient in an office environment as part of the patient's decision to purchase photochromic contact lenses. A photochromic contact lens changes from a normal, non-darkened state to a darkened state as a function of exposure to UltraViolet (UV) and/or High-Energy Visible (HEV) light.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, in exemplary aspects disclosed herein, to provide for the convenient and efficient demonstration of the change of a photochromic contact lens, in examples disclosed herein, the photochromic contact lens demonstration device is provided as a contact lens demonstration device that includes a lighting-emitting device to expose a demonstrated photochromic contact lens to UV/HEV light. The photochromic contact lens demonstration device includes a cavity that is configured to receive a packaged photochromic contact lens to be demonstrated. In examples disclosed herein, the cavity is sized to be able to receive a packaged photochromic contact lens so that the photochromic contact lens is protected from damage during the demonstration and so that the contact lens does not have to be disposed of after the demonstration. The photochromic contact lens demonstration device includes a viewing window that allows one to see the contact lens when fully disposed into the cavity to show the change of the contact lens from a non-darkened to a darkened state. To cause the inserted contact lens to change from a non-darkened (e.g., clear) to a darkened state in a demonstration process, a control circuit in the photochromic contact lens demonstration device is configured to be activated that causes the UV/HEV lighting-emitting device to emit UV/HEV light to the photochromic contact lens. The cavity of the photochromic contact lens demonstration device is designed to align the contact lens with the UV/HEV light so that the contact lens is exposed to UV/HEV light when the lighting-emitting device is activated. After a period of time of exposure of the photochromic contact lens to the UV/HEV light, the photochromic contact lens will change from a non-darkened to darkened state, which can be seen through the viewing window. The control circuit of the photochromic contact lens demonstration device is also configured to deactivate the UV/HEV light after a period of time to allow the photochromic contact lens to change back to the non-darkened state to demonstrate the full changing from a non-darkened state, to a darkened state, and then back to the non-darkened state.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Generally, photochromic materials used in photochromic lenses change from a non-darkened state to a darker state more quickly when exposed to UV/HEV light at body temperature than when the photochromic material is exposed to UV/HEV light at a lower ambient temperature. In other words, the fade rate of a photochromic lens changing from a non-darkened state to a darkened state is faster when photochromic lens is at body temperature versus a lower ambient temperature. Thus, photochromic materials will also change more quickly from the darkened state back to the non-darkened state after exposure to UV/HEV light is removed at body temperature than a lower ambient temperature for a given period of time, because the photochromic material will have originally changed to a less darkened state when exposed to UV/HEV light at body temperature versus ambient temperature. However, a photochromic contact lens is not installed in a patient at body temperature during demonstration.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, in other exemplary aspects disclosed herein, to simulate the photochromic contact lens being installed in a patient's eye at ocular body temperature to more quickly demonstrate the changing of a photochromic contact lenses from a darkened state back to a non-darkened state, the photochromic contact lens demonstration device can also include an optional heating circuit to heat and elevate the temperature of the photochromic contact lens during demonstration. In this regard, in examples discussed herein, the control circuit of the photochromic contact lens demonstration device can also be configured to activate a heating circuit to activate a heating element to heat the photochromic contact lens inserted into the demonstration device during a demonstration process. The heating circuit is positioned in the assembly of the photochromic contact lens demonstration device with the heating element positioned proximate to the photochromic contact lens when disposed in the cavity for effective heat transfer. The control circuit of the photochromic contact lens demonstration device is configured to activate the heating circuit before and/or during the activation of the light-emitting device to expose the photochromic contact lens to UV/HEV light. This regulates the photochromic contact lens so that it changes to a less dark state than otherwise would occur if the photochromic contact lens were not heated when exposed to UV/HEV light. This then allows the photochromic contact lens to change more quickly from the darkened state back to a non-darkened state when no longer exposed to UV/HEV light. The control circuit of the transition contact lens demonstration device may also be configured to keep the heating circuit activated after a period of time after deactivation of the light-emitting device to allow the photochromic contact lens to change more quickly from the darkened state back to the non-darkened state.

The method comprises inserting a contact lens into a cavity disposed in a housing to align the contact lens to a contact lens region inside the housing and a viewing window disposed in an outer surface of the housing axially aligned with the contact lens region. The method also comprises activating a control circuit coupled to a lighting device disposed in the cavity. The method also comprises activating the lighting device by the control circuit in response to the activation of the control circuit to cause the lighting device to emit UV or HEV light to the contact lens region to expose the contact lens to the UV or HEV light for a defined demonstration period of time.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another exemplary aspect, a non-transitory computer-readable

to the drawing figures, several exemplary aspects of the present disclosure are described. The word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used herein to mean &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any aspect described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Aspects disclosed herein include light-sensitive photochromic contact lens demonstration devices, and related methods. The photochromic contact lens demonstration device facilitates the easy and convenient demonstration of the adaptation of a photochromic contact lens from a normal, non-darkened (e.g., clear) state to a darkened state without having to go outside to expose the lens to sunlight. For example, it may be desired by a doctor or technician to be able to demonstrate the change of a photochromic contact lens to a patient in an office environment as part of the patient's decision to purchase photochromic contact lenses. A photochromic contact lens changes from a normal, non-darkened state to a darkened state as a function of exposure to UltraViolet (UV) and/or High-Energy Visible (HEV) light.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Thus, in exemplary aspects disclosed herein, to provide for the convenient and efficient demonstration of the change of a photochromic contact lens, in examples disclosed herein, the photochromic contact lens demonstration device is provided as a contact lens demonstration device that includes a lighting-emitting device to expose a demonstrated photochromic contact lens to UV/HEV light. The photochromic contact lens demonstration device includes a cavity that is configured to receive a packaged photochromic contact lens to be demonstrated. In examples disclosed herein, the cavity is sized to be able to receive a packaged photochromic contact lens so that the photochromic contact lens is protected from damage during the demonstration and so that the contact lens does not have to be disposed of after the demonstration. The photochromic contact lens demonstration device includes a viewing window that allows one to see the contact lens when fully disposed into the cavity to show the change of the contact lens from a non-darkened to a darkened state. To cause the inserted contact lens to change from a non-darkened (e.g., clear) to a darkened state in a demonstration process, a control circuit in the photochromic contact lens demonstration device is configured to be activated that causes the UV/HEV lighting-emitting device to emit UV/HEV light to the photochromic contact lens. The cavity of the photochromic contact lens demonstration device is designed to align the contact lens with the UV/HEV light so that the contact lens is exposed to UV/HEV light when the lighting-emitting device is activated. After a period of time of exposure of the photochromic contact lens to the UV/HEV light, the photochromic contact lens will change from a non-darkened to darkened state, which can be seen through the viewing window. The control circuit of the photochromic contact lens demonstration device is also configured to deactivate the UV/HEV light after a period of time to allow the photochromic contact lens to change back to the non-darkened state to demonstrate the full changing from a non-darkened state, to a darkened state, and then back to the non-darkened state.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Generally, photochromic materials used in photochromic lenses change from a non-darkened state to a darker state more quickly when exposed to UV/HEV light at body temperature than when the photochromic material is exposed to UV/HEV light at a lower ambient temperature. In other words, the fade rate of a photochromic lens changing from a non-darkened state to a darkened state is faster when photochromic lens is at body temperature versus a lower ambient temperature. Thus, photochromic materials will also change more quickly from the darkened state back to the non-darkened state after exposure to UV/HEV light is removed at body temperature than a lower ambient temperature for a given period of time, because the photochromic material will have originally changed to a less darkened state when exposed to UV/HEV light at body temperature versus ambient temperature. However, a photochromic contact lens is not installed in a patient at body temperature during demonstration.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Thus, in other exemplary aspects disclosed herein, to simulate the photochromic contact lens being installed in a patient's eye at ocular body temperature to more quickly demonstrate the changing of a photochromic contact lenses from a darkened state back to a non-darkened state, the photochromic contact lens demonstration device can also include an optional heating circuit to heat and elevate the temperature of the photochromic contact lens during demonstration.

The demonstration device <b>200</b> can be configured to perform an automated demonstration process in various operating modes to expose the photochromic contact lens to UV and/or HEV light to cause the photochromic contact lens to change from normal, non-darkened state to a darkened state, and then discontinue the exposure to UV and/or HEV light that causes the change back from the darkened state to a non-darkened state.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a left, side perspective view of the exemplary demonstration device <b>200</b>.

With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, the interior component <b>226</b> provides an interior surface <b>230</b>, which forms the bottom surface <b>228</b> of the slot <b>208</b>, to provide a contact lens region <b>232</b> where a photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> will be aligned when a contact lens package <b>102</b> is fully inserted in the slot <b>208</b>. The interior component <b>226</b> also includes a rear wall <b>234</b> that forms a proximal end <b>236</b> of the slot <b>208</b>. Side walls <b>238</b>A, <b>238</b>B of the interior component <b>226</b> along with the rear wall <b>234</b> form the interior space <b>240</b> of the slot <b>208</b> in which an inserted contact lens package <b>102</b> is inserted and registered. The interior space <b>240</b> is designed so that a photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> in a contact lens package <b>102</b> fully inserted into the slot <b>208</b> is axially aligned with the contact lens region <b>232</b>. The contact lens region <b>232</b> is axially aligned with the viewing window <b>220</b>. Thus, the slot <b>208</b> aligns a photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> of an inserted contact lens package <b>102</b> with the viewing window <b>220</b> so that the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> can be viewed when inserted in the demonstration device <b>200</b>. As will also be discussed in more detail below, the interior component <b>226</b> also includes an opening <b>242</b> that is configured to expose an optional heating circuit <b>244</b> installed in the housing <b>202</b>. The opening <b>242</b> is aligned with and below the contact lens region <b>232</b>. The heating circuit <b>244</b> includes a heating element <b>245</b> that is aligned with the opening <b>242</b> and the contact lens region <b>232</b>. In this manner, by the heating element <b>245</b> being located in alignment and below the contact lens region <b>232</b>, a photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> in a contact lens package <b>102</b> inserted in the slot <b>208</b> is located directly above and adjacent to the heating element <b>245</b> so that the temperature around the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> can be elevated to heat the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> during demonstration. As previously discussed, the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> can more quickly change from a non-darkened to darkened state at elevated temperatures when exposed UV and/or HEV light. In this example, the heating element <b>245</b> is an aluminum, dome-shaped component <b>246</b> that is configured to be coupled to electrical current under control of the control circuit <b>204</b> to generate heat. The heating circuit <b>244</b> also includes a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>247</b> that is coupled to the heating element <b>245</b> and is also interfaced with the control circuit <b>204</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref> is a bottom view of the cover <b>210</b> of the housing <b>202</b> of the photochromic contact lens demonstration device <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> to illustrate exemplary detail of the lighting device <b>206</b>.

In this example, the lighting device <b>206</b> is provided in the form of a lighting lens <b>250</b> that includes a translucent, circular-shaped housing <b>252</b> housing a circular-shaped PCB <b>254</b> that is formed around and adjacent to the outer edge of the viewing window <b>220</b>. UV/HEV light emitting diodes (LEDs) <b>256</b> are mounted to the PCB <b>254</b>. In this manner, when the UV/HEV LEDs <b>256</b> are activated by the control circuit <b>204</b>, the UV/HEV LEDs <b>256</b> emit UV and/or HEV light that reaches the contact lens region <b>232</b> where a photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> is disposed when its contact lens package <b>102</b> is inserted in the slot <b>208</b> aligning its photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> to the contact lens region <b>232</b> and the viewing window <b>220</b>. UV light is in the wavelength band of 10-400 nm. HEV light is in the wavelength band between 400-450 nm. For example, the UV/HEV LEDs <b>256</b> may be configured to emit light including a wavelength between 200-460 nanometers (nm), and in one example 405 nm. As will be discussed in more detail below, visible LEDs <b>258</b>, such as white light LEDs, can also be mounted on the PCB <b>254</b> and coupled (e.g., through ribbon cable <b>260</b>) to the control circuit <b>204</b>. The visible LEDs <b>258</b> are capable to emit light in the visible spectrum.

This step <b>302</b>(<b>1</b>) is performed in a standby operating mode of the control circuit <b>204</b> before the control circuit <b>204</b> is activated to position the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> in the contact lens region <b>232</b> to prepare the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> to be exposed to UV/HEV light by the lighting device <b>206</b> to demonstrate the change of the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b>.

This causes the control circuit <b>204</b> to enter into a heating operating mode from the standby operating mode. As will be discussed in more detail below, in response to activation of the switch <b>224</b>, the control circuit <b>204</b> activates the visible LEDs <b>258</b> in the lighting device <b>206</b> to cause the visible LEDs <b>258</b> to emit visible light to the contact lens region <b>232</b>. The control circuit <b>204</b> causes the visible LEDs <b>258</b> to emit visible (e.g. white) light <b>304</b> in this example to provide a visual indicator or feedback to the user that acknowledges the activation of the switch <b>224</b> and that the demonstration process has been initiated by the control circuit <b>204</b>.

In this example, the control circuit <b>204</b> also activates the optional heating circuit <b>244</b> in response to activation of the switch <b>224</b> to couple the heating element <b>245</b> to electrical current, which will then cause the heating element <b>245</b> to generate heat and raise the temperature surrounding the contact lens region <b>232</b> including the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> in the contact lens package <b>102</b> inserted into the slot <b>208</b>. As discussed above, increasing the temperature of the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> during demonstration will enable the fading rate of the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> going from a darkened state to a non-darkened state to change faster. The fading rate of the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> changing from a non-darkened state to a darkened state is the rate or speed at which the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> changes from the non-darkened state to the darkened state. Thus, increasing the temperature of the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> during demonstration can make demonstration of a photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> to represent on-eye performance by a doctor or other technician to potential purchaser patients more realistic.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this example, in step <b>302</b>(<b>2</b>) in the heating operating mode, the control circuit <b>204</b> causes the lighting device <b>206</b> to pulse the visible LEDs <b>258</b> as a visual indicator that the heating circuit <b>244</b> is active and in the process of causing the heating element <b>245</b> to generate heat to raise the temperature in the surrounding area to a defined threshold temperature programmed or pre-programmed for the control circuit <b>204</b>. For example, the defined threshold temperature may be 55 degrees Celsius. In the heating operating mode, the control circuit <b>204</b> can be configured to keep the heating element <b>245</b> active for a defined initialization period or until the temperature in the surrounding area raises to the defined threshold temperature. As will be discussed in more detail below, the control circuit <b>204</b> can be configured to pulse the visible LEDs <b>258</b> until the control circuit <b>204</b> detects that the temperature has reached the defined threshold temperature.

The UV/HEV LEDs <b>256</b> when activated illuminate the contact lens regions <b>232</b> with UV/HEV light. In this example, the control circuit <b>204</b> can enter the lens demonstration operating mode thereby deactivating the visible LEDs <b>258</b> and activating the UV/HEV LEDs <b>256</b> to emit UV/HEV light <b>306</b> to the contact lens region <b>232</b> in response to another single activation/re-activation of the switch <b>224</b> by a user after the temperature of the contact lens region <b>232</b> reaches the defined threshold temperature and is being maintained.

As previously discussed, exposing the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> to UV/HEV light <b>306</b> causes the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> to change from a non-darkened state to a darkened state. In the lens demonstration operating mode, in this example step <b>302</b>(<b>4</b>), the control circuit <b>204</b> will continue to control the heating circuit <b>244</b> to cause the temperature in the contact lens regions <b>232</b> to be maintained to the defined threshold temperature to simulate the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> being installed in a human eye at ocular body temperature. As previously discussed, the fade rate of the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> transitioning from the non-darkened state to the darkened state at higher temperatures (e.g., body temperature) will be less than the fade rate of the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> transitioning from the non-darkened state to the darkened state at lower temperatures (e.g., ambient temperature). Thus, maintaining the elevated temperature of the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> will allow the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> to change back from a darkened state to a non-darkened state faster once the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> is no longer exposed to the UV/HEV light <b>306</b>.

The defined demonstration time can be selected and/or programmed for the control circuit <b>204</b> based on empirical understanding of how long it takes for the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> to change from a non-darkened to a darkened state based on the exposure to the UV/HEV LEDs <b>256</b> at the defined threshold temperature. Then, in step <b>302</b>(<b>5</b>), the control circuit <b>204</b> may then be configured to cause the lighting device <b>206</b> to deactivate the UV/HEV LEDs <b>256</b> and re-activate the visible LEDs <b>258</b> in the lighting device <b>206</b> to show the user the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> in a darkened state with the visible light <b>304</b> for viewing. The control circuit <b>204</b> can be programmed to maintain activation of the visible LEDs <b>258</b> for a defined period of time (e.g., 90 seconds) while the photochromic contact lens <b>100</b> begins to change back from the darkened state to the non-darkened state as a result of not being exposed to the UV/HEV light <b>306</b>.
