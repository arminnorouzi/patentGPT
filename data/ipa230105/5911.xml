Although the exemplary implementation modes of the present disclosure are shown in the drawings, it should be understood that the present disclosure may be implemented in various forms and shall not be limited by the implementation modes described here. Rather, these implementation modes are provided for more fully understanding of the present disclosure and to completely convey the scope of the present disclosure to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present disclosure is more specifically described below by means of examples. The advantages and features of the present disclosure will be clearer according to the following description and claims. It is to be noted that the accompanying drawings are all in a very simplified form without precise scale to assist in illustrating the purpose of the embodiments of the present disclosure easily and clearly.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">It should be understood that the meaning of &#x201c;on&#x201d;, &#x201c;over&#x201d; and &#x201c;above&#x201d; in the present disclosure should be interpreted in the broadest possible way, so that when one object is referred to as being &#x201c;on . . . &#x201d; other objects, it may means not only that an object may be on the other objects without intermediate elements or layers (that is, the object is directly on the other objects), but also that an object is on the other objects with intermediate elements or layers therebetween.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, Spatial relation terms, such as &#x201c;on&#x201d;, &#x201c;over&#x201d;, &#x201c;above . . . &#x201d;, &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper part&#x201d; and the like for conveniently describing a relationship between one element or feature shown in the drawings and other elements or features in the present disclosure. In addition to the orientation described in the accompanying drawings, the spatial relation terms are intended to cover different orientations of a device in use or operation. A device may be oriented in other ways (rotated 90 degrees or in other orientations), and the spatial relation terms used here are interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; refers to a material on which subsequent material layers are added. The substrate itself may be patterned. The material added to the top of the substrate may be patterned or may remain un-patterned. In addition, the substrate may include a variety of semiconductor materials, such as silicon, silicon germanium, germanium, gallium arsenide, and indium phosphide. Alternatively, the substrate may be made of non-conductive materials, such as glass, plastic, or sapphire wafer.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;layer&#x201d; refers to a material part that includes an area with thickness. The layer may extend over the entirety of the structure below it or above it, or may have an area smaller than the area of the structure below it or above it. Moreover, the layer may be an area with a homogeneous or heterogeneous continuous structure whose thickness is less than that of a continuous structure. For example, the layer may be between the top surface and the bottom surface of the continuous structure, or the layer may be between any horizontal surface pair at the top surface and bottom surface of the continuous structure. The layer may extend horizontally, vertically and/or along an inclined surface. The layer may include multiple sub-layers. For example, an interconnection layer may include one or more conductor and contact sub-layers (which form interconnection wires and/or through-hole contacts), and one or more dielectric sub-layers.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Terms &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d; and the like in the embodiments of the present disclosure are adopted to distinguish similar objects and not intended to describe a specific sequence or order.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The semiconductor structure involved in the embodiments of the present disclosure will be used in the subsequent processing to form at least a part of the structure of final devices. Here, the final devices may include a memory. The memory includes, but is not limited to, a DRAM. The DRAM is only taken as an example for description below.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is to be noted that the description about the DRAM in the following embodiments is only used for illustrating the present disclosure, but not for limiting the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">With the development of the DRAM technology, the size of a storage unit becomes smaller and smaller, and its array architecture changes from 8F<sup>2 </sup>to 6F<sup>2 </sup>to 4F<sup>2</sup>. In addition, based on the requirements for ions and leakage current in the DRAM, the architecture of the memory changes from a planar array transistor to a recess gate array transistor, from the recess gate array transistor to a buried channel array transistor, and then from the buried channel array transistor to a vertical channel array transistor.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, whether the planar array transistor, the recess gate array transistor, the buried channel array transistor or the vertical channel array transistor, the DRAM is composed of multiple storage units. The structure of each storage unit is mainly composed of a transistor and a storage unit (storage capacitor) controlled by the transistor. That is, the DRAM includes the architecture (1T1C) of one transistor (T) and one capacitor (C). The main working principle thereof is to use the amount of charges stored in the capacitor to represent whether a binary bit is 1 or 0.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows a circuit connection using the architecture of 1T1C provided in an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the drain of the transistor T is electrically connected to a bit line (BL). The source of the transistor T is electrically connected to one electrode plate of the capacitor C, and another electrode plate of the capacitor C may be connected to a reference voltage which may be a ground voltage or other voltages. The gate of the transistor T is connected to a word line (WL). The transistor T is controlled to be turned on or off by applying a voltage through the word line WL, and the bit line BL is used to perform read or write operations on the transistor T when the transistor T is turned on.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">However, in order to realize the miniaturization of memories, the size of the DRAM becomes smaller and smaller, and the size of the capacitor also becomes smaller, which makes the process of forming the capacitor more and more difficult. Meanwhile, there is a problem of electric leakage of the capacitor during the use, and there is a problem of mutual interference among multiple lower electrode plates in the capacitor.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Based on this, in order to solve one or more of the above problems, the embodiments of the present disclosure provide a method for manufacturing a semiconductor structure, which can improve the problem of electric leakage of the capacitor and the problem of mutual interference among multiple lower electrode plates in the capacitor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a flowchart of a method for manufacturing a semiconductor structure provided in an embodiment of the present disclosure.
