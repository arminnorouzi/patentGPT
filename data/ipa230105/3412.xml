No. 17/153,669 filed Jan. 20, 2021, by Leema Kulandaisamy et al., entitled &#x201c;PROACTIVE SYSTEM CONTROL USING HUMIDITY PREDICTION,&#x201d; which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates generally to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems and methods of their use. More particularly, in certain embodiments, this disclosure relates to proactive system control using humidity prediction.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are used to regulate environmental conditions within an enclosed space. In a cooling mode, air is cooled via heat transfer with refrigerant flowing through the HVAC system and returned to the enclosed space as cooled conditioned air. In a heating mode, air is heated via heat transfer with a heating element and returned to the enclosed space as heated conditioned air.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To provide comfort to occupants of a space, an HVAC system may be operated to maintain the space near a desired humidity. For example, a humidity sensor may be placed in a conditioned space, and measures of humidity may be used to humidify/dehumidify the space to attempt to achieve a target indoor humidity. This disclosure recognizes that previous approaches to humidity control suffers from disadvantages. For example, in cases where there are changes in outdoor conditions, indoor humidity, and/or heating/cooling demand, there may be long periods of discomfort for occupants before the target humidity can be reached.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This disclosure contemplates an unconventional HVAC system that solves problems of conventional systems, including those described above by providing systems, methods, and devices for determining an anticipated indoor humidity and proactively adjusting operation of the HVAC system based on this information. The HVAC system, in certain embodiments, includes a controller that monitors indoor humidity values at different energy demands (e.g., for cooling and/or heating by the HVAC system) and stores a record of this information. During future times, this record of humidity values as a function of energy demand is used along with weather data to recursively determine a set of anticipated indoor humidity values. The HVAC system may then be operated proactively to dehumidify/humidify a space based on anticipated values of indoor humidity. This disclosure presents several technical advantages that improve the operation of an HVAC system. For example, by anticipating future indoor humidity values, humidification or dehumidification can be provided before an anticipated change in conditions, such that time periods during which the conditioned space is uncomfortable for occupants is greatly reduced or eliminated. The HVAC system may also be operated more efficiently by proactively adjusting operation based on anticipated humidity values rather than reactively adjusting operation based on measured humidity values. Certain embodiments may include none, some, or all of the above technical advantages. One or more other technical advantages may be readily apparent to one skilled in the art from the figures, descriptions, and claims included herein.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an embodiment, an HVAC system includes an indoor humidity sensor positioned and configured to measure an indoor humidity value of air an enclosed space, an outdoor humidity sensor positioned and configured to measure an outdoor humidity value of outdoor air, and a controller communicatively coupled to the indoor humidity sensor and the outdoor humidity sensor. During an initial period of time, the controller receives the indoor humidity value measured by the indoor humidity sensor and the outdoor humidity value measured by the outdoor humidity sensor. The controller stores a record of an energy demand of the HVAC system for each received indoor humidity value and outdoor humidity value. The energy demand of the HVAC system corresponds to an amount of energy used to operate the HVAC system. For a first time point of a future time period that occurs after the initial period of time, a first indoor humidity value and a first outdoor humidity value are received. For the future time period, an anticipated energy demand of the HVAC system is determined based at least in part on the first indoor humidity value, the first outdoor humidity value, and the record of the energy demand during the initial period of time. The controller then recursively determines, for each of a plurality of time points within the future time period following the first time point, an anticipated indoor humidity value using the anticipated energy demand for the future time period. The HVAC system is operated based at least in part on the anticipated indoor humidity value.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For a more complete understanding of the present disclosure, reference is now made to the following description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram of an example HVAC system configured for proactive operation based on anticipated indoor humidity values;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example method of operating the HVAC system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> are plots of example measured humidity values and humidity values predicted using the approach of this disclosure, according to an illustrative embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram of an example controller of the HVAC system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments of the present disclosure and its advantages are best understood by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>4</b></figref> of the drawings, like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As described above, prior to this disclosure, humidity control tended to be inefficient and provided insufficient comfort to occupants of a conditioned space. For example, previous technology may have a slow response to changes in indoor humidity, such that a conditioned space may reach an uncomfortable humidity level before the HVAC system is able to adjust operation of a humidifier or dehumidifier to reach a comfortable humidity level. This disclosure recognizes these problems and facilitates the determination of anticipated indoor humidity values. The HVAC system may be proactively operated to provide dehumidification or humidification, such that a conditioned space can efficiently be maintained in a preferred humidity range for occupant comfort (e.g., within a threshold range of a humidity setpoint).</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">HVAC System</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of an HVAC system <b>100</b> with a controller <b>146</b> configured to determine anticipated indoor humidity values <b>158</b> and appropriate adjust operation of the HVAC system <b>100</b> to proactively maintain a conditioned space at or near a humidity setpoint <b>144</b>. The HVAC system <b>100</b> conditions air for delivery to a conditioned space. The conditioned space may be, for example, a room, a house, an office building, a warehouse, or the like. In some embodiments, the HVAC system <b>100</b> is a rooftop unit (RTU) that is positioned on the roof of a building and the conditioned air is delivered to the interior of the building. In other embodiments, portion(s) of the system <b>100</b> may be located within the building and portion(s) outside the building. The HVAC system <b>100</b> may include one or more heating elements, not shown for convenience and clarity. The HVAC system <b>100</b> may be configured as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or in any other suitable configuration. For example, the HVAC system <b>100</b> may include additional components or may omit one or more components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The HVAC system <b>100</b> includes a working-fluid conduit subsystem <b>102</b>, at least one condensing unit <b>104</b>, an expansion valve <b>114</b>, an evaporator <b>116</b>, a dehumidifier and/or humidifier <b>118</b>, a blower <b>130</b>, one or more thermostats <b>140</b>, and a controller <b>146</b>. The working-fluid conduit subsystem <b>102</b> facilitates the movement of a working fluid (e.g., a refrigerant) through a cooling cycle such that the working fluid flows as illustrated by the dashed arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The working fluid may be any acceptable working fluid including, but not limited to hydroflurocarbons (e.g. R-<b>410</b>A) or any other suitable type of refrigerant.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The condensing unit <b>104</b> includes a compressor <b>106</b>, a condenser <b>108</b>, and a fan <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the condensing unit <b>104</b> is an outdoor unit while other components of system <b>100</b> may be located indoors. The compressor <b>106</b> is coupled to the working-fluid conduit subsystem <b>102</b> and compresses (i.e., increases the pressure of) the working fluid. The compressor <b>106</b> of condensing unit <b>104</b> may be a single-stage compressor, a variable-speed compressor, or a multi-stage compressor. A variable-speed compressor is generally configured to operate at different speeds to increase the pressure of the working fluid to keep the working fluid moving along the working-fluid conduit subsystem <b>102</b>. If compressor <b>106</b> is a variable-speed compressor, the speed of the compressor <b>106</b> can be modified to adjust the cooling capacity of the HVAC system <b>100</b> and/or the amount of moisture removed from air <b>120</b> passing across the evaporator <b>116</b>, described further below. In the multi-stage compressor configuration, one or more compressors can be turned on or off to adjust the cooling capacity and/or dehumidification capacity of the HVAC system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The compressor <b>106</b> is in signal communication with the controller <b>146</b> using wired and/or wireless connection. The controller <b>146</b> provides commands and/or signals to control operation of the compressor <b>106</b> and/or receives signals from the compressor <b>106</b> corresponding to a status of the compressor <b>106</b>. For example, when the compressor <b>106</b> is a variable-speed compressor, the controller <b>146</b> may provide signals to control compressor speed. When the compressor <b>106</b> operates as a multi-stage compressor, the signals may correspond to an indication of which compressors to turn on and off to adjust the compressor <b>106</b> for a given cooling and/or dehumidification capacity. The controller <b>146</b> may operate the compressor <b>106</b> in different modes corresponding to load conditions (e.g., the amount of cooling or heating requested from the HVAC system <b>100</b>). The controller <b>146</b> is described in greater detail below and with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The condenser <b>108</b> is configured to facilitate movement of the working fluid through the working-fluid conduit subsystem <b>102</b>. The condenser <b>108</b> is generally located downstream of the compressor <b>106</b> and is configured to remove heat from the working fluid. The fan <b>110</b> is configured to move air <b>112</b> across the condenser <b>108</b>. For example, the fan <b>110</b> may be configured to blow outside air through the condenser <b>108</b> to help cool the working fluid flowing therethrough. The fan <b>110</b> may be in communication with the controller <b>146</b> (e.g., via wired and/or wireless communication) to receive control signals for turning the fan <b>110</b> on and off and/or adjusting a speed of the fan <b>110</b>. The compressed, cooled working fluid flows from the condenser <b>108</b> toward the expansion device <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The expansion device <b>114</b> is coupled to the working-fluid conduit subsystem <b>102</b> downstream of the condenser <b>108</b> and is configured to remove pressure from the working fluid. In this way, the working fluid is delivered to the evaporator <b>116</b> and/or the humidifier/dehumidifier <b>118</b>. In general, the expansion device <b>114</b> may be a valve such as an expansion valve or a flow control valve (e.g., a thermostatic expansion valve (TXV)) or any other suitable valve for removing pressure from the working fluid while, optionally, providing control of the rate of flow of the working fluid. The expansion device <b>114</b> may be in communication with the controller <b>146</b> (e.g., via wired and/or wireless communication) to receive control signals for opening and/or closing associated valves and/or to provide flow measurement signals corresponding to the rate of working fluid flow through the working-fluid conduit subsystem <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The evaporator <b>116</b> is generally any heat exchanger configured to provide heat transfer between air flowing through (or across) the evaporator <b>116</b> (i.e., air <b>120</b> contacting an outer surface of one or more coils of the evaporator <b>116</b>) and working fluid passing through the interior of the evaporator <b>116</b>. The evaporator <b>116</b> may include one or more circuits of coils. The evaporator <b>116</b> is fluidically connected to the compressor <b>106</b>, such that working fluid generally flows from the evaporator <b>116</b> to the condensing unit <b>104</b> when the HVAC system <b>100</b> is operating to provide cooling and/or dehumidification.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The humidifier and/or dehumidifier <b>118</b> may include one or more devices operable to add moisture to or remove moisture from the air <b>120</b>. For example, a humidifier <b>118</b> may be any humidification unit, such as a drum style humidifier, a disc wheel humidifier, a spray mist humidifier, or the like. The controller <b>146</b> may provide signals instructing the humidifier <b>118</b> to operate based on the anticipated humidity values <b>158</b>, as described in greater detail below. For example, the controller <b>146</b> may determine that the anticipated humidity <b>158</b> is soon to fall at least a threshold amount below a humidity setpoint <b>144</b> and, in response to this determination, cause the humidifier <b>118</b> to activate to begin increasing the humidity of air <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A dehumidifier <b>118</b> may be any dehumidification unit, such as a heat pump dehumidifier or the like. For example, the controller <b>146</b> may determine that the anticipated humidity <b>158</b> is soon to increase at least a threshold amount above the humidity setpoint <b>144</b> and, in response to this determination, cause the dehumidifier <b>118</b> to activate to begin decreasing the humidity of air <b>122</b>. Dehumidification may also or alternatively be provided by the evaporator <b>116</b>. For example, in response to an appropriate anticipated humidity value (e.g., that is greater than a threshold value), operation of the HVAC system <b>100</b> may be adjusted to provide dehumidification via the evaporator <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">For example, the sensible heat ratio (&#x201c;S/T ratio&#x201d;) of the HVAC system <b>100</b> may be adjusted to increase the amount of latent heat removal (i.e., for dehumidification). The extent of cooling and dehumidification the HVAC system <b>100</b> can achieve is generally determined by its sensible capacity (Sc) and latent capacity (Lc). The HVAC system <b>100</b> generally has a total capacity (Tc), which is the sum of the sensible capacity and latent capacity (i.e., Tc=Sc+Lc). Generally, sensible capacity refers to an ability of the HVAC system <b>100</b> to remove sensible heat from air <b>120</b> (i.e., to cool the air). As used herein, sensible heat refers to heat that, when added to or removed from the air <b>120</b>, results in a temperature change of the air <b>120</b>. Comparatively, latent heat refers to the ability of an HVAC system <b>100</b> to remove latent heat from the air <b>120</b> (i.e., to dehumidify the air <b>120</b>). As used herein, latent heat refers to heat that, when added to or removed from the air <b>120</b>, results in a phase change of, for example, water within the air <b>120</b>. The S/T ratio generally changes proportionally with the ratio of the flow rate of air <b>120</b> provided by the blower <b>130</b> to the tonnage of the HVAC system, which is determined in part by the speed of the compressor <b>106</b>. As such, the controller <b>146</b> may provide instructions to adjust these properties to achieve an appropriate S/T ratio for dehumidification based an anticipated humidity value <b>158</b>. For example, the S/T ratio may be decreased to increase dehumidification of the air <b>120</b> contacting the evaporator <b>116</b>.

The humidity values <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> may be relative humidity values, humidity ratios, or any other appropriate measures of humidity in the conditioned space and the outdoor environment. A relative humidity refers to the amount of water vapor in air as a percentage of the total capacity for water vapor in the air at a given temperature. A humidity ratio refers to the ratio of the weight of water vapor in a volume of air divided by the weight of dry air in the same volume. The HVAC system <b>100</b> may include one or more further sensors (not shown for conciseness), such as sensors for measuring air temperature, and/or any other properties of a conditioned space (e.g. a room of the conditioned space).

One or more functions of the controller <b>146</b> described further below may be performed by the thermostat <b>140</b>. For example, the thermostat <b>140</b> may include the controller <b>146</b>. The thermostat <b>140</b> may be a single-stage thermostat, a multi-stage thermostat, or any suitable type of thermostat. The thermostat <b>140</b> is configured to allow a user to input a desired temperature or temperature setpoint <b>142</b> for the conditioned space and/or for a designated space or zone such as a room in the conditioned space and a humidity setpoint <b>144</b> for the conditioned space and/or for a designated space or zone. The thermostat <b>140</b> may include a temperature sensor and/or humidity sensor. For example, the humidity sensor <b>134</b> may be integrated within the thermostat <b>140</b>. The controller <b>146</b> may use information from the thermostat <b>140</b> such as the temperature setpoint <b>142</b> and/or humidity setpoint <b>144</b> for controlling the compressor <b>10</b>, humidifier/dehumidifier <b>118</b>, and/or blower <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the thermostat <b>140</b> includes a user interface and display for displaying information related to the operation and/or status of the HVAC system <b>100</b>.

The demand <b>150</b> may be the energy demand of the HVAC system <b>100</b>. For example, the demand <b>150</b> may be the amount of energy consumed by the HVAC system <b>100</b> to meet the cooling or heating demand at each combination of indoor humidity value <b>152</b> and outdoor humidity value <b>154</b>. The demand <b>150</b> may correspond to an amount of heat transfer performed by the HVAC system <b>100</b> (e.g., in units of Btu/hr) at each combination of indoor humidity value <b>152</b> and outdoor humidity value <b>154</b>.

This anticipated demand <b>156</b> generally corresponds to an amount of energy predicted to be consumed by the HVAC system <b>100</b> during a future time period after the initial time period during which the demand record <b>148</b> was established. For a number of time points during this subsequent time period, the controller then determines anticipated indoor humidity values <b>158</b>. The anticipated indoor humidity values <b>158</b> are determined recursively, such that the anticipated humidity value <b>158</b> for a given time point is determined using the anticipated humidity value <b>158</b> from the previous time point, as described in greater detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> below (see the recursive loop <b>212</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The controller <b>146</b> then causes the HVAC system <b>100</b> to operate based at least in part on the anticipated indoor humidity values <b>158</b>. For example, the controller <b>146</b> may compare the anticipated indoor humidity values <b>158</b> to the indoor humidity setpoint <b>144</b> to determine if humidification or dehumidification is needed.

For example, the S/T ratio of the HVAC system <b>100</b> may be adjusted to more effectively maintain the humidity <b>152</b> of the conditioned space at or near the humidity setpoint <b>144</b>. For example, the speed of the blower <b>130</b> and/or the compressor <b>106</b> may be adjusted to decrease the S/T ratio such that evaporator <b>116</b> more effectively dehumidifies the air <b>120</b> or increase the S/T ratio such that the air <b>120</b> can be more efficiently humidified by the humidifier <b>118</b> when cooling is being provided by the evaporator <b>116</b> (e.g., to reduce the amount of moisture removed from the air <b>120</b> by the evaporator <b>116</b>).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As described above, in certain embodiments, connections between various components of the HVAC system <b>100</b> are wired.

In a typical embodiment, the data bus may include, for example, any combination of hardware, software embedded in a computer readable medium, or encoded logic incorporated in hardware or otherwise stored (e.g., firmware) to couple components of HVAC system <b>100</b> to each other.

Once the demand record <b>148</b> is established, the controller <b>146</b> begins to operate in a proactive humidity control mode in which operation is adjusted based on the anticipated indoor humidity values <b>158</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The controller <b>146</b> may use a current indoor humidity value <b>152</b> and outdoor humidity value to determine an anticipated demand <b>156</b> for the next period of time (e.g., for the next 15 minutes or any other appropriate period of time). The anticipated demand <b>156</b> may be determined using the current operating mode (i.e., whether cooling or heating is being provided) and/or the current indoor humidity value <b>152</b> and outdoor humidity value <b>154</b>. For instance, if the HVAC system <b>100</b> is currently operating in a cooling mode, the anticipated demand <b>156</b> may be determined as a slightly higher value (e.g., 5%, 10%, or any other appropriate amount higher) than the current demand <b>150</b> of the HVAC system <b>100</b> at the current indoor humidity value <b>152</b> and outdoor humidity value <b>154</b>.

In some embodiments, weather forecast information (e.g., the weather forecast and/or record of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) may be used to refine the determination of the anticipated demand <b>156</b>. For example, if a forecast indicates an upcoming change in temperature and/or humidity or a weather event (e.g., rain, snow, wind, or the like), this information may be used to further improve the determination of the anticipated demand <b>156</b>. For example, if a sudden decrease in temperature is expected, the anticipated demand <b>156</b> for cooling mode operation may be decreased, while the anticipated demand <b>156</b> for heating mode operation may be increased. Similarly, if the current date has historically had particular temperature or humidity characteristics based on historical records, the anticipated demand <b>156</b> may be adjusted based on an expectation of similar conditions.
