It is known that the higher speed of the central processing unit and graphic card, the more heat is generated during operation. To ensure the performance of the central processing unit and graphic card and prevent them from overheating, most computers adopt air and/or water cooling systems to remove waste heat.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Liquid cooling transfers heat much faster than air circulated convection cooling. A conventional liquid cooling system has a water block for absorbing heat, a radiator for dissipating heat, and a pump for pumping the coolant. However, the conventional liquid cooling system is unable to support central processing unit and graphic card at the same time, as a result, a computer is needed to adopt at least two sets of cooling systems to remove heat generated by the central processing unit and graphic card. This not only increases cost but also makes the internal space utilization less flexible.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides a liquid cooling device and an electronic device which are capable of obtaining a balance between miniaturization of liquid cooling system and heat dissipation efficiency for both the central processing unit and the graphics card, where the arrangement of the liquid cooling system is beneficial to achieve a flexible internal space utilization of the electronic device and therefore prevents from affecting the efficiency of air-cooling.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a liquid cooling device configured to cool a first heat source and a second heat source includes a first heat exchanger, a second heat exchanger, a heat dissipation component, and a fluid driving component. The first heat exchanger has a first inlet and a first outlet, and the first heat exchanger is configured to be thermally coupled with the first heat source. The second heat exchanger has a second inlet and a second outlet, and the second heat exchanger is configured to be thermally coupled with the second heat source. The heat dissipation component has a first heat inlet, a second heat inlet, and a heat outlet. The first heat inlet and the second heat inlet are in fluid communication with the heat outlet. The first heat inlet is in fluid communication with the first outlet. The second heat inlet is in fluid communication with the second outlet. The fluid driving component has a fluid inlet, a first fluid outlet, and a second fluid outlet. The fluid inlet is in fluid communication with the heat outlet. The first fluid outlet and the second fluid outlet are respectively in fluid communication with the first heat inlet and the second heat inlet.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the liquid cooling device and the electronic device discussed above, these two circulation path share the fluid driving component and the heat dissipation component; that is, these two circulation path share the same pump and the same radiator. As such, the liquid cooling device is able to support at least two heat sources that are arranged at different places at the same time with the least number of pump and radiator possible. Thus, the liquid cooling device is beneficial to achieve a flexible internal space utilization of the electronic device to achieve a balance between the miniaturization of liquid cooling device and the heat dissipation efficiency for both the central processing unit and the graphics card.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, the first circuit board and the second circuit board are respectively disposed at two opposite sides of the bracket. In this arrangement, the bracket prevents heat generated by the first electronic component and the second electronic component from affecting each other.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure will become more fully understood from the detailed description given hereinbelow and the accompanying drawings which are given by way of illustration only and thus are not intending to limit the present disclosure and wherein:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a partial perspective view of an electronic device according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded view of the electronic device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is another partial perspective view of the electronic device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exploded view of the electronic device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a heat dissipation component of the electronic device in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Aspects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following detailed descriptions with the accompanying drawings.
