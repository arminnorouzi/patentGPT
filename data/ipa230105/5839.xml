Representative examples of the above include aluminum nitride (AlN), gallium nitride (GaN) and indium nitride (InN). In general, an expression below may be used: Al<sub>x</sub>In<sub>y</sub>Ga<sub>1&#x2212;x&#x2212;y</sub>N (where 0&#x2264;x&#x2264;1, 0&#x2264;y&#x2264;1, 0&#x2264;x+y&#x2264;1).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The industry has proposed a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) using such nitride semiconductor. The HEMT includes, for example, an electron transit layer having GaN, and an electron supply layer epitaxially growing on the electron transit layer and having AlGaN. A pair of source electrode and drain electrode are formed in a manner of being connected to the electron supply layer, and a gate electrode is disposed between the two.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Due to polarization caused by lattice mismatch between GaN and AlGaN, 2-dimensional electron gas is formed in the electron transit layer, at a position several A from an inner side of an interface between the electron transit layer and the electron supply layer. The 2-dimensional electron gas is used as a channel to connect the source and the drain. If the 2-dimensional electron gas is cut off by applying a control voltage to the gate electrode, the connection between the source and the drain is also cut off. When the control voltage is not applied to the gate electrode, the source and the drain are connected, and thus the transistor becomes a normally on device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A device using a nitride semiconductor features high withstand voltage, high temperature operation, large current density, fast switching and low on-resistance. Thus, patent document 1 proposes an application in a power device, and the device of said concept is in mass production and well-circulated in market.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent document 1 discloses the following configuration: a ridge-shaped p-type GaN gate layer (a nitride semiconductor gate layer) is laminated on an AlGaN electron supply layer, and a gate electrode is disposed on the p-type GaN gate layer. The channel is eliminated by a depletion layer expanding from the p-type GaN gate layer, hence achieving normally off.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Publication</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">[Patent document 1] Japan Patent Publication No. 2017-73506</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a semiconductor device, a structure in which a source pad, a drain pad and a gate pad on a nitride semiconductor chip are connected to a source lead, a drain lead and a gate lead by metal wires, respectively, is known in the prior art.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, in said structure, the parasitic inductance in the semiconductor device is hardly considered low enough.
