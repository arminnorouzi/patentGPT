The liner impregnated with uncured resin can be positioned within, for example, a pipe to be repaired. Once in place, the resin in the liner can be induced to harden (i.e., &#x201c;cured&#x201d;), producing a strong and rigid pipe within the host pipe. A common way to initiate the chemical reaction causing the liner to harden is to introduce steam into the interior of the liner once it has been positioned in the host pipe. The steam passes through the interior of the liner providing energy to initiate the curing reaction, and then is exhausted from the interior of the liner. In this way, a pipe can be repaired (often more than once) rather than replaced. The life of the pipe before it has to be dug up (for pipes located underground) and replaced is greatly lengthened. Many resins contain a styrene component, which can be broadly be considered a volatile organic component (&#x201c;VOC&#x201d;). The steam exhausted from the liner may contain some of the VOC, as a byproduct of the operation. While it has not been shown that a VOC present in resins commonly used is a threat to persons or to the environment, in the case of styrene there is a noticeable odor that can be offensive to persons who may be living the area where the pipe repair is being carried out. It is known to collect exhausted steam in the form of water, and then to process the water to remove the VOC. However, this may require processing many thousands of gallons of water, and is a delay and an expense over and above the cost of installing the cured in place pipe liner.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">DRAWING DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic left side elevation, partially exploded of a filter assembly;</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective of a carbon filter canister of the filter assembly;</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective of the carbon filter canister with carbon filter panels removed;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a fragmentary, bottom perspective of the carbon filter canister of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, showing openings for draining water from the canister;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a left side photograph of a carbon filter canister;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a front side photograph of the carbon filter canister of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a back side photograph thereof; and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a right side photograph thereof.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several view of the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A filtering system for use with cured in place pipe shown below in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is generally indicated by reference numeral <b>10</b>. This system includes a carbon filter canister, indicated generally at <b>12</b>, that includes carbon selected to capture the volatile organic component (&#x201c;VOC&#x201d;). Although carbon is the preferred filter material, other materials may be used within the scope of the present invention. The canister <b>12</b> has an inlet opening at its top that is covered by a fitting <b>14</b>. Wheels <b>15</b> on the bottom of the canister <b>12</b> allow the canister to be moved more easily around a work site. In the illustrated embodiment, the fitting includes a twelve inch round plate that covers the inlet opening. A smaller (e.g., 2 inch) inlet conduit <b>16</b> passing through the fitting <b>14</b> to the opening in the canister <b>12</b> communicates steam into the canister. A first section <b>16</b>A of the inlet conduit <b>16</b> extends up from the fitting <b>14</b> to a valve <b>18</b>. The valve is a ball valve, but any suitable valve or flow control apparatus can be used. The ball valve <b>18</b> may be used to control the back pressure on the steam in a CIPP liner (not shown) that has been installed in a host pipe and is being subject to a curing process in which steam is injected into the liner. The valve <b>18</b> may also be used to regulate the amount of steam passing into the carbon filter canister <b>12</b>. A second section <b>16</b>B of the inlet conduit <b>16</b> extends from the ball valve <b>18</b> to a connector <b>20</b>. A bracket <b>22</b> holds the inlet conduit <b>16</b> (including the first section <b>16</b>A, the second section <b>16</b>B and the ball valve <b>18</b>) in place with respect to the carbon filter canister <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A steam hose <b>24</b> has a first fitting <b>26</b> at one end that can be sealingly connected to the connector <b>20</b> of the inlet conduit <b>16</b>. The steam hose <b>24</b> can have a length as required to extend from the liner, which may be underground, to the location of the carbon filter canister <b>12</b>. A second fitting <b>28</b> on an opposite end of the steam hose <b>24</b> opposite the first fitting <b>26</b> can be connected to a stinger <b>30</b> (broadly, &#x201c;a liner coupler&#x201d;) that can be inserted into the liner to communicate with the interior of the liner. The stinger <b>30</b> is inserted into the liner at an end which is the downstream end of the liner, opposite the end where steam is introduced into the liner. As shown, the stinger <b>30</b> can be detached from the steam hose <b>24</b>, but any suitable construction of the steam hose and stinger is permissible. The stinger <b>30</b>, steam hose <b>24</b> and inlet conduit <b>16</b> (including the ball valve <b>18</b>) may be considered an &#x201c;exhaust conduit&#x201d; for purposes of the present description.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The carbon filter canister <b>12</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> without any of the plumbing used to attach the canister to the CIPP liner. The canister <b>12</b> has an upper housing <b>12</b>A that defines an internal volume. In the drawings, portions of two of the side of the upper housing <b>12</b>A have rectangular sections broken away to show internal construction. The upper housing <b>12</b>A includes internal baffling (not shown) to break up the stream of exhaust steam entering the upper housing. The baffling can give the exhaust steam some lateral component of motion as it enters a lower housing <b>12</b>B of the carbon filter canister <b>12</b>. The upper housing <b>12</b>A further includes an open top through which the exhaust steam is received from the inlet conduit <b>16</b>. The steam flows down from the upper housing <b>12</b>A into the lower housing <b>12</b>B of the canister <b>12</b> and then outward through openings in the four sides.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Each of the four sides has a carbon filter panel, indicated generally at <b>40</b> so that gas exiting the carbon filter canister <b>12</b> must pass through one of the filter panels before it reaches the environment. The carbon filter panels <b>40</b> comprise activated carbon filters covered on the outside by a mesh screen <b>40</b>A made of a suitable material such as aluminum. The mesh screen <b>40</b>A holds the carbon filter material in the panel <b>40</b>. Other configurations for the carbon filters is possible. For example, and without limitation, the carbon filters could be tubular in shape. Two or more carbon filter tubes could be concentrically placed to achieve the desired level of filtering. The lower housing <b>12</b>B would be reconfigured to removably receive the carbon tubes instead of the panels <b>40</b>. Activated carbon attracts and holds organic chemicals from vapor streams. In the illustrated embodiment, the activated carbon is a blend made from lignite coal, bituminous coal and coconut shell, and performs wall in the capture of styrene from a vapor stream. More specifically, the carbon blend is selected to fit the molecular weight and polarity of styrene in the exhaust steam. As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> showing the carbon filter panels <b>40</b> removed from the canister <b>12</b>, the openings in each the sides of the canister are covered by a respective mesh screen <b>42</b>. The mesh screen may be made of a suitable material, such as polypropylene. The steam must pass through these screens <b>42</b> before reaching the carbon filter panels <b>40</b>. The screens <b>42</b> help to remove water from the gas to reduce water contact with the carbon in the carbon filter panels. The carbon filter panels <b>40</b> can be removed to facilitate replacement. In the illustrated embodiment, buckles <b>43</b> are provided for connecting the carbon filter panels <b>40</b> to the lower housing <b>12</b>B. At least one of the panels <b>40</b> and the lower housing <b>12</b>B includes gasketing to assure a sealing connection between the panels and the lower housing.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the bottom of the canister <b>12</b> includes a tray <b>44</b> the collects water from the steam fed into the canister. The tray has holes <b>46</b> in it which permit water condensed from the steam to pass out of the canister. The holes <b>46</b> may release water directly to the environment or to a holding container (not shown).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in order to monitor the level of VOC in the carbon filter canister <b>12</b>, a PID sensor <b>50</b> (or other suitable sensor) may be provided. In one embodiment, the sensor <b>50</b> is arranged so that it can detect levels of VOC in the canister. If the level exceeds a certain predetermined amount, the sensor <b>50</b> can be configured to provide an indication of that event. In other embodiment, the sensor <b>50</b> may be able to cause the carbon filter system <b>10</b> to stop processing exhaust steam and, for example, shunt condensed steam to a collection area for later treatment. The sensor <b>50</b> for detecting VOC may be sensitive to water. Accordingly, in one embodiment, a filter <b>52</b> preventing entry of water or water vapor into the sensor <b>50</b> may be used.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>8</b></figref> show another constructed version of a filtering system <b>110</b>. The construction is closely similar to what is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>. Therefore, corresponding parts are given the same reference numerals, plus &#x201c;100.&#x201d; It is noted that the ball valve <b>118</b> is located nearer to the end of the inlet conduit <b>116</b> farthest from its connection to the carbon filter canister <b>112</b>, rather than between two sections of the inlet conduit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As may be best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the bracket <b>122</b> includes a stanchion <b>122</b>A mounted on the carbon filter canister <b>112</b>, and a cross bar <b>122</b>B attached to the top of the stanchion. A clamp <b>122</b>C mounted on the cross bar <b>122</b>B attaches and holds the inlet conduit <b>116</b> to the bracket <b>122</b>. The bracket also stabilizes the inlet conduit <b>116</b> with respect to the carbon filter canister <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The filter system of the present invention allows steam which may contain a VOC to be processed simultaneously with the curing of the liner. In one embodiment, the water that results from the filtered steam and be immediately released to the environment. The water from the carbon filter canister can be collected in a drip pan (not shown) at the bottom of the canister and then released.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In use, a liner made of an absorbent material can be saturated with a curable resin (broadly, &#x201c;a curable material&#x201d;) in liquid form. The liner can be installed into a host pipe in need of repair. Typically, the host pipe will be prepared by cleaning prior to installation of the liner. The liner can then be placed into the pipe in a suitable fashion, such as by everting the liner into the pipe and dragging the liner into the pipe. Initially, the liner has the shape of a flattened tube. Once in place in the pipe, the liner closed off at its remote end and is inflated into a roughly tubular shape so that the liner substantially conforms to the walls of the host pipe and defines a new passageway within the pipe for liquids to be transported. The liner is cured so that the resin carried by the liner hardens so that it holds itself in a fixed tubular shape. In this way, an essentially new pipe is formed within the host pipe, giving the pipe a substantially extended life.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A common way to induce curing of the resin in the liner is to introduce steam into the liner so that the steam flows along the full length of the liner. A restricted orifice is provided at the end of the liner opposite the end where the steam is introduced so that the steam may exit the liner, but some backpressure is maintained so that heat from the steam is absorbed by the resin, causing it to cure. One way to allow steam to escape is to insert a stinger <b>30</b> through a wall of the liner so that an open free end of the stinger is inside the liner and exposed to the steam under pressure. Other ways of allowing the steam to exit the liner, such as a saddle vent (not shown) may be used in place of the stinger. The saddle vent (broadly, &#x201c;a liner coupler&#x201d;) may include a metal plate formed to engage a side of the liner. A threaded tube is mounted on the metal plate and extends through an opening in the plate. One or more ratchet straps attached to the plate can be extended around the liner near the end of the run of the liner to secure the saddle vent in place. Prior to placing the metal plate against the liner, felt material (not shown) is wrapped around the liner and the metal plate of the saddle vent is placed against the felt material on the liner. Tightening the ratchet straps forces the plate and threaded tube down against the felt and the underlying liner. A drill can be inserted down the threaded tube and cut through the liner. The threaded tube project through the liner. The felt material is urged against the threaded tube around the opening in the liner so that the saddle vent is sealed with the liner. Therefore, exhaust steam leaving the liner passes into the steam hose <b>24</b> connected to the threaded tube and not into the environment. Saddle vents of the type described herein are shown and described in co-assigned U.S. Pat. No. 8,083,975, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Steam leaving the liner through the stinger <b>30</b> carries with it a quantity of vaporized styrene. It will be understood that the heat of the steam causes some of the styrene in the resin to be vaporized and mixed in with the steam. The exhaust steam travels along the steam hose <b>24</b> to the inlet conduit <b>16</b>. The exhaust steam passes through the open ball valve <b>18</b> and into the interior of the carbon filter canister <b>12</b>. The steam under pressure is forced through the carbon filter panels <b>40</b>. However, first the steam passes through the mesh screen <b>42</b>, which tends to force some of the water out of the steam. The water flows down into the tray <b>44</b> where it can be collected or released to the environment or some other holding container. The styrene remains largely in vapor form and passes through the mesh screens <b>42</b> and into the carbon filter panels <b>40</b>. The carbon filters capture a large majority of the styrene so that the amount of styrene in the exhaust steam leaving the carbon filter panels <b>40</b> has been measured to be 70% to 85% less than the amount of steam entering the carbon filter canister <b>12</b>. The range can be understood as being dependent upon the diameter of the liner being cured, the initial styrene concentration, etc.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Some of the exhaust steam entering the carbon filter canister <b>12</b> is diverted through filter <b>52</b> to remove water, and then to the sensor <b>50</b>. The sensor measures the styrene content of the incoming exhaust gas. The ball valve <b>18</b> can be used to control the amount of exhaust steam entering the canister <b>12</b> and to control backpressure in the liner. A suitable pressure sensor (not shown) is provided for measuring the pressure of the steam in the liner. In some embodiments, the ball valve <b>18</b> is used to control backpressure to about 3 psi when the stinger <b>30</b> or saddle vent is being installed. The ball valve <b>18</b> is thereafter used to maintain the backpressure at about 7-10 psi to fully inflate the liner and hold the liner open during the steam cure process.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
