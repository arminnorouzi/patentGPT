The probe apparatus is provided with a sensor that includes a light emitting element and a light detecting element. Light emitted from the light emitting element is detected by the light detecting element after interacting with a living body. Based on intensity of the detected light, physiological information about the living body is acquired. The probe apparatus is provided with a plurality of electrically conductive pads electrically connected to the sensor, and a plurality of electrically conductive wires through any of which a signal used in the sensor can flow. Each of the plurality of electrically conductive wires is connected to a corresponding one of the plurality of electrically conductive pads.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An object of the presently disclosed subject matter is to enhance resistance to external force applied from an environment while meeting a demand for miniaturization of a probe apparatus.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a first aspect for achieving the foregoing object, there is provided a probe apparatus including:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">a sensor including at least one element;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">a plurality of electrically conductive wires each of which has a connection portion at which electrical connection is made between the electrically conductive wire and the sensor so that a signal used in the sensor can flow through the electrically conductive wire; and</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">an insulative member configured to cover at least one of the electrically conductive wires at a place nearer to a tip than the connection portion in the at least one electrically conductive wire, the insulative member having an electrical insulating property.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to meet a demand for miniaturization of the probe apparatus, a diameter of each of the electrically conductive wires tends to be smaller and a distance between adjacent ones of the electrically conductive wires tends to be narrower. In such a situation, external force applied to the probe apparatus from an environment may cause the adjacent electrically conductive wires to unexpectedly approach each other. According to the aforementioned configuration, contact between the electrically conductive wires is blocked by the insulative member. Accordingly, it is possible to enhance resistance to the external force applied from the environment while meeting the demand for miniaturization of the probe apparatus.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a second aspect for achieving the foregoing object, there is provided a probe apparatus including:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">a sensor including at least one element; and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">a plurality of electrically conductive wires each of which has a connection portion at which electrical connection is made between the electrically conductive wire and the sensor so that a signal used in the sensor can flow through the electrically conductive wire,</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">wherein adjacent ones of the electrically conductive wires are disposed so that a distance between places nearer to tips than the connection portions in the adjacent electrically conductive wires is wider than a distance between places farther from the tips than the connection portions in the adjacent electrically conductive wires.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to meet the demand for miniaturization of the probe apparatus, a cable in which a distance between adjacent ones of electrically conductive wires is narrower tends to be used. According to the aforementioned configuration in which the distance between the adjacent electrically conductive wires is widened toward the tips of the electrically conductive wires, contact between the electrically conductive wires caused by external force applied from an environment may be suppressed even when such a cable is used. Therefore, it is possible to enhance resistance to the external force applied from the environment while meeting the demand for miniaturization of the probe apparatus.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a third aspect for achieving the foregoing object, there is provided a method for manufacturing a probe apparatus, the method including the steps of:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">preparing a plurality of electrically conductive wires that have been respectively covered with coating members each having an electrical insulating property;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">removing a second portion from at least one of the coating members while leaving a first portion therein so as to form an exposed portion where a corresponding one of the electrically conductive wires is exposed, the first portion being at a place nearer to a tip of the corresponding electrically conductive wire, the second portion being at a place farther from the tip; and</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">electrically connecting the exposed portion to a sensor including at least one element.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">When the probe apparatus according to each of the aforementioned aspects is manufactured using the electrically conductive wires covered with the coating members, the step of removing a part from the coating member so as to form the exposed portion where the corresponding electrically conductive wire is exposed for electrical connection is necessary. Since another part left in the coating member through this step is used as an insulative member, the material to be wasted can be reduced. In addition, a step of preparing the insulative member as a separate member and attaching the insulative member to the electrically conductive wire can be dispensed with. Therefore, not only can an increase in material cost be suppressed, but also efficiency in manufacturing work of the probe apparatus can be enhanced.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating external appearance of a probe apparatus according to an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a state in which the probe apparatus in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> has been attached to a fingertip of a subject.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating electrical connection between an optical sensor and a cable in the probe apparatus in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a method for making the electrical connection between the optical sensor and the cable in the probe apparatus in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a detailed configuration of a portion where the electrical connection in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is made.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">With reference to the accompanying drawings, an embodiment will be described in detail below by way of example.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates external appearance of a probe apparatus <b>10</b> in an embodiment.
