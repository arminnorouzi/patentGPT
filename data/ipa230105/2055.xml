id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a seat passenger arrangement. The invention finds a particularly advantageous, but not exclusive, application in the field of commercial aviation, mainly for an aircraft cabin space of the business or premium class type.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, many business class seat arrangements have been developed in order to find a compromise between passenger comfort and optimization of the seat filling density inside the aircraft cabin. Seat arrangements must also guarantee sufficient space for the service performed by the flight staff. However, few solutions are suitable for single-aisle aircraft, mainly used for short- and medium-haul aircrafts.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Indeed, in the existing seat arrangements, direct access to the aisles for all the seats is not systematically guaranteed. In addition, the layouts for the premium and business class cabins do not all include seats suitable for taking up a bed position. Passenger spaces can also vary according to the position of the seat inside the aircraft cabin. Existing seat configurations are also difficult to adapt to different cabin sizes and may present access problems for people with reduced mobility.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Document WO2014/049362 describes a seat unit arrangement comprising at least one rear group of two seat units and at least one front group of two seat units. Each group of two seat units comprises a seat unit arranged on the aisle side and a seat unit arranged on the window side. However, the seats located side by side in a group are isolated from each other, requiring that the width of the access passage for the seats on the window side be at least equal to the standard width (27.94 cm or 11 inches) in order to guarantee an emergency evacuation. Such a width therefore reduces the passenger space. In addition, the seats located on the window side are aligned and arranged one behind the other, which does not make it possible optimize the filling of the aircraft cabin.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention aims to remedy these drawbacks effectively by proposing an aircraft cabin having a longitudinal axis and comprising at least one aisle and a seat unit arrangement, a seat unit comprising in particular a seat provided with a seating surface and a backrest as well as a foot area, said seat being movable between a sitting position and a bed position, said seat unit arrangement comprising:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">at least one rear group of two seat units,</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">at least one front group of two seat units,</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">each group of two seat units comprising a seat unit on the aisle side, so-called &#x201c;aisle-side seat unit&#x201d; and a seat unit on the window side, so-called &#x201c;window-side seat unit&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">each seat of a group of seat units having an axis forming a non-zero angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft cabin, so that the seats of each group face the aisle,</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">a first access passage to the aisle associated with the window-side seat unit of the rear group extending between the foot area and the seat of the aisle-side seat unit of the rear group, and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">a second access passage to the aisle associated with the window-side seat unit of the rear group extending between the aisle-side seat unit of the front group and the foot area of the aisle-side seat unit of the rear group.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention thus allows direct access to the aisle for all passengers, while providing a large space and a high. seat filling density inside the aircraft cabin. Furthermore, as the window-side seat has two access passages to the aisle, the dedicated passage may have a reduced width so as to optimize the lateral requirement in size of the seat units, while the first passage may be used in particular in the event of an emergency evacuation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention further provides a flexible configuration that can be configured according to different aircraft cabin lengths in order to increase or decrease the cabin seat filling density without modifying the dimensions of a seat unit. The invention also provides substantially equal space for all passengers in the aircraft cabin, as well as reasonable privacy for all passengers.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to one embodiment, a width of the second access passage is less than a width of the first access passage.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to embodiment, there is a longitudinal overlap between at least an overlapping portion of the foot area of the aisle-side seat unit of the rear group and at least a portion of the backrest of the aisle-side seat unit of the front group.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to one embodiment, there is a longitudinal overlap between at least a portion of the foot area of the window-side seat unit of the rear group and at least a portion of the backrest of the window-side seat unit of the front group.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to one embodiment, the overlapping portion of the foot area with at least a portion of the seat back of the window-side seat unit of the front group is located between the two seat units of the front group.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one embodiment, the axes of the seats of the same group of seat units are parallel to each other.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to one embodiment, the axes of the seats of the same group of seat units form a non-zero angle with respect to each other.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to one embodiment, the seats of the same group of seat units are arranged side by side with respect to each other.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to one embodiment, the seats of the same group of seat units are longitudinally offset relative to each other.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to one embodiment, a partition separates the seats of the same group of seat units.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to one embodiment, the partition extends from a shell at the rear of the seats to a front edge of a seating surface of a seat.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to one embodiment, an aisle-side seat. unit comprises a retractable door so as to be able selectively open or close the first access passage.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to embodiment, a foot area is integrated into a console provided with an upper wall that can serve as a table and/or into a console provided with a storage cabinet.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to one embodiment, a seat unit comprises a display panel.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to one embodiment, a seat unit comprises at least one armrest.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to one embodiment, a seat unit comprises a mobile meal flap between a deployed position and a stored position.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to one embodiment, a transverse wall separates the front group of seat units and the rear group of seat units, said transverse wall extending from a wall of the aircraft cabin to the aisle.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to one embodiment, the first access passage has a width of between 27.94 cm (11 inches) and 76.20 cm (30 inches).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to one embodiment, the second access passage has a width of between 10.16 cm (4 inches) and 27.94 cm (11 inches), the value of 27.94 cm (11 inches) being excluded.</p><?summary-of-invention
