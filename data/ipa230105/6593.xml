A well-known mode of control involves, for example, controlling driving of a rotary electric machine by performing switching control on a single inverter connected to first ends of three-phase Y windings whose second ends are connected to each other. When a direct-current voltage is equal, a system including open windings and two inverters is able to make a line voltage of a winding alternating-current voltage higher and allow a rotary electric machine to operate with a higher output than a system including Y windings and a single inverter.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The introduction of the paper written by V. Oleschuk et al. states that causing carrier signals, which generate pulses for switching control of two inverters, to be different in phase enables a reduction in the magnitude of ripples of currents flowing through windings. V. Oleschuk et al. further mention that generating pulses by a synchronous system instead of a non-synchronous system that uses carrier signals enables more suitable control also for a middle/high output application. The non-synchronous system and the synchronous system both involve performing switching control on two inverters by the same control method at all times.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">RELATED ART DOCUMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Non-Patent Documents</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0005">Non-Patent Document 1: V.

The technique discovered by V. Oleschuk et al. is excellent but still has room for improvement in suitably controlling two inverters each connected to associated ends of open windings.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the above circumstances, what is desired is to provide a technique for suitably controlling two inverters each connected to associated ends of open windings.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Means for Solving the Problem</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the above, one aspect of the present disclosure provides a rotary electric machine control apparatus to control, through a first inverter and a second inverter, driving of a rotary electric machine including multiphase open windings independent of each other. The first inverter is connected to first ends of the multiphase open windings so as to perform conversion of electric power between a direct current and a multiphase alternating current. The second inverter is connected to second ends of the multiphase open windings so as to perform conversion of electric power between a direct current and a multiphase alternating current. The rotary electric machine control apparatus is able to control the first inverter and the second inverter by different control methods that produce different switching patterns and are independent of each other. The control methods include: pulse width modulation control involving outputting a plurality of pulses different in pattern in each electrical angle cycle; and rectangular wave control involving outputting a single pulse in each electrical angle cycle. The rotary electric machine control apparatus performs target control involving: controlling a first one of the inverters, which is selected from the first inverter and the second inverter, by the rectangular wave control; and controlling a second one of the inverters by special pulse width modulation control that is one type of the pulse width modulation control. The special pulse width modulation control is the control method to produce a switching pattern that is based on a difference between a switching pattern resulting from the pulse width modulation control and a switching pattern resulting from the rectangular wave control when a target voltage is to be generated in the open windings.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this aspect, rectangular wave control is performed on the first one of the inverters, which is selected from the two inverters. This enables a reduction in the number of times switching is performed by the first one of the inverters, leading to a reduction in switching loss. The second one of the inverters, on which no rectangular wave control is to be performed, is controlled by special pulse width modulation control. Special pulse width modulation control involves controlling the second one of the inverters in accordance with a switching pattern that is based on a difference between a switching pattern resulting from pulse width modulation control and a switching pattern resulting from rectangular wave control when a target voltage is to be generated in the open windings. Accordingly, if the first one of the inverters is controlled by rectangular wave control, the rotary electric machine would be driven smoothly by performing pulse width modulation control on the second one of the inverters concurrently. This typically enables a reduction in system loss and smooth control of the rotary electric machine in a relatively high rotation operating region for which rectangular wave control is to be used. Consequently, the rotary electric machine control apparatus according to this aspect is able to suitably control the two inverters each connected to the associated ends of the open windings.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further features and advantages of the rotary electric machine control apparatus will be apparent from the description of embodiments given below with reference to the drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

electric machine control apparatus to control, through two inverters, driving of a rotary electric machine including multiphase open windings independent of each other will be described below with reference to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram of a rotary electric machine driving system including a rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b> (MG-CTRL). A rotary electric machine <b>80</b> serves as, for example, a wheel driving force source for a vehicle, such as an electric vehicle or a hybrid vehicle. The rotary electric machine <b>80</b> is an open winding type rotary electric machine including multiphase (or three-phase in the present embodiment) stator coils <b>8</b> (open windings) independent of each other. Inverters <b>10</b> are each connected to associated ends of the stator coils <b>8</b>. The inverters <b>10</b> are controlled independently of each other so as to perform conversion of electric power between a direct current and a multiphase (or three-phase in this embodiment) alternating current. A first inverter <b>11</b> (INV<b>1</b>) is connected to first ends of the stator coils <b>8</b>. A second inverter <b>12</b> (INV<b>2</b>) is connected to second ends of the stator coils <b>8</b>. In the following description, the first inverter <b>11</b> and the second inverter <b>12</b> will each be simply referred to as an &#x201c;inverter <b>10</b>&#x201d; when no distinction is necessary between the first inverter <b>11</b> and the second inverter <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The inverters <b>10</b> each include a plurality of switching elements <b>3</b>. Insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) and/or power metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (power MOSFETs) are used as the switching elements <b>3</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a mode in which Si-IGBTs are used as first switching elements <b>31</b> of the first inverter <b>11</b> and SiC-MOSFETs are used as second switching elements <b>32</b> of the second inverter <b>12</b>. The first switching elements <b>31</b> may be Si-MOSFETs instead of Si-IGBTs. The second switching elements <b>32</b> may be, for example, SiC-static induction transistors (SiC-SITs) or gallium nitride-MOSFETs (GaN-MOSFETs) instead of SiC-MOSFETs. In the present embodiment, the second switching elements <b>32</b> included in the second inverter <b>12</b> are preferably relatively smaller in switching loss than the first switching elements <b>31</b> included in the first inverter <b>11</b> during transition between an OFF state and an ON state.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">SiC semiconductor and GaN semiconductor are usually more expensive than Si semiconductor. The present embodiment illustrates a mode in which SiC semiconductor is used for the switching elements <b>3</b> that are included in one of the two inverters <b>10</b>. When mass production, for example, has reduced the price of SiC semiconductor or GaN semiconductor, both of the inverters <b>10</b> may be provided using SiC semiconductor (e.g., SiC-MOSFETs) as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b></figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref>, both of the inverters <b>10</b> may be provided using Si semiconductor (e.g., Si-IGBTs) in accordance with required specifications, such as the magnitude of allowable switching loss.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The two inverters <b>10</b> each include arms <b>3</b>A each associated with one of alternating-current phases. The arms <b>3</b>A each include a series circuit of an upper side switching element <b>3</b>H and a lower side switching element <b>3</b>L. Each switching element <b>3</b> includes a freewheel diode <b>35</b> connected in parallel, assuming that a direction from a negative terminal FG to a positive terminal P (i.e., a direction from the lower side to the upper side) is a forward direction. In the present embodiment, the two inverters <b>10</b> are each connected to an associated one of direct-current power supplies <b>6</b> independent of each other. A first floating ground FG<b>1</b>, which is the negative terminal FG for the first inverter <b>11</b>, and a second floating ground FG<b>2</b>, which is the negative terminal FG for the second inverter <b>12</b>, are independent of each other. A direct-current link capacitor <b>4</b> (smoothing capacitor) to smooth a direct-current voltage is provided between each inverter <b>10</b> and the associated direct-current power supply <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Specifically, the first inverter <b>11</b>, the arms <b>3</b>A of which are each associated with one of the alternating-current phases and each include a series circuit of a first upper side switching element <b>31</b>H and a first lower side switching element <b>31</b>L, is connected at its direct-current side to a first direct-current link capacitor <b>41</b> (first smoothing capacitor), connected at its direct-current side to a first direct-current power supply <b>61</b>, and connected at its alternating-current side to the first ends of the multiphase stator coils <b>8</b> so as to perform conversion of electric power between a direct current and a multiphase alternating current. The second inverter <b>12</b>, the arms <b>3</b>A of which are each associated with one of the alternating-current phases and each include a series circuit of a second upper side switching element <b>32</b>H and a second lower side switching element <b>32</b>L, is connected at its direct-current side to a second direct-current link capacitor <b>42</b> (second smoothing capacitor), connected at its direct-current side to a second direct-current power supply <b>62</b>, and connected at its alternating-current side to the second ends of the multiphase stator coils <b>8</b> so as to perform conversion of electric power between a direct current and a multiphase alternating current.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the present embodiment, the first direct-current power supply <b>61</b> and the second direct-current power supply <b>62</b> are equal in ratings, such as a voltage rating. A rated voltage &#x201c;E<b>1</b>&#x201d; of the first direct-current power supply <b>61</b> and a rated voltage &#x201c;E<b>2</b>&#x201d; of the second direct-current power supply <b>62</b> are equal to each other and will each be simply referred to as a rated voltage &#x201c;E&#x201d; when no distinction is made therebetween. Accordingly, a direct-current side voltage (direct-current link voltage) &#x201c;Vdc<b>1</b>&#x201d; of the first inverter <b>11</b> and a direct-current side voltage (direct-current link voltage) &#x201c;Vdc<b>2</b>&#x201d; of the second inverter <b>12</b> are equal to each other. The first direct-current link capacitor <b>41</b> and the second direct-current link capacitor are equal in ratings, such as a capacity rating. The rated voltage of each direct-current power supply <b>6</b> is between about 48 volts and about 400 volts. Each direct-current power supply <b>6</b> includes, for example, a secondary battery (battery), such as a nickel metal hydride battery or a lithium ion battery, and/or an electric double layer capacitor. The rotary electric machine <b>80</b> is able to function not only as an electric motor but also as a generator. The rotary electric machine <b>80</b> converts electric power, which has been supplied thereto from the direct-current power supplies <b>6</b> through the inverters <b>10</b>, into motive power so as to carry out power running. Alternatively, the rotary electric machine <b>80</b> converts rotative driving force, which has been transmitted thereto from, for example, wheel(s), into electric power and charges the direct-current power supplies <b>6</b> with the electric power through the inverters <b>10</b> so as to carry out regeneration.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the inverters <b>10</b> are controlled by the rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b>. The rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b> is able to control the first inverter <b>11</b> and the second inverter <b>12</b> by control methods independent of each other. The control methods will be described below in detail. The rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b> is created using as its core component a logic circuit, such as a microcomputer. In one example, the rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b> controls the rotary electric machine <b>80</b> through the inverters <b>10</b> by performing current feedback control using a vector control method in accordance with a target torque (or a torque command) for the rotary electric machine <b>80</b>, which is provided from, for example, a different control apparatus, such as a vehicle control apparatus (not illustrated).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Actual currents flowing through the stator coils <b>8</b> of the respective phases of the rotary electric machine <b>80</b> are detected by a current sensor <b>15</b>. The magnetic pole position of a rotor of the rotary electric machine <b>80</b> at each point in time is detected by a rotation sensor <b>13</b>, such as a resolver. The rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b> performs current feedback control using detection results obtained by the current sensor <b>15</b> and the rotation sensor <b>13</b>. The rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b> includes various functional parts for current feedback control. The functional parts are implemented by cooperation between hardware, such as a microcomputer, and software (program).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates some of the functional parts of the rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b> in a simple manner. The vector control method involves exercising feedback control by performing coordinate transformation by which actual currents (i.e., a U phase current Iu, a V phase current Iv, and a W phase current Iw) flowing through the rotary electric machine <b>80</b> are converted into a vector component along a d axis (i.e., a d-axis current Id) and a vector component along a q axis (i.e., a q-axis current Iq). The d axis extends in the direction of a magnetic field (or magnetic flux) generated by permanent magnet(s) disposed in the rotor of the rotary electric machine <b>80</b>. The q axis extends in a direction perpendicular to the d axis (or a direction advanced by an electrical angle of &#x3c0;/2 with respect to the orientation of the magnetic field). A three-phase/two-phase coordinate transformer <b>55</b> of the rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b> performs coordinate transformation in accordance with detection results (which include a magnetic pole position and an electrical angle represented by &#x3b8;) obtained by the rotation sensor <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">A current feedback controller <b>5</b> (FB) exercises feedback control for the rotary electric machine <b>80</b> in accordance with differences between current commands (i.e., a d-axis current command Id* and a q-axis current command Iq*), which are based on a torque command for the rotary electric machine <b>80</b>, and actual currents (i.e., the d-axis current Id and the q-axis current Iq) in a dq-axis orthogonal vector coordinate system, thus calculating voltage commands (i.e., a d-axis voltage command Vd* and a q-axis voltage command Vq*). The rotary electric machine <b>80</b> is driven through the two inverters <b>10</b>, i.e., the first inverter <b>11</b> and the second inverter <b>12</b>. A divider <b>53</b> (DIV) thus divides the d-axis voltage command Vd* and the q-axis voltage command Vq* into: a first d-axis voltage command Vd<b>1</b>* and a first q-axis voltage command Vq<b>1</b>* for the first inverter <b>11</b>; and a second d-axis voltage command Vd<b>2</b>* and a second q-axis voltage command Vq<b>2</b>* for the second inverter <b>12</b>. In the present embodiment, the direct-current link voltage &#x201c;Vdc<b>1</b>&#x201d; of the first inverter <b>11</b> and the direct-current link voltage &#x201c;Vdc<b>2</b>&#x201d; of the second inverter <b>12</b> are equal to each other as previously mentioned (which means that Vc<b>1</b>=Vdc<b>2</b>). Accordingly, the voltage commands divided have the following relationships: &#x201c;Vd<b>1</b>*=Vd<b>2</b>*&#x201d;, &#x201c;Vq<b>1</b>*=Vq<b>2</b>*&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">As previously described, the rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b> is able to control the first inverter <b>11</b> and the second inverter <b>12</b> by control methods independent of each other. The rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b> includes two voltage controllers <b>7</b> each including a three-phase voltage command calculator <b>73</b> and a modulator <b>74</b> (MOD). More specifically, the rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b> includes: a first voltage controller <b>71</b> to generate switching control signals (Su<b>1</b>, Sv<b>1</b>, Sw<b>1</b>) for the U, V, and W phases of the first inverter <b>11</b>; and a second voltage controller <b>72</b> to generate switching control signals (Su<b>2</b>, Sv<b>2</b>, Sw<b>2</b>) for the U, V, and W phases of the second inverter <b>12</b>. Although described in detail below with reference to, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, voltage commands (Vu<b>1</b>**, Vv<b>1</b>**, Vw<b>1</b>**) for the first inverter <b>11</b> are different in phase from voltage commands (Vu<b>2</b>**, Vv<b>2</b>**, Vw<b>2</b>**) for the second inverter <b>12</b> by &#x201c;n&#x201d;. The second voltage controller <b>72</b> thus receives values calculated by subtracting &#x201c;n&#x201d; from the detection results (<b>0</b>) obtained by the rotation sensor <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the second voltage controller <b>72</b> includes the three-phase voltage command calculator <b>73</b> and the modulator <b>74</b> connected thereto similarly to the first voltage controller <b>71</b>, and further includes another three-phase voltage command calculator <b>73</b> (which is a special modulation three-phase voltage command calculator <b>73</b>B), another modulator (which is a special modulation modulator <b>75</b>), and a selector <b>76</b>. The selector <b>76</b> of the second voltage controller <b>72</b> selects normal modulation switching control signals generated by the modulator <b>74</b> and special modulation switching control signals generated by the special modulation modulator <b>75</b>. The second voltage controller <b>72</b> thus outputs the switching control signals (Su<b>2</b>, Sv<b>2</b>, Sw<b>2</b>) for the second inverter <b>12</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;special modulation&#x201d; refers to special pulse width modulation (which will be described below). Special modulation will be described in detail below with reference to, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> to <b>19</b></figref>. Control blocks are not limited to this configuration. In one example, a selector may select normal modulation three-phase voltage commands and special modulation three-phase voltage commands generated by the special modulation modulator <b>75</b>, and the switching control signals (Su<b>2</b>, Sv<b>2</b>, Sw<b>2</b>) for the second inverter <b>12</b> may be generated by a shared modulator in accordance with the voltage commands selected.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As will be described below, modulation methods include: synchronous modulation synchronous with rotation of the rotary electric machine <b>80</b>; and non-synchronous modulation independent of rotation of the rotary electric machine <b>80</b>. A block (which is a procedure in the case of software) for generating switching control signals by synchronous modulation usually differs from a block for generating switching control signals by non-synchronous modulation. The voltage controllers <b>7</b> described above generate switching control signals in accordance with: voltage commands; and carriers non-synchronous with rotation of the rotary electric machine <b>80</b>. For the sake of simplification of description, the present embodiment is described based on the assumption that switching control signals resulting from synchronous modulation (e.g., switching control signals in the case of rectangular wave control, which will be described below) are also generated by the voltage controllers <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As previously described, the arms <b>3</b>A of the inverters <b>10</b> each include a series circuit of the upper side switching element <b>3</b>H and the lower side switching element <b>3</b>L. The switching control signals for the respective phases are output in the form of two types of switching control signals, which are upper side switching control signals and lower side switching control signals, although no distinction is made therebetween in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In one example, a first U phase switching control signal Su<b>1</b> for switching control of the U phase of the first inverter <b>11</b> is output in the form of two signals, which are a first U phase upper side switching control signal Su<b>1</b>+ with &#x201c;+&#x201d; at its end and a first U phase lower side switching control signal Su<b>1</b>&#x2212; with &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; at its end. If the upper side switching element <b>3</b>H and the lower side switching element <b>3</b>L included in each arm <b>3</b>A have simultaneously entered an ON state, the arm <b>3</b>A is short-circuited. An approach to preventing such a short circuit involves setting a &#x201c;dead time&#x201d; during which the upper side switching control signal and the lower side switching control signal for each arm <b>3</b>A are both in an ineffective state. Such a dead time is also set in the voltage controllers <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, control terminals (which are gate terminals when the switching elements <b>3</b> are IGBTs or FETs) of the switching elements <b>3</b> included in the inverters <b>10</b> are connected to the rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b> through drive circuits <b>2</b> (DRV) and are thus subjected to switching control on an individual basis. High-voltage circuits (i.e., systems connected to the direct-current power supplies <b>6</b>), such as the inverters <b>10</b>, for driving the rotary electric machine <b>80</b> greatly differ in operating voltage (or circuit power supply voltage) from low-voltage circuits (i.e., systems operating at a voltage of between about 3.3 volts and about 5 volts), such as the rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b> whose core is, for example, a microcomputer. The drive circuits <b>2</b> enhance the driving ability (e.g., the ability to cause a subsequent circuit to operate, such as voltage amplitude or output current) of driving signals (or switching control signals) for the switching elements <b>3</b>, and relay the resulting signals. A first drive circuit <b>21</b> relays the switching control signals to the first inverter <b>11</b>. A second drive circuit <b>22</b> relays the switching control signals to the second inverter <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b> is able to carry out two switching pattern modes (or voltage waveform control modes) for the switching elements <b>3</b> included in the first inverter <b>11</b> and the second inverter <b>12</b>. Examples of the modes include: pulse width modulation (PWM) control to output a plurality of pulses different in pattern in each electrical angle cycle; and rectangular wave control (1-Pulse control) to output a single pulse in each electrical angle cycle. Control methods for the first inverter <b>11</b> and the second inverter <b>12</b> performable by the rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b> thus include pulse width modulation control and rectangular wave control. As previously mentioned, the rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b> is able to control the first inverter <b>11</b> and the second inverter <b>12</b> by control methods independent of each other.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Pulse width modulation methods include: continuous pulse width modulation (CPWM or continuous PWM), such as sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM or sinusoidal PWM) and space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM or space vector PWM); and discontinuous pulse width modulation (DPWM or discontinuous PWM). Accordingly, control methods for pulse width modulation control performable by the rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b> include continuous pulse width modulation control and discontinuous pulse width modulation.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Continuous pulse width modulation is a modulation method to continuously perform pulse width modulation on all of the multiphase arms <b>3</b>A. Discontinuous pulse width modulation is a modulation method to perform pulse width modulation on at least one of the multiphase arms <b>3</b>A such that a period during which the switching elements are kept in an ON state or an OFF state is included. Specifically, discontinuous pulse width modulation involves, for example, sequentially fixing the signal levels of inverter switching control signals associated with a single phase included in three-phase alternating-current electric power, and changing the signal levels of switching control signals associated with the other two phases. Continuous pulse width modulation involves modulating all the phases without fixing switching control signals associated with any of the phases as just mentioned. Which of the modulation methods is to be used is decided in accordance with operating conditions, such as a rotation speed and a torque required for the rotary electric machine <b>80</b>, and a modulation factor (which indicates the ratio of an effective value of a line voltage of a three-phase alternating current to a direct-current voltage) required to satisfy the operating conditions.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Pulse width modulation involves generating pulses in accordance with the magnitude relationship between the amplitude of an alternating-current waveform in the form of a voltage command and the amplitude of a carrier (CA) waveform in the form of a triangular wave, which includes a sawtooth wave (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). A PWM waveform may be directly generated by digital calculation irrespective of comparison with a carrier. Even in such a case, the amplitude of an alternating-current waveform in the form of a command value and the amplitude of a virtual carrier waveform are correlated with each other.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Pulse width modulation based on digital calculation involves determining a carrier in accordance with, for example, a control cycle of the rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b>, such as a calculation cycle of a microcomputer or an operating cycle of an electronic circuit. If multiphase alternating-current electric power is used to drive the alternating-current rotary electric machine <b>80</b>, the carrier has a cycle (or asynchronous cycle) not restricted by a rotation speed or rotation angle (electrical angle) of the rotary electric machine <b>80</b>. Thus, not only the carrier but also each pulse generated in accordance with the carrier is out of synchronization with rotation of the rotary electric machine <b>80</b>. Accordingly, modulation methods, such as sinusoidal pulse width modulation and space vector pulse width modulation, may sometimes be referred to as &#x201c;asynchronous modulation&#x201d;. In contrast, modulation methods to generate pulses in synchronization with rotation of the rotary electric machine <b>80</b> are referred to as &#x201c;synchronous modulation&#x201d;. Rectangular wave control (or rectangular wave modulation), for example, involves outputting a single pulse for each electrical angle cycle of the rotary electric machine <b>80</b> and is thus synchronous modulation.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Indices indicating the ratio of conversion from a direct-current voltage to an alternating-current voltage include a modulation factor indicative of the ratio of an effective value of a line voltage of a multiphase alternating-current voltage to a direct-current voltage. Typically, a maximum modulation factor for sinusoidal pulse width modulation is about 0.61 (&#x2248;0.612), and a maximum modulation factor for space vector pulse width modulation control is about 0.71 (&#x2248;0.707). A modulation method that uses a modulation factor exceeding about 0.71 is referred to as &#x201c;overmodulation pulse width modulation&#x201d; because such a modulation method uses a higher-than-normal modulation factor. A maximum modulation factor for &#x201c;overmodulation pulse width modulation&#x201d; is about 0.78. The modulation factor of 0.78 is a physical (or mathematical) threshold value for conversion of electric power from a direct current to an alternating current. When a modulation factor has reached 0.78 during overmodulation pulse width modulation, a transition is made to rectangular wave modulation (1-pulse modulation) that involves outputting a single pulse in each electrical angle cycle. A modulation factor for rectangular wave modulation will be fixed at about 0.78, which is a physical threshold value.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Overmodulation pulse width modulation whose modulation factor is less than 0.78 is performable using the principle of any one of a synchronous modulation method and an asynchronous modulation method. A typical modulation method for overmodulation pulse width modulation is discontinuous pulse width modulation. Discontinuous pulse width modulation is performable using the principle of any one of a synchronous modulation method and an asynchronous modulation method. In the case of using a synchronous modulation method, for example, rectangular wave modulation involves outputting a single pulse in each electrical angle cycle, but discontinuous pulse width modulation involves outputting a plurality of pulses in each electrical angle cycle. Presence of a plurality of pulses in each electrical angle cycle reduces a pulse effective period accordingly, resulting in a decrease in modulation factor. Accordingly, a modulation factor does not necessarily have to be fixed at about 0.78, and any modulation factor that is less than 0.78 may be used to perform a synchronous modulation method. In one example, multi-pulse modulation, such as 9-pulse modulation involving outputting nine pulses in each electrical angle cycle or 5-pulse modulation involving outputting five pulses in each electrical angle cycle, may be performed.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The rotary electric machine control apparatus <b>1</b> is able to perform fail-safe control, such as shutdown control (SDN) or active short circuit control (ASC), in the event of detecting abnormal condition(s) in the inverter(s) <b>10</b> or the rotary electric machine <b>80</b>.

The rotary electric machine control apparatus (<b>1</b>) is able to control the first inverter (<b>11</b>) and the second inverter (<b>12</b>) by different control methods that produce different switching patterns and are independent of each other. The control methods include: pulse width modulation control involving outputting a plurality of pulses different in pattern in each electrical angle cycle; and rectangular wave control involving outputting a single pulse in each electrical angle cycle.

The special pulse width modulation control is the control method to produce a switching pattern that is based on a difference between a switching pattern resulting from the pulse width modulation control and a switching pattern resulting from the rectangular wave control when a target voltage is to be generated in the open windings (<b>8</b>).</p><p id="p-0176" num="0170">In this aspect, rectangular wave control is performed on the first one of the inverters (<b>10</b>), which is selected from the two inverters (<b>10</b>).

The second one of the inverters (<b>10</b>), on which no rectangular wave control is to be performed, is controlled by special pulse width modulation control. Special pulse width modulation control involves controlling the second one of the inverters (<b>10</b>) in accordance with a switching pattern that is based on a difference between a switching pattern resulting from pulse width modulation control and a switching pattern resulting from rectangular wave control when a target voltage is to be generated in the open windings (<b>8</b>). Accordingly, if the first one of the inverters (<b>10</b>) is controlled by rectangular wave control, the rotary electric machine (<b>80</b>) would be driven smoothly by performing pulse width modulation control on the second one of the inverters concurrently. This typically enables a reduction in system loss and smooth control of the rotary electric machine (<b>80</b>) in a relatively high rotation operating region for which rectangular wave control is to be used.

A voltage command to produce a switching pattern for such special pulse width modulation control is a difference between a system voltage command, which is an overall voltage command when rectangular wave control is combined with pulse width modulation control, and a rectangular wave voltage command for rectangular wave control.
