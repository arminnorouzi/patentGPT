Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a rotary encoder, in particular to a rotary scale and an encoder apparatus comprising a rotary scale and a readhead for reading the rotary scale.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Metrological scales are used in the position measurement of a parts of a machine which can move relative to each other. Metrological scale typically has a series of features on it which can be read by a readhead so that the readhead can provide a measure of its position along, or around, the scale. The metrological scale can be mounted onto one part of a machine and is read by a suitable readhead which is attached to another part of the machine. Types of metrological scale include magnetic scales (in which the scale features are provided by features having particular magnetic properties), capacitive scales (in which the features are provided by features having particular capacitive properties), inductive scales (in which the features are provided by features having particular inductive properties) and optical scales (in which the features are provided by features having particular optical properties). Optical scales can be transmissive or reflective. An example of an optical scale configuration is disclosed in EP-A-0 207 121 and also U.S. Pat. No. 4,974,962.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For measuring rotary displacement, such a scale may be provided on a member which rotates in use with the shaft or other rotary part relative to the readhead. In particular, the member which has the scale features and which rotates in use with the shaft can be a disc. In particular, glass or metal discs are commonly used in high performance encoders, and typically the scale features are formed directly in/on the glass or metal material. The inventors are concerned with providing improvements in such glass or metal disc scale, in particular with providing a low-profile, high performance (e.g. high resolution/low error) disc scale.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, the present invention relates to an improved rotary encoder, in particular to an improved disc encoder.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a rotary scale apparatus for an encoder apparatus comprising at least one track of scale features for reading by a readhead to determine the relative position thereof, the rotary scale apparatus comprising a planar disc comprising a through hole for receiving a cylindrical shaft, and in which the rotary scale member comprises at least three cantilevered spring members which are provided substantially in plane with the planar disc and spaced around the edge of the hole, for engaging with, and radially locating (e.g. centring) the planar disc on, a cylindrical shaft inserted therethrough.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such a configuration has been found to provide a particularly effective and compact self-locating rotary encoder apparatus. For instance, it has been found to be difficult to provide an effective (e.g. highly repeatable) in-plane self-locating solution for disc scales, especially for metal or glass discs. The use of cantilevered spring members has been found to be particularly advantageous over other configurations which use non-cantilevered spring arrangements. With the improved self-locating performance of the rotary encoder apparatus provided by the configuration of the present invention (e.g. the better it is at predictably, e.g. repeatably, locating itself relative to a shaft, for instance so as to self-centre the disc/scale markings with respect to the shaft) it is possible to provide an improved set up of the encoder apparatus and thereby improve the metrological performance of the encoder.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Whilst there have already been attempts to make such so-called &#x201c;self-locating&#x201d; (e.g. &#x201c;self-centring&#x201d;) rotary encoders (e.g. such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,255,644 and 6,293,021), our inventors have found existing solutions to be unsatisfactory, in particular for thin/planar/compact rotary encoders, and where there are high demands on the predictability of the self-locating performance of the scale member.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Compared to a flexure supported at both ends (e.g. a flexure provided by a slot in the material), the spring force provided by a cantilevered spring member is less affected by its width. Accordingly, due to manufacturing tolerances which can cause the width of springs/flexures to vary, it has been found that the use of cantilevered spring members (instead of flexures supported at both ends) can provide a more predictable self-locating ability for a disc scale with in-plane spring members. Indeed, such a difference can be significant with today's ever-increasing demand for higher accuracy position encoders. For example, the inventors are facing demands that a scale can self-centre on a shaft with less than 10 &#x3bc;m (microns) eccentricity and in some instances less than 5 &#x3bc;m (microns) eccentricity, and the claimed configuration has been instrumental in helping the inventors meet such demands.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Such a configuration can also help to ensure that the self-locating performance of an encoder disc is highly repeatable. This can be important because the scale features for a glass or metal scale disc are commonly formed by mounting the glass or metal disc on the shaft of manufacturing apparatus, and then forming the marks with the disc on the shaft, wherein the glass or metal disc is rotated by the shaft so that scale features can be formed around the disc's surface. It is important that when the disc is removed from the manufacturer-site shaft and subsequently mounted on a customer-site shaft, it sits relative to the customer's shaft in the same relative radial location as it did on the manufacturer-site shaft. In view of that the customer and manufacturer-site shafts are not likely to be exactly the same diameter, it is desirable to ensure that the flexures which radially locate the disc on the shaft behave repeatably, even in the event of non-identically sized shafts. It has been found that even small differences in the diameter of the customer and manufacturer-site shaft can have a significant adverse effect on where the disc sits on customer-site shaft compared to the manufacturer-site shaft, which can in turn impact the performance of the encoder.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As will be understood, the cantilevered spring members will be elastically deformable, in particular in the radial dimension (with respect to the disc scale).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, preferably, when in use (i.e. when mounted on a shaft), the cantilevered spring members can each be radially displaced within their elastic limit, and they each, in return, provide a force which together work to radially locate the disc on the shaft.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, each spring member provides a substantially identical spring force for a given radial deflection. The cantilevered spring members can be nominally/substantially identical in shape and size. This can simplify the design and manufacture of the cantilevered spring members so as to provide nominally/substantially equal, balanced, self-locating forces. Also, this can be particularly preferable when the repeatability of the radial self-location of the disc across shafts of different sizes is important.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As will be understood, each cantilevered spring member can be configured such that its length extends in a generally circumferential direction around the edge of the hole. Preferably, at least one cantilevered spring member extends in an opposite direction to another cantilevered spring member. For example, preferably at least one cantilevered spring member extends in a generally clockwise direction around the edge of the hole, and at least one other cantilevered spring member extends in a generally anti-clockwise direction around the edge of the hole. It has been found that such a configuration can help to avoid adverse forces between the disc and shaft when mounted, which can affect the stability of the disc. For example, if the length of a cantilevered spring member changes with temperature, then when mounted on a shaft, each cantilevered spring member could exert a turning force on the shaft/disc. The effect of such turning forces can be reduced/negated by arranging at least one cantilevered spring member which extends in opposite direction to the other(s). This can be especially desirable for those applications where the utmost accuracy and stability is demanded.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The rotary scale member can comprise at least three pairs of cantilevered spring members provided in plane with the planar disc and spaced around the edge of the hole. The planar disc could have a combination of pairs of cantilevered springs and single springs. However, it can be advantageous for all cantilevered spring members to be provided in pairs, to help ensure that the self-locating spring forces are balanced.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In line with the preceding two paragraphs, the rotary scale member can comprise at least three pairs of cantilevered spring members, wherein the cantilevered spring members in a pair extend in opposite directions relative to each other. In other words, the rotary scale member can comprise at least three pairs of cantilevered spring members, wherein each spring member in a pair can be configured such that their free ends are proximal each other and their fixed (or &#x201c;root&#x201d;) ends are distal each other. In such a case, within each pair of cantilevered spring members, any change in the length of each cantilevered spring member (e.g. due to temperature changes) will have an opposing effect on the turning/twisting of the disc relative to the shaft. In the preferred embodiments where each cantilevered spring members are substantially identical in configuration, the turning force exerted due to the change in length of each cantilevered spring members should be substantially equal and opposite, and therefore the net turning force exerted by a pair of cantilevered spring members can be substantially zero.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Preferably, the cantilevered springs (or the pairs of cantilevered springs) are arranged equiangularly around the hole. In a particularly preferred embodiment, there are provided three pairs of cantilevered springs, in which the pairs of cantilevered springs are arranged equiangularly around the hole.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In can be preferred that the width of a cantilevered spring member, measured between the sides facing toward and away from the centre of the hole, progressively narrows towards its free end. Preferably, at least the side of a cantilevered spring member facing toward the centre of the hole is substantially straight. The inventors found that, to ensure equal stress distribution along the length of a cantilevered spring member, the theoretically ideal shape for a cantilevered spring member is a parabolic shape. However, the inventors also found that found that there are disadvantages with providing parabolic shaped cantilevered spring members, such as, for example, that the rate of change of force applied by the flexure can vary with deflection as the point of the contact between the shaft and flexure moves. Having a straight-edged spring member which faces/engages the shaft in use reduces this effect, thereby providing a more stable, and practically better solution than the theoretically ideal parabolic shape.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Suitable disc materials for the planar disc include metal or glass. In a preferred embodiment, the planar disc comprises a steel, in particular stainless steel disc, but as will be understood, other metals such as aluminium or titanium can also be used.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The cantilevered spring members and planar disc can be formed (in particular cut) from a single sheet of material. The use of sheet material, and forming (e.g. cutting) the features from the sheet material can help to ensure that the root of the cantilevered spring member is in plane with the disc, and also helps to ensure that the forces exerted on the disc are kept in plane, thereby reducing/avoiding moments on the disc which could warp the disc. Such a configuration also helps to facilitate a very compact rotary encoder.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably the track of scale features comprises a complete annular track of scale features (e.g. as opposed to just comprising a partial arc). Preferably the at least one track of scale features is provided on the planar face of the planar disc. The scale features in a track could be incremental features or absolute features. The disc scale could comprise more than one track.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The disc scale could comprise at least one additional hole located between the hole for the shaft and the outer edge of the planar disc. Such an additional hole could be provided to help facilitate securing of the disc scale to a shaft, e.g. to help facilitate securing the disc scale to a body on which the shaft is provided. For example, a bolt could be passed through the hole to secure the disc to the body, and/or the adhesive could be located in the hole to secure the disc to the body.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Preferably, the thickness of the planar disc is not more than 5 mm, for example not more than 2.5 mm, for instance not more than 1.5 mm. As will be understood, in order for the disc to be self-supporting (i.e. not collapse under its own weight), and/or to ensure effective spring members, the disc will have to have sufficient thickness. Such an appropriate minimum thickness will depend on various factors including the diameter of the planar disc and the material of the planar disc. Typically, the inventors have found that it is preferably to have a disc which is not less than 0.5 mm, for instance not less than 0.6 mm, in particular not less than 0.7 mm. Preferably, the planar disc has substantially uniform thickness.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to another aspect of the invention there is provided an apparatus comprising a first and second relatively rotatable parts, in which a rotary scale apparatus as described above is mounted on one of the first and second relatively rotatable parts, for rotation therewith, and at least one readhead mounted on the other of the first and second relatively rotatable parts for reading the rotary scale apparatus' scale features.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the following drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an isometric view of disc scale member according to the present invention mounted on a shaft, with a readhead arranged to read the scale;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a plan view of the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side view of the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a plan view of the disc scale member of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shown in isolation;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a detailed view of the spring members of the disc scale member of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a plan view of a disc scale member according to another embodiment of the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, there is shown an encoder apparatus <b>2</b> comprising a disc scale member <b>4</b> according to one example embodiment of the present invention. The disc scale member <b>4</b> is shown in isolation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, the disc scale member <b>4</b> is shown mounted on a cylindrical shaft <b>6</b> of a machine. The disc scale member <b>4</b> is planar in configuration. In particular, the disc scale member <b>4</b> is formed from a thin sheet of material, in this embodiment, from stainless steel, which is about 1 mm thick. For context, the diameter of the disc scale member <b>4</b> in this embodiment is about 55 mm. As will be understood, the invention is not limited to discs of such a size, and such dimensions are given merely as an example of a disc. Also, the disc could be made from other metallic materials, such as aluminium.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The disc scale member <b>4</b> has a scale track <b>8</b> on one of its planar faces, extending completely annularly around the disc scale member. The scale track <b>8</b> comprises a series of features which a readhead <b>10</b> (mounted on a component <b>12</b> which is fixed relative to the cylindrical shaft <b>6</b>) can read to determine the relative position/motion of the scale disc <b>4</b> and the readhead <b>10</b>. In the embodiment described, the encoder apparatus is an optical encoder apparatus, but this need not necessarily be the case. For instance, the encoder apparatus could be a magnetic, inductive or capacitive encoder apparatus. Furthermore, in the embodiment described, the encoder apparatus is a reflective optical encoder apparatus (in that the light from the readhead is reflected by the scale back toward the readhead, and in that the readhead's illumination and scale detection components are on the same side of the scale). However, this need not necessarily be the case, and the encoder apparatus could be a transmissive optical encoder.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In this embodiment, the encoder apparatus <b>2</b> is an incremental encoder apparatus. Accordingly, in this embodiment the scale disc <b>4</b> is an incremental scale disc and the scale track <b>8</b> comprises a series of periodically arranged features which the readhead <b>10</b> can read in order to provide a count of the relative position/movement of the scale disc <b>4</b> and the readhead <b>10</b>. As is common in the field of incremental encoder apparatus, the scale disc could comprise one or more reference marks which can be read by the readhead which it passes the readhead, so that the readhead can identify a reference position on the disc scale member. Of course, the encoder apparatus could be an absolute encoder apparatus instead of an incremental encoder apparatus. Accordingly, the scale disc <b>4</b> could be an absolute scale disc, in which the scale track(s) thereon can comprise features defining a series of unique absolute positions such that the absolute position of the scale disc and readhead can be determined on start-up without requiring relative motion of the disc scale member and the readhead.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the scale disc <b>4</b> comprises a hole <b>14</b> through its middle, through which the cylindrical shaft <b>6</b> can extend when the scale disc <b>4</b> is mounted on the cylindrical shaft <b>6</b>. In accordance with the present invention, the disc scale member <b>4</b> comprises a number of cantilevered spring members <b>16</b> which are provided in plane with the planar disc and spaced around the edge of the hole <b>14</b>, for engaging with, and radially locating the scale disc <b>4</b> on, the cylindrical shaft <b>6</b> when it is inserted therethrough.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the disc scale member <b>4</b> comprises three pairs of cantilevered spring members <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c</i>. Each pair of cantilevered spring members <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c </i>is provided in plane with the planar scale disc <b>4</b> and spaced around the edge of the hole <b>14</b>. Also, each pair of cantilevered spring members <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c </i>is configured such that the free ends <b>18</b> of the cantilevered spring members <b>16</b> are proximal each other and their fixed ends <b>20</b> are distal each other (e.g. see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). In other words, the cantilevered spring members <b>16</b> in each pair <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c </i>point toward each other, rather than away from each other.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, each cantilevered spring member <b>16</b> is tapered such that it narrows towards its free end <b>18</b>. Accordingly, the width w<sub>1 </sub>of a cantilevered spring member is greater at its fixed end <b>20</b> than its width w<sub>2 </sub>at its free end <b>18</b>. As will be understood, the exact desired dimensions of the cantilevered spring member will depend on a number of factors including the material, size of the disc, and the desired spring force. Our inventors have found a good desired spring force of each flexure in a pair can be about 20 Newtons, which provides a good balance between providing sufficient self-locating ability and not over gripping the shaft.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the embodiment described, the shaft-engaging side/edge of the cantilevered spring member <b>16</b> is straight. Such a configuration has been found to be particularly advantageous from a manufacturing and performance point of view. In particular, our inventors have identified that whilst for even force distribution reasons the ideal shape of a cantilevered spring member might be parabolic, manufacturing such a shaped flexure can be difficult, and the rate of change of force can vary significantly as the contact point between the cantilevered spring member and shaft changes. Accordingly, our inventors have found that providing a straight edged contact face for the cantilevered spring member is an optimum compromise between good force distribution whilst enabling contact close to the free end of the cantilevered spring member, as well as being simple and therefore cost effective to manufacture. Also, in the embodiment described, the width of the cantilevered spring member <b>16</b> reduces linearly.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the embodiment described, each cantilevered spring member <b>16</b> is formed by creating, in the same piece/sheet of material as the scale disc <b>4</b>, a slot <b>22</b> (which sits behind the cantilevered spring members <b>16</b>) and a gap <b>24</b> (which sits between the free ends <b>18</b> of the cantilevered spring members <b>16</b>). The slot <b>22</b> and gap <b>24</b> enable the cantilevered spring members <b>16</b> to flex along their length, into the slot <b>22</b>. Such a slot <b>22</b> and gap <b>24</b> can be formed, for instance, by etching and/or machining the scale disc <b>4</b>. Optionally, the scale disc <b>4</b>, along with its cantilevered spring members <b>16</b>, is formed by a moulding, casting and/or additive process.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the scale disc <b>4</b> is push-fit onto a shaft <b>6</b> which is slightly larger than the space between the pairs of the cantilevered spring members <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c</i>, the shaft <b>6</b> engages the side of each of the cantilevered spring members <b>16</b> facing the middle of the hole <b>14</b>, and causes each of them to bend slightly into the slot <b>22</b>. The elasticity of the material of the cantilevered spring members <b>16</b> causes a reaction force on the shaft <b>6</b>. Preferably, the reaction force provided by each cantilevered spring member <b>16</b> is nominally the same, such that the scale disc <b>4</b> self-locates on the shaft <b>6</b>. Such nominally identical reaction forces can be achieved by configuring the cantilevered spring members <b>16</b> such that they are nominally identical in shape and size, as they are in the embodiment described.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">If desired, the scale disc <b>4</b> can be further secured to the shaft. For example, in the embodiment described, the scale disc <b>4</b> comprises three holes <b>26</b> through which mechanical fasteners <b>28</b>, such as a bolts <b>28</b>, can be passed in order to secure the scale disc <b>4</b> to the shaft <b>6</b>. Optionally, adhesive could be applied in the hole <b>26</b> region so as to secure the scale disc <b>4</b> to the shaft <b>6</b> (with or without a mechanical fastener <b>28</b>). In the embodiment shown, the hole <b>26</b> for the fastener is connected to the slot <b>22</b>. Doing so means that the manufacturing process is much simpler and efficient because the hole <b>26</b> and slot <b>22</b> can be formed in one continuous process. However, as will be understood, this need not be the case and so the hole <b>26</b> and slot <b>22</b> could be disconnected/separate. Also, in the embodiment shown, an alignment feature (in this case a hole) <b>30</b> is provided. Such an alignment hole <b>30</b> can be used to ensure that the disc <b>4</b> is oriented correctly when it is mounted on the shaft <b>6</b>. For instance, the shaft <b>6</b> could comprise a projecting pin (not shown) such that the disc <b>4</b> can only sit flush against the shaft <b>6</b> when the projecting pin and alignment hole <b>30</b> are aligned.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As will be understood, such holes <b>26</b> for the fasteners are optional and there could be fewer than three such holes (e.g. as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) or optionally the disc scale member could be provided without any such holes for fasteners.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the embodiment described, the scale disc's hole <b>14</b> is irregular in shape. In particular, the side of each cantilevered spring that faces the centre of the hole is straight, whereas the shape of the hole between the pairs of cantilevered springs is curved. Whilst it has been found advantageous to provide cantilevered springs with straight edges for engaging with a shaft, the shape of the hole between the pairs of cantilevered springs is less important and need only be sufficiently shaped and sized such that it does not engage a cylindrical shaft extending therethrough (so as not to impact the self-locating effect of the cantilevered springs).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the described embodiment, three pairs of cantilevered springs <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c </i>are provided. However, whilst this has been found to be the optimal solution, other configurations are possible. For example, four pairs of cantilevered springs could be provided. Optionally, a number of (e.g. three or four) individual cantilevered springs could be provided around the side of the hole, instead of the cantilevered springs being provided in pairs.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown, in the described embodiment, preferably the cantilevered springs (or the pairs of cantilevered springs) are arranged equiangularly around the hole. This does not necessarily have to be the case, but such an arrangement can be simplest when trying to balance the forces provided by the cantilevered springs so as to have a self-locating effect.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
