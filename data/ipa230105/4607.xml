Where, firstly, the recommendation server <b>110</b> obtains content cover images corresponding to a plurality of contents accessed by a user account; then, the recommendation server <b>110</b> obtains the cover image features of the plurality of content cover images, and determines a user account feature of the user account based on the cover image features of the plurality of content cover images; and then, the recommendation server <b>110</b> determines an access probability value of the user account accessing a content to be recommended based on the cover image feature of the content to be recommended and the user account feature; finally, The recommendation server <b>110</b> provides the content to be recommended to the user account based on the access probability value. In practical applications, the recommendation server <b>110</b> may be implemented as an independent server or a server cluster composed of a plurality of servers.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow chart of a method for content recommendation according to an embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the method for content recommendation is used in the recommendation server <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and includes the following steps.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In S<b>210</b>, content cover images corresponding to a plurality of contents accessed by the user account are obtained.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the contents may refer to multimedia contents used to be provided to the user account, such as short videos, videos, news, articles (e.g. official account tweets), multimedia advertisements, e-books, songs and albums, etc.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In practical applications, the plurality of contents accessed by the user account may also be named as historically accessed contents.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the content cover image may refer to a cover image corresponding to the content, such as short video cover image, article cover image, etc.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a specific implementation, the recommendation server obtains content cover images corresponding to the plurality of contents accessed by the user account. For example, the recommendation server obtains short video cover images corresponding to X short videos clicked by a certain user account.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, X is a positive integer greater than 0.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In practical applications, the selection of the length of user's click history X has a great influence on the results. If X is small, the user's click list (content click list) has a large randomness and the user's preferences may not be captured; if X is large and the click list is too long, it will increase the difficulty of training. In practical applications, X may be equal to 20, that is, the content cover images corresponding to the contents of the last <b>20</b> clicks in the user's click history may be used, which can effectively express the user's personalized preference.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In S<b>220</b>, cover image features of the plurality of content cover images are obtained and user account feature of the user account is determined according to the cover image features of the plurality of content cover images.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the cover image feature may refer to an image feature corresponding to the content cover image.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the user account feature may refer to a corresponding feature used to represent the user account.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In specific implementation, after the recommendation server obtains content cover images corresponding to a plurality of contents, the recommendation server can perform feature extraction on each content cover image through a pre-trained image feature extraction network, and then obtain the cover image feature corresponding to each content cover image. In practical applications, the image feature extraction network may be a CNN visual feature extraction network.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, the CNN visual feature extraction network can adopt convolutional neural networks such as resnet50, VGG, inception, etc., and the last full connection layer is replaced with a dimension reduction layer, et., the full connection of 1024 dimensions to 32 dimensions. The CNN network adopts imagenet for pre-training, otherwise the network is difficult to converge.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Then, the recommendation server determines the user account feature of the user account according to the cover image features of the plurality of content cover images. Specifically, the recommendation server may input the cover image feature of each content cover image into a pre-trained user coding network, and perform fusion processing on the cover image feature of each content cover image through the pre-trained user coding network, and generate a user account feature corresponding to the user account. In practical applications, the recommendation server may adopt a user vector representation (e.g. user_embed) output by the pre-trained user coding network to represent the user account feature corresponding to the user account.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In S<b>230</b>, an access probability value of the user account accessing a content to be recommended is determined, based on the cover image feature of the content to be recommended and the user account feature.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In practical applications, the access probability value may also be named as content click-through rate (ctr).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the cover image feature of the content to be recommended may refer to an image feature corresponding to the content cover image of the content to be recommended. In practical applications, the specific process of obtaining the image feature corresponding to the content cover image of the content to be recommended is similar to the specific process of obtaining the cover image features of the plurality of content cover images above, and will not be repeated here.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In specific implementation, after the recommendation server obtains the cover image feature of the content to be recommended and the user account feature corresponding to the user account, the recommendation server may input the cover image feature of the content to be recommended and user account feature into a pre-trained click-through rate prediction network; the cover image features of the content to be recommended and the user account feature corresponding to the user account are processed through the pre-trained click-through rate prediction network, and then the output result of the pre-trained click-through rate prediction network is taken as the access probability value of the user account accessing the content to be recommended.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In practical applications, the above pre-trained click-through rate prediction network may also be named as a CTR prediction network.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the CTR prediction network may adopt a three-layer DNN (Deep-learning Neural Network) network, and train the loss by adopting a cross entropy loss function (SoftMax cross entropy loss). In order to train the network better, an optimal configuration scheme is selected by performing tuning tests in terms of Log sampling method, data enhancement, activation function, loss function, attention method, etc.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In S<b>240</b>, the content to be recommended is provided to the user account according to the access probability value.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a specific implementation, after obtaining the access probability value of the user account accessing the content to be recommended, the recommendation server may provide the content to be recommended to the user account based on the access probability value. Specifically, the recommendation server may determine whether the access probability value is greater than a preset threshold or not.
