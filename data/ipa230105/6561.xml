For example, during charging of a cell phone supporting a Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery (USB-PD) protocol, an initial alternating current voltage supplied by the power supply needs to be converted into a continuously adjustable direct current voltage. An existing common voltage adjustment method may be as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a structure of an existing power supply conversion circuit, in which a power supply <b>10</b> is configured to provide an alternating current, and a rectifier-filter circuit <b>20</b> and a pulse width modulation circuit <b>80</b> are configured to convert the alternating current into a pulse square wave. The pulse square wave is applied to a coil on a transformer primary side <b>30</b>_<b>1</b> of the transformer <b>30</b>. The coil on the transformer primary side <b>30</b>_<b>1</b> is configured to generate an induced electromagnetic field based on the pulse square wave and couple the induced electromagnetic field to a coil on a transformer secondary side <b>30</b>_<b>2</b>. The coil on a transformer secondary side <b>30</b>_<b>2</b> is configured to generate an induced current based on the induced electromagnetic field, and determine, based on a ratio of winding turns of the coil on the transformer primary side <b>30</b>_<b>1</b> to winding turns of the coil on the transformer secondary side <b>30</b>_<b>2</b>, an output voltage on the transformer secondary side <b>30</b>_<b>2</b>. The induced current on the transformer secondary side <b>30</b>_<b>2</b> is converted into a direct current by a secondary rectifier-filter circuit <b>40</b>T, and the direct current is provided to an electric load <b>50</b>. In the structure of the power supply conversion circuit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the electric load <b>50</b> may feed, via a dedicated sampling feedback circuit <b>60</b> and an isolation member <b>70</b> (generally a signal isolation conversion chip configured to isolate a current of the coil on the transformer primary side from a current of the coil on the transformer secondary side), a demand voltage magnitude in a form of a power supply feedback signal back to the transformer primary side <b>30</b>_<b>1</b>. Through the pulse width modulation circuit <b>80</b>, a voltage applied on the transformer primary side <b>30</b>_<b>1</b> is adjusted based on the power supply feedback signal. Therefore, the output voltage on the transformer secondary side <b>30</b>_<b>2</b> can be changed based on a fixed ratio of winding turns in the transformer <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one of the conventional applications, based on the structure of the power supply conversion circuit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the sampling feedback circuit <b>60</b> may consist of a separate dedicated feedback coil winding, a reverse bias cut-off diode D<b>2</b>, a resistor R<b>5</b>, and a resistor R<b>6</b>, as illustrated in a dashed box in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The dedicated feedback coil winding is configured to obtain the power supply feedback signal from the coil on the transformer secondary side. The resistor R<b>5</b> and the resistor R<b>6</b> are configured to adjust the output voltage of the coil on the transformer secondary side. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a switching power supply chip U<b>2</b> may be configured to obtain information of an output voltage V+ through the feedback coil winding. When a magnitude of the output voltage V+ needs to be adjusted based on a demand voltage of the electric load, an adjustment loop may be as follows: the power supply feedback signal is fed back to the pulse width modulation circuit by the electric load via the isolation member; a sampling voltage is obtained by the pulse width modulation circuit from a transformer feedback winding, and a pulse width or frequency of the pulse square wave is adjusted to obtain the output voltage. Therefore, such an adjustment loop has a long feedback loop and poor real-time performance of an adjustment. Further, due to defects of the transformer such as leakage inductance and leakage flux, a primary transformer coil, a secondary transformer coil, and a feedback winding cannot ideally have a proportional relationship strictly determined by the turn ratio. In this way, it has poor accuracy to control the output voltage on the transformer secondary side by feeding, via the dedicated feedback winding, the sampling voltage signal back.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In another conventional application, based on the structure of the power supply conversion circuit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the sampling feedback circuit <b>60</b> may also be as illustrated in a dashed box in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The output voltage on the transformer secondary side is divided by a resistor R<b>7</b> and a resistor R<b>8</b>. The divided sampling voltage is transmitted to a comparator. The comparator may transmit a result of a comparison between the sampling voltage and a reference voltage Vref to an optocoupler chip T<b>1</b>. The optocoupler chip T<b>1</b> may transmit an isolated feedback signal to an FB interface of a control chip on the transformer primary side. The control chip may adjust, based on the signal returned from the optocoupler chip, a PWM pulse width or frequency on the coil on the transformer primary side. A voltage adjustment circuit illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> requires the use of an optocoupler chip as a signal isolation member between the transformer primary side and the transformer secondary side, with a long path for a feedback sampling voltage signal to be returned to a pulse width control circuit. In addition, a speed of the optocoupler chip cannot meet higher response requirements.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, in the above conventional applications, a circuit for controlling a voltage is mainly located on the primary side of the transformer, thereby leading to a high voltage on the primary side. The required high voltage resistance device usually has a large package but a low capacitance value, which affects an overall size of the circuit.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present disclosure provides a power supply conversion circuit as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a structural schematic diagram of a power supply conversion circuit according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.
