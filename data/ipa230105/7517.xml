In NR systems, the terrestrial radio access network includes a plurality of base stations (BS), referred as next generation Node-Bs (gNBs), communicating with a plurality of mobile stations, referred as user equipment (UE). A UE may communicate with a base station (BS) or a gNB via the downlink and uplink. The downlink (DL) refers to the communication from the base station to the UE. The uplink (UL) refers to the communication from the UE to the base station. The 5G NR standard is developed by 3GPP. Channel State Information reference signals (CSI-RS) are utilized by UEs to measure and feedback the characteristics of a radio channel so that the gNB can use correct modulation, code rate, beam forming, etc. for DL data transmission.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In real developments, it is observed that the throughput drops significantly in high or medium velocity scenarios. One main reason is that the reported CSI becomes outdated due to fast channel variation. The channel variation can be observed in Doppler domain. In the current NR, CSI is calculated based on the located slot of CSI reference resource, which is before the uplink slot for CSI reporting. The CSI calculated for a past slot may not be useful at a later time when gNB needs to perform scheduling, especially in high velocity scenarios. To increase throughput, gNB needs to know the CSI that is good for &#x201c;future&#x201d; channels. The future CSI cannot be learned by a &#x201c;one-shot&#x201d; measurement as any channel variation requires at least two measurements to detect.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A solution is sought to extend the CSI framework in NR to support high velocity.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method of downlink channel state information (DL CSI) computation and reporting is proposed to support high velocity in new radio (NR) systems. In a first novel aspect, two CSI reference slots are defined. CSI reference slot for CSI measurement is defined for determining which CSI-RS/SSB occasion(s) is used for computing CSI. CSI reference slot for CSI computation is defined for determining the slot where UE assumes the CSI computation should be based upon the channel from that slot onwards.

The UE determines a first CSI reference slot for measurement and a second CSI reference slot for computation from the CSI-RS configuration information.

The UE measures CSI reference signals (CSI-RS) of a downlink channel that is received before the first CSI reference slot for measurements.

Mobile communication network <b>100</b> is an OFDM network comprising a serving base station (gNB <b>101</b>) and a user equipment (UE <b>102</b>). In 3GPP NR system based on OFDMA downlink, the radio resource is partitioned into slots in time domain, each slot is comprised of a number of OFDM symbols. Each OFDMA symbol further consists of a number of OFDMA subcarriers in frequency domain depending on the system bandwidth. The basic unit of the resource grid is called Resource Element (RE), which spans an OFDMA subcarrier over one OFDMA symbol. REs are grouped into resource blocks (RBs), where each RB consists of twelve consecutive subcarriers in one slot.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Several physical downlink channels and reference signals are defined to use a set of resource elements carrying information originating from higher layers. For downlink channels, the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) is the main data-bearing downlink channel in NR, while the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) is used to carry downlink control information (DCI). The control information may include scheduling decision, information related to reference signal information, rules forming the corresponding transport block (TB) to be carried by PDSCH, and power control command. For radio resource management (RRM) measurement in NR, each UE can be configured to measure synchronization signal (SS) blocks (SSB) and/or channel state information (CSI) reference signal (CSI-RS). For CSI-RS measurement, both frequency and timing resources need to be determined. CSI-RS are utilized by UEs to measure and feedback the characteristics of a DL channel so that gNB can use correct modulation, code rate, beam forming, etc. for DL data transmission.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In real developments, it is observed that the throughput drops significantly in high or medium velocity scenarios. One main reason is that the reported CSI becomes outdated due to fast channel variation.

In one novel aspect, two CSI reference slots are defined. CSI reference slot for CSI measurement is defined for determining which CSI-RS/SSB occasion(s) is used for computing CSI. CSI reference slot for CSI computation is defined for determining the first time slot where UE assumes the CSI computation should be based upon the channel from that time slot onwards. For example, if CSI reporting occurs at slot(n), then the CSI reference slot for CSI measurement occurs at slot (n&#x2212;n<sub>CSI_REF</sub>), and the CSI reference slot for computation occurs at slot(n+K). In another novel aspect, UE can be configured with a CSI computation period consisting of one or N slots and can be divided into multiple sub-periods without overlap.

CSI reference signals (CSI-RS) are dedicated measurement signals introduced to be used by UEs to acquire CSI, for example, for channel dependent scheduling, link adaptation, and transmission settings related to multi-antenna transmission. UE is configured to compute CSI based on one single occasion or multiple occasions of CSI-RS over configured CSI reference resource, e.g., a group of downlink frequency domain and time domain resource blocks. The CSI reference resource for a serving cell is defined as follows. In the frequency domain, the CSI reference resource is defined by the group of downlink physical resource blocks corresponding to the band to which the derived CQI value relates. In the time domain, the CSI reference resource is defined by a single downlink slot or special subframe to which the derived CQI value relates. In the spatial/layer domain, the CSI reference resource is defined by any RI and PMI on which the CQI is conditioned.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the current NR, CSI is calculated based on the located slot of CSI reference resource, which is before the uplink slot for CSI reporting. However, the CSI calculated for a past slot may not be useful at a later time when gNB needs to perform scheduling, especially in high velocity scenarios. To increase throughput, gNB needs to know the CSI that is good for &#x201c;future&#x201d; channels when channel variation is high. The future CSI cannot be learned by a &#x201c;one-shot&#x201d; measurement as any channel variation requires at least two measurements to detect. In one novel aspect, a UE can be configured to measure multiple occasions of CSI-RS over multiple slots for a past DL channel, and the UE can also be configured to calculate and predict CSI of a future DL channel, based on channel variations detected from the multiple CSI-RS measurements.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Specifically, two CSI reference slots are defined to support high velocity scenarios. CSI reference slot for CSI measurement is defined for determining which CSI-RS is used for computing CSI. CSI reference slot for CSI computation is defined for determining the first slot where UE assumes the CSI computation should be based upon the channel at that time onwards. When UE is configured to compute CSI based on one single occasion of CSI-RS, the two CSI reference slots coincide and are the same as CSI reference resource of Rel-15 NR. When UE is configured to compute CSI based on multiple occasions of CSI-RS, for the purpose of determining which CSI-RS occasion(s) is used for computing CSI, the CSI reference slot for CSI measurement is the same as CSI reference resource of Rel-15 NR. When UE is configured to compute CSI based on multiple occasions of CSI-RS, the CSI reference slot for CSI computation can be configured the same as or after the uplink slot for CSI reporting. Multiple CSI-RS occasions can be multiple repetitions in a burst period or multiple CSI-RS resources in a CSI-RS resource set across slots no later than the CSI reference resource.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a UE is configured to compute CSI based on multiple occasions of CSI-RS, and to report CSI at SLOT n. The CSI reference slot for CSI measurement is the same as CSI reference resource that occurs before SLOT n with an offset value of n<sub>CSI_ref</sub>, e.g., occurs at SLOT (n&#x2212;n<sub>CSI_ref</sub>). That is, the UE computes CSI based on multiple occasions of CSI-RS received and measured no later than SLOT (n&#x2212;n<sub>CSI_ref</sub>). The CSI reference slot for CSI computation can be configured after the uplink slot for CSI reporting with an offset K, e.g., at SLOT (n+K). That is, the UE computed CSI is for a future time, starting from SLOT (n+K), where the UE assumes the CSI computation should be predicted on the channel starting from that future time of SLOT (n+K) onwards. Traditionally, the computed CSI over past CSI reference resource (e.g., SLOT (n&#x2212;n<sub>CSI_ref</sub>)) becomes outdated for future time (e.g., SLOT (n+K)) due to fast channel variation. By configuring two separate CSI reference slots for CSI measurement and for CSI computation, the UE can compute and predict future CSI in SLOT (n+K) based on multiple occasions of CSI-RS received and measured no later than SLOT (n&#x2212;n<sub>CSI_ref</sub>). For example, CSI prediction can be performed using the autoregressive (AR) model H[n]=&#x3a3;<sub>i=1</sub><sup>D </sup>c<sub>i</sub>H[n&#x2212;i]. The multiple CSI-RS measurements can be used to estimate the AR coefficients {c<sub>i</sub>}. Then, this equation H[n]=&#x3a3;<sub>i=1</sub><sup>D </sup>c<sub>i</sub>H[n&#x2212;i] can be applied recursively to compute H[n+K].</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a second embodiment of configuring CSI computation period with whole-period CSI and sub-period CSI to support high velocity scenario in accordance with one novel aspect. UE can be configured with a CSI computation period consisting of one or multiple slots and can be divided into multiple sub-periods without overlap. Each sub-period consists of X consecutive slots, where X is configurable. A CSI computed for the whole CSI computation period is called &#x201c;whole-period&#x201d; CSI. A CSI computed for a sub-period is called &#x201c;sub-period&#x201d; CSI. A CSI computation period can start from the CSI reference slot for CSI computation. A CSI computation period can be set before the CSI resource reference specified in NR Release 15.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in time domain, subperiods SUB-P 0, SUB-P 1, . . . , SUB-P P&#x2212;1 are defined. In frequency domain, subbands SUB-B 0, SUB-B 1, SUB-B B&#x2212;1 are defined. The size of sub-period depends on the total number of slots in the CSI computation period. If the number of slots in CSI computation period A is larger than the number of slots in CSI computation period B, then the size of sub-period for A is larger than or equal to the size of sub-period for B. When the number of slots in the CSI computation period is less than or equal to a certain pre-defined value, only the whole-period CSI is reported. Reporting of a whole-period CSI is omitted if none of slots in the CSI computation period comprise at least one higher layer configured downlink or flexible symbol. A valid sub-period is a sub-period in which all the slots comprise at least one higher layer configured downlink or flexible symbol. Reporting of a sub-period CSI is omitted if the sub-period is not a valid sub-period. Only the valid sub-periods are indexed, starting from the first valid sub-period. The gNB can inform UE which sub-period(s) can be omitted for CSI reporting. The omitted sub-periods are considered as invalid sub-periods.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one preferred embodiment, the CSI reporting is configured to be in SLOT n, and the CSI computation period starts from the CSI reference slot for CSI computation, e.g., SLOT (n+K), as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Because the UE is configured to compute CSI based on multiple occasions of CSI-RS measured no later than SLOT (n-n<sub>CSI_ref</sub>), the UE can consider time domain correlation of the multiple occasions of CSI-RS to predict the CSI in SLOT (n+K). In addition, the UE is configured with a CSI computation period (e.g., across multiple slots) with a whole period and multiple non-overlapping subperiods, which can exploit time-domain correlation. The CSI computation period is designed to facilitate reduction of CSI feedback overhead. If N slots within the same sub-period can share the same CSI with little performance loss, then the overhead is reduced to 1/N. Besides, the channel variation in time is usually sparse in a transform domain, e.g., Doppler domain (through DFT). Then, M sub-periods may be described using M&#x2032;&#x3c;&#x3c;M values, e.g., M&#x2032;/M=&#xbc;.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another alternative embodiment, the CSI reporting is configured to be in SLOT n, and the CSI computation period ends at the CSI reference slot for CSI measurement, which is the same as the CSI reference resource, e.g., SLOT (n-n<sub>CSI_ref</sub>) (not shown). The intention is for gNB to predict the future CSI, so UE should compute CSI only on the past observations. Under this scenario, the UE measures CSI-RS received no later than SLOT (n-n<sub>CSI_ref</sub>), and computes CSI using the computation period ending at the same slot. The UE still considers the time domain correlation of the entire computation period to estimate the CSI of the DL channel with reduction of CSI feedback overhead. However, the UE does not need to do any prediction for CSI of the DL channel starting from a future SLOT (n+K). The UE simply reports the computed past CSI to the network, and the network can predict a future CSI using the received past CSI.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates examples of CSI computation period with whole-period CSI and sub-period CSI for wideband and subband.
