It is known that in some mechanical systems the transmission of motion between two moving members in translation that are guided linearly, namely a driving member and a driven member that have different orientations, is carried out via a sloped ramp. Such a ramp consists of two surfaces of these members that rub against each other. Such a system can thus be of the &#x201c;double-acting&#x201d; type when it comprises a two-sided ramp that enables a &#x201c;push-pull&#x201d; transmission of the movement or of the &#x201c;single-acting&#x201d; type when it concerns a one-sided ramp that enables transmission of the movement by pushing.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">When built with good precision, such systems can work without major problems. This is not the case if they are misaligned, for example due to wear or if they have a faulty angle, for example due to machining tolerances that are too broad.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such flaws have the disadvantage of generating a concentration of forces on the edges at the end of the ramp and, on the other hand, of causing these edges to scrape off the film intended to ensure the lubrication of the device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such a situation itself leads to a drop in the conversion efficiency of the movement or even to the system bending and subsequently jamming, which in the long run, due to abrasion, causes premature wear of the surfaces in contact, which in time can lead to their degradation and seizure. To avoid such drawbacks, it has been proposed to match the angles of the contacting surfaces of the driving member and the driven member using cylindrical shoes that are mounted so as to oscillate in a recess built into one of said members. In such a system, the cylindrical shoe contacts with the ramp via a flattened surface built into the latter, so that it can rotate such that this flattened surface comes in permanent contact with that ramp. However, it was found that during the movement, due to the friction of the ramp on the flattened surface of the shoe, the latter tended to rotate in the direction of the sliding, such that its leading or following edge is facing the lubricant and scraping it off, thus preventing any lubrication.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 5,135,242 describes a chuck with radial clamping jaws, in which the actuating movement is performed by a driving member that acts along the axis of the chuck. in such a chuck, a cylindrical journal is used which is rotatably mounted in a driven member and each end of which is machined to form a stud comprising two opposite flattened surfaces relative to the axis of the journal. Each of the studs slides into a groove in the driving member, the axis of that groove being sloped relative to the axis of the driving member. Under these conditions, when the driving member moves axially, the flattened surfaces of the stud are respectively applied against one edge or the other of the groove according to the direction of axial displacement of the driving member. This results in a radial displacement of the driven member in either direction, following the direction of axial displacement of the driving member.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such a system presents the aforementioned drawback, namely that the stud is led to rotate in the direction of the sliding, such that its leading or following edge is facing the lubricant and scraping it off, thus preventing any lubrication.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This invention proposes to remedy the aforementioned drawbacks by proposing means to make contact between the driven member and the driving member that allows optimal lubrication of the system.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This invention therefore aims to provide a device for transmitting a movement between a first and a second member, i.e., from a driving member to a driven member, of the type comprising a cylindrical journal with a circular base rotatably mounted in a housing of the driven member or of the driving member, at least one of the ends of this journal being hollowed out by a groove capable of forming on either side thereof two symmetrical shoes with respect to an axial and diametral plane of the journal and capable of coining into contact with the driven member or the driving member via a flattened surface, the straight section of each shoe being delimited by an arc conforming to the outer surface of the journal, ending with a straight segment belonging to the flattened surface.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferentially, the journal will be rotatably mounted in the housing of the driven member, which usually corresponds to a shorter kinematic length.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the invention, the driving member may comprise a ramp against the sides of which the flattened surfaces of the shoes can be applied.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The sides of this ramp may be symmetrical with respect to a plane. They may also be parallel to this plane. These sides may also form an angle with said plane comprised between 5&#xb0; and 30&#xb0; and preferentially, on the order of 15&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The device according to the invention may comprise at least one pair of ramps; between each of these pairs of ramps there may be a journal that is rotatably mounted in a housing of the driven member, each of the two ends of this journal forming a pair of shoes whose flattened surfaces can be applied respectively against the sides of the ramps.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The ramps of each pair of ramps can be arranged opposite each other. These ramps may be attached to a slide mounted on a plate that can be moved in translation along the axis of a chuck under the action of a control member.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The driven member can consist of a jaw holder of a concentric clamping chuck.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The chuck jaw holder can be mounted so as to slide into a radial slide on the chuck.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">This invention also relates to a radial clamping chuck with several concentric jaws, in which the radial displacement of the jaws is controlled by an axial displacement of a control member, the transmission of the movement of the control member to the jaws being performed by means of a device for transmitting a movement as described above.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary

The sides <b>46</b><i>b </i>of this ramp are symmetrical with respect to the plane vv&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the straight section, following the XV-XV line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the ramp <b>46</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, has an isosceles trapezoid shape, the small base of which is on the outside and the angle formed by each of its sides <b>46</b><i>b </i>with the median plane vv&#x2032; forms a side angle &#x3b4;, which is small in order to avoid generating lateral thrusts. Preferentially, this side angle &#x3b4; will be comprised between 5&#xb0; and 30&#xb0; and in particular equal to 15&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in zone B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, between each of the three pairs of slides <b>44</b>, there is a cylindrical journal <b>48</b> with a circular base, represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b><i>a</i></figref>, the ends of which are hollowed out by a groove <b>50</b>, the shape of which is complementary to that of the ramp <b>46</b> and thus forms a fork whose branches form shoes <b>48</b><i>a </i>whose sides <b>48</b><i>b </i>support the sides <b>46</b><i>b </i>of the ramp <b>46</b>, by of course providing for a working clearance.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to the invention, and unlike the devices of the prior art, the two opposite oscillating shoes formed by the branches <b>48</b><i>a </i>of the journal <b>48</b> have their center of rotation O outside their straight section, and more specifically in the present embodiment, on the longitudinal axis of each journal, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. These two journals thus have the same operating mode as the one described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, such that they allow for correct admission of the lubricating fluid <b>14</b> between the moving parts.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The &#x3b4; slope of the sides <b>46</b><i>b </i>of the ramp <b>46</b> relative to its median plane vv&#x2032;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>19</b></figref>, and the corresponding inclination of the sides <b>48</b><i>b </i>of the shoes <b>48</b><i>a </i>are interesting in that they create corner bearing means, which make it possible to compensate for any production flaws. More specifically, such an arrangement has the advantage of allowing the oscillating shoe, by moving transversely in its housing, to compensate for possible flaws in the positioning of the contact surfaces, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>. Thus, despite an offset of the ramps, they cooperate on the sides of the journal.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Of course, according to the invention, the sides <b>46</b><i>b </i>of the ramp <b>46</b> as well as the sides <b>48</b><i>b </i>of the shoes <b>48</b><i>a </i>may not be sloped as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b><i>b</i></figref>, and each shoe would thus have the shape of a cylinder whose base would consist of an arc ending in a segment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, which would have the advantage of offering better mechanical efficiency and being easier to achieve. As shown in zone C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the jaw holder <b>26</b> is hollowed out of a housing <b>27</b> transverse to it, the diameter of which allows the journal <b>48</b> to slide into it.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Under these conditions, and referring in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, it can be seen that when the plate <b>34</b> is actuated by an axial translation movement with respect to the jaw holder <b>26</b>, for example in the direction of the arrow F<b>4</b>, the axial displacement of the slide <b>44</b>, and therefore its ramp <b>46</b>, with respect to the jaw holder <b>26</b>, has the effect of generating a radial displacement of the latter following the arrow F<b>5</b>. The movement of a driving member, consisting of the slide <b>44</b> and its ramp <b>46</b>, is thus transmitted to a driven member, consisting of the jaw holder <b>26</b>, these two members having perpendicular directions.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to the invention, as illustrated in schematic <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>18</b></figref>, when the plate <b>34</b> moves in the direction of the arrow F<b>4</b>, the slide <b>44</b> and its ramp <b>46</b>, which in this case constitutes the driving member, the journal <b>48</b>, as a result of this displacement, tends to rotate in the direction of the arrow F<b>3</b>, which has the effect of clearing the heel <b>49</b> of their contact face <b>48</b><i>b </i>with the sides of the ramp <b>46</b>, thus allowing the admission of the lubricating fluid <b>14</b> between these two elements.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">This invention is of interest for many mechanical devices and in particular those that require the transmission of a significant force between a driving part and a driven part with sloping axes and especially perpendicular axes, in particular in the actuation of press slides, for example punch presses.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Previous embodiments have been described in which the oscillating shoe or shoes was/were rotatably embedded in a driven part, but, of course, according to the invention, this could be inversely achieved.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Lastly, and although a clevis-mounted journal has been described above, this invention is of course applicable to a journal that is cantilever-mounted. Furthermore, the slides can be prismatically guided, as described above, which has the advantage of not having to be locked in rotation, or cylindrically guided, which makes them easier to achieve.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Of course, these examples are in no way limiting relative to the multiple applications of this invention.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
