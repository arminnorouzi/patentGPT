Information is stored by programing memory cells within a memory device to various states. For example, binary memory cells may be programmed to one of two supported states, often corresponding to a logic 1 or a logic 0. In some examples, a single memory cell may support more than two possible states, any one of which may be stored by the memory cell. To access information stored by a memory device, a component may read, or sense, the state of one or more memory cells within the memory device. To store information, a component may write, or program, one or more memory cells within the memory device to corresponding states.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various types of memory devices exist, including magnetic hard disks, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), dynamic RAM (DRAM), synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM), static RAM (SRAM), ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM), magnetic RAM (MRAM), resistive RAM (RRAM), flash memory, phase change memory (PCM), 3-dimensional cross-point memory (3D Xpoint), not-or (NOR), and not-and (NAND) memory devices, and others. Memory devices may be volatile or non-volatile. Volatile memory cells (e.g., DRAM cells) may lose their programmed states over time unless they are periodically refreshed by an external power source. Non-volatile memory cells (e.g., NAND memory cells) may maintain their programmed states for extended periods of time even in the absence of an external power source.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a memory device that supports thin film transistor deck selection in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of a transistor structure that supports thin film transistor deck selection in a memory device in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example of a circuit that supports thin film transistor deck selection in a memory device in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> through <b>7</b></figref> illustrate example layouts of memory dies that support thin film transistor deck selection in a memory device in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref> show flowcharts illustrating methods that support thin film transistor deck selection in a memory device in accordance with examples as disclosed herein.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Memory devices may include various arrangements of memory arrays formed over a substrate, where memory cells of the memory arrays may be organized or addressed in accordance with rows and columns. In some examples, circuitry that supports accessing or operating the memory arrays may be located below the memory arrays, which may refer to a location that is at least in part between the memory arrays and the substrate. For example, row decoders or column decoders, among other types of decoding circuitry, may be located below the memory arrays but above the substrate and, in some examples, may include transistors that are formed at least in part by doping portions of the substrate (e.g., substrate-based transistors, transistors having channels formed from doped crystalline silicon or other semiconductor). As memory devices scale with a greater quantity of layers or decks above a substrate, the area of a substrate used for such decoders or other supporting circuitry may increase, which may lead to various scaling limitations (e.g., related to the limited area of a substrate to support a growing quantity of decks and, by extension, a growing quantity and area for such decoders or other supporting circuitry).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with examples as disclosed herein, a memory device may include memory arrays arranged in a stack of decks formed over a substrate, and deck selection components (e.g., deck selection transistors, deck decoding or addressing circuitry) may be distributed among the layers to leverage common substrate-based circuitry. For example, each memory array of the stack may include a set of digit lines of a corresponding deck, and deck selection circuitry, such as deck selection transistors or other switching circuitry (e.g., of the corresponding deck, of another deck) operable to couple the set of digit lines with a column decoder that may be shared among (e.g., coupled with) multiple decks. To access memory cells of a selected memory array on one deck, the deck selection circuitry corresponding to the selected memory array may each be activated (e.g., coupling digit lines of the selected memory array with the common column decoder), while the deck selection circuitry corresponding to a non-selected memory array on another deck may be deactivated (e.g., isolating digit lines of the non-selected memory array from the common column decoder). Deck selection circuitry, such as deck selection transistors, may leverage thin-film manufacturing techniques, such as various techniques for forming vertical transistors (e.g., transistors having vertical channels, transistors having channels oriented at least in part along a thickness direction of the memory die, transistors having polycrystalline silicon channels) above a substrate. Implementing deck selection circuitry at various decks of such a memory die may alleviate or mitigate area utilization challenges of a substrate level, such as moving certain aspects of decoding or addressing into decks or levels above the substrate, which may improve scaling in memory devices by supporting a greater quantity of decks for a given area of substrate-based circuitry.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Features of the disclosure are initially described in the context of a memory device and related circuitry as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>3</b></figref>. Features of the disclosure are described in the context of memory die layouts with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> through <b>7</b></figref>.

The memory device <b>100</b> may also be referred to as a memory die, or an electronic memory apparatus. The memory device <b>100</b> may include memory cells <b>105</b> that are programmable to store different logic states. In some cases, a memory cell <b>105</b> may be programmable to store two logic states, denoted a logic 0 and a logic 1. In some cases, a memory cell <b>105</b> may be programmable to store more than two logic states (e.g., as a multi-level cell). The set of memory cells <b>105</b> may be part of a memory array <b>110</b> of the memory device <b>100</b>, where, in some examples, a memory array <b>110</b> may refer to a contiguous tile of memory cells <b>105</b> (e.g., a contiguous set of elements of a semiconductor chip).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some examples, a memory cell <b>105</b> may store an electric charge representative of the programmable logic states (e.g., storing charge in a capacitor, capacitive memory element, or capacitive storage element). In one example, a charged and uncharged capacitor may represent two logic states, respectively. In another example, a positively charged (e.g., a first polarity, a positive polarity) and negatively charged (e.g., a second polarity, a negative polarity) capacitor may represent two logic states, respectively. DRAM or FeRAM architectures may use such designs, and the capacitor employed may include a dielectric material with linear or para-electric polarization properties as an insulator. In some examples, different levels of charge of a capacitor may represent different logic states, which, in some examples, may support more than two logic states in a respective memory cell <b>105</b>. In some examples, such as FeRAM architectures, a memory cell <b>105</b> may include a ferroelectric capacitor having a ferroelectric material as an insulating (e.g., non-conductive) layer between terminals of the capacitor. Different levels or polarities of polarization of a ferroelectric capacitor may represent different logic states (e.g., supporting two or more logic states in a respective memory cell <b>105</b>).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some examples, a memory cell <b>105</b> may include or otherwise be associated with a configurable material, which may be referred to as a material memory element, a material storage element, a material portion, and others. The configurable material may have one or more variable and configurable characteristics or properties (e.g., material states) that may represent different logic states. For example, a configurable material may take different forms, different atomic configurations, different degrees of crystallinity, different atomic distributions, or otherwise maintain different characteristics that may be leveraged to represent one logic state or another. In some examples, such characteristics may be associated with different electrical resistances, different threshold characteristics, or other properties that are detectable or distinguishable during a read operation to identify a logic state written to or stored by the configurable material.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some cases, a configurable material of a memory cell <b>105</b> may be associated with a threshold voltage. For example, electrical current may flow through the configurable material when a voltage greater than the threshold voltage is applied across the memory cell <b>105</b>, and electrical current may not flow through the configurable material, or may flow through the configurable material at a rate below some level (e.g., according to a leakage rate), when a voltage less than the threshold voltage is applied across the memory cell <b>105</b>. Thus, a voltage applied to memory cells <b>105</b> may result in different current flow, or different perceived resistance, or a change in resistance (e.g., a thresholding or switching event) depending on whether a configurable material portion of the memory cell <b>105</b> was written with one logic state or another. Accordingly, the magnitude of current, or other characteristic (e.g., thresholding behavior, resistance breakdown behavior, snapback behavior) associated with the current that results from applying a read voltage to the memory cell <b>105</b>, may be used to determine a logic state written to or stored by memory cell <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the example of memory device <b>100</b>, each row of memory cells <b>105</b> may be coupled with one or more word lines <b>120</b> (e.g., WL<sub>1 </sub>through WL<sub>M</sub>), and each column of memory cells <b>105</b> may be coupled with one or more digit lines <b>130</b> (e.g., DL<sub>1 </sub>through DL<sub>N</sub>). Each of the word lines <b>120</b> and digit lines <b>130</b> may be an example of an access line of the memory device <b>100</b>. In general, one memory cell <b>105</b> may be located at the intersection of (e.g., coupled with, coupled between) a word line <b>120</b> and a digit line <b>130</b>. This intersection may be referred to as an address of a memory cell <b>105</b>. A target or selected memory cell <b>105</b> may be a memory cell <b>105</b> located at the intersection of an energized or otherwise selected word line <b>120</b> and an energized or otherwise selected digit line <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some architectures, a storage component of a memory cell <b>105</b> may be electrically isolated (e.g., selectively isolated) from a digit line <b>130</b> by a cell selection component, which, in some examples, may be referred to as a switching component or a selector device of or otherwise associated with the memory cell <b>105</b>. A word line <b>120</b> may be coupled with the cell selection component (e.g., via a control node or terminal of the cell selection component), and may control the cell selection component of the memory cell <b>105</b>. For example, the cell selection component may be a transistor and the word line <b>120</b> may be coupled with a gate of the transistor (e.g., where a gate node of the transistor may be a control node of the transistor). Activating a word line <b>120</b> may result in an electrical connection or closed circuit between a respective logic storing component of one or more memory cells <b>105</b> and one or more corresponding digit lines <b>130</b>, which may be referred to as activating the one or more memory cells <b>105</b> or coupling the one or more memory cells <b>105</b> with a respective one or more digit lines <b>130</b>. A digit line <b>130</b> may then be accessed to read from or write to the respective memory cell <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some examples, memory cells <b>105</b> may also be coupled with one or more plate lines <b>140</b> (e.g., PL<sub>1 </sub>through PL<sub>N</sub>). In some examples, each of the plate lines <b>140</b> may be independently addressable (e.g., supporting individual selection or biasing).

In some examples, a height dimension or extent in the z-direction of the pillars <b>430</b> of a memory array <b>110</b> may be the same as or at least partially overlapping with a height dimension or extent in the z-direction of the pillars <b>470</b> of the memory array <b>110</b>. For example, each of the pillars <b>430</b> and <b>470</b> may have a common height dimension (e.g., a common upper extent, a common lower extent, or both) relative to the substrate. In some examples, the pillars <b>430</b> may have a height or a height dimension that is different than the pillars <b>470</b>, such as the pillars <b>430</b> having an extended height along the z-direction to support one or more features of the capacitors <b>320</b>.

In some examples, pillars <b>430</b> and <b>470</b> may be formed from the same material or combination of materials (e.g., from a same layer or stack of layers). In some examples, such layers may include one or more electrode layers, such as an electrode layer above a stack of doped semiconductor material layers, an electrode layer below a stack of doped semiconductor material layers, or both, and such electrode layers may be or may not be etched or trenched along with the pillar formation processes. Additionally or alternatively, in some examples, holes or trenches may be etched through a material (e.g., in the z-direction, through a dielectric material, through a gate dielectric material) and material for the pillars <b>430</b> and <b>470</b> (e.g., one or more doped semiconductor materials, one or more electrode materials) may be deposited in the etched holes or trenches.

However, in other examples, a transistor <b>380</b> or a cell selection component <b>330</b> may include or be otherwise formed with any quantity of one or more pillars <b>470</b> or <b>430</b>, respectively.

In some examples, gate conductors may be located alongside the respective pillars (e.g., as a transverse gate, as a pass-by gate, as a pair of gate conductors on either or both sides of a pillar), including conductors extending between the pillars along the y-direction and separated from pillars along the x-direction by a gate dielectric. In some examples, gate conductors may include at least a portion that wraps (e.g., partially, entirely) around respective pillars (e.g., as a wrap-around gate, as a circumferential gate, as an all-around gate), where at least the respective pillars a may be wrapped (e.g., partially wrapped, entirely wrapped) with a circumferential gate dielectric that is in contact with the pillar and the conductor.

For example, data, instructions, commands, information, signals, bits, symbols, and chips that may be referenced throughout the description may be represented by voltages, currents, electromagnetic waves, magnetic fields or particles, optical fields or particles, or any combination thereof. Some drawings may illustrate signals as a single signal; however, the signal may represent a bus of signals, where the bus may have a variety of bit widths.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">The terms &#x201c;electronic communication,&#x201d; &#x201c;conductive contact,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected,&#x201d; and &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; may refer to a relationship between components that supports the flow of signals between the components. Components are considered in electronic communication with (or in conductive contact with or connected with or coupled with) one another if there is any conductive path between the components that can, at any time, support the flow of signals between the components. At any given time, the conductive path between components that are in electronic communication with each other (or in conductive contact with or connected with or coupled with) may be an open circuit or a closed circuit based on the operation of the device that includes the connected components. The conductive path between connected components may be a direct conductive path between the components or the conductive path between connected components may be an indirect conductive path that may include intermediate components, such as switches, transistors, or other components. In some examples, the flow of signals between the connected components may be interrupted for a time, for example, using one or more intermediate components such as switches or transistors.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">The term &#x201c;coupling&#x201d; refers to condition of moving from an open-circuit relationship between components in which signals are not presently capable of being communicated between the components over a conductive path to a closed-circuit relationship between components in which signals can be communicated between components over the conductive path. When a component, such as a controller, couples other components together, the component initiates a change that allows signals to flow between the other components over a conductive path that previously did not permit signals to flow.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">The term &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; refers to a relationship between components in which signals are not presently capable of flowing between the components. Components are isolated from each other if there is an open circuit between them. For example, two components separated by a switch that is positioned between the components are isolated from each other when the switch is open. When a controller isolates two components from one another, the controller affects a change that prevents signals from flowing between the components using a conductive path that previously permitted signals to flow.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">The term &#x201c;layer&#x201d; or &#x201c;level&#x201d; used herein refers to a stratum or sheet of a geometrical structure (e.g., relative to a substrate). Each layer or level may have three dimensions (e.g., height, width, and depth) and may cover at least a portion of a surface. For example, a layer or level may be a three dimensional structure where two dimensions are greater than a third, e.g., a thin-film. Layers or levels may include different elements, components, and/or materials. In some examples, one layer or level may be composed of two or more sublayers or sublevels.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">The devices discussed herein, including a memory array, may be formed on a semiconductor substrate, such as silicon, germanium, silicon-germanium alloy, gallium arsenide, gallium nitride, etc. In some examples, the substrate is a semiconductor wafer. In other cases, the substrate may be a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate, such as silicon-on-glass (SOG) or silicon-on-sapphire (SOS), or epitaxial layers of semiconductor materials on another substrate. The conductivity of the substrate, or sub-regions of the substrate, may be controlled through doping using various chemical species including, but not limited to, phosphorous, boron, or arsenic. Doping may be performed during the initial formation or growth of the substrate, by ion-implantation, or by any other doping means.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">A switching component or a transistor discussed herein may represent a field-effect transistor (FET) and comprise a three terminal device including a source, drain, and gate. The terminals may be connected to other electronic elements through conductive materials, e.g., metals. The source and drain may be conductive and may comprise a heavily-doped, e.g., degenerate, semiconductor region. The source and drain may be separated by a lightly-doped semiconductor region or channel. If the channel is n-type (i.e., majority carriers are electrons), then the FET may be referred to as a n-type FET. If the channel is p-type (i.e., majority carriers are holes), then the FET may be referred to as a p-type FET. The channel may be capped by an insulating gate oxide. The channel conductivity may be controlled by applying a voltage to the gate. For example, applying a positive voltage or negative voltage to an n-type FET or a p-type FET, respectively, may result in the channel becoming conductive. A transistor may be &#x201c;on&#x201d; or &#x201c;activated&#x201d; when a voltage greater than or equal to the transistor's threshold voltage is applied to the transistor gate. The transistor may be &#x201c;off&#x201d; or &#x201c;deactivated&#x201d; when a voltage less than the transistor's threshold voltage is applied to the transistor gate.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">The description set forth herein, in connection with the appended drawings, describes example configurations and does not represent all the examples that may be implemented or that are within the scope of the claims.
