In some cases, the three types of light can also be turned on at the same time to enable the functions of illumination, sterilization, and plant growth assistance at the same time.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some examples, the multifunctional light-emitting device further includes a control part, and the control part correspondingly controls the light source assembly when responding to a user operation, such that the light source assembly performs one or more functions of illumination, plant growth assistance, and sterilization. For example, the control part may be a physical switch or a touch switch; the user can control the light-emitting device through the control part, to control the light-emitting device to emit the light for illumination, the plant grow light, or the ultraviolet light.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">It should be noted that the control part includes a micro-controller, such as an MCU micro-controller, an SoC micro-controller, an SCM micro-controller, etc., where the functions of a central processing unit (CPU) with data processing capability, a random access memory (RAM), a read only memory (ROM), multiple I/O ports and an interrupt system, a timer/counter, etc. (and possibly including display driver circuits, pulse width modulation circuits, analog multiplexers, A/D converters, etc.) are integrated on a silicon chip through an ultra-large-scale integrated circuit technology.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some examples, the multifunctional light-emitting device further includes a communication part, and the communication part establishes a communication connection with an external control device, to correspondingly control the light source assembly to perform one or more functions of illumination, plant growth assistance and sterilization after receiving light control instructions from the external device. In the present example, the external control device may be a cell phone (i.e., the user controls the light-emitting device via a cell phone app) or a control part independent of the light-emitting device (e.g., a remote control, etc.). It should be noted that the communication part may be a Bluetooth communication module, a Wi-Fi communication module, an NB-IoT communication module, a ZigBee communication module, or a LoRa communication module,</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the present disclosure provides a multifunctional desk lamp. The multifunctional desk lamp of the present embodiment includes a base assembly <b>21</b>, a lamp head assembly <b>22</b> and a lamp arm assembly <b>23</b>, wherein one end of the lamp arm assembly <b>23</b> is connected with the base assembly <b>21</b>, and the other end is connected with and supports the lamp head assembly <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some examples, the lamp arm assembly <b>23</b> includes a vertical arm <b>231</b> and a horizontal arm <b>232</b>; a first end of the vertical arm <b>231</b> is connected with the base assembly <b>21</b>, a second end of the vertical arm <b>231</b> is connected with a first end of the horizontal arm <b>232</b> through a first rotating part <b>24</b>, and a second end of the horizontal arm <b>232</b> is connected with the lamp head assembly <b>22</b> through a second rotating part <b>25</b>. The first rotating part <b>24</b> rotates and drives the horizontal arm <b>232</b> and the lamp head assembly <b>22</b> to rotate around the vertical arm <b>231</b>; and the second rotating part <b>25</b> rotates and drives the lamp head assembly <b>22</b> to rotate around the horizontal arm <b>232</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">For example, the first rotating part <b>24</b> may rotate in the direction represented by a curved arrow D as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, to drive the horizontal arm <b>232</b> to rise upwards, so as to drive the lamp head assembly <b>22</b> to rise upwards too (i.e., increasing the height of the lamp head assembly <b>22</b>); the first rotating part <b>24</b> may also rotate in the opposite direction of D to lower the horizontal arm <b>232</b>, so as to lower the lamp head assembly <b>22</b> as well (i.e., decreasing the height of the lamp head assembly <b>22</b>). For another example, the second rotating part <b>25</b> can rotate in the direction represented by a curved arrow E and drive the lamp head assembly <b>22</b> to tilt upwards, i.e., increasing the elevation angle of the lamp head assembly <b>22</b>; the second rotating part <b>25</b> can also rotate in the opposite direction of E so as to drive the lamp head assembly <b>22</b> to tilt downwards, i.e., reducing the elevation angle of the lamp head assembly <b>22</b>. In the present embodiment, through the cooperation of the horizontal arm <b>232</b>, the vertical arm <b>231</b> and the rotating parts <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, the height and angle of the lamp head assembly <b>22</b> can be adjusted as needed.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Further, the rotating parts can be universal joints, so the first rotating part <b>24</b> can rotate to drive the horizontal arm <b>232</b> and the lamp head assembly <b>22</b> to rotate around the vertical arm <b>231</b> along any angle, for example, the horizontal arm <b>232</b> and the lamp head assembly <b>22</b> can be adjusted upwards, downwards, leftwards, rightwards, to the upper left, to the lower left, to the upper right, to the lower right, etc.; similarly, the second rotating part <b>25</b> can drive the lamp head assembly to rotate around the horizontal arm <b>232</b> along any angle.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some examples, the base assembly <b>21</b> includes a drive power module and a touch panel; when the touch panel is touched, it transmits corresponding lamp control instructions to the drive power module through an interface; the drive power module is configured to have three light control circuits, and each light control circuit is configured to independently drive different LED chips. For example, in a sterilization scenario, if the user touches, for example, a word &#x201c;sterilization&#x201d; on the touch panel, the drive power module will drive a ultraviolet LED chip to emit ultraviolet light; in a plant growth assistance scenario, if the user touches, for example, a word &#x201c;plant&#x201d; on the touch panel, the drive power module will drive a plant grow light LED chip to emit plant grow light; in the reading and writing scenario, if the user touches, for example, words &#x201c;read/write&#x201d; on the touch panel, the drive power module will drive an illumination LED chip to emit light for illumination, for example, white light.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples, the multifunctional desk lamp further includes an electrical connecting part <b>26</b>, such as an electrical plug through which the desk lamp obtains electricity, and a switch or switches connected in series may be disposed between the electrical connecting part <b>26</b> and the other parts of the desk lamp as needed, so that it is convenient for the user to turn off or turn on the desk lamp.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The structure of the lamp head assembly <b>22</b> in an example is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, which includes a lamp cover <b>31</b>, a heat dissipation part <b>32</b>, a cover plate <b>33</b>, and a lens <b>34</b>, wherein the lamp cover <b>31</b> includes an accommodating space for accommodating the lamp head assembly <b>22</b>, the heat dissipation part <b>32</b> is arranged in the accommodating space of the lamp cover <b>31</b>, the cover plate <b>33</b> covers the lamp cover <b>31</b>, and the lens <b>34</b> is arranged on the cover plate <b>33</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Specifically speaking, the heat dissipation part <b>32</b> includes a ceramic radiator <b>321</b> and an aluminum radiator <b>322</b>; one side of the ceramic radiator <b>321</b> is for attaching to the light source assembly <b>35</b> and the other side thereof is connected with the aluminum radiator <b>322</b>. In one embodiment, the ceramic radiator <b>321</b> and the aluminum radiator <b>322</b> are connected by glue. Adopting both the ceramic radiator and the aluminum radiator leads to a good heat dissipation, insulation and corrosion resistance. Since the ceramic material is used, there is no need to re-applying acrylic oligomers coatings for insulation.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, the cover plate <b>33</b> and the lamp cover <b>31</b> are connected by buckles, and therefore, when in use, the cover plate <b>33</b> is pressed against the ceramic radiator <b>321</b>, and the lens <b>34</b> and the cover plate <b>31</b> are also connected by buckles. Adopting the buckles saves the cost of screws and other related materials, therefore avoids the process of locking screws and other related processes, and facilitates assembly and production.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The light source assembly <b>35</b> includes an ultraviolet LED chip <b>351</b>, a plant grow light LED chip <b>352</b> and an illumination LED chip <b>353</b>. The illumination LED chip <b>353</b> is configured to emit light for illumination, such as white light; the white light is a composite light, and is usually a mix of two colors of light or three colors of light, when the white light passes through a prism, since the refractive indexes of light of different wavelengths are different, the white light is divided into a variety of colors, when any two of the three primary colors are overlapped with each other, a secondary color will be generated, and three primary colors are mixed with each other to obtain the color white. The plant grow light LED chip <b>12</b> is configured to emit full-spectrum light and its waveband preferably includes a blue light waveband of 400-499 nm and a red light waveband of 600-699 nm, which are favorable to plant growth. The ultraviolet LED chip <b>13</b> is configured to emit ultraviolet light, and its preferred waveband is 315-400 nm.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some examples, the light source assembly <b>35</b> may be attached to a surface of the ceramic radiator <b>321</b> by means of mounting, or the LED chip may be packaged by chip-on-board (COB) packaging. It should be understood that, COB packaging is a packaging technology in which a bare chip is adhered to an interconnected substrate with a conductive or non-conductive adhesive and then the bare chip is subjected to wire bonding to achieve electrical connection, thereby avoiding direct exposure of the chip to the air and avoiding contamination or artificial damages that may destroy the chip's ability to function normally.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some examples, the cover plate <b>33</b> includes three light-transmitting areas respectively corresponding to the illumination LED chip, the plant grow light LED chip and the ultraviolet LED chip, to realize different applications. Specifically speaking, the lens <b>34</b> arranged on the cover plate is a Fresnel lens; the three light-transmitting areas of the cover plate include a hollow part <b>331</b> for transmission of the ultraviolet light, a bright surface lens <b>332</b> for transmission of the plant grow light, and the Fresnel lens <b>34</b> for transmission of the light for illumination.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Preferably, the light for illumination emitted by the illumination LED chip radiates outwards through the Fresnel lens, and the Fresnel lens shatters the rays of light originally emitted so that the shattered rays cover a desktop lighting range of the desk lamp with improved light intensity uniformity in the center and edges of the desktop lighting range. The plant grow light emitted by the plant grow light LED chip radiates outwards through the bright surface lens; the ultraviolet LED chip irradiates outwards directly through the hollow part on the cover plate <b>33</b> and does not irradiates through the lens; such arrangement increases the efficiency of the ultraviolet LED chip, and results in a better sterilization effect, while prevents the lens from being yellowed due to direct radiation by the ultraviolet light.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some examples, the desk lamp further includes a power adapter board <b>36</b> for adapting to power supplies, such as converting an AC supply (such as commercial power supply) to a DC low-voltage power supply (e.g., 5V, 3V, etc.) required to drive the LEDs.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In summary, the present disclosure provides a multifunctional light source assembly and a multifunctional desk lamp applying the same; the desk lamp head of the present disclosure is provided with an illumination chip, a plant grow light chip and an ultraviolet chip which are respectively connected to the controller, which respectively control the three chips through the on and off of currents so that functions such as illumination for reading and writing, ultraviolet sterilization, and plant growth assistance can be achieved. In addition, while the ultraviolet light is turned on for sterilization, the illumination light can also be turned on to serve as an indicating light, thereby enhancing the safety of the lamp; compared to traditional methods for heat dissipation, the heat dissipation method herein that adopts both aluminum and ceramic materials is more efficient, and has a better insulation effect and corrosion-resistance property, thereby improving the overall performance of the lamp. Therefore, the present disclosure effectively overcomes various shortcomings of the prior art and has a high industrial value.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The above embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles of the present disclosure and the effects, and are not intended to limit the present disclosure.
