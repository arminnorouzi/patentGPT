DC-DC converters may be used in a wide variety of applications, including portable electronic devices (such as cellular telephones, laptop computers, etc.) or automotive applications, for example, where a DC input voltage (from a battery, for example) is converted to a DC output voltage to power circuits. In some applications, multiple DC output voltages are needed for different circuits of a single device. Additionally, some applications have multiple DC input voltages, so the DC-DC converter may need to support operation with different DC input voltages.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Traditional DC-DC converters use analog control circuitry due to the control circuitry's simple implementation and efficiency. However, advancements in digital technology have led to digitally controlled DC-DC converters that offer high-speed operation with low power consumption.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a high-level view of a prior art digitally controlled DC-DC converter <b>100</b>. DC-DC converter <b>100</b> includes a digital pulse width modulator (DPWM) <b>105</b> that generates a stream of variable width pulses that drives a power stage of DC-DC converter <b>100</b> in order to obtain the desired DC output voltage. DPWM <b>105</b> changes the pulse widths of the pulses in the stream of variable width pulses to achieve the desired DC output voltage. The stream of variable width pulses is amplified by a power switching circuit <b>110</b>, while a filter <b>115</b> averages the amplified stream of variable width pulses to produce the DC output voltage V<sub>OUT</sub>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">An analog to digital converter (ADC) <b>120</b> converts a difference (an error) between the DC output voltage V<sub>OUT </sub>and the desired DC output voltage, and a compensator <b>125</b> generates adjustments (e.g., adjustments to the pulse widths) to the stream of variable width pulses to reduce the difference between the DC output voltage V<sub>OUT </sub>and the desired DC output voltage. Adjustments to the stream of variable width pulses may include changing pulse widths, the duration of the on and off periods of each pulse in the stream of variable width pulses, and so on. As an example, increasing the pulse width of a pulse will increase the DC output voltage V<sub>OUT</sub>, while decreasing the on period of a pulse will decrease the DC output voltage V<sub>OUT</sub>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a detailed view of a prior art DPWM <b>105</b>. DPWM <b>105</b> utilizes a hybrid technique for generating the stream of variable width pulses. DPWM <b>105</b> generates a stream of pulses with pulse widths that can adjusted. The discussion presented herein focuses on a single pulse to help prevent confusion. This single pulse will be referred to as a first pulse having a first pulse width. DPWM <b>105</b> generates a first pulse width that is generally close to the desired pulse width and then fine tunes the pulse width to more accurately match the desired pulse width. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, DPWM <b>105</b> includes a logic control circuit <b>205</b>, a coarse pulse width adjust circuit <b>210</b>, and a fine pulse width adjust circuit <b>212</b>. Logic control circuit <b>205</b> is configured to output a binary value based on the DC input voltage V<sub>IN</sub>, the binary value is also based on an error sign and an error magnitude (both produced by compensator <b>125</b>, for example). The binary value produced by logic control circuit <b>205</b> corresponds to a pulse width of individual pulses of the stream of variable width pulses, which may be based on the DC input voltage V<sub>IN</sub>, as well as error values generated by compensator <b>125</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Coarse pulse width adjust circuit <b>210</b> generates the first pulse width of the pulse, and includes a counter <b>214</b> and a digital comparator <b>216</b>. Counter <b>214</b> is configured to increment (or decrement) based on a clock signal of DC-DC converter <b>100</b>, and comparator <b>216</b> compares an output of counter <b>214</b> with a specified bit (or bits) of the binary value produced by logic control circuit <b>205</b>, with the specified bit corresponding to a falling edge of an individual pulse of the stream of variable width pulses. In general, the time between when counter <b>214</b> commences counting and the falling edge corresponds to the first pulse width of the pulse. As an example, the specified bit is a most significant bit (MSB) of the binary value produced by logic control circuit <b>205</b>. Coarse pulse width adjust circuit <b>210</b> may operates as follows:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0029">Rising edge of an individual pulse occurs when counter <b>214</b> commences, e.g., when counter <b>214</b> is reset (to zero, for example).

Fine pulse width adjust circuit <b>212</b> performs fine tuning on the first pulse width, and includes a digital delay line (DDL) <b>218</b>, a fine multiplexer <b>220</b>, and a register <b>222</b>. DDL <b>218</b> introduces delays to the rising and falling edge of the individual pulses produced by coarse pulse width adjust circuit <b>210</b>, allowing fine adjustments to the pulse width of the individual pulses. Fine pulse width adjust circuit <b>212</b> can introduce the same delay or different delays to the rising and falling edges of a single pulse. DDL <b>218</b> is implemented as a linear sequence of buffers, with each buffer introducing a delay proportional to the propagation delay of the buffer. Fine multiplexer <b>220</b> has multiple inputs with each input coupled to a buffer output of DDL <b>218</b>. Fine multiplexer <b>220</b> selects a particular delayed rising or falling edge of the individual pulse based on the binary value produced by logic control circuit <b>205</b>. The selection of fine multiplexer <b>220</b> is based on a least significant bit (LSB) of the binary value generated by logic control circuit <b>205</b>. Register <b>222</b>, which is implemented using S-R latches, for example, is set (outputting a high value) when counter <b>214</b> is reset and is reset (outputting a low value) when fine multiplexer <b>220</b> outputs a high value (which corresponds to a time that is a sum of the time of the falling edge produced by coarse pulse width adjust circuit <b>210</b> and the time delay introduced by DDL <b>218</b>) resetting register <b>222</b>. Hence, the pulse width of the individual pulse is a sum of the pulse width of the pulse generated by coarse pulse width adjust circuit <b>210</b> (COARSE T<sub>ON</sub>) and delay imparted upon the individual pulse by fine pulse width adjust circuit <b>212</b> (FINE T<sub>ON</sub>).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates a detailed view of a pulse <b>230</b> output by coarse pulse width adjust circuit <b>210</b>. Pulse <b>230</b> is an individual pulse of the stream of variable pulse pulses. Pulse <b>230</b> has a rising edge <b>235</b> that corresponds to when counter <b>214</b> is reset (trace <b>237</b> represents the value of counter <b>214</b>), which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> as occurring at time <b>239</b>. Pulse <b>230</b> also has a falling edge <b>241</b> located at time <b>243</b>, when the specified bit of counter <b>214</b> is equal to the specified bit of the binary value produced by logic control circuit <b>205</b>. Pulse <b>230</b> has a pulse width equal to COARSE T<sub>ON</sub>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates a detailed view of pulse <b>230</b> delayed by DDL <b>218</b> of fine pulse width adjust circuit <b>212</b>. Pulse <b>230</b> (output of comparator <b>216</b> of coarse pulse width adjust circuit <b>210</b>) is provided to DDL <b>218</b>. As discussed previously, DDL <b>218</b> comprises a linear sequence of delay elements (e.g., buffers), with each delay element introducing a delay proportional to the propagation delay of the delay element. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, a time <b>250</b> corresponds to a delay introduced by a first delay element of DDL <b>218</b>, a time <b>252</b> corresponds to a delay introduced by a second delay element of DDL <b>218</b>, a time <b>254</b> corresponds to a delay introduced by a third delay element of DDL <b>218</b>, a time <b>256</b> corresponds to a delay introduced by a fourth delay element of DDL <b>218</b>, and so on. Pulse <b>258</b> illustrates pulse <b>230</b> delayed by the first four delay elements of DDL <b>218</b>. The delay introduced by the delay elements is equal to N*T<sub>CLK</sub>=FINE T<sub>ON</sub>, where N is the number of delay elements and T<sub>CLK </sub>is the switching period of the clock of DC-DC converter <b>100</b>. Hence, it is possible to increase the pulse width of pulse <b>230</b> by utilizing the rising edge of pulse <b>230</b> and a falling edge of a delayed pulse (e.g., pulse <b>258</b>) to produce a pulse with pulse width approximately equal to COARSE T<sub>ON</sub>+N*T<sub>CLK</sub>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035">An issue that exists with the prior art DC-DC converter <b>100</b> is the power consumption associated with the circuitry providing the fine pulse width control, e.g., fine pulse width adjust circuit <b>212</b>. Individually, each delay element in the linear sequence of delay elements has relatively small power consumption. However, in situations where there may be several hundred delay elements (or more) in the linear sequence of delay elements, the total power consumption may be high. Furthermore, the linear sequence of delay elements is continually consuming power, even in situations where there is no need to adjust the pulse width.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0036">For discussion purposes, consider a situation where the prior art DC-DC converter <b>100</b> is a buck converter with the following parameters, which are determined from the requirements for the DC-DC converter:</p><p id="p-0035" num="0037">f<sub>SW</sub>=switching frequency;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0038">V<sub>IN</sub>=input voltage;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0039">V<sub>OUT</sub>=output voltage; and</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040">&#x394;V<sub>OUT</sub>=maximum change in the output voltage.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0000">While f<sub>CLK </sub>(the system clock frequency) directly depends on</p><p id="p-0040" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>n=V</i><sub>IN</sub><i>/&#x394;V</i><sub>OUT</sub>.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0041" num="0041">With consideration being given to the fact that V<sub>IN </sub>may cover a wide range of values, there is a tradeoff between the precision of DC-DC converter <b>100</b> and the power consumption of DC-DC converter <b>100</b>, where the precision of DC-DC converter <b>100</b> is a measure of how well the output voltage of DC-DC converter <b>100</b> matches up to the expected output voltage of DC-DC converter <b>100</b>.

As an example, consider a situation where it may be desirous to reduce power consumption (e.g., the battery voltage of the battery powered device is approaching a low voltage limit, or there is a desire to maximum available battery life), then the system clock frequency may be reduced to reduce overall power consumption. However, the output of the DC-DC converter may need to remain constant. If the system clock frequency is reduced beyond the point where the DC-DC converter is able to maintain the constant output, the DC-DC converter will be unable to keep meeting the precision requirements of the output signal. Therefore, there is a need for methods and apparatus for a DC-DC converter compatible with wide range system clock frequency.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0056">According to an example embodiment, methods and apparatus for a DC-DC converter compatible with wide range system clock frequency are provided. In an embodiment, a DC-DC converter with wide range control of the delay of the DDL of the DC-DC converter is provided. In an embodiment, circuits that tune the DDL in accordance with the system clock are provided. Given a system clock frequency for the DC-DC converter, the circuits tune the delay the DDL so that the output of the DC-DC converter remains able to meet a desired value, for example. The delay of the DDL of the DC-DC converter may be adjusted in a multi-phase process.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0057">As an example, a first phase of the multi-phase process includes setting the system clock frequency to a desired value, for example, to reduce power consumption and then adjusting the delay of the individual delay elements of the DDL by controlling the V<sub>CTRL </sub>to adjust the precision of the output of the DC-DC converter to meet the desired output precision requirements (i.e., the output is within a specified threshold of the desired output). The first phase may be considered to be a fine adjustment phase. Then, if the first phase is unable to adjust the DDL to the degree needed to have the DC-DC converter produce the output that meets the desired output precision requirements, a second phase that includes changing the number of enabled delay elements in the DDL to adjust the delay of the DDL is performed. Changing the number of enabled delay elements in the DDL results in more dramatic changes in the delay of the DDL. The second phase may be considered to be a coarse adjustment phase. After performing the second phase, the first phase may be repeated to further fine tune the delay of the DDL (with the newly adjusted number of delay elements) in accordance with V<sub>CTRL</sub>. It may be necessary to perform several iterations of the first phase and the second phase before the DC-DC converter is able to produce an output that is in accordance with the output precision requirements.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0058">In an embodiment, the second phase is performed prior to the first phase. In this embodiment, the number of enabled delay elements of the DDL is changed until the output of the DC-DC converter is close to the desired output, although in some situations, it may be possible to have the output of the DC-DC converter meeting the desired output by changing the number of enabled delay elements. The closeness may be determined by comparing a difference between the output and the desired output with another threshold, where this threshold may be less stringent than the previous threshold. Once the output of the DC-DC converter is sufficiently close to the desired output, the first phase is performed. In the first phase, the delay of the individual enabled delay elements is changed by changing V<sub>CTRL </sub>until the phase error meets the phase error threshold and the T<sub>ON </sub>reaches the value fixed by the control loop, for example. It may be necessary to perform several iterations of the second phase and the first phase before the above occurs.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0059">In an embodiment, during the development, manufacture, or testing of the DC-DC converter, the number of enabled delay elements of the DDL is determined for a variety of different system clock frequencies and stored in a memory. This information may then be retrieved, based on the system clock frequency of the DC-DC converter, on an as needed basis to serve as a starting point in the tuning of the delay of the DDL. Then, the first phase is performed if needed. In general, the retrieval of the information from memory instead of performing the first phase may result in a reduction of the time associated with tuning the delay of the DDL. If the first phase is also unable to adjust the delay of the DDL so the DC-DC converter produces an output that does not have the required precision, the second phase is performed, followed by the first phase. It may be necessary to perform several iterations of the second phase and the first phase before the DC-DC converter is able to produce an output that is sufficiently close to the desired output. In general, a maximum number of iterations may be equal to the delay elements of the DDL, as an example, the DDL has 128 delay elements, then the maximum number of iteration is 128, and in each iteration, a single delay element of the DDL is disabled. As an illustrative example, if the DC-DC converter is designed to operate with a system clock frequency range of 10 MHz to 100 MHz, the memory may store the number of enabled delay elements for system clock frequencies of 10 MHz, 30 MHz, 50 MHz, 70 MHz, and 90 MHz. Other system clock frequency points, as well as different numbers of points, may be used.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0060">However, simply adjusting the delay of the DDL may be insufficient to achieve good performance for the DC-DC converter. A metric may be used to determine if adequate performance has been achieved. As an example, a phase error may be present between the system clock of the DC-DC converter and the selected output of phase multiplexer <b>515</b>. Excessive phase error may lead to poor performance, as well as lead to non-linear behavior to the control loop. Hence, the phase error between the system clock and the selected output of phase multiplexer <b>515</b> is used to measure the performance of the DC-DC converter, by determining if the number of enabled delay elements in the DDL is correct, for example.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0061">In an embodiment, the delay of the DDL may be adjusted in the first phase by adjusting the delay of the individual delay elements of the DDL. The delay of the individual delay elements of the DDL may be adjusted by changing the voltage (e.g., V<sub>CTRL</sub>) provided to the individual delay elements of the DDL. As an example, increasing the voltage provided to the delay elements of the DDL increases the current, resulting in a decrease in the delay associated with each of the delay elements of the DDL. Therefore, the overall delay introduced by the DDL is decreased. As another example, decreasing the voltage provided to the delay elements of the DDL decreases the current, resulting in an increase in the delay associated with each of the delay elements of the DDL. Therefore, the overall delay introduced by the DDL is increased.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0062">In an embodiment, the delay of the DDL may be adjusted in the second phase by enabling or disabling the various delay elements of the DDL. As an example, enabling one or more delay elements (in addition to the delay elements currently enabled) increases the delay of the DDL. Conversely, disabling one or more delay elements (from those delay elements that are enabled) decreases the delay of the DDL. In an embodiment, each individual delay element of the DDL may be disabled or enabled. In another embodiment, groups of delay elements of the DDL may be collectively disabled or enabled. As an example, groups of 2, 4, 8, 16, etc., delay elements of the DDL may be collectively disabled or enabled.

The change in the system clock frequency of the DC-DC converter may be detected when a mode of the DC-DC converter changes, for example. As another example, the change in the system clock frequency of the DC-DC converter is detected when an instruction to change the system clock frequency is executed.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0091">All delay elements of the DDL of the DC-DC converter are enabled (block <b>907</b>). By enabling all of the delay elements, the delay of the DDL is maximized for the given clock frequency. As an illustrative example, the enabling of all of the delay elements may be achieved by configuring the phase multiplexer to select the output of the last delay element (or the last selectable delay element in the situation where not every delay element is individually selectable) of the DDL, thereby selecting the maximum delay imparted onto the pulse generated by the coarse pulse width adjust circuit. Alternatively, none of the delay elements of the DDL of the DC-DC converter are enabled. By disabling all of the delay elements, the delay of the DDL is minimized for the given clock frequency. As an illustrative example, the disabling of all of the delay elements may be achieved by configuring the phase multiplexer to select the input of the first delay element (or the first selectable delay element in the situation where not every delay element is individually selectable) of the DDL, thereby selecting the minimum delay imparted onto the pulse generated by the coarse pulse width adjust circuit. Alternatively, a fraction (e.g., &#xbd;, &#x2153;, &#xbc;, &#x2155;, &#x2159;, etc.) of the delay elements of the DDL are enabled, with the remainder disabled. Other fractions are possible. The phase error between the system clock and the output of the selected delay element of the DDL of the DC-DC converter is measured (block <b>909</b>). As an example, the coarse phase detector is used to generate the phase error.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0092">A check is performed to determine if the phase error meets the phase error threshold (block <b>911</b>). The phase error, as generated by the coarse phase error detector is compared with the phase error threshold. If the phase error is less than (or less than and equal to) the phase error threshold, the phase error may be said to have met the phase error threshold, for example. If the phase error is not less than the phase error threshold, the phase error is said to have not met the phase error threshold, for example.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0093">If the phase error does not meet the phase error threshold, another check is performed to determine if the voltage V<sub>CTRL </sub>has met a voltage threshold (block <b>913</b>). The voltage threshold may be a maximum voltage threshold, a minimum voltage threshold, or both a maximum and minimum voltage threshold. If the voltage V<sub>CTRL </sub>has not met the voltage threshold, the voltage V<sub>CTRL </sub>is changed (block <b>915</b>) and logic control circuit <b>505</b> returns to block <b>909</b> to measure the phase error. The voltage V<sub>CTRL </sub>may be increased or decreased in accordance with the value of the phase error (e.g., if the phase error is negative or positive), for example. As an example, if the phase error is negative, the control voltage V<sub>CTRL </sub>is increased, while if the phase error is positive, the control voltage V<sub>CTRL </sub>is decreased. Alternative mappings are possible. In an embodiment, the amount of change in the voltage V<sub>CTRL </sub>is based on the magnitude of the phase error. As an example, if the magnitude of the phase error is large, the amount of change in the voltage V<sub>CTRL </sub>is also large. Conversely, if the magnitude of the phase error is small, the amount of change in the voltage V<sub>CTRL </sub>is also small.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0094">If the voltage V<sub>CTRL </sub>meets the voltage threshold, the voltage V<sub>CTRL </sub>has met its minimum or maximum threshold and can no longer be changed, hence it may be necessary to change the number of enabled delay elements of the DDL. In such a situation, the select lines for the multiplexers are changed (block <b>917</b>). For example, multiplexer selector line <b>513</b> to phase multiplexer <b>515</b> may be changed to reflect the decreased or increased number of enabled delay elements. As an illustrative example, the disabling or enabling of one or more delay elements of the DDL may be achieved by configuring multiplexer selector line <b>513</b> of phase multiplexer <b>515</b> to select the output of a shorter or longer sequence of delay elements, as well as the LSB output of logic control circuit <b>505</b> to fine adjust selector <b>509</b> and fine multiplexer <b>220</b>, thereby selecting a smaller or larger delay on the pulse generated by the coarse pulse width adjust circuit. The delay is changed by disabling or enabling one or more delay elements of the DDL (block <b>919</b>). Decreasing the delay results in a shortening of the pulse width. Increasing the delay results in the lengthening of the pulse width. As discussed previously, the decreasing or increasing of the number of enabled delay elements may be on a single delay element basis (where individual delay elements may be disabled or enabled at a time) or a group basis (where a group of two or more delay elements may be disabled or enabled at a time). In an embodiment, the disabled delay elements may also be deactivated during block <b>919</b>.
