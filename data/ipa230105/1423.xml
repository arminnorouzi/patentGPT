The first formation fracturing operation was done in 1947 with silica sand as the proppant. Since then, many materials have been used as proppants including walnut hulls, natural sand, glass, resin coated sand, sintered bauxite and kaolin, and fused zirconia. Today, fracking is used in approximately 95 percent of oil and gas wells in the United States, and sand and ceramic proppants are the two most common proppants used.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, Frac sand is not used as mined without processing. Sand processing includes mining sand deposits, crushing, washing/cleaning, drying, and sizing the sand grains. The size range of proppant is an important consideration for the frac plan. Proppant sizes are generally between 8 and 140 mesh (2.38 mm and 0.105 mm). The mesh size is the number of openings across one linear inch of screen. When describing the size of the proppant, the proppant is typically referred to as simply the sieve cut. For example, 16/30 mesh is 1.19 mm to 0.595 mm.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Proppant processing and particularly sizing and screening of the proppant conventionally occurs at a proppant facility, such as sand plant. The processing plant is usually a significant distance from the wellsite, such that the processed proppant must be delivered or shipped by wheeled vehicle to the wellsite. In other words, conventionally, proppant is processed, including screened for size, and packaged at the distant proppant facility for delivery to the wellsite or well staging area. Depending on how the proppant is transported to the wellsite (e.g., open rail car or open trailer) and how the proppant is stored at the at the wellsite (e.g., unprotected piles) and other factors, the proppant may be or may become contaminated as to size range, proppant contaminants, such as debris, and otherwise. Any one of these can compromise the blending equipment, compromise the performance of the frac fluid, and/or compromise the production performance of the well. Further, as multiple horizontal runs are created from one wellsite or wellbore, changes to the frac plan between horizontal runs, and even within a single horizontal run, may require resizing of the proppant, which may require time consuming conventional delivery of alternately sized proppant to the wellsite or staging area.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also, because the cost of conventional transportation or shipment is related to the weight of the cargo, the proppant (e.g., sand) is dried at the proppant facility in furnaces to remove water content and thereby reduce shipping weight and costs. The drying process is the bottleneck of the frac sand production process and burns fossil fuel (natural gas, propane, etc.) at high rates to complete the drying process. It is well documented that hydrocarbon fired furnaces for drying proppant to reduce its shipping costs consumes large amounts of energy and creates a large and undesirable carbon footprint. The drying process is estimated to create 17-38 tons of CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions per 1,000 dried tons depending on the drying process and fuel type. Drying accounts for 50% or more of frac sand production costs.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The inventions disclosed and enabled herein address one or more of the issues discussed above and eliminate the need to store proppant at the wellsite or staging area in a contamination-proof manner, reduce the carbon footprint of fracing by reducing or eliminating the need to dry proppant, facilitate the use of wet or dry proppant at the wellsite, wet screening of the proppant for size debris removal, any one of which may reduce the total cost to the end user and the environment.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTIONS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">One of the many possible summaries of our inventions is a mobile system for wet screening of proppant at a wellsite, comprising a trailer suitable for towing upon roadways to the wellsite, the trailer having an inclined rail system extending upward and away from a trailer deck at one end toward a second end at a predetermined height above the trailer deck. A wet screening component may comprise a support structure having a rail system on a lower surface thereof and structured for sliding engagement with the trailer rail system. The wet screening component may further comprise a proppant screening assembly having an inlet area, a discharge area, and a screen having a plurality of openings of predetermined size and shape through which fluid and proppant smaller than a first size may pass, and which prevents particles larger than the first size from passing through the openings. A proppant feed box having an opening through which proppant can be received and an inlet through which fluid can be received for creating a proppant slurry in the feed box. A proppant slurry discharge disposed above the inlet area, and the proppant feed box separate from and not coupled to the proppant screening assembly. At least one fluid spray system disposed above the screen to supply fluid to the screen to facilitate wet screening of proppant. A frac slurry collection bin disposed relative to the screen to collect a frac slurry of proppant and fluid that has passed through the screen and having a collection bin outlet for discharging the frac slurry from the collection bin. Wherein the wet screening component is located along the rails in a transportation position establishing a minimum overall height of the wet screening component from the trailer deck and wherein the wet screening component is moved along the rails to an operating position establishing a predetermined height of the bin outlet from the trailer deck. A frac slurry conduit coupled to the collection bin outlet when the wet screening component is in the operating position and which passes frac slurry from the collection bin to a frac fluid blending system.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Systems utilizing our inventions may comprise a proppant supply system that delivers a predetermined rate of proppant to the proppant feed box. The proppant supply system may comprise a belt conveyor. Systems may comprise a conveyor loading system configured to receive bulk proppant and to supply a measured amount of proppant to a first end of the belt conveyor system. The conveyor loading system may comprise a load sensor for determining an amount of proppant delivered to the belt conveyor and a proppant moisture sensor. The wet screening component may be winched along the rail system from the transportation position to the operating position. Systems may further comprise a fluid supply system communicating with the fluid inlet on the proppant feed box. The fluid supply system may comprise a fluid pump and a fluid flow meter. Substantially all of the fluid introduced to the vibratory screening assembly through the proppant feed box and the at least one spray bar is discharged from the bin outlet. Systems may comprise a frac slurry pump for pumping the frac slurry from the collection bin outlet to the frac fluid blending system. The frac slurry conduit may be connected to the inlet of the frac slurry pump. Systems may comprise a controller operatively coupled to the proppant supply system so that a predetermined rate of proppant is delivered to the proppant feed box. The screen of the wet screening component may be leveled when the wet screening component is in the operation position. Systems may comprise a plurality of adjustable legs extending from the support structure to the ground for leveling the screen. The screen openings may be 3 mm by 3 mm square openings.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another one of the many possible summaries of our inventions is a method of creating a frac slurry of proppant screened for size and debris comprising placing the trailer immediately adjacent a wellhead, moving the wet screening component to the operating position, supplying a predetermined rate of water to the proppant feed box, collecting the water in the collection bin, passing the water through the bin outlet to the frac fluid blending system, supplying a predetermined rate of proppant to the proppant feed box while water is being supplied to the proppant feed box, depositing a proppant slurry on the screen, separating oversized particles from proppant slurry, collecting the frac slurry of water and proppant screened for size and debris in the collection box; and passing the frac slurry through the bin outlet to the frac fluid blending system to create a frac fluid for the formation associated with the wellhead. The predetermined rate of water may be between 12 bbl/min and 119 bbl/min. The predetermined rate of water may be between greater than 50 bbl/min. The frac slurry has a proppant component of between 3 lbs/gallon and 6 lbs/gallon. No wastewater is produced by the methods.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">None of these brief summaries of the inventions is intended to limit or otherwise affect the scope of the appended claims, and nothing stated in this Brief Summary of the Invention is intended as a definition of a claim term or phrase or as a disavowal or disclaimer of claim scope.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0008" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The following figures form part of the specification and are included to illustrate certain aspects of the present inventions other than with words.

Our inventions are especially useful at those fields or basins where proppant is stored in exposed conditions, such as an exposed pile, where foreign particles, such as gravel or dirt, can contaminate the proppant, and is also useful when proppant is delivered or stored in unexposed tote bags or trucks. Our inventions also are useful in those fields or basins that use locally sourced proppant, such as as-mined sand, which can be delivered to the wellsite with little to no processing at a proppant facility prior to delivery. For example, our inventions can use &#x201c;dry&#x201d; proppant (i.e., less than about 1% water by weight) or &#x201c;wet&#x201d; proppant (i.e., greater than about 1% water by weight). Our inventions also facilitate the use of non-specialized bulk material transports, such as dump trucks, end dumps and belly dumps. Our inventions are environmentally friendly in that all water introduced into our systems may be, if desired transferred to a frac fluid blending system for ultimate injection into the well. No wastewater need be produced. Our inventions also are useful in those basins or well sites where the frac plan is subject to modification or change during a frac job. Other benefits of our inventions will become apparent to those of skill in the art by reading this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The wellsite wet screening systems taught herein are for use immediately adjacent the well that is to be frac'ed. By &#x201c;immediately adjacent,&#x201d; we mean that the wet screening system is physically located near the wellhead such that the wet screened proppant from the wet screening system can be directly, such as immediately, supplied to the frac fluid blending system or truck during the wet screening process. As a non-limiting example of a wellsite wet screening system being immediately adjacent a land-based wellhead is when the proppant slurry collection bin discharge is within 250 feet of the wellhead.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some of the many possible embodiments of our inventions, it is contemplated that the proppant, whether sand, coated sand, ceramic, or otherwise, for a particular well, may be loaded into an inlet hopper, mixed with water, and delivered to a vibrationary screening assembly. In other of the many possible embodiments of our inventions, it is contemplated that the proppant, whether sand, coated sand, ceramic, or otherwise, for a particular well, may be loaded on to a conveyor for transport to an inlet hopper, mixed with water and delivered to a vibrationary screening assembly. In still other of the many possible embodiments of our inventions, it is contemplated that the proppant, whether sand, coated sand, ceramic, or otherwise, for a particular well, may be loaded into a load hopper by a material handler, such as a frontend loader, and then deposited, such as by metering, on to a conveyor for transport to an inlet hopper, mixed with water and delivered to a vibrationary screening assembly.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Our inventions utilize a vibratory screening assembly to wet screen the proppant so that proppant smaller than a predetermined size and/or shape (determined by the screen) passes through the screen and falls into an enclosed area or bin. Fluid, preferably fresh water or produced water, may be used with the screening operation to wet screen the proppant. Fluid also may be used in a feed box associated with the screening structure to efficiently transfer the proppant into the vibratory screening assembly. In operation, the water falls through the screen along with the properly sized proppant into the enclosed area. Oversized proppant and contaminates exit the screener, such as at one end, and do not pass through the screen. Gravity or a slurry pump, or both, may be used to feed the screened proppant slurry from the enclosed bin frac fluid blending system for finalization of the frac fluid prior to injection. The amount of fluid added to the vibratory screening assembly may be metered and/or controlled so that the amount of proppant and fluid delivered to the frac fluid blending system is known and/or controlled. It also is contemplated that one or more chemicals may be introduced with the fluid supplied for wet screening.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As mentioned, a proppant conveyor system may be used to feed the vibratory screening assembly, and if used, is preferably a load hopper and belt conveyor system with a weight transducer, such as a belt scale, to determine the amount (e.g., weight) of proppant conveyed and to determine the rate (e.g., lbs/hour) of proppant added to the vibratory screening assembly. Preferably, one or more variable frequency drive AC motors are used to power and provide control of the amount of proppant supplied.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The vibratory screening assembly system preferably has an inlet hopper that the main conveyor, if used, dumps proppant into. The inlet hopper also may include a controllable feed system to add proppant to the sizing screen at controlled/controllable rates and patterns. Preferably, however, we contemplate that the inlet hopper simply passes the proppant slurry to the screen without controlling the feed rate. It is preferred that the system that loads proppant onto the main belt conveyor controls the amount of proppant delivered to the screen.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">We contemplate proppant feed rates into the inlet hopper for embodiments of our inventions of between about 5 ton/hr and about 1,500 ton/hr, and preferably between about 100 ton/hour and about 800 ton/hour. We contemplate fluid flow rates into the vibratory screening assembly of between about 500 gal/min (12 bbl/min) to about 5000 gal/min (119 bbl/min), and preferably between about 24 bbl/min (1,000 gal/min) and about 100 bbl/min (4,200 gal/min). It is preferred that embodiments of the inventions disclosed herein provide a proppant slurry to the frac fluid blender system in amounts ranging between about 0.3 lbs of proppant per gallon of water (i.e., about 8.6 lbs/gal) to about 12 lbs of proppant per gallon of water (i.e., about 20.3 lbs/gallon), and preferably between about 1 lbs proppant/gallon of water and about 10 lbs proppant/gallon water.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Preferred embodiments of our inventions are modular and mobile so that the wellsite wet screening system can be relocated easily to different well sites. In mobile embodiments, the screen system is preferably sized and constructed so that it can be hauled on and operated from a highway vehicle or tractor trailer without oversize permits or height issues. Additionally, our wellsite wet screening system inventions may be used offshore, for example on a frac boat, as enabled herein.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Turning now to a first embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates perspective view of a wet screening system <b>100</b> according to our inventions, comprising a wet screening component <b>102</b> and a proppant supply component <b>104</b>.

The vibratory screening assembly <b>106</b> may be coupled to an upper surface of the platform <b>108</b>, preferably with vibration isolating mounts.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The inlet hopper <b>110</b> may comprise an inlet or opening <b>124</b> sized and arranged to receive material, such as proppant, from a conveyor <b>122</b> or other material delivery system. The inlet hopper <b>110</b> further comprises a water inlet <b>126</b>, such as a conduit flange, for receiving a flow of water into the hopper <b>110</b>. The inlet hopper <b>110</b> comprises a discharge port <b>128</b> sized and arranged to deliver a slurry of proppant and water from the inlet hopper <b>110</b> to the inlet of the vibratory screening assembly <b>106</b>. It is preferred that the volume of the discharge port <b>128</b> be less than the volume of the hopper <b>110</b> generally so that the hopper <b>110</b> provides a retention time for the incoming proppant and water before being discharged to the vibratory screening assembly <b>106</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the inlet hopper <b>110</b> may be supported above the vibratory screening assembly <b>106</b> inlet by a frame or support structure <b>130</b> coupled to the platform <b>108</b>. It is preferred, but not required, that the inlet hopper frame <b>130</b> not be coupled to or contact the vibratory screening assembly <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The platform support frame <b>112</b> may be fabricated from structural members, such as steel beams, arranged and configured to carry the weight and operation of the wet screening component <b>102</b>. Within the support frame <b>112</b> and preferably below the underside of the platform <b>108</b>, is the frac slurry collection bin <b>114</b>, which is sized and configured to receive the proppant slurry from the vibrating screen <b>118</b>. For purposes of this disclosure, the slurry of proppant and water that pass through the screen or sieve <b>118</b> into the collection bin <b>114</b> will be referred as the &#x201c;frac slurry&#x201d; in contradistinction to the &#x201c;proppant slurry&#x201d; that is discharged <b>128</b> from the inlet hopper <b>110</b> onto the vibrating screen <b>118</b>. The collection bin <b>114</b> may comprise one or more outlets <b>132</b>, such as conduit flanges, through which the frac slurry may pass.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is preferred that a flexible, semi-rigid or rigid frac slurry conduit <b>134</b> be coupled, including removably coupled, to the bin outlet <b>132</b> for delivery of the frac slurry to a frac fluid blending system (not shown). The outlet may have a diameter of about 14 inches or so. It will be understood that there are a variety of frac fluid blending systems of various designs that are used in the oil fields, and that the location and height of the proppant inlet portion of the blending truck may vary. Thus, for the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the height of the bin outlet <b>132</b> may be adjusted by changing the height of the hopper support frame <b>126</b>, such as through adjustable length supports. Further, it is preferred that the adjustable length supports allow for leveling of the wet screening component <b>102</b>. It will be appreciated that the efficiency of the proppant screening process is directly affected by the levelness of the screen <b>118</b>. As the levelness increases, the screening efficiency also increases. It should be noted that the system is operable at less than truly level conditions.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the wet screening system <b>100</b> comprises a proppant supply component <b>104</b>, which may comprise any of a number of material supply systems, such as belt conveyor <b>122</b> having a conveyor drive assembly <b>136</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the drive assembly may be a simple constant speed AC motor. Alternately, the drive assembly may comprise an AC motor and variable frequency drive for controllably delivering proppant to the inlet <b>124</b> in the hopper <b>110</b>. In this particular embodiment, the belt conveyor <b>122</b> has a conveyor inlet <b>138</b> into which a controlled amount of proppant can be deposited for conveyance to the inlet hopper <b>110</b>. For example and not limitation, a front-end loader, proppant box, proppant tote, or other material handling equipment may dump proppant into the conveyor inlet <b>138</b>. As illustrated, the proppant supply component <b>104</b> is preferably trailerable to the well site, and it is preferred that proppant be supplied to the feed inlet hopper <b>110</b> at a rate ranging between about 100 ton/hour to about 700 ton/hour.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a plan view of the wet screening system <b>100</b>.

Water supply conduit <b>202</b> is shown supplying water to water inlet <b>126</b> through rigid and flexible conduits. The water and proppant <b>200</b> mix in the hopper <b>110</b>, and that proppant slurry is delivered to the vibratory screen assembly <b>118</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows optional water spray bars or water spray heads <b>204</b> that add water to the proppant slurry on the vibratory screen assembly <b>118</b> to improve the efficiency of vibratory screening and/or increase the screening throughput rate as compared to dry screening. The spray bars may comprise simple holes or holes with conical splash plates to create a more spray like distribution or dedicated spray nozzles. Preferably, the spray bars or spray heads are not rigidly mounted to the vibratory screening assembly <b>106</b>. As is known, oversized particles <b>206</b> in the proppant slurry cannot pass through the sized openings in the screen <b>118</b> and are moved to the discharge area of the vibratory screening assembly <b>106</b> for removal from the system <b>102</b>. A discharge chute <b>208</b> may be attached at the discharge area to funnel or direct the oversized particles exiting the vibratory screening assembly <b>106</b> to a particular location.

This embodiment utilizes the wet screening component <b>102</b> and the proppant supply component <b>104</b> previously described with certain modifications and additions. First, the wet screening component <b>102</b> is mounted on a tractor trailer or truck chassis <b>302</b> so that it is mobile and transportable to other wellsites as needed or desired. In this first alternate embodiment <b>300</b>, the wet screening component <b>102</b> is rigidly mounted to the trailer/chassis <b>302</b> for transportation to the wellsite. Those of skill will understand that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> do not necessarily illustrate the preferred location on the trailer <b>302</b> for the rigidly mounted wet screening component <b>102</b>. Once at the wellsite, the wet screening component may be unsecured from the trailer or chassis so that the wet screening component <b>102</b> may be leveled by extending leveling legs (preferably 4) to the ground and adjusting the height thereof. In this embodiment <b>300</b>, it is preferred that all plumbing, power, and data connections to the wet screening component <b>102</b>, the proppant supply component <b>104</b>, and other equipment may be uncoupled at each of those components to aid mobility, make-up and tear-down.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">For example, the support structure <b>112</b> may have rigid piping coupled thereto with flanges, such as quick connect flanges, at each end.

Once the wet screening system <b>102</b> is properly positioned at the wellsite, the rigid piping on the support structure <b>112</b> and the vibratory screen assembly <b>106</b> may be coupled with flexible conduit to prevent damage caused by vibrations of the system. The support structure <b>112</b> piping may be coupled to a water supply pump <b>310</b> with rigid, flexible, or a combination of rigid and flexible piping.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> show a loading hopper system <b>308</b> that may be used to load proppant <b>200</b> onto the belt conveyor <b>122</b>.

These figures illustrate that the load hopper <b>308</b> can discharge onto a small conveyor <b>322</b> that deposits the proppant onto the conveyor inlet <b>138</b>. It is preferred that the secondary conveyor <b>322</b> is driven by an AC motor with speed control, such as a variable frequency drive. In this preferred embodiment, the primary conveyor <b>122</b> comprises a load transducer associated with the belt to determine, relatively or absolutely, the weight of proppant (including any moisture) transferred by the load hopper <b>318</b> and conveyor <b>322</b> to the primary conveyor <b>122</b>. The speed of the of the secondary conveyor <b>322</b> can be adjusted to control the amount of proppant delivered to the inlet hopper <b>114</b>.

Preferably the water supply system comprises a fluid meter <b>316</b>, such as flow rate meter (e.g., volumetric or mass). Although the fluid meter <b>316</b> is illustrated adjacent the pump <b>310</b>, it may be located elsewhere in the fluid supply path, such as mounted to the platform support <b>112</b>. Typically, the pump <b>310</b> will draw water from a tank or pond, or storage containers suitable for the fracing operations. As discussed above, it is preferred that the fluid supply <b>310</b> be configured to supply fluid for wet screening at flow rates of between about 1,000 gal/min to about 2,000 gal/min.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> also shows that the mobile wet screening system <b>300</b> (or any embodiment of our inventions) may comprise a centralized power system <b>324</b> for distributing power to the wet screening component <b>102</b>, the proppant supply component <b>104</b>. In addition to the power system <b>324</b>, this embodiment preferably comprises a controller <b>326</b> arranged and structured to acquire data and generate control signals for various components.

It is preferred that system <b>100</b> comprise a moisture sensor to determine the moisture content of the proppant for weight determination purposes. It is preferred that the load hopper <b>308</b> comprise a moisture sensor, such as near infra-red moisture sensor or radio frequency moisture sensor to aid the determination of the amount of proppant delivered to the inlet hopper <b>114</b>.

The prototype system had a 7&#x2032; by 14&#x2032; vibratory screen with 3-millimeter square openings therein. The minimum water input was 50 bbl/min, and the system was operated with about 53 bbl/min of water. The total water consumed by the prototype system and frac fluid blending system was about 70 bbl/min total, meaning that the blending system added about 17 bbl/min of water. The loading hopper conveyor utilized a variable frequency drive AC motor, and the speed was adjusted/controlled to deliver the correct amount of proppant (up to about 1,000 tons per hour) to the main belt conveyor based on the pump schedule. The main belt conveyor delivered the proppant to the inlet hopper or feedbox of the wet screening component. The proppant was mixed with water and discharged to the screen. Spray bars added water to help move the proppant through the screen into the collection bin. Oversized debris, including oversized proppant was discharged from the screen and collected. The prototype was configured such that gravity would feed the frac slurry from the bin to the frac fluid blending system at a feed rate of about 5+ lbs of proppant per gallon of water.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The start up of this prototype system comprised starting water flow to the system by energizing the fluid supply system and setting the flow rate to about 53 bbl/min. The system passed this water to the frac fluid blending system for use in pressure fracing the well, although no well was frac'ed during this prototype run. Once the system was operating in a steady state with no proppant, the load hopper began to discharge proppant to the secondary conveyor for delivery to the primary conveyor. The weight sensor in the primary conveyor was used to adjust the proppant delivery to the primary conveyor so that the appropriate amount of proppant was delivered to the inlet hopper. The prototype was operated in this manner and the frac slurry captured by the collection bin was fed directly to the frac fluid blending system.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">For those embodiments that use a controller, one of many possible algorithms comprises 1) dynamically controlling an amount of water supplied to the system; 2) determining a moisture content of proppant that will be supplied to the system; 3) determining a normalized weight of proppant, based on the determined moisture content, delivered to the inlet hopper; 4) adjusting the amount of proppant delivered to the inlet hopper to a predetermined amount or range of amounts; and, optionally, 5) determining a density of the frac slurry exiting the collection bin.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">An example job based on the performance of the prototype discussed above is presented below. This example assumes a 2 well pad requiring 30,000 tons total of dry sand, with 1,000 tons of pumped per day.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Utilizing</entry><entry>Utilizing</entry><entry>Utilizing</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Embodiment</entry><entry>Embodiment</entry><entry>Conventional</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>According to the</entry><entry>According to the</entry><entry>Equipment </entry></row><row><entry/><entry>disclosed</entry><entry>disclosed</entry><entry>and</entry></row><row><entry>Item</entry><entry>Inventions</entry><entry>Inventions</entry><entry>Processes</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Proppant Cost, dry</entry><entry>n/a</entry><entry>$30</entry><entry>$30</entry></row><row><entry>($/ton)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Proppant Cost, wet</entry><entry>~$15</entry><entry>n/a</entry><entry>n/a</entry></row><row><entry>($/ton)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>TransportCost</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2009;$9</entry><entry>$9</entry><entry>$30</entry></row><row><entry>($/ton)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Wellsite Service</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2009;$15</entry><entry>$15</entry><entry>Included in</entry></row><row><entry>($/ton)</entry><entry/><entry/><entry>Transport Cost</entry></row><row><entry>Total per ton ($)</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2009;$39</entry><entry>$54</entry><entry>$60</entry></row><row><entry>Total Proppant Cost</entry><entry>&#x2009;&#x2009;$1,170,000</entry><entry>$1,620,000</entry><entry>$1,800,000</entry></row><row><entry>($)</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">Other and further embodiments utilizing one or more aspects of the inventions described above can be devised without departing from the spirit of Applicant's invention.
