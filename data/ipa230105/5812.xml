For example, the manufacturing apparatus uses vapor deposition, sputtering, or CVD to form a copper (Cu) film on the bottom surface <b>11</b><i>a </i>side of the semiconductor substrate <b>11</b>. Next, the manufacturing apparatus uses photolithography to form a resist pattern with a predetermined shape on the Cu film. Next, the manufacturing apparatus, using the resist pattern as a mask, etches the Cu film. As a result, the manufacturing apparatus forms the first electrodes <b>12</b> from the Cu film.

In other words, a typical resin has a higher coefficient of linear expansion than an adhesive base material or a device, and therefore expands/contracts and undergoes changes in elastic modulus in accordance with temperature.
