from Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation), 765 g of epichlorohydrin (5.0 equivalents per equivalent of hydroxy groups of tetramethylbiphenol), and 183 g of 1-butanol (1-butanol: 0.3 mol times the amount of epichlorohydrin) were placed. The temperature was increased to 40&#xb0; C. to uniformly dissolve the mixture. Thereafter, 158 g (1.15 equivalents per equivalent of hydroxy groups of tetramethylbiphenol) of a 48.5 wt % aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide was added dropwise over a period of 90 minutes. Simultaneously with the dropwise addition, the temperature was increased from 40&#xb0; C. to 65&#xb0; C. over 90 minutes. Thereafter, the mixture was maintained at 65&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes to complete the reaction. The reaction solution was transferred to a 5-L separating funnel. To the funnel, 500 g of warm water having a temperature of 65&#xb0; C. was added, thereby cooling the mixture to 65&#xb0; C. The mixture was allowed to stand for 1 hour. After the standing, the aqueous layer was drained from the separated oil and water layers to remove by-product salts and excess sodium hydroxide. Then, epichlorohydrin was completely removed under reduced pressure at 150&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0216">After that, 434 g of methyl isobutyl ketone was added thereto (epoxy resin concentration: 40% by weight).

Then, 6.2 g (the amount of NaOH based on the epoxy resin was 1.0% by weight) of a 48.5 wt % aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide was added thereto. The reaction was conducted for 60 minutes. The mixture was washed with 400 g of water four times. Then, methyl isobutyl ketone was completely removed under reduced pressure at 150&#xb0; C. to give an epoxy resin composition (AII-1) of Example 1.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0217">Table 3 presents the
