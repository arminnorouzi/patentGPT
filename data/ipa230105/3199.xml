id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">Systems and methods for generating electrical power in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) operation include one or more heat exchangers incorporated into mobile heat generation units, and which will receive a heated fluid flow from one or more heat sources, and transfer heat therefrom to a working fluid that is circulated through an ORC unit for generation of power. In embodiments, the mobile heat generation units comprise pre-packaged modules with one or more heat exchangers connected to a pump of a recirculation system, including an array of piping, such that each mobile heat generation unit can be transported to the site and installed as a substantially stand-alone module or heat generation assembly.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure

Typically, ORC generators utilize a working fluid loop that flows in a loop wherein the working fluid is heated to cause the working fluid in the loop to change phases from a liquid to a vapor. The vaporous working fluid may then flow to a gas expander, causing the gas expander to rotate. The rotation of the gas expander may cause a generator to generate electrical power. The vaporous working fluid may then flow to a condenser or heat sink. The condenser or heat sink may cool the working fluid, causing the working fluid to change phase from the vapor to the liquid. The working fluid may circulate through the loop in such a continuous manner, thus the geothermal generator may generate electrical power.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Heat exchangers within geothermal generators often are not built to withstand high pressures, and/or substantial heat flows. In addition, construction of ORC power systems in the field can be difficult particularly to provide and/or construction such power systems quickly and with sufficient capacity for a desired level of power generation. It further can be difficult to modify and/or change components in the field, particularly at more remote sites.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, Applicants have recognized a need for systems and methods for generation of power in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) operation that includes components and/or systems to facilitate ease of construction and/or customizable power generation systems for supplying electrical power to one or more of in-field operational equipment, a grid power structure, and an energy storage device. The present disclosure is directed to embodiments of such systems and methods.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure is generally directed to systems and methods for generating and controlling generation of electrical power in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) operation at a remote site, such as in the vicinity of a wellhead during hydrocarbon production to thereby supply electrical power to one or more of in-field operational equipment, a grid power structure, and an energy storage device. In embodiments, the present disclosure provides a mobile heat generation unit that is constructed with a series of components to provide a transportable module that can be transported and located at a site, such as a site for hydrocarbon production.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">By way of example and not limitation, in embodiments, the hydrocarbon production site can include a wellhead and/or pumping station that produces a heated wellhead fluid that, as it exits the wellhead, may be under high-pressure and at a high temperature.

Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0072" num="0071">So that the manner in which the features and advantages of the embodiments of the systems and methods disclosed herein, as well as others that will become apparent, may be understood in more detail, a more particular description of embodiments of systems and methods briefly summarized above may be had by reference to the following detailed description of embodiments thereof, in which one or more are further illustrated in the appended drawings, which form a part of this specification. It is to be noted, however, that the drawings illustrate only various embodiments of the systems and methods disclosed herein and are therefore not to be considered limiting of the scope of the systems and methods disclosed herein as it may include other effective embodiments as well.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The present disclosure is directed to systems and methods for generating geothermal power in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) operation in the vicinity of a wellhead during hydrocarbon production to thereby supply electrical power to one or more of in-field equipment or operational equipment, a grid power structure, other equipment, and an energy storage device. Wellhead fluids flowing from a wellhead at a well are typically under high-pressure. In-field equipment at the well is not rated for such high pressures. Prior to further processing or transport, the pressure of the flow of the wellhead fluid may be reduced, e.g., from 15,000 PSI to 200 PSI, from 10,000 PSI to 200 PSI, from 2,000 PSI to 200 PSI, or any other range from 20,000 PSI to 100 PSI, based on the pressure rating of the in-field equipment at the well. As the wellhead fluid flows from the wellhead, the temperature of the flow of the wellhead fluid may be at a high temperature, at least partially due to the high pressure of the flow of the wellhead fluid. As the pressure is reduced, the wellhead fluid temperature may also be reduced, as result of the pressure drop. Typically, the heat of the flow of wellhead fluid from the wellhead is not utilized and may be considered heat waste.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Geothermal power generators typically use a looping pipe or pipeline buried at depths with sufficient temperature to allow a working fluid to change phase from liquid to vapor. As the working fluid changes phase from a liquid to a vaporous state, the vaporous state working fluid may flow up the pipe or pipeline to a gas expander. The vaporous state working fluid may flow through and cause the gas expander to rotate. The rotation of the gas expander may cause a generator to generate electrical power, as will be described below. The vaporous state working fluid may flow through the gas expander to a heat sink, condenser, or other cooling apparatus. The heat sink, condenser, or other cooling apparatus may cool the working fluid thereby causing the working fluid to change phases from a vapor to a liquid. Heat exchangers of typical geothermal generators are not rated for high-pressure operations and usually geothermal generators obtain heat from varying underground depths.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the present disclosure, a high-pressure heat exchanger may be placed or disposed at the well and/or in the vicinity of one or more wellheads. The high-pressure heat exchanger may be connected to the wellhead and may accept a high temperature or heated flow of wellhead fluid. A working fluid may flow through the heat exchanger. As the wellhead fluid and working fluid flows through the high-pressure heat exchanger, the high-pressure heat exchanger may facilitate transfer of heat from the wellhead fluid to the working fluid. A heat exchanger may include two fluidic paths, one for a heated fluid and another for a cool fluid. The fluidic paths may be in close proximity, allowing heat to transfer from the heated fluid to the cool fluid. The fluidic paths may be loops, coils, densely packed piping, tubes, chambers, some other type of path to allow for fluid to flow therethrough, and/or a combination thereof, as will be understood by those skilled in the art. As fluids flow through the heat exchanger, the cool liquid's temperature may increase, while the heated liquid's temperature may decrease.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Additionally, a geothermal generator unit or ORC unit may be disposed, positioned, or placed at the wellhead. The geothermal generator unit or ORC unit may directly connect to the high-pressure heat exchanger, include the high-pressure heat exchanger, or may connect to the high-pressure heat exchanger via an intermediary heat exchanger. As the hot wellhead fluid heats the working fluid, either via direct connection or through an intermediary heat exchanger, the working fluid may change phases from a liquid to a vapor. In such examples, the working fluid utilized may be chosen based on a low boiling point and/or high condensing point. The vaporous state working fluid may flow through the geothermal generator unit or ORC unit to a generator, e.g., a gas expander and generator. The vaporous state working fluid may then flow to a condenser or heat sink, thereby changing state from the vapor to the liquid. Finally, the liquid may be pumped back to the high-pressure heat exchanger. Such a cycle, process, or operation may be considered a Rankine cycle or ORC.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Such systems may include various components, devices, or apparatuses, such as temperature sensors, pressure sensors or transducers, flow meters, control valves, smart valves, valves actuated via control signal, controllers, a master or supervisory controller, other computing devices, computing systems, user interfaces, in-field equipment, and/or other equipment. The controller may monitor and adjust various aspects of the system to ensure that hydrocarbon production continues at a specified rate, that downtime is limited or negligible, and that electrical power is generated efficiently, optimally, economically, and/or to meet or exceed a preselected electrical power output threshold.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> are schematic top-down perspectives of novel implementations of a geothermal power generation enabled well, according to one or more embodiment of the disclosure. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a well <b>100</b> may include various components or equipment, also referred to as in-field equipment. Such in-field equipment may include fracturing equipment, field compressors, pump stations, artificial lift equipment, drilling rigs, data vans, and/or any other equipment utilized or used at a well <b>100</b>. For example, the well <b>100</b> may include one or more pumpjacks <b>108</b>, one or more wellhead compressors <b>110</b>, various other pumps, various valves, and/or other equipment that may use electrical power or other type of power to operate. To generate power from otherwise wasted heat, the well <b>100</b> may additionally include a high-pressure heat exchanger <b>104</b>, one or more geothermal generators, one or more ORC units <b>106</b>, a high-pressure geothermal generator, a high-pressure ORC unit, and/or some combination thereof. As wellhead fluid flows from one of the one or more wellheads <b>102</b>, a portion of the flow of wellhead fluid or all of the flow of wellhead fluid may flow through the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>104</b>, high-pressure geothermal generator, a high-pressure ORC unit, or some combination thereof. As the hot and high-pressure wellhead fluid flows through, for example, the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>104</b>, the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>104</b> may facilitate a transfer of heat from the wellhead fluid to a working fluid flowing through the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>104</b>. In other words, the wellhead fluid may heat the working fluid. Such a heat transfer may cause the working fluid to change phases from a liquid to a vapor. The vaporous state working fluid may flow from the high-pressure heat exchanger to the one or more ORC units <b>106</b>. The one or more ORC units <b>106</b> may then generate power using the vaporous state working fluid. The electrical power may be transferred to the in-field equipment at the well <b>100</b>, to an energy storage device (e.g., if excess power is available), to equipment at other wells, to the grid or grid power structure (e.g., via a transformer <b>116</b> through power lines <b>118</b>), or some combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, one or more wells <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B, <b>100</b>C may be nearby or in close proximity to each of the other one or more wells <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B, <b>100</b>C. Further, each of the one or more wells <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B, <b>100</b>C may utilize different amounts of electrical power, in addition to generating different amounts of electrical power. As such, one well (e.g., well <b>100</b>A, well <b>100</b>B, and/or well <b>100</b>C) of the one or more wells <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B, <b>100</b>C may generate a surplus of electrical power or utilize electrical power from other sources. In an example, a controller may determine if a well (e.g., well <b>100</b>A, well <b>100</b>B, and/or well <b>100</b>C) of the one or more wells <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B, <b>100</b>C generates a surplus. If a surplus is generated, the controller may determine which, if any, of the other one or more wells <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B, <b>100</b>C may have a deficit of electrical power. The controller may then transmit signals to equipment at the one or more wells <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B, <b>100</b>C to enable electrical power transfer between the one or more wells <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B, <b>100</b>C with excess and deficits, e.g., a well with a deficit may receive electrical power from a well with a surplus (see <b>120</b>). In another example, the one or more wells <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B, <b>100</b>C may include energy storage devices e.g., batteries, battery banks, or other solutions to store energy for short or long term time periods. The energy storage devices may be placed, disposed, or installed at one or more of the one or more wells <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B, <b>100</b>C or at points in between the one or more wells <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B, <b>100</b>C. As surplus electrical power is generated, that surplus electrical power may be transmitted and stored in the energy storage devices. The energy storage devices may be accessible by the in-field equipment of each of the one or more wells <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the one or more wells <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B, <b>100</b>C may include a high-pressure heat exchanger <b>104</b> and ORC units <b>106</b>. In an example, the ORC units <b>106</b> may be modular and/or mobile. The ORC units <b>106</b> may be mounted to a vehicle, such as a truck or other vehicle type, or skid and transported to the well <b>100</b>. Further, the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>104</b> may be modular and/or mobile. The high-pressure heat exchanger <b>104</b> may be mounted to a vehicle and/or skid. Upon arrival at one of the one or more wells <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B, <b>100</b>C, the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>104</b> may be removed from the vehicle or the vehicle may be left on-site or at least while the one or more wells <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B, <b>100</b>C are producing hydrocarbons. In an example, during hydrocarbon production, operation of the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>104</b> and ORC unit <b>106</b> may occur. After hydrocarbon production has ceased, none, some, or all of the equipment may be removed from the well <b>100</b>. For example, the well <b>100</b> may be re-used for generating geothermal energy via a different method. In such examples the ORC units <b>106</b> and high-pressure heat exchanger <b>104</b> may remain on-site.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>F</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>G</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>H</figref> are block diagrams illustrating novel implementations of a geothermal power generation enabled well to provide electrical power to one or more of in-field equipment, equipment at other wells, energy storage devices, and the grid power structure, according to one or more embodiment of the disclosure. As illustrated in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A through <b>2</b>H</figref>, different embodiments may be utilized for geothermal power generation at the surface of a well during hydrocarbon production. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, a well <b>200</b> may include a wellhead <b>202</b>. The wellhead <b>202</b> may produce a stream or flow of wellhead fluid. The wellhead fluid may flow from a first pipe <b>215</b>. The first pipe <b>215</b> may include, at various positions along the length of the pipe <b>215</b>, sensors, meters, transducers, and/or other devices to determine the characteristics of the wellhead fluid flowing through pipe <b>215</b>. Further, sensors, meters, transducers and/or other devices may be included at various positions within the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> and/or ORC unit <b>203</b> to determine the characteristics of the working fluid or ORC fluid flowing through the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> and/or ORC unit <b>203</b>. Based on the determined characteristics of the wellhead fluid, working fluid, and/or ORC fluid and/or characteristics of other aspects of the well <b>200</b>, e.g., temperature, pressure, flow, power demand and/or power storage or transmission options and/or other factors, a first heat exchanger valve <b>208</b> connected to the first pipe <b>215</b> may be opened, e.g., partially opened or fully opened.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Further, when the first heat exchanger valve <b>208</b> is opened, a second heat exchanger valve <b>222</b> connected to a second pipe <b>217</b> may be opened, e.g., partially opened or fully opened. The second heat exchanger valve <b>222</b> may allow the flow of wellhead fluid to exit the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b>. Based on the opening of the first heat exchanger valve <b>208</b> and second heat exchanger valve <b>222</b>, a first wellhead fluid valve <b>210</b> may be adjusted. Such adjustment may occur to ensure that the production of the wellhead <b>202</b> or the production of wellhead fluid from the wellhead <b>202</b> may not be impeded or slowed based on a diversion of the flow of the wellhead fluid to the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b>. Downstream of the first wellhead fluid valve <b>210</b>, but prior to where the diverted portion of the flow of wellhead fluid is reintroduced to the primary or bypass wellhead fluid flow, a pressure sensor <b>212</b> may be disposed, e.g., the pressure sensor <b>212</b> may be disposed along pipe <b>217</b>. In another example, rather than a pressure sensor <b>212</b>, a flow meter may be disposed along pipe <b>217</b>, e.g., a wellhead fluid flow meter and/or a downstream flow meter. The wellhead fluid flow meter may measure the flow rate of a fluid exiting the wellhead <b>202</b>. A downstream flow meter may measure the flow rate of the wellhead fluid at a point downstream of the first wellhead fluid valve <b>210</b>. Such a pressure sensor <b>212</b> or flow meter may be utilized to determine whether the flow of wellhead fluid is at a pressure or flow that does not impede hydrocarbon production. In an example, where the flow is impeded to a degree that the production of hydrocarbons may be inhibited, the first wellhead fluid valve <b>210</b> may be opened further, if the first wellhead fluid valve <b>210</b> is not already fully opened. If the first wellhead fluid valve <b>210</b> is fully opened, the first heat exchanger valve's <b>208</b> and second heat exchanger valve's <b>222</b> percent open may be adjusted. Other factors may be taken into account for such determinations, such as the pressure or flow from the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b>, the pressure or flow at the point of a choke valve located further downstream along the second pipe <b>217</b>, a pressure rating for downstream equipment, and/or the temperature of the wellhead fluid within the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b>. Once the flow of wellhead fluid passes through the first wellhead fluid valve <b>210</b> and/or the second heat exchanger valve <b>222</b>, the wellhead fluid may flow to in-field equipment <b>270</b> for further processing or transport.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Each of the valves described herein, e.g., first heat exchanger valve <b>208</b>, second heat exchanger valve <b>222</b>, first wellhead fluid valve <b>210</b>, and other valves illustrated in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>G</figref>, may be control valves, electrically actuated valves, pneumatic valves, or other valves suitable to receive signals and open and close under, potentially, high pressure. The valves may receive signals from a controller or other source and the signals may cause the valves to move to a partially or fully opened or closed position. The signal may indicate the position that the valve may be adjusted to, e.g., a position halfway open, a position a third of the way open, a position a particular degree open, or completely open, such positions to be understood as non-limiting examples. In such examples, as the valve receives the signal indicative of a position to adjust to, the valve may begin turning to the indicated position. Such an operation may take time, depending on the valve used. To ensure proper operation and prevent damage (e.g., damage to the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b>, such as when pressure of the wellhead fluid exceeds a pressure rating of the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b>), the valve may be configured to close in a specified period of time while high-pressure fluid flows therethrough. Such a configuration may be based on a torque value of the valve, e.g., a valve with a higher torque value may close faster than that of a control valve with a lower torque value. Such a specified period of time may be 5 seconds to 10 seconds, 5 seconds to 15 seconds, 5 seconds to 20 seconds, 10 seconds to 15 seconds, 10 seconds to 20 seconds, or 15 seconds to 20 seconds. For example, if a wellhead fluid flow exceeds a pressure of 15,000 PSI, the first heat exchanger valve <b>208</b> may close within 5 seconds of the pressure sensor <b>214</b> indicating the pressure exceeding 15,000 PSI. In other embodiments, the valves may either fully open or fully close, rather than open to positions in between. In yet other examples, the valves may be manually or physically opened by operators or technicians on-site.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, pressure sensors <b>204</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>207</b> and/or temperature sensors <b>206</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>226</b>, <b>218</b> may be disposed at various points on or along different pipes, equipment, apparatuses, and/or devices at the well. Each sensor may provide information to adjust and/or control various aspects of the wellhead fluid flow. For example, pressure sensors <b>204</b>, <b>212</b> may provide pressure measurements to determine whether a flow of wellhead fluid is not impeded in relation to hydrocarbon production targets. Pressure sensors <b>214</b>, <b>220</b> may provide measurements to ensure that the flow of wellhead fluid through the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> is sufficient to facilitate heat transfer from the wellhead fluid to a working fluid in a ORC loop <b>221</b> and/or that the pressure within the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> does not exceed a pressure rating of the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b>. In another example, temperature sensor <b>206</b> may provide data to control flow of the wellhead fluid. For example, if the flow of wellhead fluid is at a temperature sufficient to cause the working fluid to exhibit a vaporous phase change, then the first heat exchanger valve <b>208</b> and second heat exchanger valve <b>222</b> may be opened. Further, temperature sensors <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, <b>226</b>, <b>248</b> may provide measurements to ensure that the temperatures within the heat exchanger, of the flow of wellhead fluid, and of the flow of working fluid, are above the thresholds or within a range of thresholds, e.g., above a vaporous phase change threshold. For example, rather than or in addition to using temperature of the wellhead fluid as measured by temperature sensor <b>206</b>, the temperature of the working fluid as measured by temperature sensor <b>226</b> may be utilized to determine whether to maintain an open position of an already open first heat exchanger valve <b>208</b>. In such examples, the first heat exchanger valve <b>208</b> may initially be fully or partially open, e.g., prior to flow of the wellhead fluid.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In another embodiment, in addition to the first heat exchanger valve <b>208</b> and second heat exchanger valve <b>222</b>, the well <b>200</b> may include a first ORC unit valve <b>295</b> and a second ORC unit valve <b>296</b>. Such ORC unit valves <b>295</b>, <b>296</b> may be utilized to control flow of working fluid flowing into the ORC unit <b>203</b>. Further the ORC unit valves <b>295</b>, <b>296</b> may be utilized when more than one high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> corresponding to one or more wellheads are connected to the ORC unit <b>203</b>.

The flow of working fluid may be adjusted to ensure that the ORC unit <b>203</b> produces an amount of electrical power greater than or equal to a preselected electrical power output threshold, based on various factors or operating conditions (e.g., temperature of wellhead fluid flow, temperature of working fluid flow, electrical output <b>236</b> of the ORC unit <b>203</b>, electrical rating of the ORC unit <b>203</b>, flow and/or pressure of the wellhead fluid, and/or flow and/or pressure of the working fluid). In some examples, the ORC unit valves <b>295</b>, <b>296</b> may initially be fully open or at least partially open and as various factors or operating conditions are determined, then the ORC unit valves <b>295</b>, <b>296</b> for one or more heat exchangers may be adjusted to enable the ORC unit <b>203</b> to meet a preselected electrical power output threshold, as will be understood by a person skilled in the art. The preselected electrical power output threshold may be set by a user or may be a predefined value generated by a controller (e.g., controller <b>272</b>) based on various factors. The various factors may include an ORC unit electrical power rating or output rating or maximum potential temperature of the wellhead fluid and/or working fluid.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">As shown, several pairs of sensors may be located adjacent to one another. In other examples, those positions, for example, the pressure sensor's <b>204</b> and the temperature sensor's <b>206</b> location, may be reversed. In yet another example, each one of the sensors may provide measurements for multiple aspects of the wellhead fluid, e.g., one sensor to provide a combination of flow, pressure, temperature, composition (e.g., amount of components in the wellhead fluid, such as water, hydrocarbons, other chemicals, proppant, etc.), density, or other aspect of the wellhead fluid or working fluid. Each sensor described above may be integrated in or within the pipes or conduits of each device or component, clamped on or over pipes or conduits, and or disposed in other ways, as will be understood by those skilled in the art.

The high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> may be disposed nearby or at a distance from the wellhead <b>202</b>. The high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> may be a modular and/or mobile apparatus. In such examples, the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> may be brought or moved to a well or site (e.g., via a vehicle, such as a truck), placed at the well or site during hydrocarbon production, and then moved to another well or site at the end of hydrocarbon production. The high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> may be disposed on a skid, a trailer, a flatbed truck, inside a geothermal generator unit, or inside an ORC unit <b>203</b>. Once brought to a well or site, the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> may be secured to the surface at the well. The high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> may be configured to withstand pressures in excess of about 5,000 PSI, about 10,000 PSI, about 15,000 PSI, and/or greater. In an example, the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> may be a high-pressure shell and tube heat exchanger, a spiral plate or coil heat exchanger, a heliflow heat exchanger, or other heat exchanger configured to withstand high pressures. In another example, portions of the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> may be configured to withstand high-pressures. For example, if a shell and tube heat exchanger is utilized, the shell and/or tubes may be configured to withstand high-pressures.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In another embodiment, at least one fluidic path of the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> may be coated or otherwise configured to reduce or prevent corrosion. In such examples, a wellhead fluid may be corrosive. To prevent damage to the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> over a period of time, the fluid path for the wellhead fluid may be configured to withstand such corrosion by including a permanent, semi-permanent, or temporary anti-corrosive coating, an injection point for anti-corrosive chemical additive injections, and/or some combination thereof. Further, at least one fluid path of the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> may be comprised of an anti-corrosive material, e.g., anti-corrosive metals or polymers. As noted, the wellhead fluid may flow into the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> at a high pressure. As the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> may operate at high pressure, the high-pressure heat exchange may include pressure relief valves to prevent failures if pressure within the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> were to exceed the pressure rating of the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b>. Over time, wellhead fluid flowing through the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> may cause a buildup of deposits or scaling. To prevent scaling and/or other related issues, the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> may be injected with scaling inhibitors or other chemicals or may include vibration or radio frequency induction devices.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Once the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> facilitates heat transfer from the wellhead fluid to the working fluid, the working fluid may partially, substantially, or completely change phases from a liquid to a vapor, vaporous state, gas, or gaseous state. The vapor or gas may flow to the ORC unit <b>203</b> causing an expander to rotate. The rotation may cause a generator to generate electricity, as will be further described and as will be understood by those skilled in the art. The generated electricity may be provided as an electrical output <b>236</b>. The electricity generated may be provided to in-field equipment, energy storage devices, equipment at other wells, or to a grid power structure. The working fluid in the high-pressure heat exchanger may be a working fluid to carry heat. Further, the working fluid of the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> may or may not exhibit a vaporous phase change. The working fluid may carry heat to another heat exchanger <b>205</b> of the ORC unit <b>203</b>. As such, heat may be transferred from the wellhead fluid to the working fluid of the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> and heat may be transferred from the working fluid of the high-pressure heat exchanger <b>250</b> to the working fluid of the ORC unit <b>203</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In an example, the working fluid may be a fluid with a low boiling point and/or high condensation point. In other words, a working fluid may boil at lower than typical temperatures, while condensing at higher than typical temperatures. The working fluid may be an organic working fluid. The working fluid may be one or more of pentafluoropropane, carbon dioxide, ammonia and water mixtures, tetrafluoroethane, isobutene, propane, pentane, perfluorocarbons, other hydrocarbons, a zeotropic mixture of pentafluoropentane and cyclopentane, other zeotropic mixtures, and/or other fluids or fluid mixtures. The working fluid's boiling point and condensation point may be different depending on the pressure within the ORC loop <b>221</b>, e.g., the higher the pressure, the lower the boiling point.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the internal components of an ORC unit <b>203</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> further illustrates several of the same components, equipment, or devices as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates.

A master controller <b>402</b> may manage the operations of geothermal power generation at a wellhead during hydrocarbon production. The master controller <b>402</b> may be one or more controllers, a supervisory controller, programmable logic controller (PLC), a computing device (such as a laptop, desktop computing device, and/or a server), an edge server, a cloud based computing device, and/or other suitable devices. The master controller <b>402</b> may be located at or near the well. The master controller <b>402</b> may be located remote from the well. The master controller <b>402</b>, as noted, may be more than one controller. In such cases, the master controller <b>402</b> may be located near or at various wells and/or at other off-site locations. The master controller <b>402</b> may include a processor <b>404</b>, or one or more processors, and memory <b>406</b>. The memory <b>406</b> may include instructions. In an example, the memory <b>406</b> may be a non-transitory machine-readable storage medium. As used herein, a &#x201c;non-transitory machine-readable storage medium&#x201d; may be any electronic, magnetic, optical, or other physical storage apparatus to contain or store information such as executable instructions, data, and the like. For example, any machine-readable storage medium described herein may be any of random access memory (RAM), volatile memory, non-volatile memory, flash memory, a storage drive (e.g., hard drive), a solid state drive, any type of storage disc, and the like, or a combination thereof. As noted, the memory <b>406</b> may store or include instructions executable by the processor <b>404</b>. As used herein, a &#x201c;processor&#x201d; may include, for example one processor or multiple processors included in a single device or distributed across multiple computing devices. The processor may be at least one of a central processing unit (CPU), a semiconductor-based microprocessor, a graphics processing unit (GPU), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to retrieve and execute instructions, a real time processor (RTP), other electronic circuitry suitable for the retrieval and execution instructions stored on a machine-readable storage medium, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">As used herein, &#x201c;signal communication&#x201d; refers to electric communication such as hard wiring two components together or wireless communication for remote monitoring and control/operation, as understood by those skilled in the art. For example, wireless communication may be Wi-Fi&#xae;, Bluetooth&#xae;, ZigBee, cellular wireless communication, satellite communication, or forms of near field communications. In addition, signal communication may include one or more intermediate controllers or relays disposed between elements that are in signal communication with one another.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The master controller <b>402</b> may include instructions <b>408</b> to measure temperature at various points or locations of the system (e.g., as illustrated in, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>). For example, temperature may be measured at a wellhead fluid temperature sensor <b>1</b> <b>416</b>, heat exchanger temperature sensors <b>418</b>, wellhead fluid temperature sensor <b>2</b> <b>420</b>, condenser temperature sensors <b>422</b>, and/or at various other points in the system <b>400</b>. Other characteristics may be measured as well, such as flow, density, pressure, composition, or other characteristics related to the wellhead fluid and/or working fluid.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Utilizing the characteristics noted above, the master controller <b>402</b> may control various aspects of the system <b>400</b>. For example, the master controller <b>402</b> may include flow control adjustment instructions <b>412</b>. The system <b>400</b> may include one or more valves placed in various locations (For example, but not limited to, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A through <b>2</b>H</figref>). Valves of the system <b>400</b> may include a wellhead fluid valve <b>1</b> <b>426</b>, heat exchanger valves <b>428</b>, wellhead fluid valve <b>2</b> <b>430</b>, and condenser valves <b>432</b>. As noted other valves may be included in the system and controlled by the master controller <b>402</b>. The valves may operate to adjust flow based on a number of factors. Such factors may include temperature of a wellhead fluid, flow rate of the wellhead fluid, temperature of the working fluid, flow rate of the working fluid, pressure of the wellhead fluid at various points in the system, pressure of the working fluid at various points in the system, and/or some combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In an example, the system <b>400</b> may include a user interface <b>436</b>, e.g., such as a monitor, display, computing device, smartphones, tablets, and other similar devices as will be understood by those skilled in the art. A user may view data, enter thresholds or limits, monitor status of the equipment, and perform other various tasks in relation to the equipment at the well. For example, a specific flow rate may be set for hydrocarbon production. As a wellhead begins producing hydrocarbons (e.g., wellhead fluids begin flowing from a wellhead), the master controller <b>402</b> may monitor flow rate and compare the flow rate to the threshold either set by a user or pre-set in the master controller <b>402</b>. If the master controller <b>402</b> determines that the heat exchanger valves <b>428</b> (e.g., via flow control adjustment instructions <b>412</b>) should be open or are open and that the flow of wellhead fluid is higher or lower than the threshold, the master controller <b>402</b> may adjust the appropriate valves, e.g., wellhead fluid valve <b>426</b> and/or heat exchanger valves <b>428</b>. The valve associated with the primary or bypass wellhead fluid pipe, e.g., wellhead fluid valve <b>426</b>, may open or close by varying degrees based on such determinations.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In another example, the master controller <b>402</b> may include instructions <b>410</b> to control a pump for the ORC unit, e.g., working fluid pump <b>424</b>. If heat exchanger valves <b>428</b> and condenser valves <b>432</b> are closed, the master controller <b>402</b> may transmit a signal to shut down or cease operation of the working fluid pump <b>424</b>, if the working fluid pump <b>424</b> is operating. The master controller <b>402</b> may further transmit a signal, based on the heat exchanger valves <b>428</b> being open, to initiate or start operations of the working fluid pump <b>424</b>. The working fluid pump <b>424</b> may be a fixed pressure pump or a variable frequency pump. The master controller <b>402</b> may further include instructions <b>414</b> to monitor the power output from an ORC unit or from expanders/generators <b>434</b> (e.g., expander/generator A <b>434</b>A, expander/generator B <b>434</b>B, and/or up to expander/generator N <b>434</b>N). If the system <b>400</b> utilizes ORC units, the master controller <b>402</b> may determine the electrical power generated or output based on an output from, for example, ORC unit controller A <b>438</b>A, ORC unit controller B <b>438</b>B, and/or up to ORC unit controller N <b>438</b>N. If the power output drops to an un-economical or unsustainable level or electrical power generation ceases completely while the heat exchanger valves <b>428</b> are open, the master controller <b>402</b> may transmit signals to close the heat exchanger valves <b>428</b>. In another example, the master controller <b>402</b> may monitor electrical power output from other wells. The master controller <b>402</b> may monitor or meter the amount of electrical power being utilized at each of the wells and/or the amount of electrical power being generated at each of the wells. If an excess of electrical power exists, the master controller <b>402</b> may transmit signals causing the excess energy at any particular well to be stored in energy storage devices, transmitted to the grid, and/or transmitted to another well. If a deficit of electrical power exists, the master controller <b>402</b> may transmit a signal causing other wells to transmit electrical power to the well experiencing an electrical power deficit. In another example, the metered electrical power may be utilized for commercial trade, to determine a cost of the electricity generated, and/or for use in determining emissions or emission reductions through use of an alternate energy source (e.g., geothermal power).</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In another example, the master controller <b>402</b> may include instructions to maximize energy output from an ORC unit. In such examples, the ORC unit may be connected to a plurality of high-pressure heat exchangers. Further, each of the high-pressure heat exchangers may connect to one or more wellheads. As a wellhead produces a wellhead fluid, the pressure and temperature of the wellhead fluid may vary, over time, as well as based on the location of the wellhead. The master controller <b>402</b> may determine the temperature of the wellhead fluid at each high-pressure heat exchanger and/or the temperature of the working fluid in each high-pressure heat exchanger. Based on these determinations, the master controller <b>402</b> may open/close valves associated with one or more particular high-pressure heat exchangers to ensure the most efficient heat transfer. Further, the master controller <b>402</b> may determine the amount of electrical power output from the ORC unit. Based on a power rating of the ORC unit (e.g., the maximum power output the ORC unit is able to produce) and/or the amount of electrical power output from the ORC unit, the master controller <b>402</b> may adjust valves associated with the one or more particular high-pressure heat exchangers to thereby increase electrical power output. Additional ORC units may be utilized and electrical power output for each may be optimized or efficiently generated. The master controller <b>402</b> may determine, for each ORC unit, the optimal amount or efficient amount of heated working fluid flowing from each high-pressure heat exchanger to ensure the highest amount of electrical power possible is generated per ORC unit or that each ORC unit meets a preselected electrical power output threshold. In such examples, each ORC unit may be connected to each high-pressure heat exchanger and the master controller <b>402</b> may determine which set of valves to open/close based on such an optimization or electrical power output threshold.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In another example, the master controller <b>402</b> may include failover instructions or instructions to be executed to effectively reduce or prevent risk. The failover instructions may execute in the event of ORC unit and/or high-pressure heat exchanger failure or if an ORC unit and/or high-pressure heat exchanger experiences an issue requiring maintenance. For example, the ORC unit and/or high-pressure heat exchanger may have various sensors or meters. Such sensors or meters, when providing measurement to the master controller <b>402</b>, may indicate a failure in the ORC unit and/or high-pressure heat exchanger. In another example, the master controller <b>402</b> may include pre-determined parameters that indicate failures. If the master controller <b>402</b> receives such indications, the master controller <b>402</b> may open, if not already open, the wellhead fluid valve <b>1</b> <b>426</b> and wellhead fluid valve <b>2</b> <b>430</b>. After the wellhead fluid valve <b>1</b> <b>426</b> and wellhead fluid valve <b>2</b> <b>430</b> are opened, the master controller <b>402</b> may close the heat exchanger valves <b>428</b>, the condenser valves <b>432</b>, or any other valve associated with the flow of fluid to the ORC unit and/or high-pressure heat exchanger. In such examples, the master controller <b>402</b> may prevent further use of the ORC unit and/or high-pressure heat exchanger until the issue or failure indicated is resolved. Such a resolution may be indicated by a user via the user interface <b>436</b> or based on measurements from sensors and/or meters.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In another example, the master controller <b>402</b> may, as noted, determine an amount of electrical power output by an ORC unit. The master controller <b>402</b> may additionally determine different characteristics of the electrical power output. For example, the master controller <b>402</b> may monitor the output voltage and frequency. Further, the master controller <b>402</b> may include pre-set or predetermined thresholds, limits, or parameters in relation to the monitored characteristics of the electrical power output. Further still, the master controller <b>402</b> may connect to a breaker or switchgear. In the event that the master controller <b>402</b> detects that an ORC unit exceeds any of the thresholds, limits, and/or parameters, the master controller <b>402</b> may transmit a signal to the breaker or switchgear to break the circuit (e.g., the flow of electricity from the ORC unit to a source) and may shut down the ORC unit (e.g., closing valves preventing further flow to the ORC unit, as described above).</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow diagram of geothermal power generation in which, when a wellhead fluid is at or above a vaporous phase change temperature threshold, heat exchanger valves may be opened to allow wellhead fluid to flow therethrough, thereby facilitating heating of a working fluid for use in a ORC unit, according to one or more embodiment of the disclosure.

In other examples, a user may indicate, via the user interface <b>436</b>, that the wellhead is active. If the wellhead is not active, the master controller <b>402</b> may wait for a specified period of time and make such a determination after the period of time.

For example, for pentafluoropropane the vaporous phase change temperature or boiling point may be 15.14 degrees Celsius. In another example, or factors may be taken into account when determining whether to open heat exchanger valves <b>428</b>. For example, whether the pressure is within operating range of a high-pressure heat exchanger, whether the flow rate at a primary or bypass pipeline is sufficient to prevent impedance of hydrocarbon production, whether power generation costs are offset by power generation needs, among other factors.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">At block <b>508</b>, if the wellhead fluid is at or above the vaporous phase change temperature, the master controller <b>402</b> may transmit a signal to heat exchanger valves <b>428</b> to open to a specified degree.

The degree to which the heat exchanger valves <b>428</b> opens may depend on the temperature of the wellhead fluid, the flow rate of the wellhead fluid, and/or the pressure of the wellhead fluid.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">At block <b>510</b>, the master controller <b>402</b> may close wellhead fluid valves (e.g., wellhead fluid valve <b>1</b> <b>426</b>) to divert a portion of the flow of wellhead fluids to the high-pressure heat exchanger. The wellhead fluid valves (e.g., wellhead fluid valve <b>1</b> <b>426</b>) may close partially or completely, depending on various factors, such as heat exchanger flow capacity, current flow rate, current pressure, current temperature, among other factors. Once the wellhead fluid valves (e.g., wellhead fluid valve <b>1</b> <b>426</b>) are closed, at block <b>512</b>, a working fluid pump <b>424</b> of the ORC unit may begin pumping the working fluid through the ORC loop. At block <b>514</b>, the master controller <b>402</b> may determine whether electricity is being generated. If not, the master controller <b>402</b> may check if the wellhead is still active and, if the wellhead is still active, the master controller <b>402</b> may adjust the valves (e.g., wellhead fluid valve <b>1</b> <b>426</b> and heat exchanger valves <b>428</b>) as appropriate (e.g., increasing flow through the heat exchanger to facilitate an increase in heat transfer).</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">At block <b>516</b>, if the wellhead fluid is lower than the vaporous phase change temperature, the master controller <b>402</b> may open or check if the wellhead fluid valves (e.g., wellhead fluid valve <b>1</b> <b>426</b>) are open.

If they are not the master controller <b>402</b> may open the heat exchanger valves and close, at least partially, the wellhead fluid valves. If the heat exchanger valves are open, the master controller <b>402</b> may not change or adjust any of the valves open percentage, but rather continue to or start pumping the working fluid or ORC unit through the ORC unit.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">In addition, after the master controller <b>402</b> closes the heat exchanger valves at block <b>720</b>, the master controller <b>402</b> may determine, at block <b>726</b>, the wellhead fluid temperature at the heat exchanger. At block <b>728</b>, the master controller may determine whether the wellhead fluid is at a vaporous phase change temperature of the working fluid or ORC fluid. If the wellhead fluid temperature is less than such a value, the master controller <b>402</b> may wait and measure the temperature again after a period of time. If the wellhead fluid temperature is greater than or equal to such a value, the master controller <b>402</b> may perform the operations of method <b>701</b> starting at block <b>724</b> again.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flow diagram of geothermal power generation in which a working fluid flow is determined based on a preselected electrical power output threshold, according to one or more embodiment of the disclosure.

Once opened, the heat exchanger valves may allow for continuous diversion of the flow of wellhead fluid through the heat exchanger. The flow of wellhead fluid through the heat exchanger may facilitate transfer of heat from the flow of wellhead fluid to a flow of working fluid or intermediate working fluid.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">At block <b>808</b>, ORC unit valves may be opened. The ORC unit valves may initially be fully opened or partially opened. The ORC unit valves, when open, may allow for working fluid from each of the heat exchangers to flow into the ORC unit. Each working fluid flow may be combined and may pass through the ORC unit.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">At block <b>810</b>, the master controller <b>402</b> may determine one or more operating conditions of the ORC unit and/or the system <b>400</b>. The one or more operating conditions may include the flow rate and/or pressure of working fluid flowing through each of the one or more heat exchangers, the flow rate and/or pressure of wellhead fluid flowing through each of the one or more heat exchangers or at any other point downstream of the wellhead, the temperature of the working fluid in each of the one or more heat exchangers, the temperature of wellhead fluid at each of the one or more heat exchangers, the temperature of the combined working fluid flow at the ORC unit, the electrical power output from the ORC unit, and/or the open position of each of the valves included in the system <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">At block <b>812</b>, based on the determined operating conditions, the master controller <b>402</b> may determine an optimal or efficient working fluid flow of the ORC unit. The optimal or efficient working fluid flow may depend on the temperature of the combined working fluid flowing to the ORC unit. The other operating conditions, described above, may be utilized to determine the optimal or efficient working fluid flow. The optimal or efficient working fluid flow may comprise the combined flow of working fluid flowing into the ORC unit to thereby produce a maximum amount of electrical power possible or to enable the ORC unit to meet a preselected electrical power output threshold. The optimal or efficient working fluid flow may be at a temperature sufficient to produce such an amount of electrical power (e.g., a temperature greater than or equal to the boiling point of the working fluid within the ORC unit). The optimal or efficient working fluid flow may be indicated by the master controller <b>402</b> as one or more open positions for each of the ORC unit valves and/or heat exchanger valves.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">At block <b>814</b>, the master controller <b>402</b> may, based on a determined optimal or efficient working fluid flow, determine whether to adjust the one or more ORC unit valves. Other valves within the system <b>400</b> may be adjusted based on the optimal or efficient working fluid flow, such as one or more heat exchanger valves and/or one or more wellhead fluid valves. If it is determined that the ORC unit valves or any other valves are to be adjusted, the master controller <b>402</b>, at block <b>816</b>, may transmit a signal to the valve to be adjusted indicating a new open position or closed position for the valve to adjust to. After the signal is transmitted, the valve may automatically adjust to the position indicated. If the valve is not to be adjusted or after the valves have been adjusted, the master controller <b>402</b> may determine operating conditions again. In an example, the master controller <b>402</b> may wait for a period of time, allowing the system to adjust to the new temperatures and flow rates or to reach equilibrium, prior to determining the operating conditions.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref> are block diagrams illustrating novel implementations of one or more geothermal power generation enabled wells to provide electrical power to one or more of in-field equipment, equipment at one of the other wells, energy storage devices, and the grid power structure, according to one or more embodiment of the disclosure.

In addition, the substantially skeletonized frame <b>1010</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>H</figref> further can help reduce weight of the mobile heat generation unit for ease of transport, loading, and unloading of the mobile heat generation unit at a hydrocarbon production site or other location.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">By way of example only, in embodiments, mobile heat generation units can be constructed with 1-2 heat exchangers in a package, skid or module having a length of about 20 feet, a width of approximately 8-10 feet, and a height of at least 8 feet, and can be transported and delivered to a site by a conventional semi-tractor trailer. In other embodiments, the mobile heat generation units can be constructed with a length upwards of approximately 40 feet, a width of approximately 8-10 feet, and a height of at least approximately 8 feet and can incorporate more (e.g. 3-6) heat exchangers. Other varying sizes and configurations of the prepackaged mobile heat generation units according the principals of the present disclosure, also can be provided. The construction of the mobile heat generation unit as a substantially pre-assembled/pre-configured module or package enables production of substantially uniform or generally standardized heat generation units that produced off-site with one or more selected heat exchangers, including high pressure heat exchangers configured to receive heated fluid flows of a selected type, e.g. high temperature high pressure liquid or gas fluid flows, and/or different capacity heat exchangers, packaged therein for ease and efficiency of shipment and installation at a site.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>H</figref>, a series of cover panels <b>1026</b> can be installed along the upper or top portion <b>1011</b>, the sides <b>1013</b>, and the proximal and distal ends <b>1014</b> and <b>1016</b> of the frame <b>1010</b>. The cover panels can form a protective skin or outer covering to enclose the chamber <b>1018</b> and operative components of the mobile heat generation unit contained therein. While the operative components of the mobile heat generation unit generally will be weather resistant rated (including the heat exchanger(s) <b>1005</b>), the cover panels <b>1026</b> can help protect such components from extreme weather and during transport and deter access thereto by unauthorized personnel, animals, etc. during transport and after installation.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">The cover panels generally can be formed from a rigid, durable material, such as a corrugated steel or other, similar metal material selected for durability without substantially increasing the weight of the overall package of the mobile heat generation unit, while enclosing and protecting the operative components of the mobile heat generation unit. Other rigid, durable materials also can be used for the cover panels. At least some of the cover panels <b>1026</b> further can be releasibly attached or mounted to the peripheral frame beams <b>1017</b>, such as by a limited number (e.g., 5-10) of bolts, screws or other fasteners or other mechanical connections. As a result, at least a portion of the cover panels can be selectively removable as needed for enabling access to the chamber defined within the frame, and to the operative components of the mobile heat generation unit housed therein.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">For example, if there is a need or a desire to change one or more of the heat exchangers <b>1005</b> of the mobile heat generation unit <b>1002</b>, such as to substitute an exhaust heat exchanger for a different capacity or type of heat exchanger (e.g. a heat exchanger designed to extract heat from compressed gas or from a heated fluid or a high pressure fluid such as a wellhead fluid) one or more of the cover panels <b>1026</b> along the top or upper portion <b>1011</b> of the frame <b>1010</b> can be removed, as can one or more of the additional beams or supports <b>1019</b> as needed, to enable the removal and/or change-out of one or both of the heat exchangers through the top of the frame.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Such a change-out or substitution of the heat exchangers can be accomplished without requiring a substantial reconstruction of the entire mobile heat generation unit, and can be accomplished in the field e.g. at the hydrocarbon production site or other location, or can be done at a manufacturing or storage facility. The mobile heat generation units of the present disclosure thus can be reconfigured as needed without affecting their ability to be produced and transported to a site as pre-packaged, substantially ready-to-use modular mobile heat generation units that also can be relocated from one site to another without having to substantially deconstruct and the reconstruct the entire heat exchange assembly at each site. In addition, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>B and <b>12</b>C</figref>, selected ones of the cover panels also can be provided with pre-defined ports or openings to receive and connect the exhaust conducts or ducts or piping supplying the heated fluid to the one or more heat exchangers.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>H</figref>, in some embodiments the heat exchangers <b>1005</b> of the mobile heat generation unit <b>1002</b> generally will be mounted on raised platforms <b>1030</b> within the chamber <b>1018</b> of the frame so as to locate the heat exchangers at raised or elevated positions. This can facilitate access to and removal of the heat exchangers from the top of the frame of the mobile heat generation unit, and further can facilitate access thereto from within the chamber for servicing. In addition, in the illustrated embodiment showing two heat exchangers <b>1005</b> mounted within the chamber, one of the heat exchangers is illustrated as being arranged adjacent the distal end <b>1016</b> of the frame, while the other heat exchanger is located closer to the proximal end <b>1014</b> of the frame.

For example, cover panels <b>1026</b> arranged on opposite the sides of the mobile heat generation unit can be removed or can be provided with ports or openings through which the exhaust conduits or ducts extending from the one or more heat sources and the vent or outlet pipes connected to the heat exchangers are received.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, each exhaust conduit or duct <b>1004</b> can include a damper valve <b>1043</b> that can be selectively opened and closed by an actuator <b>1044</b>, such as a motor or hydraulic actuator, under control of the controller <b>1035</b> for the mobile heat generation unit. A pressure sensor <b>1046</b> can be provided at or near the junction or connecting pipe <b>1047</b> between each exhaust conduit and its heat associated exchanger to measure an incoming flow rate or pressure of the exhaust gas being supplied along each exhaust conduit or duct <b>1004</b> to the heat exchangers. Based on a measured pressure or fluid flow rate, the damper valves <b>1043</b> can be opened or closed as needed to control the pressure and/or mass flow volume of the exhaust gasses feeding into the heat exchangers.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">In addition, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that while a pair of heat exchangers are shown in a present embodiment, in other embodiments, a single heat exchanger could be used, or more than two heat exchangers also can be used, e.g. the mobile heat generation unit can be packaged with 3, 4, 5 or 6 (or more) heat exchangers.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">Each mobile heat generation unit further will include a fluid recirculation system <b>1050</b>, along which the second fluid path <b>1007</b> is defined an extends.

As the working fluid is moved along the second fluid path through the closed fluid recirculation loop defined between the ORC unit and the mobile heat generation unit, the working fluid is heated by transfer of heat from the heated flow passing through the heat exchangers along the first fluid path so that the working fluid will be output and supplied to the ORC unit at a temperature approximately at or above its boiling point, whereupon the liquid working fluid will change from a liquid to vapor phase.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">As the heated (e.g. vaporous phase) working fluid is circulated through the ORC unit, it can pass through a gas expander that can rotate so as to drive a generator <b>1061</b> for generation of electrical power, such as discussed above with respect to embodiments of the ORC unit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>H</figref>.

Thereafter, the working fluid can pass through a condenser and/or heat sink that can condenses the vaporous working fluid to a substantially cooled, liquid state that is provided back to the mobile heat generation unit via the fluid inlet conduit <b>1051</b>.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">As discussed with respect to the above embodiments, the ORC unit further generally will include a controller that can monitor the incoming and outgoing working fluid flows, e.g. receiving inputs from a series of sensors <b>1062</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) monitoring pressure, temperature, etc. of the working fluid and can control the flow thereof to prevent the heated working fluid flow from looping back on itself. The controller of the ORC unit further can be connected to the controller of the mobile heat generation unit by a data connection, such as by a common data and power connection or coupling through which power can be supplied to the mobile heat generation unit and data transferred between the mobile heat generation unit from the ORC unit. As also noted, each ORC unit connected to the mobile heat generation unit can be configured and can be operated in accordance with any of the above discussed embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>D-<b>10</b>E</figref> and, the fluid intake conduit <b>1051</b> can include a coupling <b>1068</b> at a first end thereof, which coupling generally can be arranged along the top or upper portion <b>1012</b> of the frame <b>1010</b>, at the proximal end <b>1014</b> thereof. The fluid intake conduit generally will initially extend into the chamber along the upper portion thereof, extending over the control area/first section <b>1031</b>B, and as it enters the second section <b>1031</b>B of the chamber, can be directed downwardly to connect to the pump <b>1057</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>G</figref>, for supplying the working fluid received from the ORC unit at a first temperature wherein the working fluid is in a substantially cooled, liquid phase.

The pump <b>1057</b> will receive and pump the working fluid along a flow path <b>1066</b> defined by the array of piping <b>1058</b> arranged within the second section <b>1031</b>B of the chamber to feed the working fluid through the heat exchangers.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>D-<b>10</b>G</figref>, the first section of piping <b>1059</b>A extends from the pump <b>1057</b> to a splitter or manifold <b>1067</b> having control valve <b>1068</b>, and which forms a T-junction between first section of piping <b>1059</b>A and each heat exchanger <b>1005</b>. The working fluid can be divided between and supplied to each heat exchanger wherein the working fluid passing along the second fluid path <b>1007</b> through each heat exchanger will be heated via heat transfer from the heated fluid flows passing along the first fluid path through each heat exchanger. The controller <b>1035</b> of the mobile heat generation unit can monitor the flow of heated fluid coming into each heat exchanger (e.g. the mass flow of incoming exhaust gas), and can accordingly adjust the flow of working fluid supplied to each heat exchanger through manipulation of the control valve <b>1068</b> to ensure substantially optimum operation of the heat exchangers, and to provide a maximum heated working fluid outflow for supply to the ORC unit.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">As indicated, the control valve <b>1068</b> of the splitter <b>1057</b> can be opened and closed to selectively divert more or less volumes of the working fluid into each of the heat exchangers through an inlet port <b>1070</b> adjacent a first or upstream portion thereof. As the working fluid passes through the heat exchangers, heat from the incoming heated fluid flow (e.g. heated exhaust gases passing along the first fluid path) is transferred to the working fluid. The working fluid is heated within the heat exchangers to a second temperature that is greater than the first temperature, and which generally will be at or above a boiling point of the working fluid whereupon the working fluid changes to its a vapor phase as it is output from the heat exchangers through a downstream port <b>1071</b> and to the second section of piping <b>1059</b>B of the array of piping. The heated working fluid thereafter can be fed through a manifold <b>1072</b> that can include a control valve <b>1073</b> operable to regulate the flow of the heated working fluid from one or both of the heat exchangers for feeding to the ORC unit. The manifold generally will be linked to the fluid outlet conduit <b>1052</b>, which will extend along a portion of the chamber and will be directed upwardly to the top or upper portion of the chamber, terminating at an outlet coupling or connector <b>1074</b> adjacent to the top portion of the frame at the approximately and thereof.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>C-<b>10</b>D and <b>11</b></figref>, the mobile heat generation unit <b>1002</b> can include an expander <b>1076</b> having an expansion tank <b>1077</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>), with an inlet valve <b>1078</b> that can be controlled (e.g. opened and closed) by the controller <b>1035</b> of the mobile heat generation unit. One or more pressure sensors <b>1079</b> can be provided along the array of piping so as to detect an increase in pressure of the incoming working fluid that would raise its temperature substantially toward its vapor point, and in response, the controller can open the inlet valve of the expansion tank, to enable excess working fluid to be drawn off so as to reduce or control the pressure of the flow of working fluid as needed.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">In addition, an air separator can be provided along array of piping, for example along the second section of piping. The air separator generally will be configured and can be operable to filter out particulates from the working fluid, and/or to drain or bleed off excess air from the recirculating system <b>1050</b>, such as on startup of the mobile heat generation unit.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the mobile heat generation unit <b>1002</b> can include, or can be connected to, a weather station <b>1080</b> having an array of weather sensors configured to monitor and report environmental conditions at or around a hydrocarbon production site location at which the mobile heat generation unit is installed. For example, sensors measuring ambient temperature, barometric pressure and other environmental conditions can be provided, either as part of a standalone weather station connected to the mobile heat generation unit, or as an included array of sensors within the transportable package defined by mobile heat generation unit. The readings of temperature, pressure, etc. relating to the ambient weather conditions will be supplied to the controller <b>1035</b> for the mobile heat generation unit, which accordingly can adjust the intake of the heated fluid flow from the heat source(s) along the first fluid path into and through the one or more heat exchangers and/or the circulation of the working fluid along the second fluid path, based on such measured ambient weather conditions. For example, the controller can open or close one or more of the damper and/or control valves for regulating or diverting the incoming heated fluid flow, and/or the flow of the working fluid between the heat exchangers as needed to ensure a substantially consistent flow of the highest temperature working fluid to be produced and supplied to the ORC unit.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">The mobile heat generation unit additionally will include UPC battery backup or other alternative power source that can automatically be engaged. In the event that exhaust streams or other incoming streams or flows of the heated fluid fail, and/or the mobile heat generation unit loses a connection to a direct power source (e.g. an ORC unit providing to a direct power source to the mobile heat generation unit is shut down or otherwise the power connection is lost), the battery backup system can be automatically turned on to provide power to the controller <b>1035</b> and at least some of the operative components of the mobile heat generation unit.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">In embodiments, the mobile heat generation unit further can include one or more drain or dump valves arranged along the array of piping. While the array of piping generally will be insulated to both prevent or reduce the incidence of personnel being burned or otherwise injured when they come into contact with such piping, and protect the piping from subfreezing temperatures, in the event of a system power loss and/or loss of the flows of heated fluid into the mobile heat generation unit, and subfreezing temperatures being detected by the controller, the controller can engage and operate one or more of the drain or dump valves to enable drainage of deionized water out of the array of piping in order to prevent freezing of the deionized water within the piping, which can cause splitting or otherwise damage to the operative components of the mobile heat generation unit.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">As noted above, the mobile heat generation unit <b>1002</b> according to the present embodiment, can be used in place of one or more high pressure heat exchangers as disclosed with respect to any of the embodiments disclosed and/or taught by the present disclosure.

The pre-packaged mobile heat generation unit can be easily transported, such as by a semi-tractor trailer, and can be located and installed at a site being easily and efficiently connected or coupled to a heat source and to an ORC unit at the site, without having to separately ship components such as heat exchangers and assemble such components at the site. Additional mobile heat generation units further can be transported to a job site, and can be connected in series to a previously installed mobile heat generation unit and to additional heat sources, as well as one or more ORC units as needed.
