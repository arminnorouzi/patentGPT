Typically, the endoscope comprises an elongated insertion tube with a handle at the proximal end as seen from the operator and visual inspections means, such as a built in camera, at the distal end of the elongated insertion tube. This convention of distal and proximal, proximal being the end closest to the operator and distal being the end remote from the operator, as used above for the endoscope in general will, where applicable, be adhered to for all parts throughout this description. Electrical wiring for the camera and other electronics such as LED lighting run along the inside of the elongated insertion tube from the handle to the tip at the distal end. Instead of using cameras, endoscopes may also be fiber-optic, in which case the optical fibers run along inside of the elongated insertion tube. Also, a working channel may run along the inside of the insertion tube from the handle to the tip, e.g. allowing liquid to be removed from the body cavity or allowing the insertion of surgical instruments or the like into the body cavity.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore, in order to be able to maneuver the endoscope inside the body cavity, the distal end of the endoscope may comprise a section with increased flexibility, e.g. an articulated tip part allowing the operator to bend this section. Typically this is done by tensioning or slacking pull-wires in a guide tube also running along the inside of the elongated insertion tube from the articulated tip part to a control mechanism with an operating member in the handle in an arrangement commonly known as a Bowden cable, cf. Bowden's original patent U.S. Pat. No. 609,570.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The pull-wire running along the inside of the guide tube of a Bowden cable normally extends with a predetermined length over either end allowing an operating member to be attached to a free end, in the following referred to as the proximal end, and an operated member to attached to the other free end, in the following referred to as the distal end. When the ends of the guide tube are held stationary, movement of the proximal end of the pull-wire with respect to the guide tube is transmitted to the distal end as a corresponding movement of the distal end of the pull-wire with respect to the guide tube, so as to effect a movement of the operated member.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is a known in the art to provide a mechanical member holding the proximal end of guide tube in endoscopes. For instance U.S. Pat. No. 4,203,430 discloses an arrangement where the proximal ends of the pull-wires are terminated in internally threaded adjustment cylinders. Generally, the fastening of the proximal end of the guide tube to the operating handle is achieved with mechanical means where the guide tube is clamped or terminated in a block member, which however contributes to increasing the number of part required to assembly the control mechanism of the endoscope.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Based on this prior art it is the object of the present invention to provide an endoscope, preferably a disposable endoscope, which reduces the amount of mechanical parts required to assemble the control mechanism.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a first aspect of the invention this is achieved with an endoscope having an operating handle comprising a handle housing arranged at a proximal end thereof and an insertion tube extending from said handle towards a distal end of the endoscope and terminating in a steerable tip part at the distal end of the endoscope, the endoscope further comprising a control mechanism with a Bowden cable having an outer guide tube having a first length between a proximal end and a distal end of said outer guide tube and an inner pull-wire having a second length between a proximal end and a distal end of said inner pull-wire, said second length being longer than said first length, the proximal end of the outer guide tube is affixed to the operating handle by means of an adhesive. This allows for a simple and practical configuration and assembly of the Bowden cable arrangement and the required number of parts and costs to obtain good bending properties of the distal tip by adhering a portion of the outer surface of the outer guide tube to the operating handle. Furthermore, the utilized adhesive used as assembly means is already at hand for assembly of other parts of single use endoscopes.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a further preferred embodiment the endoscope further comprises a working channel extending from the operating handle to the tip part, the outer guide tube is affixed by means of an adhesive to the working channel at at least one point between the operating handle and the tip part. This configuration has shown to increase the bending properties at the distal tip while still reducing the number of mechanical parts and costs for assembly of the Bowden cable arrangement.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a further embodiment that facilitates assembly of the endoscope, the adhesive is a reactive adhesive, preferably an UV adhesive.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In yet a further embodiment an inner surface of the operating handle is provided with a first recess wherein the outer guide tube is positioned and affixed by means of the adhesive. This ensures a correct position of the Bowden cable arrangement with respect to other mechanical and movable parts inside the operating handle. It furthermore allows correct and precise application of the correct amount of adhesive as the position is readily indicated to the operator at the assembly line.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further improved practical embodiment the recess has a length and the adhesive is located in the most distal 2/3 of the length of the recess. This allows correct mounting and fastening of the outer guide tube when these are cut to various lengths, i.e. small tolerances of the outer guide tube length can be accepted.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a further embodiment the inner surface of the operating handle comprises a second recess for receiving the on outer guide tube of a second Bowden cable and in that the recesses are located in the same side of the operating handle. This provides an improved bending range of the distal tip as a second Bowden cable arrangement may be provided, while a practical guidance of the pull-wires towards the operating member is ensured.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In a further improved embodiment the operating handle has a height and that a proximal end of the first recess is located at a higher height than a proximal end of the second recess.

The endoscope <b>1</b> has a proximal end with an operating handle <b>2</b> to be held in one hand by an operator. Accordingly, the operating handle is shaped in a manner ergonomically suitable for operator, in particular but not exclusively for the hand of the operator, as arms and joints may also play a role in the ergonomics. From the handle <b>2</b> an insertion tube <b>3</b> extends towards the distal end of the endoscope. At the distal end of the endoscope <b>1</b> the insertion tube <b>3</b> ends in a bending section <b>4</b> and a tip part <b>5</b>. The bending section <b>4</b> is in mechanical connection with an operating member <b>6</b>, digitally operable by the operator, e.g. by the thumb, thereby allowing the operator to bend the tip part <b>5</b> in a desired direction when advancing the insertion tube <b>3</b> towards a desired location, e.g. through a body cavity of a patient. As can also be seen the endoscope <b>1</b> comprises a flexible connection cable <b>7</b> with a connector <b>8</b> allowing the endoscope <b>1</b> to be connected to a monitoring device such as a monitor <b>92</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> forming part of an endoscope <b>1</b> and monitor <b>92</b> system.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>1</b></figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>an exploded view of the endoscope <b>1</b> is shown. As mentioned, the endoscope <b>1</b> has an operating handle <b>2</b> at the proximal end thereof i.e. at the left-hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The operating handle <b>2</b> is assembled from and comprises a number of handle parts to be described later. From the operating handle <b>1</b>, the insertion tube <b>3</b> comprising a number of insertion tube parts to be described later extends towards the distal end of the endoscope, i.e. towards the right-hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The operating handle <b>2</b> comprises at least two shell parts <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> forming the outer housing walls of the handle housing of the operating handle <b>2</b>. The two shell parts <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> form the outer housing walls and are shaped to provide an ergonomically suitable operating handle for an operator, gripping it with one hand. In addition to the two shell parts <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> a transition part <b>11</b> forming the transition from the operating handle to the insertion. Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>1</b></figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>an exploded view of the endoscope <b>1</b> is shown. As mentioned, the endoscope <b>1</b> has an operating handle <b>2</b> at the proximal end thereof i.e. at the left-hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>. The operating handle <b>2</b> is assembled from and comprises a number of handle parts to be described later. From the operating handle <b>1</b>, the insertion tube <b>3</b> comprising a number of insertion tube parts to be described later extends towards the distal end of the endoscope, i.e. towards the right-hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The two shell parts <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> are adapted to engage and be held and be supported by a chassis <b>12</b>, in turn, adapted to support said at least two shells parts <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> by suitable engagement means, such as recesses and/or protrusions <b>13</b> interlocking with suitable complementary means <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> on the chassis <b>12</b>, better visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>. Furthermore the shell part <b>10</b> has pair of columns <b>88</b> of which only one is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref><i>a. </i>These columns <b>88</b> serve the attachment of the shell part <b>10</b> to the chassis <b>12</b>. The shell part has internal engagement means (not visible) at adapted to engage the shell part <b>9</b> at the proximal end of the endoscope <b>1</b>, so as hold them together. At the other end the shell parts are held together by the transition part</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Turning now to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> the chassis <b>12</b> will be described in greater detail. The chassis <b>12</b> preferably shell shaped, i.e. said chassis comprises an essentially shell shaped structure with a shell wall having an inner surface <b>16</b> and an outer surface <b>17</b> linked by an edge <b>18</b>, said essentially shell shaped structure defining an interior compartment <b>19</b> delimited by said inner surface <b>16</b> and the edge <b>18</b> of the shell wall, the edge thus defining main opening <b>20</b> of said interior compartment <b>19</b>. It will be understood that the chassis <b>12</b> can be designed mainly based on technical requirements, such as kinematic chains of movable parts, and thus be optimized for those technical requirements without having to inherit constraints from the ergonomic requirements of the handle <b>2</b>, i.e. the shape of the two shell parts <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Best visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> are a number of different apertures and cut-outs formed in the chassis <b>12</b>. These apertures form vias for different purposes between the interior compartment <b>19</b> and the exterior of the chassis <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The different cut-outs and apertures differ in shape, size, location and lay-out depending on their purposes, and may as mentioned be designed according to technical requirements, independently of the ergonomic requirements of the handle <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Starting from the proximal end of the endoscope <b>1</b> there is an aperture <b>21</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The aperture <b>21</b> accommodates a push button <b>22</b>, so that the push-button <b>22</b> extends from the interior compartment of the chassis <b>12</b> to the exterior, and on through an aperture in the shell part <b>9</b> to be accessible by an operator holding the handle <b>2</b> of the endoscope <b>1</b>. The push-button <b>22</b> is preferably biased towards an external position by means of two coil springs <b>83</b> guided by two guiding columns <b>84</b> fixed in the bottom two wells provided in the chassis <b>12</b>, preferably by gluing using UV-curable glue or resin transmitted through the transparent material of the chassis <b>12</b>. The two guiding columns <b>83</b> further serve to reduce friction between the coil springs <b>83</b> and the columns <b>88</b>. They are therefore preferably made of a material with relatively low friction, such as low-density polyethylene LDPE, e.g. Cosmothene&#xae; 4812.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">On the outer surface <b>17</b> of the shell wall of the chassis <b>12</b> two lugs with holes <b>89</b> are provided. These serve to engage the columns <b>88</b> on the shell part <b>10</b> for attaching it to the chassis, as described above.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the shell wall two elongate apertures <b>23</b> in the form of slits are provided. The two elongate apertures <b>23</b> are preferably arranged as a pair, one on either side of the aperture <b>23</b>. The two elongate apertures <b>23</b> serve as guide means for the push-button by accommodating a respective protrusion <b>24</b> provided on the surface of the push-button <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the vicinity of the two elongate apertures <b>23</b>, a first and a second pair of apertures <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> in the form of essentially cylindrical through holes are provided. The first pair of essentially cylindrical apertures serve as pivotal bearings for trunnions <b>27</b> of a control lever <b>28</b> for manoeuvring the bending section <b>5</b> via an arrangement of a pair of Bowden pulls <b>29</b>. As can best be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the control lever <b>28</b> is attached to the control knob <b>6</b>, and at least the control knob extends to the outside of the endoscope handle <b>2</b> through a slit <b>30</b> in the shell part <b>10</b> to be accessible by a thumb of the an operator. It should be noted that it is not essential for the function as bearings for the trunnions <b>27</b> of the control knob, that the holes are though holes, but because the chassis is preferably injection moulded, through holes may be much easier manufactured than e.g. blind holes.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The second pair of apertures <b>26</b> are preferably also circular through holes and have the same diameter. They need not be circular, however, as their purpose is allowing the insertion of a tool, such as a rod in order to immobilise the control lever <b>28</b> during assembly of the endoscope, more specifically when attaching the proximal ends of the pull wires <b>31</b> of the two Bowden pulls <b>29</b> to the control lever <b>28</b>. Accordingly, the control lever <b>28</b> has a through hole <b>32</b>, corresponding in size to the apertures <b>26</b>, and adapted to align with these in one position of the control lever <b>28</b>, thereby allowing the insertion of the tool through all three holes, <b>26</b>, <b>32</b>, so as to block movement of the control lever <b>28</b> with respect to the chassis <b>12</b>. The position of the three holes <b>26</b>, <b>32</b> are selected so as to block the control lever <b>28</b> in a position later corresponding to a neutral position of the control lever <b>28</b> and knob <b>6</b>, in which the bending section <b>4</b> is straight.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">With the control lever <b>28</b> blocked during assembly the cables <b>31</b> Bowden pull may be attached to the control lever <b>28</b> in a well defined manner. This is preferably done by threading the respective free end of each cable <b>31</b> through suitable passages in the control lever <b>28</b>, forming a loop <b>43</b> by looping the free ends back to the respective cable and crimping the free end onto the cable <b>31</b> using a barrel <b>33</b>. The barrel <b>33</b> may be of the open barrel type, to avoid the hazel of sliding the barrel <b>33</b> on onto the cable <b>31</b> prior to crimping. Evidently, other attachments for the loop <b>43</b>, such as protrusions, may also be used. Furthermore, entirely different attachments methods without loops are also envisaged, albeit not preferred.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">To facilitate this assembly process a cross-shaped aperture <b>34</b> is located in the vicinity of the bottom of the chassis <b>12</b>, i.e. away from the main opening <b>20</b> defined by the edge <b>18</b>. Likewise a cut-out <b>35</b> in the wall from the edge <b>18</b> is provided. The cross-shaped aperture <b>34</b> and the cut-out <b>35</b> allows access to the cables <b>31</b> various tools, such as holding and crimping tools during the assembly.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As can best be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> the cross-shaped aperture <b>34</b> a further, essentially rectangular aperture is generally aligned with a further rectangular access aperture <b>36</b> and a pentagonal aperture <b>37</b> in the direction towards the proximal end of the endoscope <b>1</b>. The cross-shaped aperture <b>34</b>, the rectangular aperture <b>36</b> and the pentagonal aperture <b>37</b> are separated by respective bridges <b>38</b> and <b>39</b>. These bridges <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> do not follow the general curvature of the outer surface <b>17</b> of the chassis <b>12</b> but are indented to form a generally V-shaped groove <b>40</b> connecting the cross-shaped aperture <b>34</b> to the pentagonal aperture <b>37</b> via the rectangular aperture <b>36</b>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, this V-shaped groove <b>40</b> in the outer surface <b>17</b> provides the outer surface <b>17</b> with a means for guiding one or more movable parts, in particular the cable <b>31</b> of the Bowden pull between two apertures, such as the cross-shaped aperture <b>34</b> and the pentagonal aperture <b>37</b> along the outer surface <b>17</b> outside of the interior compartment <b>19</b>. This in turn allows the unsupported free end of the pull wire <b>31</b> of the Bowden pull arrangement to follow a straight line. At the same time, because the unsupported free end of the pull wire <b>31</b> passes from the interior compartment <b>19</b> of the chassis <b>12</b> to the exterior via the cross-shaped aperture <b>34</b>, the pull wire <b>31</b> becomes easily accessible for the assembly tools, in particular the crimping tool. The cross-shape of the cross-shaped aperture, in turn, facilitates the use of the tools by providing the necessary space for opening and closing the tools, be it a crimping tool or a holding tool.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> a further pair apertures <b>41</b> in the form of essentially cylindrical through holes can be seen. Similar to the apertures <b>25</b>, the further pair of apertures <b>41</b> serve as bearings of trunnions <b>42</b> carrying a pinion <b>44</b>. The pinion <b>44</b> is adapted to be in engagement with a curved rack <b>45</b> having a first free end <b>46</b> and a second end with trunnions <b>47</b> held loosely in suitable receptacles inside the push button <b>22</b>. The rack <b>45</b> as such is loosely held in a guideway comprising a first side <b>85</b>, a second side <b>86</b> and a curved bottom <b>87</b> adapted to keep the rack <b>45</b> in engagement with the pinion <b>44</b>, cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The first side <b>85</b> and the second side <b>86</b> as well as the curved bottom <b>87</b> are preferably formed integrally with the remainder of the chassis <b>12</b>, e.g. in an injection moulding process. The first side is preferably constituted by a plane surface of a thickened part of the wall, i.e. a raised part of the inner surface <b>16</b> of the chassis <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The entire insertion tube <b>3</b> is sealingly encapsulated in a flexible outer tube. The outer tube comprises a first outer tube section <b>80</b> and a second outer tube section <b>81</b> joined with a sleeve <b>82</b>. The first outer tube section <b>80</b> is more flexible than the second tube section <b>81</b> in order to comply with the movements of the bending section <b>5</b>. The second tubular member <b>73</b> is however still quite flexible. More specifically, the second tubular member <b>73</b> and a second outer tube section <b>81</b> surrounding it are so flexible that they allow a loose knot to be tied on the insertion tube <b>3</b>. The alternative is a rigid or semi-rigid endoscope where the insertion portion is rigid, only slightly bendable or hinged, and which does not allow a knot to be tied on the insertion tube. Starting from the distal end of the insertion tube <b>3</b> there is provided a working channel formed by a first tube segment <b>72</b> attached to and preferably embedded in the tip part <b>4</b> at one end. The second end of the first tube segment <b>72</b> is connected to a first end of a second tube segment <b>73</b> by means of a short length of rigid tubing <b>74</b>. Rigid in this sense is to mean more rigid than the second tube segment <b>73</b> which, in turn, is more rigid than the first tube segment <b>72</b> which has to comply with the flexibility requirements of the bending section <b>5</b></p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A transparent plastic material is advantageous in that it more efficiently allows dispersion of light and hence better allows parts to be joined and/or sealed using an UV curable glue or resin, i.e. an adhesive that hardens under the influence of ultraviolet light. In respect of glue or resin, be it UV curable or not, it has been found that simply gluing the proximal end portions of the outer guide tubes <b>60</b> of the Bowden pulls <b>29</b> to the operating handle is sufficient to secure the Bowden pulls <b>29</b> in position. Hence it has been realised that in a simply cost reducing and efficient embodiment of a single use endoscope, an outer surface of the outer guide tubes <b>60</b> can be adhered to the operating handle in order to secure the Bowden pulls <b>29</b> in position. I.e. a part of the outer surface of the outer guide tube adjacent to the most proximal part of the outer guide tube is adhered to the operating handle. This is primarily, because, as it has been realized, adjustment is not needed. Adjustment, in turn, is not necessary because any slacking of the pull-wire <b>31</b> of the Bowden pull <b>29</b> is negligible in a disposable endoscope <b>1</b>. The pull-wires <b>31</b> are not under any substantial tension during shelf life and will hardly undergo any mentionable stretching during the one short occasion the disposable endoscope <b>1</b> is in use. Preferably, the outer guide tubes <b>60</b> are made of a coiled wire. Preferably a coiled stainless steel wire, which also has shown to hardly undergo any stretching during shelf life and use as required for a single-use endoscope.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows in more detail the recesses <b>61</b> provided along the inner surface of the operating handle <b>2</b>. In the embodiment shown recesses <b>61</b> are provided in a chassis <b>12</b> which is a part of the operating handle. Evidently, the recesses may be provided on the inner surfaces of the shell parts <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> forming the shell structure of the operating handle <b>2</b>. Likewise, the proximal end of the outer guide tubes <b>60</b> of the Bowden pulls <b>29</b> may be glued directly to the operating handle without the provision of recesses <b>61</b>. The recesses <b>61</b> are provided in one side of the operating handle <b>2</b> and are formed by upright standing wall sections <b>63</b> forming the elongate recesses <b>61</b> extending in the proximal-distal longitudinal direction of the operating handle <b>2</b>, wherein the outer guide tubes are positioned as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The recesses <b>61</b> may share a wall section <b>63</b> and the side wall of the operating handle may form part of the recesses <b>61</b>. The recesses <b>61</b> are elongate with a length I as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>. To keep the outer guide tubes <b>60</b> in the desired position in the recesses <b>61</b> they are adhered and thereby affixed to the recesses, preferably the adhesive is an UV curable glue or resin, i.e. one that hardens under the influence of ultraviolet light. Dots of applied adhesive <b>64</b> are indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. It is preferred that the adhesive is applied in the most distal 2/3 of the recesses indicated with 2/3 I in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>. This provides more tolerance to the length of the outer guide tubes and ensures that they are affixed to the operating handle even if they are provided to the shorter side within the tolerances. Evidently, the adhesive may be applied in many different manners as long as it serves the purpose of affixing the outer guide tube <b>60</b> to the operating handle <b>2</b> so that the pull-wire may be keep its tension during self-life and use. Hence the adhesive may be applied before or after the outer tube is positioned as desired and even application of adhesive both before and after positioning of the outer guide tube is possible.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As indicated with h in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref> the operating handle <b>2</b> has a height h and the proximal end of the two recesses <b>61</b> are located at different locations along the height h. Thereby the recesses also serves a guide means of the pull-wires <b>31</b> towards the control lever <b>28</b>. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>this is desirable because the pull-wires <b>31</b> are fastened to the control lever <b>28</b> at different heights.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It has also shown advantageous to adhere the outer guide tubes <b>60</b> of the Bowden pulls <b>29</b> to an outer surface of the working channel in order to improve the bending properties of the distal tip <b>4</b>. This is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> where <b>62</b> indicated points where the guide tube is affixed to the working channel by means of an adhesive, preferably to the second tubular member <b>73</b>. In the embodiment three points between the operating handle and the bending section <b>4</b> are indicated, but at least one point would suffice. Again an UV curable glue or resin, i.e. an adhesive that hardens under the influence of ultraviolet light, which is used for gluing other parts of the operating handle, and especially the proximal ends of the outer guide tubes to the operating handle, is suitable as adhesive to glue the parts together.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The embodiments described in the above description of how to implement the solutions of the invention are only examples.
