Many collectable cards are graded and placed in a hard clear plastic case. The case is intended to be permanent in most cases and it is desirable to keep the case from being damaged so the view of the card is not encumbered by scratches and dents.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Collectable cards are normally shipped in boxes with protective filler such as packing peanuts or bubble wrap. Although this is generally adequate protection for a single card in a protective case, when several cards are shipped together they can often end up rubbing against one another and damaging each other. Also, the cards do not arrive in a presentable manner. The person receiving the cards has to carefully unwrap the cards and place the cards in a separate device for presentation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Most devices used for presenting cards would provide very little protection for the cards or are too bulky to ship one or even a handful of cards.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disclosed device is unique when compared with other known devices and solutions because it provides a protective case that can be used both for shipping and for display.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosed device is unique in that it is structurally different from other known devices or solutions. More specifically, the device is unique due to the presence of: (1) a case with an indent for a card or similar item and connecting items for connecting the protective case to another protective case or other protective element; and (2) a case with a flat bottom balanced to stand and display the card or other item either alone or while connected to other cases or protective elements.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example front view of a protective case.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example front view of two connected protective cases.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example bottom view of the two connected protective cases with the cases folded together.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an example front view of a protective case connected to a protective case</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an example bottom view of the protective case connected to the protective case with the protective case and the protective case folded together.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an example front view of two connected protective cases.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows an example bottom view of several protective cases and a protective case connected and folded together.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an example front view of a protective case with friction pads.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows an example front view of a protective case with a pressing plate.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows an example front view of a protective case with a turn button.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the Summary above, in this Detailed Description, the claims below, and in the accompanying drawings, reference is made to particular features of the invention. It is to be understood that the disclosure of the invention in this specification includes all possible combinations of such particular features. For example, where a particular feature is disclosed in the context of a particular aspect or embodiment of the invention, or a particular claim, that feature can also be used&#x2014;to the extent possible&#x2014;in combination with and/or in the context of other particular aspects and embodiments of the invention, and in the invention generally.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The term &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and grammatical equivalents thereof are used herein to mean that other components, ingredients, steps, etc. are optionally present. For example, an article &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; (or &#x201c;which comprises&#x201d;) components A, B, and C can consist of (i.e., contain only) components A, B, and C, or can contain not only components A, B, and C but also contain one or more other components.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Where reference is made herein to a method comprising two or more defined steps, the defined steps can be carried out in any order or simultaneously (except where the context excludes that possibility), and the method can include one or more other steps which are carried out before any of the defined steps, between two of the defined steps, or after all the defined steps (except where the context excludes that possibility).</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The term &#x201c;at least&#x201d; followed by a number is used herein to denote the start of a range including that number (which may be a range having an upper limit or no upper limit, depending on the variable being defined). For example, &#x201c;at least 1&#x201d; means 1 or more than 1. The term &#x201c;at most&#x201d; followed by a number is used herein to denote the end of a range, including that number (which may be a range having 1 or 0 as its lower limit, or a range having no lower limit, depending upon the variable being defined). For example, &#x201c;at most 4&#x201d; means 4 or less than 4, and &#x201c;at most 40%&#x201d; means 40% or less than 40%. When, in this specification, a range is given as &#x201c;(a first number) to (a second number)&#x201d; or &#x201c;(a first number)&#x2014; (a second number),&#x201d; this means a range whose limits include both numbers. For example, &#x201c;25 to 100&#x201d; means a range whose lower limit is 25 and upper limit is 100 and includes both <b>25</b> and <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example front view of a protective case <b>100</b>. The protective case <b>100</b> may have a base <b>105</b> with an indent <b>110</b> in the base <b>105</b>. The protective case <b>100</b> may also include first connectors <b>122</b> on a first side of the base <b>105</b> and second connectors <b>124</b> on a second side of the base <b>105</b> opposite the first side. The base <b>105</b> may have a rectangular prism shape with a flat bottom side. The indent <b>110</b> may have a rectangular prism shape as well (which may be complementary to the shape of a collectable card or card case). In some embodiments, other shapes may be used so the indent <b>110</b> conforms to the shape of the object being shipped and/or displayed in the protective case <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Standard collectable cards (not shown) are 3.5 by 2.5 inches. A card case (not shown) for a standard collectible card may be about 4.5 by 3 inches and about 0.25 inches thick.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The indent <b>110</b> may be slightly larger than the size of the card case about 4.55 by 3.05 inches and about 0.25-. 5 inches deep. The base <b>105</b> may have a height of 5-7 inches, width of 4-5 inches and depth of about 0.75-1.25 inches. It may be advantageous to have the indent <b>110</b> be deeper than the thickness of the card case to provide some protection to the card case from objects rubbing the front face of the protective case <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The first connectors <b>122</b> and second connectors <b>124</b> may be part of a hinge system for connecting protective cases <b>100</b> and other protective devices together in a way that connected protectives cases <b>100</b> and other protective items can close (e.g., go face to face) for shipping and storage and open for display and standing on end. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first connectors <b>122</b> may be male connectors for a hinge system and the second connectors <b>124</b> may be female connectors for the hinge system. From the perspective of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first connectors <b>122</b> may be on or around the front left edge of the base <b>105</b> and the second connectors <b>124</b> may be on or around the back right edge of the base <b>105</b>. Restated, the first connectors <b>122</b> and the second connectors <b>124</b> may be on opposite edges of the base <b>105</b>. The first connectors <b>122</b> may have a shank and a ball making up the male connector. The second connectors <b>124</b> may include two prongs with indents complimentary to the ball of the first connector <b>122</b> so that the ball of the first connector <b>122</b> fits securely between the two prongs. Other hinge systems such as hinges that use pins may also be used. The first connectors <b>122</b> and second connectors <b>124</b> may be made of plastic, metal, or other durable material suitable for hinge systems. The base <b>105</b> may be made of plastic, wood, metal, or other materials suitable for protecting and supporting (for display and storage/shipment) a card case or other item.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Protective cases <b>100</b> that hold more than one card case or another item are also possible. For example, multiple indents <b>110</b> may be included in a protective case <b>100</b>. In some non-limiting embodiments protective cases <b>100</b> may have a top component <b>310</b> and a bottom component <b>320</b> whereby top component <b>310</b> and bottom component <b>320</b> are connected by a series of detachable snap fastening connections. When connected together top component <b>310</b> may cover and protect a card place in indent <b>110</b> which is positioned on bottom component <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example front view of two connected protective cases <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an example bottom view of the two connected protective cases <b>100</b> with the cases folded together in a closed position. Each of the protective cases may include a different layout of first connectors and second connectors. For example, one protective case <b>100</b> may have first connectors on a front edge (edge connecting to front side of the base <b>105</b> with the indent <b>110</b>) while the second protective case <b>100</b> may have second connectors on a front edge (edge connecting to a back side of the base <b>105</b> opposite the front side). In this way, the second connectors <b>124</b> on the first protective case (left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and the first connectors <b>122</b> on the second protective case <b>100</b> (right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) can be connected in a way that protective cases <b>100</b> can rotate (relative to each other) to a closed position where the front sides of the protective cases <b>100</b> are proximate to each other and rotate (relative to each other) to an open position where the front sides are visible to a viewer. In the closed position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) the front faces may be about parallel, in an open position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) the front faces may be about 90-180 degrees from each other. The bottom side (viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) of protective cases <b>100</b> may be flat such that the protective case <b>100</b> may be stood up on end on the bottom side. In some embodiments, the protective case <b>100</b> may also be balanced such that the protective case will balance/stay up when stood up on the bottom side (with or without a card case or other item in the indent <b>110</b>).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The first connectors <b>122</b> and second connectors <b>124</b> may extend out and way from the base <b>105</b> (e.g., diagonally away from the front face or back face of the base <b>105</b>) such that the connection between the first connectors <b>122</b> and second connectors <b>124</b> of different protective cases <b>100</b> allows the protective cases <b>100</b> to rotate to a position where the front faces of the protective cases are parallel and proximate to each other.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an example front view of a protective case <b>300</b> connected to a protective case <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an example bottom view of the protective case <b>300</b> connected to the protective case <b>200</b> with the protective case and the protective case folded together in a closed position. The protective case <b>300</b> may be similar to the protective case <b>100</b> in all but that the protective case <b>300</b> only includes first connectors <b>322</b> on a front edge of a base <b>305</b> of the protective case <b>300</b>. The protective case may not include second connectors <b>324</b> (not shown in this figure) on a back edge of the base <b>305</b>. If second connectors <b>324</b> are included on a protective case <b>300</b> then first connectors <b>322</b> may not be included. Restated, the protective case <b>300</b> may include either first connectors <b>322</b> or second connectors <b>324</b> on a front edge of the base <b>305</b>. The base <b>305</b> may include an indent <b>310</b> similar to the indent <b>110</b> of protective case <b>100</b>. The first connectors <b>322</b> and second connectors <b>324</b> of the protective case <b>300</b> may be the same as the first connectors <b>122</b> and second connectors <b>124</b> of the protective case <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The protective case <b>200</b> may have a base <b>205</b> and first connectors <b>222</b> (not shown in this figure) or second connectors <b>224</b> on an edge of the base <b>205</b>. The base <b>205</b> may have similar dimensions to the base <b>305</b> of the protective case <b>300</b> so the protective case <b>200</b> can close over the indent <b>310</b> in the protective case to protect the card case or other item in the indent <b>310</b>. The protective case <b>200</b> may also act to stabilize the protective case <b>300</b> when the protective case <b>200</b> and protective case <b>300</b> are connected and are in an open position and stand on end. The protective case <b>200</b> may be thinner than the protective case <b>300</b> because it does not need to have an indent such as indent <b>310</b> for containing a card case or other item.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an example front view of two connected protective cases <b>300</b>.

The protective case <b>100</b>, protective case <b>300</b>, or protective case <b>200</b> may be connected by connecting in a line with first connectors <b>122</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>322</b> and second connectors <b>124</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>324</b>. At one end of the line a protective case <b>300</b> or protective case <b>200</b> may be connected and at a second end of the line a protective case <b>300</b> or protective case <b>200</b> may be connected so that no additional first connectors <b>122</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>322</b> and second connectors <b>124</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>324</b> stick out from the ends of the line. The middle of the line may be protective cases <b>100</b> that can connect on both sides. The line may have any number of protective cases <b>100</b>, so any number of card cases or other items can be protected by a line of protective case <b>100</b>, protective case <b>300</b>, and/or protective case <b>200</b>.
