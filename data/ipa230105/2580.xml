In this embodiment, the device <b>10</b> is an article of athletic gear for a user engaging in a sport or other athletic activity. More particularly, in this embodiment, the article of athletic gear <b>10</b> is an article of protective athletic gear wearable by the user to protect him/her. Specifically, in this example, the article of protective athletic gear <b>10</b> is a helmet for protecting a head of the user against impacts. In this case, the helmet <b>10</b> is a hockey helmet for protecting the head of the user, who is a hockey player, against impacts (e.g., from a puck or ball, a hockey stick, a board, ice or another playing surface, etc., with another player, etc.).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Each of the post-molded expandable components <b>12</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>12</b><sub>E </sub>of the helmet <b>10</b> is a part of the helmet <b>10</b> that is configured to be expanded or has been expanded after being molded (i.e., shaped in a mold). This may allow each of the post-molded expandable components <b>12</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>12</b><sub>E </sub>of the helmet <b>10</b> to have enhanced characteristics (e.g., be more shock-absorbent, lighter, etc.), to be cost-effectively manufactured (e.g., by using less material and/or making it in various sizes), and/or to be customized for the user (e.g., by custom-fitting it to the user in-store or at another location where it can be expanded to conform to the user).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In this embodiment, the helmet <b>10</b> comprises an outer shell <b>11</b> and an inner liner <b>15</b> that includes the post-molded expandable components <b>12</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>12</b><sub>E </sub>of the helmet <b>10</b>. The helmet <b>10</b> also comprises a chinstrap <b>16</b> for securing the helmet <b>10</b> to the player's head. The helmet <b>10</b> may also comprise a faceguard (not shown) to protect at least part of the player's face (e.g., a grid (sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;cage&#x201d;) or a visor (sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;shield&#x201d;)).</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The helmet <b>10</b> defines a cavity <b>13</b> for receiving the player's head. In response to an impact, the helmet <b>10</b> absorbs energy from the impact to protect the player's head. The helmet <b>10</b> protects various regions of the player's head. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>47</b> and <b>48</b></figref>, the player's head comprises a front region FR, a top region TR, left and right side regions LS, RS, a back region BR, and an occipital region OR. The front region FR includes a forehead and a front top part of the player's head and generally corresponds to a frontal bone region of the player's head. The left and right side regions LS, RS are approximately located above the player's ears. The back region BR is opposite the front region FR and includes a rear upper part of the player's head.

That is, expansion of the precursor <b>12</b><sub>x</sub>* made of the expanded material <b>50</b> to the expanded shape of the post-molded expandable component <b>12</b><sub>x </sub>is caused by energy transmitted to the precursor <b>12</b><sub>x</sub>* made of the expanded material <b>50</b> after the precursor <b>12</b><sub>x</sub>* has been molded (e.g., outside of the mold <b>70</b>).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The expandable material <b>50</b> may be provided in any suitable way and any suitable molding process using the mold <b>70</b> may be used to mold the expandable material <b>50</b> into the precursor <b>12</b><sub>x</sub>*.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In this embodiment, the expandable material <b>50</b> is provided as a fluid flowing into the mold <b>70</b> to undergo the molding process to mold the expandable material <b>50</b> into the precursor <b>12</b><sub>x</sub>*. In particular, in order to obtain the expandable material <b>50</b>, the expandable microspheres <b>60</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>60</b><sub>M </sub>are combined with the polyurethane <b>52</b>. For instance, the expandable microspheres <b>60</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>60</b><sub>M </sub>may be introduced into one or more components of the polyurethane <b>52</b> prior to mixing of the components of the polyurethane <b>52</b> (e.g., isocyanates and/or polyols). For example, in this embodiment, the expandable microspheres <b>60</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>60</b><sub>M </sub>are introduced into the isocyanates of the polyurethane <b>52</b> prior to mixing the isocyanates, the polyols and any other components of the polyurethane <b>52</b> if any.

The expandable microspheres <b>60</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>60</b><sub>M </sub>may be introduced into the polyols of the polyurethane <b>52</b> in other embodiments. Moreover, in this example, the expandable microspheres <b>60</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>60</b><sub>M </sub>are introduced into the polyurethane <b>52</b> as dry unexpanded microspheres.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Also, in this embodiment, the molding process of the precursor <b>12</b><sub>x</sub>* is a low-temperature molding process during which a temperature of the expandable material <b>50</b> being molded is lower than an expansion temperature at which the expandable microspheres <b>60</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>60</b><sub>M </sub>are expanded. For instance, in some embodiments where the expansion temperature of the expandable microspheres <b>60</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>60</b><sub>M </sub>may be 70&#xb0; C. or more, the molding process may be carried out such that the temperature of the expandable material <b>50</b> being molded is less than 70&#xb0; C.

For instance, in this embodiment, the molding process is carried out via a molding apparatus <b>75</b> comprising the mold <b>70</b>. In this example, the molding process includes feeding the expandable material <b>50</b> into a barrel of the molding apparatus <b>75</b> (e.g., via a hopper) in which a mechanism (e.g., a screw mechanism) causes displacement of the expandable material <b>50</b> towards a sprue of the mold <b>70</b>. Once the expandable material <b>50</b> reaches the sprue of the mold <b>70</b>, the expandable material <b>50</b> is injected into a mold cavity <b>72</b> of the mold <b>70</b> that is shaped like the precursor <b>12</b><sub>x</sub>*.
