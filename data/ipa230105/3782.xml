In particular, embodiments utilize a testing device executing an application that provides a testing platform for sensors of a vehicle that include oscillators. The application instructs the testing device to display a representation of a vehicle and a plurality of oscillators of the vehicle on a display screen. A user can select one or more oscillators for testing and the testing device can transmit a test request that identifies the one or more selected oscillators of the plurality of oscillators for testing. An electronic control unit of a vehicle can receive a test request and can instruct the one or more oscillators to generate test signals to be received by the testing device. The testing device can calculate a performance metric of the test signals received from one or more oscillators. Based on the performance metric, the testing device can determine whether the one or more oscillators are properly placed, functioning at a predetermined threshold, or both.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, described embodiments allow for analysis of placement of oscillators and functionality of oscillators within vehicles. Analysis of test signals can identify whether oscillators will functionally communicate with key fobs or other wireless devices.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">As shown and described herein, systems and methods for testing oscillators of a vehicle are provided. Turning now to the drawings wherein like numbers refer to like structures, and particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, schematically depicts a view of a portion of a testing system <b>100</b> for testing of a plurality of oscillators for a vehicle <b>102</b>. Testing of oscillators may allow for determinations as to whether oscillators are placed in proper locations, appropriately oriented, and/or are appropriately functioning. Moreover, embodiments may determine modifications to be made to oscillator positions and/or orientations.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment, the vehicle <b>102</b> may include a plurality of sensors, each comprising one or more oscillators. The oscillators may include one more cabin oscillators, such as oscillators <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b, </i>and <b>110</b><i>c, </i>and one or more door oscillators, such as door oscillators <b>120</b><i>a</i>, <b>120</b><i>b, </i>and <b>120</b><i>c. </i>The oscillators <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may be communicatively coupled to a communication bus <b>140</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Each oscillator <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>and/or <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c </i>may include or be coupled with a wireless receiver, such as an antenna. In some embodiments, the oscillators <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>and/or <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c </i>may include transceivers that may include an oscillator, an antenna, a transmitter, a receiver, and an electronic controller, such as a processor and a data storage device. Components of a transceiver may be provided in an integrated circuit. The transceiver may include a radio frequency (RF) transceiver that can perform predetermined process such as amplification or demodulation on received radio waves or to generate radio waves to be transmitted.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In embodiments, the oscillators <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>and/or <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c </i>may be configured to generate and/or receive signals in a predetermined frequency or frequency range, for example, a signal generally at a frequency at or between 100-250 KHz, 120-135 KHz, or the like. The oscillators <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>and/or <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c </i>may further perform amplification or demodulation on the received signals received through associated antennas. For example, and without limitation, the oscillators <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>and/or <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c </i>may include wireless communication devices, such as transceivers, receivers, and/or transmitters, that are capable of generating and/or receiving signals. Each of oscillators <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>and/or <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c </i>may be utilized as key fob sensors, wireless device sensors, or the like. It is noted that the end use of the plurality of oscillators <b>120</b> is not limited. That is, the plurality of oscillators <b>120</b> may be tested for functionality regardless of how the oscillators <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>and/or <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c </i>are to be used once a vehicle is produced or otherwise released for production. Signals generated by, for example, oscillators <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>and/or <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c </i>may be communicated to key fobs, remote controllers, computing devices, or other devices. The oscillators <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>and/or <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c </i>may be associated with respective coverage areas. For instance, oscillator <b>120</b><i>a </i>may include predetermined coverage area <b>124</b><i>a, </i>generally defined by a coverage radius <b>122</b><i>a. </i>Similarly, oscillator <b>120</b><i>b </i>may include predetermined coverage area <b>124</b><i>b</i>, generally defined by a coverage radius <b>122</b><i>b, </i>and oscillator <b>120</b><i>c </i>may include predetermined coverage area <b>124</b><i>c, </i>generally defined by a coverage radius <b>122</b><i>c. </i>The cabin oscillators <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b</i>, and <b>110</b><i>c </i>may have a collective coverage area <b>112</b>, where at least one of the cabin oscillators <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b, </i>and <b>110</b><i>c </i>provides coverage to each location within the coverage area <b>112</b>. For instance, the cabin oscillator <b>110</b><i>a </i>may provide coverage within the area of a dash or counsel, and/or a driver and front passenger seat. Cabin oscillator <b>110</b><i>a </i>may at least partially provide overlapping coverage with cabin oscillator <b>110</b><i>b. </i>Cabin oscillator <b>110</b><i>b </i>may generally provide coverage at or behind the driver and front passenger seat, at a second and/or third row of seats, or the like. Cabin oscillator <b>110</b><i>b </i>may in turn at least partially provide overlapping coverage with cabin oscillator <b>110</b><i>c. </i>Cabin oscillator <b>110</b><i>c </i>may generally provide coverage at or behind a second and/or third row of seats, within a cargo area, or the like. As such, cabin oscillators <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b, </i>and <b>110</b><i>c </i>may include overlapping coverage areas such that the collective coverage area <b>112</b> is fully covered by at least one of cabin oscillators <b>110</b><i>a, </i><b>110</b><i>b, </i>and <b>110</b><i>c. </i>The coverage areas for the respective oscillators <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>and/or <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c </i>may comprise predetermined areas in which the respective oscillators <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>and/or <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c </i>are configured to generate wireless signals detectable by another device, such as a key fob, computing device, or other device. The coverage areas can be controlled by oscillators <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>and/or <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c. </i>For instance, each oscillator may be disposed in a particular location and at a particular orientation such that signals generated at a predetermined strength by the oscillator are transmitted over the coverage area. In an example, the coverage area for oscillator <b>110</b><i>a </i>may include a front cabin of a vehicle, such between a windshield and a plane defined by a driver and front passenger seat. In this example coverage area, the oscillator of the oscillator <b>110</b><i>a </i>selectively generates and emits wireless signals that may be received by a key fob, computing device or other device may sense signals emitted by the oscillator <b>110</b><i>a. </i>If the oscillator of the oscillator <b>110</b><i>a </i>is improperly placed, oriented, or otherwise not functioning as expected, the coverage area may shift or become unreliable such that key fobs, computing devices, or other devices cannot reliably detect the generated signals in one or more locations within the predetermined coverage area.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, oscillators <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>and/or <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c </i>may include or be communicatively coupled to one or more controllers, such as an electronic control unit (&#x201c;ECU&#x201d;). Controllers may receive signals from the oscillators <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>and/or <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c, </i>and may instruct generation of signals by oscillators <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>and/or <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c. </i>Received signals may be analyzed and appropriately processed by controllers. For instance, a wireless device such as an electronic key fob or a remote controller may transmit signals to one or more of the oscillators <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>and/or <b>120</b><i>a</i>-<b>120</b><i>c </i>to perform a particular action or to indicate presence of the key fob within a coverage area. Such actions may include, for instance, locking/unlocking a door, opening/closing a powered door or tailgate, triggering/terminating an alarm, allowing for actuating a motor or engine, or the like. It is noted that received signals may be analyzed to determine whether the key fob is authorized to perform an action, such as unlock a door. It is noted that vehicle <b>102</b> may include any number of appropriate oscillators that may be configured to control any number of actions for a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, the vehicle <b>102</b> may include any appropriate make or model of vehicle. Such vehicles may include, for example, cars, trucks, recreation vehicles, vans, all-terrain vehicles, or the like. Moreover, vehicles may include combustion engines, electric motors, or hybrid power sources. In general, the placement and/or orientation of oscillators on or within the vehicle <b>102</b> may be predetermined for a particular make and model of vehicle <b>102</b>.
