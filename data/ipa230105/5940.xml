For example, when multiple decks of semiconductor structures are stacked to form a 3D memory device, it becomes exceedingly difficult to control the overlay of channel structures of those decks. Also, deep etching is required through the multiple decks in order to connect channel side walls formed in the upper and lower channels across the decks. However, the lack of precision in channel overlay would cause damage to the channel structures during etching, especially in the lower decks, and also cause under etching of the bottom layers of certain channel structures. Additionally, epitaxial growth of semiconductor materials at the bottom of the channel structures also becomes difficult.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">To address one or more of the aforementioned issues, the present disclosure introduces a solution in which two semiconductor assemblies are bonded together, with an inter-assembly bonding layer formed between the two assemblies.

Therefore, the cell density of the 3D memory devices is increased without sacrificing the cell size for each memory cell that would otherwise cause the abovementioned issues.

Each semiconductor assembly in this configuration can be formed by a transfer bonding method, in which the periphery structure can be formed in a second doped semiconductor layer formed over the array structure having a first doped semiconductor layer, and a contact pad in electrical contact with the periphery structure can be formed over the periphery structure. Thus, the two semiconductor assemblies can be subsequently bonded via the inter-assembly bonding layer from the side of each semiconductor assembly having the contact pad.

Carrier substrate <b>302</b> may be removed from the final product. Carrier substrate <b>302</b> may be a part of a dummy wafer and may be made of any suitable materials, such as glass, sapphire, plastic, silicon, to name a few, to reduce the cost thereof. Filling layer <b>304</b> can include polysilicon, a high-k dielectric, or a metal.

Stop layer <b>303</b> may include any dielectric materials including, but not limited to, silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, low-k dielectrics, or any combination thereof. It is understood that in some examples, pad oxide layers (e.g., silicon oxide layers) may be formed between carrier substrate <b>302</b> and stop layer <b>303</b> to relax the stress between different layers and avoid peeling.
