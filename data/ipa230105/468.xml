num="0002">The present invention relates, generally, to systems and methods for providing tissue information in an anatomic target region and, more particularly, to providing the tissue information using acoustic reflectors.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Tissue, such as a benign or malignant tumor or blood clot within a patient's skull or other body region, may be treated invasively by surgically removing the tissue or non-invasively by using, for example, thermal ablation. Both approaches may effectively treat certain localized conditions within the body, but involve delicate procedures to avoid destroying or damaging otherwise healthy tissue. Unless the healthy tissue can be spared or its destruction is unlikely to adversely affect physiological function, surgery may not be appropriate for conditions in which diseased tissue is integrated within healthy tissue.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Ultrasound therapy, as may be accomplished using focused ultrasound, has particular appeal for treating diseased tissue surrounded by or neighboring healthy tissue or organs because the effects of ultrasound energy can be confined to a well-defined target region. Ultrasonic energy may be focused to a zone having a cross-section of only a few millimeters due to relatively short wavelengths (e.g., as small as 1.5 millimeters (mm) in cross-section at one MegaHertz (1 MHz)). Moreover, because acoustic energy generally penetrates well through soft tissues, intervening anatomy often does not pose an obstacle to defining a desired focal zone. Thus, ultrasonic energy may be focused at a small target in order to ablate diseased tissue without significantly damaging surrounding healthy tissue.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, ultrasound may be utilized to open the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the treatment of neurological diseases. The BBB, formed by layers of cells in the central nervous system (CNS), prevents large molecules from entering the brain parenchyma, and thus presents one of the largest obstacles to treating many brain diseases. Specifically, the BBB prevents many therapeutic agents, such as drugs and gene-therapy vectors, from reaching a patient's brain tissue. For example, treatments for CNS infections, neurodegenerative diseases, congenital enzyme defects and brain cancer are all hampered by the ability of the BBB to block passage of, inter alia, antibiotics, anti-retroviral drugs, enzyme replacement therapy, gene preparations and anti-neoplastic drugs. It is thus desirable to using ultrasound energy to temporarily and locally &#x201c;open&#x201d; the BBB to permit therapeutic quantities of these agents to access the affected brain tissue.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An ultrasound focusing system generally utilizes an acoustic transducer surface, or an array of transducer surfaces, to generate an ultrasound beam. The transducer may be geometrically shaped and positioned to focus the ultrasonic energy at a &#x201c;focal zone&#x201d; corresponding to the target tissue mass within the patient. During wave propagation through the tissue, a portion of the ultrasound energy is absorbed, leading to increased temperature and, eventually, to cellular necrosis&#x2014;preferably at the target tissue mass in the focal zone. The individual surfaces, or &#x201c;elements,&#x201d; of the transducer array are typically individually controllable, i.e., their phases and/or amplitudes can be set independently of one another (e.g., using a &#x201c;beamformer&#x201d; with suitable delay or phase shift in the case of continuous waves and amplifier circuitry for the elements), allowing the beam to be steered in a desired direction and focused at a desired distance, and the focal zone properties to be shaped as needed. Thus, the focal zone can be rapidly displaced and/or reshaped by independently adjusting the amplitudes and/or phases of the electrical signal input into the transducer elements.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">During a focused ultrasound procedure, system parameters are generally fixed for a given transducer array, but tissue homogeneity may vary significantly from patient to patient, and even between different tissue regions within the same patient and organ. Tissue inhomogeneity may decrease the intensity of the acoustic energy reaching the focal zone and may even move the location of the focal zone within the patient's body. In addition, different types of tissue may respond differently to the ultrasound application. For example, although exposing tissue to ultrasound may generally increase its permeability, different types of tissue may have different permeability responses. In addition, different types of tissue may have different degrees of viability in response to application of ultrasound.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, to effectively and efficiently treat the target tissue while avoiding damage to non-target tissue, a need exists to acquire information about target and/or non-target tissue prior to and/or during the ultrasound procedure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention relates to approaches for providing tissue information in an anatomic target region using reflections from one or more transient acoustic reflectors (e.g., one or more microbubbles) in proximity to (e.g., less than <b>5</b> mm away) one or more sonication locations that are themselves in proximity to or within the target region. In one embodiment, the transient acoustic reflectors are introduced into one or more blood vessels in proximity to the sonication location(s). An ultrasound transducer then transmits ultrasound waves to the reflector(s) and receives reflection signals therefrom. By analyzing the reflection signals, it is possible to obtain tissue information (e.g., tissue type, tissue condition, tissue anomaly, vascularity, tissue permeability and/or tissue viability) at the sonication locations and/or to map blood vessel(s) in the vicinity thereof. As used herein, the term &#x201c;blood vessels&#x201d; refers to venous and arterial passages and also to tissue adjacent thereto.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the reflection signals are used to determine the tissue information only when the signals are sufficiently &#x201c;consistent&#x201d; (e.g., when the value of a consistency function of the travel times and/or phase delays associated therewith is maximized or exceeds a predetermined threshold). Additionally or alternatively, based on sufficiently consistent reflection signals, a characteristic (e.g., the concentration and/or flow rate) associated with the transient reflectors may be determined. For example, a larger amplitude of the reflection signal generally corresponds to a higher concentration and/or a higher flow rate of the reflectors. Further, based on the determined characteristic of the reflector, the presence and/or location of a lesion can be determined. For example, a slower flow rate at a portion of the blood vessel may indicate the presence of a nearby lesion.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In various embodiments, the tissue information provided by the sufficiently consistent reflection signals can be combined with information acquired using an imaging device (e.g., a computer tomography (CT) device or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) device) different from the ultrasound transducer via e.g., image registration. For example, the CT device may provide accurate locational information about the target region and the sufficiently consistent reflection signals may provide information such as the locations of the transient reflectors, a map of the blood vessels, tissue viability of the target/non-target regions, etc. This diverse information may advantageously be combined, thereby providing improved tissue characterization at the target/non-target regions for better diagnosis and/or therapy.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, the tissue information and/or the characteristic associated with the acoustic reflectors provided by the sufficiently consistent reflection signals may facilitate evaluation of the treatment effect of sonications at the target region during a therapeutic medical procedure. For example, as cancerous tissue in the target region is ablated, the concentration and/or the flow rate of the transient acoustic reflectors in blood vessels near the target may increase. Thus, by monitoring the concentration and/or the flow rate of the transient acoustic reflectors in local blood vessels, the treatment effect (e.g., ablation progress) and/or the viability of the target tissue during the therapeutic procedure can be effectively evaluated.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, multiple types (e.g., having different shell types, different contents, different half-lives in the body, different sizes, etc.) of the transient acoustic reflectors are utilized to obtain additional tissue information of the target and/or non-target. For example, relatively large microbubbles (e.g., having a diameter of a few micrometers) are introduced into the blood vessels prior to the relatively small microbubbles (e.g., having a diameter less than one micrometer or nanodroplets with diameters less than 100 nanometers). As a result, reflection signals from the relatively large microbubbles can provide information of the relatively large blood vessels and tissue associated therewith, and reflection signals from the relatively small microbubbles can provide additional information of the relatively small blood vessels and tissue associated therewith. In some embodiments, the transient acoustic reflectors include &#x201c;targeted reflectors&#x201d; that can be attached to specific types of receptors, biomolecules, cells or tissue. For example, the targeted reflectors can be microbubbles conjugated with antibodies. Due to affinity between the antibodies and their target proteins, the targeted reflectors may provide additional information about the cells or tissue in which the proteins are expressed. For example, microbubbles in the targeted reflectors may be attached to the membrane of epithelial cancer cells due to the affinity between the antibodies in the targeted reflectors and the cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31), which is expressed on the surface of all endothelial cancer cells. In addition, the targeted microbubbles may advantageously amplify the sonporation effect on the cell membrane under relatively low peak negative acoustic pressure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention pertains to a system for computationally characterizing tissue in an anatomic target region. In various embodiments, the system includes an ultrasound transducer having multiple transducer elements; and a controller configured to (a) cause the transducer to generate multiple sonications to transient acoustic reflectors at or proximate to the target region; (b) measure reflection signals of the sonications off the transient acoustic reflectors; (c) based on the measurements, identify the reflection signals originating from single transient acoustic reflectors; and (d) based at least in part on the identified reflection signals, generating a digital map of tissue within the target region, the map including a tissue characteristic (e.g., a tissue type, a tissue condition, a tissue anomaly, a degree of tissue viability, a degree of vascularity, and/or a degree of tissue permeability).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The system may further include means for introducing multiple transient acoustic reflectors to the tissue within the target region. The means for introducing the transient acoustic reflectors may include an administration device. In addition, the transient acoustic reflectors may include microbubbles. The microbubbles may have different characteristics (e.g., different shell types, different contents, different half-lives in a body and/or different sizes). Alternatively, the transient acoustic reflectors may include targeted reflectors. In one embodiment, the targeted reflectors include microbubbles conjugated with antibodies.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In various embodiments, the map further includes a mapping of blood vessels within the target region. In addition, the controller may be further configured to register the mapping of the blood vessels and/or the tissue characteristic with images acquired using an imaging device different from the ultrasound transducer. In some embodiments, the controller is further configured to determine concentrations of the transient acoustic reflectors in multiple portions of blood vessels based at least in part on the identified reflection signals and/or an injection rate of the transient acoustic reflectors. The controller may be further configured to determine an acoustic intensity distribution associated with one or more of the transient acoustic reflectors in one or more of the portions of the blood vessels based at least in part on the identified reflection signals; assign a weighting factor to each of the sub-regions within the blood vessel portion(s) based on the acoustic intensity associated therewith; and determine the concentration of the transient acoustic reflectors in the blood vessel portion(s) based at least in part on the weighted average of the acoustic intensities associated with the sub-regions.

Additionally, the controller may be further configured to determine the tissue information within the target region by computing a tissue aberration for one or more of the transducer elements using a physical model.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another aspect, the invention relates to a method of computationally characterizing tissue in an anatomic target region. In various embodiments, the method includes (a) generating multiple sonications to transient acoustic reflectors at or proximate to the target region; (b) measuring reflection signals of the sonications off the transient acoustic reflectors; (c) based on the measurements, identifying the reflection signals originating from single transient acoustic reflectors; and (d) based at least in part on the identified reflection signals, generating a digital map of tissue within the target region, the digital map including a tissue characteristic (e.g., a tissue type, a tissue condition, a tissue anomaly, a degree of tissue viability, a degree of vascularity, and/or a degree of tissue permeability).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The method may further include introducing multiple transient acoustic reflectors to the tissue within the target region.

In various embodiments, the system <b>100</b> includes a phased array <b>102</b> of transducer elements <b>104</b>, a beamformer <b>106</b> driving the phased array <b>102</b>, a controller <b>108</b> in communication with the beamformer <b>106</b>, and a frequency generator <b>110</b> providing an input electronic signal to the beamformer <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The array <b>102</b> may have a curved (e.g., spherical or parabolic) shape suitable for placement on the surface of the skull or a body part other than the skull, or may include one or more planar or otherwise shaped sections. Its dimensions may vary, depending on the application, between millimeters and tens of centimeters. The transducer elements <b>104</b> of the array <b>102</b> may be piezoelectric ceramic elements, and may be mounted in silicone rubber or any other material suitable for damping the mechanical coupling between the elements <b>104</b>. Piezo-composite materials, or generally any materials capable of converting electrical energy to acoustic energy, may also be used. To assure maximum power transfer to the transducer elements <b>104</b>, the elements <b>104</b> may be configured for electrical resonance at 50&#x3a9;, matching input connector impedance.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The transducer array <b>102</b> is coupled to the beamformer <b>106</b>, which drives the individual transducer elements <b>104</b> so that they collectively produce a focused ultrasonic beam or field. For n transducer elements, the beamformer <b>106</b> may contain n driver circuits, each circuit including or consisting of an amplifier <b>118</b> and a phase delay circuit <b>120</b>; each drive circuit drives one of the transducer elements <b>104</b>. The beamformer <b>106</b> receives a radio frequency (RF) input signal, typically in the range from 0.1 MHz to 1.0 MHz, from the frequency generator <b>110</b>, which may, for example, be a Model DS345 generator available from Stanford Research Systems. The input signal may be split into n channels for the n amplifiers <b>118</b> and delay circuits <b>120</b> of the beamformer <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, the frequency generator <b>110</b> is integrated with the beamformer <b>106</b>. The radio frequency generator <b>110</b> and the beamformer <b>106</b> are configured to drive the individual transducer elements <b>104</b> of the transducer array <b>102</b> at the same frequency, but at different phases and/or different amplitudes.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The amplification or attenuation factors al-an and the phase shifts al-an imposed by the beamformer <b>106</b> serve to transmit and focus ultrasonic energy through inhomogeneous tissue (e.g., the patient's skull) onto the target region (e.g., a region in the patient's brain). Via adjustments of the amplification factors and/or the phase shifts, a desired shape and intensity of a focal zone may be created at the target region.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The amplification factors and phase shifts may be computed using the controller <b>108</b>, which may provide the computational functions through software, hardware, firmware, hardwiring, or any combination thereof. For example, the controller <b>108</b> may utilize a general-purpose or special-purpose digital data processor programmed with software in a conventional manner, and without undue experimentation, to determine the frequency, phase shifts and/or amplification factors of the transducer elements <b>104</b>. In certain embodiments, the controller computation is based on information about the characteristics (e.g., structure, thickness, density, etc.) of the skull and their effects on propagation of acoustic energy. In various embodiments, such information is obtained from an imager <b>122</b>, such as an MRI device, a CT device, a positron emission tomography (PET) device, a single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) device, or an ultrasonography device. The imager <b>122</b> may provide a set of two-dimensional images suitable for reconstructing a three-dimensional image of the skull from which thicknesses and densities can be inferred; alternatively, image acquisition may be three-dimensional. In addition, image-manipulation functionality may be implemented in the imager <b>122</b>, in the controller <b>108</b>, or in a separate device.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The system <b>100</b> may be modified in various ways within the scope of the invention. For example, the system may further include an acoustic-signal detector (e.g., a hydrophone) <b>124</b> that measures transmitted or reflected ultrasound, and which may provide the signals it receives to the controller <b>108</b> for further processing. The reflection and transmission signals may also provide an alternative or additional source for determining the phase shifts and/or amplification factors or feedback for the phase and amplitude adjustments of the beamformer <b>106</b> as further described below. The system <b>100</b> may contain a positioner for arranging the array <b>102</b> of transducer elements <b>104</b> with respect to the patient's skull. In order to apply ultrasound therapy to body parts other than the brain, the transducer array <b>102</b> may take a different (e.g., cylindrical) shape. In some embodiments, the transducer elements <b>104</b> are mounted movably and rotatably, providing mechanical degrees of freedom that can be exploited to improve focusing properties. Such movable transducers may be adjusted by conventional actuators, which may be driven by a component of controller <b>108</b> or by a separate mechanical controller.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, in order to acquire tissue information of the target region <b>101</b> and/or the non-target region in proximity to the target region, in various embodiments, one or more transient acoustic reflectors (e.g., microbubbles) <b>202</b> are introduced into or proximate to the target region <b>101</b>. The microbubbles <b>202</b> may be generated by applying acoustic energy from the transducer elements <b>104</b> to the target <b>101</b>. The microbubbles <b>202</b> can be formed due to the negative pressure produced by the propagating ultrasonic waves or when the heated liquid ruptures and is filled with gas/vapor. Because of their encapsulation of gas, the microbubble(s) <b>202</b> may act as reflectors of the ultrasound waves and transmit coherent omnidirectional signals <b>204</b>-<b>208</b> to the transducer <b>102</b>; the reflection signals <b>204</b>-<b>208</b> can be substantially concurrently detected by the transducer elements <b>104</b> and/or acoustic signal detector <b>124</b> associated therewith. Based on analysis of the reflection signals, the controller <b>108</b> may obtain information of the tissue information at the target region <b>101</b> as further described below. Approaches to generating microbubbles utilizing ultrasound waves are provided, for example, in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2019/0308038, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Additionally or alternatively, the acoustic reflector <b>202</b> may be introduced into the patient's body intravenously; the transient reflector may either be injected systemically into the patient or locally into the target region <b>101</b> using an administration system <b>126</b>. For example, the transient reflector <b>202</b> may include or consist of one or more microbubbles introduced into the patient's brain in the form of liquid droplets that subsequently vaporize to form the microbubbles; or as gas-filled bubbles entrained within a liquid carrier, e.g., a conventional ultrasound contrast agent. Alternatively, other substances suitable for cavitation nucleation can be administered instead of bubbles (see, e.g., https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda downloaddocument/9783642153426-cl.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-998046-p174031757).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, after the transient reflector <b>202</b> is generated and/or introduced into the target region <b>101</b>, the controller <b>108</b> may activate at least some of the transducer elements <b>104</b> to transmit a series of sonications to the microbubbles located at the target region <b>101</b>. In one implementation, the transducer elements <b>104</b> possess both transmit and detect capabilities. Thus, at least some of the transducer elements <b>104</b> may be operated to measure acoustic signals reflected from the target region <b>101</b> as described, for example, in International Application No. PCT/IB2019/000644 (filed on Jun. 4, 2019), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. Additionally or alternatively, ultrasound reflections from the transient reflector <b>202</b> at the target region <b>101</b> may be measured using the acoustic-signal detector <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The measured reflection signals may then be fed to the controller <b>108</b> for analysis; based thereon, the controller <b>108</b> may determine information of the tissue located in proximity to and/or within the target region and/or a characteristic associated with the transient acoustic reflector as further described below. In various circumstances, the reflection signals from the transient reflector <b>202</b> have relatively low quality (e.g., the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are below a threshold); analysis based thereon may therefore result in inaccurate determination of the tissue information at the target. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates an approach to solving this problem. The ultrasound transducer <b>102</b> may be activated to sequentially generate multiple foci at various sonication locations <b>222</b>-<b>230</b> that are in proximity to the target region <b>101</b> (e.g., less than 5 mm away) or within the target region <b>101</b>, and each location may have one or more transient reflectors <b>202</b> associated therewith. For example, the transducer elements <b>104</b> may generate one or more series of sonications to the first sonication location <b>222</b> and measure the reflections from the transient reflector <b>232</b> located in proximity thereto. Subsequently, the transducer elements <b>104</b> may generate another one or more series of sonications to the second sonication location <b>224</b> and measure the reflections from the transient reflector <b>234</b> associated therewith. This process may continue until a desired number (e.g. at least 10) of the reflection signals from the sonication locations in proximity to the target <b>101</b> are measured.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In various embodiments, the sonication locations <b>222</b>-<b>230</b> are determined based on the image(s) acquired by the imager <b>122</b> and/or the ultrasound transducer <b>102</b>. For example, the imager <b>122</b> may acquire images of the target and/or non-target regions; and the ultrasound transducer <b>102</b> may acquire images of the transient reflector(s) <b>202</b> in the target/non-target regions based on the reflection signals therefrom as further described below. Based on the acquired images of the target/non-target regions and the transient reflectors associated therewith, the controller <b>108</b> may select the sonication locations <b>222</b>-<b>230</b> that are near (e.g., less than 5 mm away) and/or at the target region and having one or more transient reflectors in proximity to thereto (e.g., less than 5 mm away).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, upon collection of the reflection signals from all (or at least some) of the sonication locations, an initial signal-processing procedure is performed to select signals that are more likely to be from the transient reflectors. This approach may advantageously eliminate (or at least reduce) usage of reflections from the background reflectors (e.g., the skull), which are less relevant (or irrelevant) to characterizing the target region. As used herein, the term &#x201c;transient reflector&#x201d; refers to an acoustic reflector that dissipates or evolves with time during sonications (e.g., microbubbles) and the term &#x201c;background reflector&#x201d; refers to an acoustic reflector that does not dissipate or evolve significantly during sonication (e.g., the skull). In addition, a signal-selection approach may be implemented to select the reflection signals that are from single reflectors. In one embodiment, the signal-selection approach selects the reflection signals based on consistency therebetween. For example, the reflection signals are considered to have sufficient consistency when the value of a consistency function of the phase delays (or travel times) associated with the reflection signals is maximized or exceeds a predetermined threshold (e.g., 40%). By using the reflection signals having sufficient consistency, artifacts exhibited in the signals due to low SNRs and/or vibrations from the multiple microbubbles may advantageously be eliminated (or at least reduced); this thereby provides more accurate information about the tissue located in proximity to or within the target region and/or a characteristic associated with the transient reflectors. In addition, the computational complexity of analyzing the reflection signals can be significantly reduced. Further details concerning the initial signal-processing procedure and signal-selection approach are provided, for example, in PCT Publication No. WO 2020/128615, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In various embodiments, based on the selected reflection signals that have sufficient consistency, the controller <b>108</b> can generate one or more images of the transient reflectors and/or determine a characteristic (e.g., a concentration or a flow rate) associated with the transient reflectors <b>202</b>. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, transient acoustic reflectors <b>202</b> may be introduced (e.g., by the administration device <b>126</b>) with a predetermined injection rate (e.g., 1 cc/min) into one or more blood vessels <b>302</b> in proximity to the identified sonication locations <b>304</b>-<b>314</b>; based on the injection rate and the reflection signals from the reflectors <b>202</b> received from each portion of the blood vessel <b>302</b>, the controller <b>108</b> may determine the concentration of the transient acoustic reflectors in the corresponding portion of the blood vessel <b>302</b>. Generally, the higher the injection rate and/or the larger the amplitude of the selected reflection signal, the higher the reflector concentration will be. In various embodiments, a relationship between injection rates and reflector concentrations and/or a relationship between the amplitudes of the sufficiently consistent reflection signals and reflector concentrations can be established prior to performing measurements of the reflection signals. These relationships may be empirically obtained from a pre-clinical study, a pre-treatment procedure, and/or from known literature. Alternatively, the relationship may be computationally determined using a physical model. For example, using conventional techniques implemented without undue experimentation, the physical model may predict the amplitudes associated with the sufficiently consistent reflection signals based on information about the geometry of the transducer elements <b>104</b> and their locations and orientations relative to the sonication locations <b>304</b>-<b>314</b>, the power levels and phases of ultrasound waves transmitted from the elements <b>104</b>, material properties (e.g., the energy absorption of the tissue or the speed of sound at the employed frequency) of the target tissue and intervening tissue along the beam path, as well as the injection rate and/or concentrations of the reflectors in different portions of the blood vessel <b>302</b>. The material properties may be collected using the imager <b>122</b> as described above and/or other suitable devices. For example, based on the acquired images, a tissue model characterizing one or more material characteristics of the intervening tissue and the target tissue may be established. The tissue model may take the form of a 3D arrangement of cells corresponding to voxels representing the intervening and/or target tissue; the cells have attributes whose values represent characteristics of the tissue, such as the absorption coefficient, that are relevant to the energy absorption. The voxels are obtained tomographically by the imager <b>122</b> and the type of tissue that each voxel represents can be determined automatically by conventional tissue-analysis software. Using the determined tissue types and a lookup table of tissue parameters (e.g., absorption coefficient by type of tissue), the cells of the tissue model may be populated. Further detail regarding creation of a tissue model that identifies the energy absorption coefficient, heat sensitivity and/or thermal energy tolerance of various tissues may be found in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2012/0029396, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Additionally or alternatively, the controller <b>108</b> may analyze the sufficiently consistent reflection signals to determine the acoustic intensity distributions associated with the transient acoustic reflectors in each portion of the blood vessel <b>302</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> depicts two acoustic focus points <b>402</b>, <b>404</b> located in two sub-regions <b>406</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>406</b><sub>2 </sub>within a portion <b>406</b> of the blood vessel <b>302</b> and their corresponding acoustic intensity distributions <b>412</b>, <b>414</b>. The controller <b>108</b> operates the transducers to generate an acoustic field with desired properties at the focus, using, for example, a grid of sonications exemplified by points <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Typically, the acoustic intensity has a peak value at the location of the focus; the acoustic intensity gradually decreases as the distance from the focus increases. If the acoustic intensity in the region <b>406</b><sub>3 </sub>exceeds a physical threshold (e.g., 1 MP), there may be acoustic reflectors that are detected by measurements, but with lower probability. Thus, in some embodiments, the controller <b>108</b> assigns a weighting factor to each sub-region within a portion of the blood vessel based on the acoustic intensity associated therewith. For example, the sub-region <b>406</b><sub>3 </sub>corresponding to the overlap location <b>416</b> has a cumulative acoustic intensity lower than that of the focus points <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>; hence, this location receives a larger weighting factor, while the sub-regions <b>406</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>406</b><sub>2 </sub>corresponding to the locations of the focus points <b>402</b>, <b>404</b> may be assigned smaller weighting factors. Thereafter, the controller <b>108</b> may determine the concentration of the transient acoustic reflectors in the portion <b>406</b> of the blood vessel <b>302</b> based on a weighted average of the acoustic intensities associated with the sub-regions <b>406</b><sub>1-3 </sub>and a relationship between the acoustic intensities and reflector concentrations (as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). Again, this relationship may be empirically obtained from a pre-clinical study, a pre-treatment procedure, and/or from known literature and/or computationally determined using the physical model as described above.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, the controller <b>108</b> can determine the flow rate of the transient reflectors in various portions of the blood vessel <b>302</b> using the sufficiently consistent reflection signals. Again, typically, the larger the number of consistent signals and/or the larger the amplitudes of the reflection signals, the higher will be the flow rate of the reflectors; and the relationship between the number of consistent signals and/or the amplitudes of the reflection signals and the flow rates of the reflectors can be established empirically and/or using the physical model as described above prior to performing measurements of the reflection signals.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In various embodiments, the transient acoustic reflectors in an identified portion of the blood vessel <b>302</b> are depleted or at least reduced by activating the transducer <b>102</b> to transmit sonications thereto. Thereafter, based on measurements of the sufficiently consistent reflection signals from the transient acoustic reflectors within the identified sub-region, the controller <b>108</b> may determine the flow rate therein. Again, larger number of consistent signals and/or the larger the reflection-signal amplitudes and/or shorter periods of detecting the reflection signals after depletion (or reduction) of the acoustic reflectors correspond to the larger flow rate, and this relationship can be established empirically or using the physical model prior to the measurements of the reflection signals.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, the controller <b>108</b> further determines information regarding the tissue located in proximity to the blood vessel <b>302</b>. For example, a slower flow rate at a portion of the blood vessel may indicate the presence of a lesion. Thus, by comparing the flow rate along the blood vessel, the presence and/or the location of a lesion can be identified. In addition, because the anatomical and/or material properties of the tissue in proximity to the blood vessel may affect the concentration and/or the flow rate of the transient acoustic reflectors, the controller <b>108</b>, upon determining the concentration/flow rate of the reflectors in a portion of the blood vessel, may generate a digital map to provide tissue information (e.g., tissue type, tissue condition, tissue permeability, tissue anomaly, vascularity, and/or tissue viability) in the corresponding region in proximity to the portion of the blood vessel. In one embodiment, the sufficiently consistent reflection signals are selected such that they are from a specific location (e.g., the portion of the blood vessel that is in proximity to one of the sonication locations). As a result, the tissue characteristics (e.g., the type, condition, anomaly, vascularity, permeability and/or viability) associated with the sonication location can be determined. Further details regarding selection of the reflection signals based on the locations of the reflectors are provided, for example, in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2018/0206816, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In various embodiments, based on analysis of the sufficiently consistent reflection signals, the controller <b>108</b> may generate an image of the reflectors and/or mapping of the blood vessel <b>302</b> in which the transient reflectors <b>202</b> are located. In addition, the controller <b>108</b> may register the generated mapping of the blood vessels (and/or the characteristic of the tissue in proximity to or within the target region) with images that are acquired using an imaging device (e.g., a CT device or an MRI device) different from the ultrasound transducer. This may advantageously allow different types of information provided by different imaging devices to be combined, thereby providing useful details about the tissue information at the target/non-target regions for better diagnosis. For example, the CT device may provide accurate locational information about the target region and the sufficiently consistent reflection signals may provide information such as the locations of the transient reflectors, the mapping of the blood vessels, the tissue viability of the target/non-target regions, etc. Approaches to registering information (e.g., images) acquired using two or more imaging systems as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 9,934,570, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, because ultrasound energy can be employed therapeutically&#x2014;e.g., to heat and ablate diseased (e.g., cancerous) tissue without causing significant damage to surrounding healthy tissue&#x2014;the tissue information and/or the characteristic of the acoustic reflectors provided by the sufficiently consistent reflection signals may allow the treatment effect of the sonications on the target region to be evaluated during a therapeutic medical procedure. In various embodiments, to ablate the target tissue, the ultrasound waves from the transducer elements <b>104</b> are focused at the target region <b>101</b> using an autofocusing approach that involves the use of one or more transient reflectors. As described above, the transient reflectors may be generated and/or introduced in proximity to (e.g., less than 5 mm away) one or more sonication locations that are in proximity to or at the target region. Upon introduction or generation of the transient reflector near the target <b>101</b>, the transducer <b>102</b> is activated to apply a series of sonications thereto; reflection signals from the reflector <b>202</b> may be detected by the transducer <b>102</b> and/or the acoustic-signal detection device <b>124</b> associated with the transducer elements. Optionally, the measured signals may be selected using the initial signal-processing approach and/or signal-selection approach described above.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Subsequently, the selected signals can be provided to the controller <b>108</b> to obtain information, such as the amplitudes and/or phases, associated with the reflections; these may be compared to the amplitudes and/or phases associated with the transmitted ultrasound waves from the transducer elements <b>104</b>. Based on the deviations therebetween, configurations (e.g., amplitudes and/or phases) of one or more transducer elements <b>104</b> may be adjusted so as to compensate for the deviations, thereby improving the focusing properties. In some embodiments, this autofocusing procedure is iteratively performed until optimal focusing properties are achieved. Approaches for autofocusing an ultrasound beam at the target region are provided, for example, in PCT Publication No. WO 2018/020315 and U.S. Patent Application No. 62/781,258 (filed on Dec. 18, 2018); the entire contents of these applications are incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In various embodiments, the controller <b>108</b> operates the transducer elements based on the configurations determined using the autofocusing approach so as to treat the target tissue (e.g., cancerous tissue). As the target cancerous tissue is ablated, the concentration and/or the flow rate of the transient acoustic reflectors in the blood vessel in proximity to the target may increase. Thus, in one embodiment, the controller <b>108</b> can analyze the sufficiently consistent reflection signals from the acoustic reflectors to monitor the concentration and/or the flow rate of the transient acoustic reflectors in the blood vessel, and based thereon, determine the treatment effect (e.g., the tissue ablation progress) and/or the viability of the target tissue.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, the controller <b>108</b> computationally reconstructs an acoustic field in the target tissue and/or the location(s) of the acoustic reflector(s) based on the reflection signals therefrom. For example, upon applying sonications to the target tissue and/or the transient acoustic reflector(s) in proximity thereto, at least some of the transducer elements <b>104</b> may simultaneously record reflection signals from the acoustic reflector(s); based thereon, the sources of the emissions can be estimated through back-propagation to different image coordinates so as to reconstruct two- or three-dimensional acoustic images (e.g., acoustic-field maps) of the activity. The image amplitude reflects the intensity of the acoustic emissions integrated across the array elements <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Additionally or alternatively, the controller <b>108</b> may computationally reconstruct the acoustic image of the target/non-target region based on the tissue information (e.g., tissue aberration and/or temperature increase) associated therewith. For example, the controller may implement the physical model described above to compute tissue aberration and/or temperature increase at the target and/or non-target region. Information of the computed tissue aberrations and/or temperature increases may then be combined with information acquired from the reflection signals off the target/non-target region to reconstruct the acoustic image at the target and/or non-target region.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates an exemplary approach <b>500</b> for acquiring information about target and/or non-target tissue and generating a digital map providing the tissue information prior to and/or during the ultrasound procedure in accordance herewith. In a first step <b>502</b>, the transient acoustic reflectors (e.g., microbubbles) having an initial concentration are generated and/or introduced with an injection rate in proximity to (e.g., less than 5 mm away) one or more sonication locations that are in proximity to or at the target region. In a second step <b>504</b>, at least some of the transducer elements <b>104</b> are activated to transmit a series of sonications to the transient reflector(s); reflection signals from the transient reflector(s) are measured using, for example, the acoustic-signal detector <b>124</b> and/or the transducer elements <b>104</b>. In a third step <b>506</b>, the controller <b>108</b> may implement an initial signal-processing approach and/or a signal-selection approach to select reflection signals from single transient acoustic reflector(s) (as opposed to the background reflector(s)). Based on the selected reflection signals, the controller <b>108</b> may generate a digital map to provide tissue information associated with the target and/or non-target regions (step <b>508</b>). The tissue information may include, for example, a mapping of blood vessels and/or a characteristic (e.g., a tissue type, tissue condition, tissue permeability, tissue viability, tissue anomaly, vascularity, tissue aberration, tissue temperature) of the tissue. In various embodiments, the controller registers the tissue information with images acquired using an imaging device (e.g., a CT device or an MRI device) different from the ultrasound transducer to provide more details about the tissue information in the target/non-target regions (step <b>510</b>).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrates an exemplary approach <b>520</b> for computationally reconstructing/revising an acoustic image representing, for example, an acoustic field at the target and/or the location(s) of the acoustic reflector(s) in accordance herewith. Similar to approach <b>500</b>, the transient acoustic reflectors (e.g., microbubbles) are first generated and/or introduced in proximity to (e.g., less than 5 mm away) one or more sonication locations that are in proximity to or at the target region (step <b>502</b>). Subsequently, at least some of the transducer elements <b>104</b> are activated to transmit a series of sonications to the transient reflector(s); reflection signals therefrom can be measured using, for example, the acoustic-signal detector <b>124</b> and/or the transducer elements <b>104</b> (step <b>504</b>). Optionally, the controller <b>108</b> may implement an initial signal-processing approach and/or a signal-selection approach to select reflection signals from single transient acoustic reflector(s) (step <b>506</b>). Based on the selected reflection signals, the controller <b>108</b> may computationally reconstruct/revise the digital acoustic images representing, for example, acoustic fields at the target region and/or locations of the acoustic reflectors (step <b>522</b>). Additionally or alternatively, the transducer may apply sonications to the target region and create a focus therein using the autofocusing approach (step <b>524</b>); again, reflection signals from the target tissue may be measured using the acoustic-signal detector <b>124</b> and/or the transducer elements <b>104</b> (step <b>526</b>). The controller may also compute a tissue aberration in the target region using a physical model (step <b>528</b>). Based on the computed tissue aberration and the measured reflection signals from the target tissue, the controller may reconstruct/revise the acoustic image of the target region (step <b>522</b>). In some embodiments, the controller <b>108</b> computationally reconstructs the acoustic images at the target region based on the computed tissue aberration and reflection signals from the target tissue and acoustic reflector(s).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> illustrates an exemplary approach <b>540</b> for determining tissue information of the target and/or non-target regions and/or a characteristic (e.g., a concentration and/or flow rate) of the transient acoustic reflector(s) and generating a digital map providing the tissue information in accordance herewith. Similar to approaches <b>500</b>, <b>520</b>, the acoustic reflectors (e.g., microbubbles) are first generated and/or introduced, with an injection rate, in proximity to (e.g., less than <b>5</b> mm away) one or more sonication locations that are in proximity to or at the target region (step <b>502</b>). Subsequently, at least some of the transducer elements <b>104</b> are activated to transmit a series of sonications to the transient reflector(s); reflection signals from the transient reflector(s) are then measured using, for example, the acoustic-signal detector <b>124</b> and/or the transducer elements <b>104</b> (step <b>504</b>). Optionally, the controller <b>108</b> may implement an initial signal-processing approach and/or a signal-selection approach to select reflection signals from single transient acoustic reflector(s) (step <b>506</b>). The controller <b>108</b> may then, based on the selected reflection signals and the injection rate of the reflectors, determine the concentration and/or flow rate of the acoustic reflectors (step <b>542</b>). The determined concentration/flow rate of the acoustic reflectors may be utilized to generate a digital map providing tissue information (e.g., the mapping of blood vessels and/or the characteristic of the tissue) and/or treatment effect (e.g., ablation progress) on the target and/or non-target tissue (step <b>544</b>). In addition, the controller may determine the presence and/or location of a lesion within the target region based on the determined flow rate (step <b>546</b>). In some embodiments, the controller can, based on the reflection signals, determine acoustic intensity distributions associated with the transient acoustic reflectors in one or more sub-regions of the target/non-target regions (step <b>548</b>). In addition, the controller may assign a weighting factor to each of sub-regions based on the acoustic intensity associated therewith (step <b>550</b>). The concentration of the transient acoustic reflectors in the target/non-target regions can then be determined based on the weighted average of the acoustic intensities associated with the sub-regions (step <b>542</b>). In various embodiments, the controller <b>108</b> operates the transducer to generate the second sonication(s) to a sub-region within the target region so as to reduce a concentration of the transient acoustic reflectors therein (step <b>552</b>). By measuring the reflection signals from the acoustic reflectors, the controller may determine the flow rate thereof (step <b>542</b>).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In general, functionality for providing information about target and/or non-target tissue and/or a characteristic of the transient acoustic reflectors and computationally reconstructing an acoustic image at the target and/or the locations of the transient acoustic reflectors, such as causing the transient reflectors to be introduced/generated in proximity one or more sonication locations that are in proximity to or at the target region, causing the transducer to transmit a series of sonications to the transient acoustic reflectors and/or target region, measuring the reflection signals from the transient acoustic reflectors and/or the target region, selecting the reflection signals, and based thereon, determining a characteristic associated with the reflectors, generating a digital map including information of the tissue located in proximity to or within the target region, determining the presence and/or location of a lesion within the target region, evaluating the treatment effect on the target region, registering the tissue information with images acquired using an imaging device (e.g., a CT device or an MRI device) different from the ultrasound transducer, computing a tissue aberration in the target region using, for example, a physical model, reconstructing an acoustic image at the target region, causing the transducer to generate the second sonication(s) to a sub-region within the target region so as to reduce a concentration of the transient acoustic reflectors therein, determining acoustic intensity distributions associated with the transient acoustic reflectors in one or more sub-regions of the target/non-target regions and assigning a weighting factor to each of sub-regions based on the acoustic intensity associated therewith, as described above, whether integrated within a controller of the imager, the administration system, and/or an ultrasound system, or provided by a separate external controller, may be structured in one or more modules implemented in hardware, software, or a combination of both.
