continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 16/567,686, filed on Sep. 11, 2019. The aforementioned application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Recent years have seen significant improvements in online content storage (e.g., &#x201c;cloud&#x201d; storage). To illustrate, existing online storage systems can enable users to organize digital content (e.g., various types of files and media) into a traditional folder hierarchy with multiple folders, or layers of nested folders, and files stored within folders of the folder hierarchy. Furthermore, existing storage systems enable a user to share a folder with other users via the online storage system. Despite some of the online storage conveniences that existing storage systems offer, such systems have a number of technical problems and disadvantages.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, the traditional file/folder storage hierarchy of existing storage systems are inflexible when it comes to applying permission and sharing settings. In particular, existing storage systems typically apply permission and sharing settings at a folder level. Folder level permission and sharing settings are inflexible, however, and can cause inaccurate permission and sharing settings that either provide a user access to content that was meant to be restricted or does not provide a user access as desired. For example, it is often the case that a user wants to share multiple files that are stored within multiple different folders, but at the same time the user does not want to share all of the files within each of the multiple folders. The inflexible folder level permission structure of many existing storage systems, however, is not able to adequately handle such a situation.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Due to the inflexibilities of existing storage systems, such as the ones discussed above, many users use manual and awkward workarounds. For example, due to the rigidness of folder level permission settings, a user may manually create duplicative folders and save additional copies of multiple files for every individual combination of files a user wants to share with another user. However, this type of action results in an inefficient use of storage space on the online content storage system by creating multiple copies of files within the storage system. Moreover, this type of manual workaround results in additional inflexibilities and versioning inaccuracies as any changes that are made to a copy of the file are not made to other copies of the file stored in other locations.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to storage inefficiencies mentioned above, existing storage systems also suffer from inefficient graphical user interfaces for accessing and viewing files stored within the online content storage system. As discussed above, existing storage systems store files in a file/folder hierarchy, and accordingly, existing systems often provide a graphical user interface that displays a hierarchy of folders and files located within folders that allows a user to select a folder and a file within a folder to view the file. This type of existing graphical user interface, however, is inefficient when a user needs to view several files or when a user wants to present several files in a specific order. In particular, in an existing storage system a user would select and open each shared file (e.g., click on each file) within a folder or within multiple different folders. Thus, for example, if a user wished to share content within several files, then the viewing user would need to select and open those several files in multiple separate steps. Moreover, even after performing the numerous steps, the result is often a haphazard display of opened windows that present the content in no particular order. Moreover, if the viewing user does not have the correct application associated with a shared file installed on their own computer, then the user may not be able to view the file at all.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, there are many problems and shortcomings with regard to existing online content storage systems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present disclosure provide benefits and/or solve one or more of the foregoing or other problems in the art with systems, non-transitory computer-readable media, and methods for generating and modifying a collection content item that can be shared across multiple users of a content management system. For example, the content management system can generate a collection content item (e.g., a sharable data file) that references, organizes, and provides access to other content items. In one or more embodiments, the collection content item can reference and organize content items both internal to the content management system and external to the content management system. In one or more embodiments, the content management system can provide the collection content item to a user in an editable mode wherein the user can indicate content items to add to the collection content item. In response to receiving the indication to add the content items, the content management system can add references to the storage location of the content items to the collection content item. Accordingly, the collection content item includes a collection of storage location references that allows users to access each of the referenced content items based on accessing the collection content item.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The content management system can also share or otherwise publish the collection content item to other users with granular permission settings and version controls. For example, the content management system can maintain separate permission settings associated with each content item referenced by a collection content item. Additionally, because the content management system adds references to a storage location of a base content item to the collection content item, the content management system efficiently applies any version changes made to the base content item to any viewed instances of that content item via the collection content item. Alternatively, the content management system can provide a specific version of one or more content items to users, while the live content items continue to be available for additional editing. Moreover, the content management system can render content items within the collection content item such that the content items are viewable to a user regardless of what software the user has installed a client computing device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additional features and advantages of the present invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by the practice of such exemplary embodiments. The features and advantages of such embodiments may be realized and obtained by means of the instruments and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. These and other features will become more fully apparent from the following description and appended claims, or may be learned by the practice of such embodiments as set forth hereinafter.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to describe the manner in which the above recited and other advantages and features of the invention can be obtained, a more particular description of the invention briefly described above will be rendered by reference to specific embodiments thereof that are illustrated in the appended drawings.

The referenced content items can be located at digital storage locations either within or outside of the content management system and may include any type of digital content (e.g., PDFs, image files, video files, audio files, word processing documents, media presentations, or webpages). As such, the content management system can generate, modify, and maintain collection content items so as to provide users with an efficient, flexible, and easy way to create a sharable collection of content items that are not limited by storage location, file type, version, or permission issues.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">To further illustrate, in one or more embodiments, the content management system can receive, from a client computing device, an indication of one or more content items to add to a collection content item (e.g., a data file that references and organizes the one or more content items as will be explained further below). In response to receiving this indication, the content management system can generate the collection content item including references to the one or more content items indicated by the client computing device. For example, the content management system can add, to the collection content item, references to the digital storage location of the one or more content items.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Additionally, the content management system can provide the generated collection content item to the client computing device for display. When displayed by the client computing device via a content management system application (e.g., a web browser or native application), the collection content item can include selectable references to the one or more content items. For example, in response to a detected selection of one of the selectable references in the collection content item, the content management system can provide a rendering of the content item or content items associated with the selected reference.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one or more embodiments, the content management system can provide both an edit mode and a display mode for a collection content item. For example, while a collection content item is in edit mode, the content management system can provide an editable view of the collection content item wherein the user may add text, formatting, content item references, and so forth. Additionally, while the collection content item is in edit mode, the content management system can provide additional tools for editing content items, modifying the organization of the content items, as well as other functions described in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition, the content management system can provide the collection content item in a display mode. While in display mode, the content management system can render the collection content item with a table of contents including selectable references to the content items previously added to the collection content item. In response to a detected selection of a reference within the displayed table of contents, the content management system can provide the referenced content item for display. In addition, the contentment management system can display the content items in a specified order, format, and version of content item, as will be described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In one or more embodiments, the content management system can provide a high level of permission control granularity associated with a collection content item. For example, the content management system can enable a user to specify a permission setting associated with each content item referenced by a collection content item. Thus, when the collection content item is later shared with one or more additional users, the content management system can maintain the same permission settings for each referenced content item. In this way, when an additional user interacts with the published collection content item, the content management system may provide access to some, but not all, of the referenced content items, depending on the additional user's permission level.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one or more embodiments, the content management system can determine the permission level of a content item that the collection content item references based on the folder permissions within which the content item is stored within the content management system. Thus, a user can combine several content items that are stored in multiple different folders, and the permissions from each of the multiple different folders is maintained for the respective content items regardless of the combination of content items referenced in the collection content item. In addition, in one or more embodiments, the content management system can provide an option to edit permissions of content items referenced in the collection content item. Accordingly, the content management system can allow a user to organize a collection of content items within a collection content item, and then easily edit the permissions associated with each of the referenced content items so that users having access to the collection content item can access each of the referenced content items.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition to permission control, in one or more embodiments, the content management system can provide version control for all content items referenced by a collection content item. For example, because a collection content item includes references to the digital location of a base content item (e.g., a &#x201c;live&#x201d; content item), the content management system can provide for display the most recent version of that content item. In other words, because the collection content item includes a reference to the storage location of the live content item, when a user accesses the collection content item, the content management system can provide the latest version of the content item. This remains true even when the collection content item is shared, re-shared, copied, and moved.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Alternatively, the content management system can provide a version lock feature that can provide a specific or fixed version of a content item within a collection content item to users (e.g., a &#x201c;published version&#x201d;). For example, the content management system can store various versions of a content item, and each of the versions have a specific digital storage location within the content management system. With the version lock feature, the content management system can add a reference to the digital storage location associated with a fixed version of a content item. Thus, while the live version of the content item continues to update based on any received edits, the collection content item can provide the specific version of a document. Accordingly, the content management system can provide an intuitive and efficient way to publish a specific version of a document to a group of people (e.g., an approved version), while the user responsible for the content can continue to work on the live version of the document until the next version is ready for publishing.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The content management system provides many advantages and benefits over existing systems and methods. For example, by enabling granular permission and sharing settings, the content management system is much more flexible relative to existing systems. Specifically, the content management system can enable permission and sharing settings to be set both at the file level (e.g., the content item level) and at the collection content item level. This, in turn, means that collection content item authors can share a collection content item with a group of users, but selectively disable specific users within that group from accessing certain content items within the collection content item. As such, the content management system can give collection content item authors a great deal of flexibility and control in how collection content items are shared with other users.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Additionally, by offering such granular controls relative to collection content items, the content management system avoids other pitfalls common to existing systems. Specifically, by utilizing the content management system's granular permission and sharing settings, users no longer need to create copies of files in specific folders in order to share them with a specific user or group of users, as is the case with existing systems. Instead, the content management system can allow a user to add storage references of several content items that are stored in various folders and locations to a collection content item, and then set permission levels for the collection content item without having to manually set permission levels at each of the various folders or create duplicative copies of files and folders. As such, the content management system efficiently utilizes system storage while ensuring that shared users are always seeing the correct version of files within a collection content item.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Moreover, the content management system avoids other technical pitfalls of existing systems by providing an efficient and streamlined graphical user interface in connection with a collection content item. For example, rather than the haphazard display of opened windows resulting from opening files in existing systems, the content management system can provide a single graphical user interface including a table of contents for the content items associated with the collection content item in one portion of the display, with a rendering of a selected content item in a second portion of the display. Thus, the user can make selections within the provided table of contents, and quickly view renderings of those content items; all within the same graphical user interface. Moreover, the viewing users can more efficiently and quickly access content items provided via the collection content item with fewer steps, selections, and interactions compared to having to navigate through various folders and make various individual file selections. Additionally, because the content management system can provide renderings of all different types of content items, users are not required to have specific applications and/or software installed for the purpose of viewing a content item. Additional advantages will become apparent based on the discussion below.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated by the foregoing discussion, the present disclosure utilizes a variety of terms to describe features and advantages of the content management system. Additional detail is now provided regarding the meaning of such terms. For example, as used herein, the term &#x201c;content item&#x201d; refers to any type of digital content available as a file. In particular, a content item can include an online cloud storage document (e.g., available via the content management system), a portable document format (e.g., &#x201c;PDF&#x201d;) document, a Microsoft&#x2122; Office&#x2122; document, a web page document (e.g., a .html document), a uniform resource locator (e.g., &#x201c;URL&#x201d;), or a digital media file (e.g., a digital video file, a digital image file, a digital audio file), or any other type of digital content.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one or more embodiments, a content item can include a collaborative content item. As used herein, the term &#x201c;collaborative content item&#x201d; refers to a content item that includes or is associated with collaboration information. For example, a collaborative content item may be a text document over which several users have collectively collaborated (e.g., added various portions, removed various portions, commented on various portions). In one or more embodiments, users can collaborate on a collaborative content item via a network application interface accessed via a web browser. A collaborative content item may include the text document data along with additional metadata including user information associated with the collaborators, timestamp data associated with document edits, and comment data from the various collaborators.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A content item can also include a collection content item. As used herein, the term &#x201c;collection content item&#x201d; refers to a content item that references other content items. For example, a collection content item can include a data structure or a data file that includes references to other content items. As used herein, a &#x201c;reference&#x201d; or &#x201c;content item reference&#x201d; refers to an identifier of the content item, wherein the identifier can identify, for example, a digital storage location of a content item or a unique ID associated with the content item. For example, the reference to a content item can include a pointer or resource locator that indicates a storage location of the content item. For example, a reference may be a pointer to an online cloud storage location of a content item, to a web server location of a content item, or to a hard drive location of a content item.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one or more embodiments, content management system stores collection content items in the same manner as other types of content items. For example, content management system can store a collection content items in a file structure based on the name of the collection content item and/or the author of the collection content item. Content management system can store a collection content item at the server level or at the client computing device. If stored on a client computing device, content management system may store a collection content item within a visible/accessible file system, as with other types of content items. In at least one embodiment, a collection content item can reference one or more additional collection content items. Such a collection content item would create a nested tree of collection content items.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one or more embodiments, a collection content item can also include display instructions, which can include hypertext markup language (HTML), cascading style sheets (CSS), or other types of instructions that dictate to a web browser or another type of application (e.g., a mobile app) how the collection content item should be displayed. In at least one embodiment, a collection content item, when accessed via a content management system application, has an edit mode and a display mode. As mentioned above, the content management system can provide or &#x201c;publish&#x201d; a collection content item to one or more additional users via the content management system application and/or a web browser.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As used herein, &#x201c;permission&#x201d; refers to a specific level of access associated with a content item. For example, a content item's permission setting can dictate specific users or levels of users who may view, edit, copy, share, and/or download a content item. Additionally, as used herein, a &#x201c;version&#x201d; of a content item refers to a copy of a content item at a specific developmental stage. For example, for various reasons, a content item may be changed, updated, or otherwise edited over time. In at least one embodiment, versions of the content item can include the content item at each stage of change. To illustrate, the content management system may create a fixed version of a content item by generating a snapshot of the content item at a specific time, and then creating a locked pointer to that snapshot. The content management system can maintain the &#x201c;live&#x201d; or editable content item for the content item author(s), while making the specific version of the content item available to other shared users.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic image illustrating an example system <b>100</b> wherein content management system <b>104</b> operates.

Content management system <b>104</b> can also add additional display instructions to the collection content item (e.g., as HTML, CSS) that cause the collection content item to appear a certain way when presented in display mode. Content management system <b>104</b> can then provide the collection content item (<b>312</b>) to client computing device <b>106</b><i>a</i>. Additionally, content management system <b>104</b> can store the generated collection content item based on a user account corresponding to client computing device <b>106</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In response to receiving the generated collection content item, client computing device <b>106</b><i>a </i>can display the collection content item in edit mode (<b>314</b>). In one or more embodiments, when providing a collection content item to a client computing device where the selection of content items for that collection content item was made (e.g., the &#x201c;author&#x201d; client computing device), content management system <b>104</b> can provide the generated collection content item in edit mode. While in edit mode, content management system application <b>108</b><i>a </i>can enable the collection content item to be further edited with the addition of other content items, or with changes to the display instructions associated with the collection content item. In other words, when in edit mode, the content management system <b>104</b> enables a user to edit a content item from directly within the displayed collection content item.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition, the content management system <b>104</b> can receive, from the client computing device, a request to directly access the content item separate from the collection content item. For example, based on a request to directly access the content item, the content management system <b>104</b> can provide, to the client computing device, the content item without providing the content collection item. This allows a user to access the content item separate from any collection to edit or otherwise edit the content item, for example. Once any edits are performed on the content item based on a direct access to the content item, then when the content management system <b>104</b> provides the collection content item that references the content item, the content item will show those edits since the collection content item references the storage location of the content item.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">At any point after the collection content item is generated, client computing device <b>106</b><i>b </i>can detect a selection of collection content item (<b>316</b>). For example, the author of the collection content item may have shared the collection content item with client computing device <b>106</b><i>b </i>via content management system <b>104</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the author of the collection content item may have added the collection content item to a repository to which client computing device <b>106</b><i>b </i>has access. In one or more embodiments, content management system application <b>108</b><i>b </i>may detect the selection of the collection content item via a graphical user interface provided on client computing device <b>106</b><i>b</i>. Content management system application <b>108</b><i>b </i>can then communicate the selection (<b>318</b>) of the collection content item to content management system <b>104</b>. Content management system <b>104</b> can provide (<b>320</b>) the collection content item <b>320</b> to client computing device <b>106</b><i>b </i>via content management system application <b>108</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one or more embodiments, content management system application <b>108</b><i>b </i>displays the collection content item (<b>322</b>) on client computing device <b>106</b><i>b </i>in display mode. For example, as mentioned above a generated collection content item can have two modes; edit mode and display mode. Content management system application <b>108</b> may provide a collection content item to a client computing device in one of those two modes depending on whether the client computing device is the author client computing device, a client computing device authorized to edit the collection content item, or a client computing device authorized to view the collection content item. If the requesting client computing device is the author device or a device authorized to edit the collection content item, the content management system application installed thereon can display the collection content item in edit mode. If the requesting client computing device is only authorized to view the collection content item (e.g., as with client computing device <b>106</b><i>b</i>), the content management system application installed thereon can display the collection content item in display mode. Content management system <b>104</b> can provide authorization information associated with the collection content item as part of metadata associated with the collection content item.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Client computing device <b>106</b><i>b </i>can detect a selection of a content item reference displayed as part of the collection content item (<b>324</b>). For example, content management system application <b>108</b><i>b </i>can detect a selection of a content item reference displayed within a graphical user interface including the collection content item. Client computing device <b>106</b><i>b </i>can communicate the detected content item reference selection (<b>326</b>) to content management system <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In one or more embodiments, content management system <b>104</b> enables collection content items to include references to files that are local to content management system <b>104</b> (e.g., located in content management system data repository <b>105</b>), and/or external to content management system <b>104</b> (e.g., stored on a client computing device hard drive or web server, such as third party server(s) <b>112</b>). In at least one embodiment, content management system <b>104</b> can determine that a requested content item is located on third party server(s) <b>112</b> based on the selectable content item reference associated with the content item. For example, the selectable content item reference may include a uniform resource locator (URL) or other type of file pointer.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In response to determining that the requested content item is located on third party server(s) <b>112</b>, content management system <b>104</b> can generate and send a request for the content item (<b>328</b>) to third party server(s) <b>112</b>. Third party server(s) <b>112</b> can then identify the requested content item (<b>330</b>) and send the content item (<b>332</b>) back to content management system <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one or more embodiments, content management system <b>104</b> renders a display of the content item (<b>334</b>) received from third party server(s) <b>112</b>. For example, content management system <b>104</b> can generate a rendering of a content item by determining a file type associated with the content item, extracting any text or other media from the content item based on the file type, and adding the extracted text or other media to a preformatted display. Content management system <b>104</b> can then provide the generated rendering (<b>336</b>) to client computing device <b>106</b><i>b</i>, where content management system application <b>108</b><i>b </i>can display the rendering (<b>338</b>) as part of a graphical user interface.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates a sequence diagram of content management system <b>104</b> applying permission settings to a collection content item based on requests from one or more client computing devices. In one or more embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, client computing device <b>106</b><i>a </i>can detect a selection of an existing collection content item (<b>340</b>). For example, as mentioned above, content management system application <b>108</b><i>a </i>installed on client computing device <b>106</b><i>a </i>can provide a listing of existing collection content items within a display on client computing device <b>106</b><i>a</i>. In response to detecting a selection of the existing collection content item, content management system application <b>108</b><i>a </i>can communicate the selection (<b>342</b>) to content management system <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Content management system <b>104</b> can identify the selected collection content item (<b>344</b>) and provide the collection content item (<b>346</b>) to client computing device <b>106</b><i>a</i>. As discussed above, content management system application <b>108</b><i>a </i>installed on client computing device <b>106</b><i>a </i>can display the collection content item (<b>348</b>) in either edit mode or display mode, depending on the authorship and authorizations associated with the collection content item. Content management system application <b>108</b><i>a </i>can then detect a selection of a content item reference (<b>350</b>) associated with the collection content item and communicate that selection (<b>352</b>) to content management system <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one or more embodiments, content management system <b>104</b> can determine whether to provide the content item associated with the selected content item reference (<b>354</b>). For example, every content item managed and provided by content management system <b>104</b> may be associated with various permission settings. In at least one embodiment, these permission settings dictate users that can interact with the content item in different ways. To illustrate, permission settings associated with a particular content item may dictate users who are authorized to: view the content item, edit the content item, share the content item, or copy the content item. Permission settings may list specific users (e.g., by username or account identifier) associated with various privileges or may list levels of users associated with various privileges.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In one or more embodiments, the content items referenced in the collection content item have permission settings in accordance with permissions settings previously stabled in the content management system <b>104</b>. Specifically, because the collection content item may store a reference to the storage location of the content item within the content management system <b>104</b>, that storage location may already be associated with permission settings based on the folder within which the content item is stored. For example, the content item may be stored in a folder that has an existing list of users associated with individual privileges. Thus, once the reference to the content item is incorporated within the collection content item, the list of users and associated privileges remain in effect from the collection content item without the author of the collection content item having to perform any additional file permission setting steps. This allows the author of the collection content item to easily share a set of content items via collection content item with groups of users while at the same time maintaining desired and previously defined permissions and access levels to each of the content items for each of the users.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">For example, a user can cause the content management system <b>104</b> to add a first content item from a first folder and a second content item from a second folder to a collection content item. In addition, in this example, the first folder is shared with user A and not user B, while the second folder is shared with user B and not user A. In this situation, the content management system <b>104</b> can share the collection content item with both user A and user B. When user A accesses the collection content item, the content management system <b>104</b> provides user A with access to only the first content item based on the first folder already being shared with user A. The content management system <b>104</b> does not provide user A access to the second content item based on the second folder not being shared with user A. Similarly, when user B accesses the collection content item, the content management system <b>104</b> provides user B with access to only the second content item based on the second folder being shared with user B, but the content management system prevents user B from accessing the first content item based on the first folder not being shared with user B.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">By using previously defined permission structures associated with content items stored within the content management system <b>104</b>, the content management system <b>104</b> provides an intuitive and efficient way to control permissions to content items shared via a collection content item. In particular, the content management system <b>104</b> can maintain file permission settings to allow a user to freely share content items with groups of users while maintaining a predefined permission structure, thus ensuring an efficient and accurate application of access privileges to multiple shared content items shared with multiple users.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one or more embodiments, the content management system provides an efficient permission setting function that easily sets the permissions for each of the content items referenced in a collection content item. For example, a user may wish to combine several content items from various folders having various different permissions with respect to each user in a group of users. However, the user may want each of the users in the group of users to have access to all of the referenced content items in the collection content item. In existing systems, a user would have to either have to create copies of content items and store all the new copies in a single folder (thereby consuming more storage space within the content management system), or the user would have to perform numerous navigation steps to manually change all the permissions of the various folders (which often is not desired because the user does not want the users in the group to access all of the content items in each of the folders). To overcome these disadvantages, the content management system <b>104</b> can provide a permission setting function that provides access to all the content items (or a select subset of content items) referenced in the collection content item.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, the content management system <b>104</b> can provide a permission setting menu that allows a user to select all or a portion of content items referenced within a collection content item. In addition, the content management system <b>104</b> can provide an option to provide a level of access (view, edit, share, etc.) to the selected content items for users that access the collection content item. Accordingly, with an interaction with a single button, the content management system can provide custom permissions settings to provide access to the selected content items to those users having access to the collection content item. Moreover, the content management system <b>104</b> define the specific users that have access to the collection content item.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In one or more embodiments, to provide access to content items referenced in the collection content item, upon receiving user input via the permission setting menu, the content management system <b>104</b> can associate metadata with the collection content item and the content items referenced in the collection content item that instructs the content management system to provide access to a particular content item when it is accessed from the collection content item. In other words, metadata contained within the collection content item can include access instructions that supersede defined permission levels for a specific folder. In this way, the content management system can easily provide, to a group of users, access to specific files within multiple folders without having to change the permission levels of each folder in which the content items are stored and/or create additional copies of the content items.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Continuing with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, and based on the principles discussed above, the content management system <b>104</b> can determine whether to provide a content item to client computing device <b>106</b><i>a </i>by identifying a user name, account identifier, or privilege level associated with client computing device <b>106</b><i>a</i>, and comparing the user name, account identifier, or privilege level to the permission settings associated with the content item. In one or more embodiments, if the user name, account identifier, or privilege level corresponds to a permission setting enabling access to the content item (e.g., for viewing), content management system <b>104</b> can render a content item display (<b>356</b>), as discussed above, and provide the rendering (<b>358</b>) to client computing device <b>106</b><i>a</i>. Content management system application <b>108</b><i>a </i>can then display the rendering (<b>360</b>) on client computing device <b>106</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, client computing device <b>106</b><i>b </i>can detect a selection of the same collection content item (<b>362</b>) as was previously requested by client computing device <b>106</b><i>a</i>. Content management system application <b>108</b><i>b </i>can communicate the selection (<b>364</b>) to content management system <b>104</b>, which can provide the collection content item (<b>366</b>) back to client computing device <b>106</b><i>b</i>. Content management system application <b>108</b><i>b </i>can display the collection content item (<b>368</b>) and detect a selection of the same content item reference (<b>370</b>) selected by client computing device <b>106</b><i>a</i>, above.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In response to receiving the detected selection (<b>372</b>) from client computing device <b>106</b><i>b</i>, content management system <b>104</b> can determine whether to provide the requested content item (<b>374</b>) to client computing device <b>106</b><i>b</i>. As discussed above, content management system <b>104</b> can make this determination based on a comparison of information associated with client computing device <b>106</b><i>b </i>and the permission settings associated with the requested content item. In at least one embodiment, client computing device <b>106</b><i>b </i>does not have the required user name, account identifier, or access level that enable access to the requested content item. In response to making this determination, content management system <b>104</b> can generate a refusal (<b>376</b>) associated with client computing device <b>106</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">For example, content management system <b>104</b> can generate the refusal as a pop-up window or other type of notification that includes information detailing why client computing device <b>106</b><i>b </i>cannot access the requested content item (e.g., &#x201c;Sorry, you do not have permission to view this content item.&#x201d;). Additionally or alternatively, content management system <b>104</b> can generate the refusal by deactivating content item reference within the collection content item displayed on client computing device <b>106</b><i>b</i>. As such, content management system <b>104</b> can provide the refusal (<b>378</b>) to client computing device <b>106</b><i>b </i>where content management system application <b>108</b><i>b </i>displays the refusal (<b>380</b>).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> illustrates a sequence diagram of content management system <b>104</b> providing versions of content items referenced within a collection content item to one or more client computing devices. In one or more embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, client computing device <b>106</b><i>a </i>detects a version action associated with a content item within a collection content item (<b>382</b>). For example, as mentioned above, content management system <b>104</b> can enable versioning options associated with a content item referenced in a collection content item.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">To illustrate, content management system <b>104</b> can enable a content item author to &#x201c;pin&#x201d; or otherwise define a specific version of a content item within the collection content item. In other words, the content management system <b>104</b> can store various versions of a content item with each version of the content item having a different storage location within the content management system <b>104</b>. The content management system can provide an option for the user to select to reference the live version of a document or a specific version of a document. Thus, the collection content item can include a reference that causes the content management system to provide access to the specific version of the content item via the collection content item, while simultaneously the author of the content item can continue to edit the live content item without affecting the version within the collection content item.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Accordingly, in some embodiments, a collection content item can include references to live content items (e.g., content items that will automatically update as changes are made) and/or specific versions of content items (e.g., a locked version of a content item that does not update as changes are made to the live content item). Additionally or alternatively, client computing device <b>106</b><i>a </i>can detect a version action relative to an entire collection content item (e.g., relative to all referenced content items in a collection content item). In such a case, content management system <b>104</b> can automatically &#x201c;pin&#x201d; or otherwise lock the current version of each content item referenced in the collection content item. For example, based upon a version action, the content management system <b>104</b> can determine a reference for the current specific version of each content item referenced in the collection content item so that even when the live documents update with user changes, the collection content item continues to provide access to the corresponding specific versions.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, in response to receiving an indication of the detected version action (<b>382</b>), content management system <b>104</b> can determine a reference location to a specific version of the content item (<b>383</b>). For example, content management system <b>104</b> can determine the storage location of the specific version of the content item referenced within the collection content. In some embodiments, content management system <b>104</b> can update the content item references within the collection content item so that they no longer point to the live content items, but rather point to the specific versions of the content items stored within the content management system <b>104</b>. In one or more embodiments, the storage location reference of the specific version includes versioning information (e.g., a creation timestamp, a version number).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">While the collection content item references the specific version of the content item, the content management system <b>104</b> can continue to update the live version of the content item based on edits received from the author, for example. For example, and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, client computing device <b>106</b><i>a </i>can detect and provide edits to the live content item collection content item (<b>384</b>). For example, as just mentioned, when content management system <b>104</b> references a specific version of a content item within a collection content item, a content item author can continue to edit the live content item while the specific version of the content item remains unchanged when accessed via the collection content item. Accordingly, upon receiving the edits, content management system <b>104</b> can apply the received edits to the live content item (<b>385</b>) without affecting the version referenced in the collection content item.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">To further illustrate, client computing device <b>106</b><i>b </i>can detect a request for the content item via the collection content item (<b>386</b>) and can communicate the request (<b>387</b>) to content management system <b>104</b>. In response to receiving the request, content management system <b>104</b> can determine the specific version of the content item to provide (<b>385</b>) to client computing device <b>106</b><i>b</i>. For example, content management system <b>104</b> can determine to provide the specific version of the content item based on metadata associated with the reference in the collection content item. Accordingly, content management system <b>104</b> can provide the specific version of the content item to client computing device <b>106</b><i>b </i>(<b>389</b>), where content management system application <b>108</b><i>b </i>displays the specific version of the content item (<b>390</b>).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In one or more embodiments, even though the content management system <b>104</b> provides the specific version of the content item, client computing device <b>106</b><i>a </i>can continue detecting additional edits to the live version of the content item (<b>391</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>. Moreover, in response to receiving the additional edits, content management system <b>104</b> can apply the additional edits to the live version of the content item (<b>392</b>). At some point, the author making edits to the live version of the content item may wish to publish a new version of the content item via the collection content item. At this point, the client computing device <b>106</b><i>a </i>can detect a version action to reference a new version of the content item (<b>393</b>) within the collection content item. For example, the content management system <b>104</b> can provide an update option associated with a referenced content item that a user can select to automatically reference the new version of a content item.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Upon receiving an indicating of the version action to reference the new version of the content item, the content management system <b>104</b> can determine the reference location to the new version of the content item (<b>394</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>. For example, the content management system <b>104</b> can replace, within the collection content time, the reference to the specific version of the content item with a reference to the new version of the content item. As with the specific reference, the reference to the new version may simply reference the new version and not the live document. In alternative embodiments, the content management system can receive input that causes the content management system to update a reference to a live version of the content item.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Moreover, after adding the reference location of the new version of the content item to the collection content item, the client computing device <b>106</b><i>b </i>can detect and send a request for the content item via the collection content item (<b>395</b>). Based on the reference within the collection content item now referencing the new version of the content item, the content management system <b>104</b> provides the new version of the content item (<b>397</b>), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>. Accordingly, the content management system <b>104</b> described herein provides a flexible versioning process that efficiently allows for the publishing of specific document versions while also maintaining a live document for editing and updating. Unlike existing systems that are typically limited to only sharing the live document version, the content management system described herein provides a flexible and efficient way to generate and share specific versions of documents, live versions of documents, and update both the live versions and static specific versions based on user settings.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">As will be described in more detail below, content management system <b>104</b> can generate, modify, and provide one or more graphical user interfaces.

Embodiments within the scope of the present disclosure also include physical and other computer-readable media for carrying or storing computer-executable instructions and/or data structures. In particular, one or more of the processes described herein may be implemented at least in part as instructions embodied in a non-transitory computer-readable medium and executable by one or more computing devices (e.g., any of the media content access devices described herein). In general, a processor (e.g., a microprocessor) receives instructions, from a non-transitory computer-readable medium, (e.g., a memory, etc.), and executes those instructions, thereby performing one or more processes, including one or more of the processes described herein.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">A processor can include any processing unit or device that processes instructions in a computing system. For example, a processor can include, but is not limited to, one or more of a central processing unit, a graphics processing unit, a field programmable gate array, an accelerated processing unit, a digital signal processor, or an integrated processor. A computing system can also include any number of processors for processing individually (e.g., by a single processor) or together (e.g., by a plurality of different processors or processor cores).</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Computer-readable media can be any available media that can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer system. Computer-readable media that store computer-executable instructions are non-transitory computer-readable storage media (devices). Computer-readable media that carry computer-executable instructions are transmission media. Thus, by way of example, and not limitation, embodiments of the disclosure can comprise at least two distinctly different kinds of computer-readable media: non-transitory computer-readable storage media (devices) and transmission media.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Non-transitory computer-readable storage media (devices) includes RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM, solid state drives (&#x201c;SSDs&#x201d;) (e.g., based on RAM), Flash memory, phase-change memory (&#x201c;PCM&#x201d;), other types of memory, other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">A &#x201c;network&#x201d; is defined as one or more data links that enable the transport of electronic data between computer systems and/or modules and/or other electronic devices. When information is transferred or provided over a network or another communications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or a combination of hardwired or wireless) to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a transmission medium. Transmissions media can include a network and/or data links which can be used to carry desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Further, upon reaching various computer system components, program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures can be transferred automatically from transmission media to non-transitory computer-readable storage media (devices) (or vice versa). For example, computer-executable instructions or data structures received over a network or data link can be buffered in RAM within a network interface module (e.g., a &#x201c;NIC&#x201d;), and then eventually transferred to computer system RANI and/or to less volatile computer storage media (devices) at a computer system. Thus, it should be understood that non-transitory computer-readable storage media (devices) can be included in computer system components that also (or even primarily) utilize transmission media.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Computer-executable instructions comprise, for example, instructions and data which, when executed at a processor, cause a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions. In some embodiments, computer-executable instructions are executed on a general purpose computer to turn the general purpose computer into a special purpose computer implementing elements of the disclosure. The computer executable instructions may be, for example, binaries, intermediate format instructions such as assembly language, or even source code. Although the subject matter has been described in language specific to structural features and/or methodological acts, it is to be understood that the subject matter defined in the appended claims is not necessarily limited to the described features or acts described above. Rather, the described features and acts are disclosed as example forms of implementing the claims.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the disclosure may be practiced in network computing environments with many types of computer system configurations, including, personal computers, desktop computers, laptop computers, message processors, hand-held devices, multi-processor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainframe computers, mobile telephones, PDAs, tablets, pagers, routers, switches, and the like. The disclosure may also be practiced in distributed system environments where local and remote computer systems, which are linked (either by hardwired data links, wireless data links, or by a combination of hardwired and wireless data links) through a network, both perform tasks. In a distributed system environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">Embodiments of the present disclosure can also be implemented in cloud computing environments. In this description, &#x201c;cloud computing&#x201d; is defined as a model for enabling on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. For example, cloud computing can be employed in the marketplace to offer ubiquitous and convenient on-demand access to the shared pool of configurable computing resources. The shared pool of configurable computing resources can be rapidly provisioned via virtualization and released with low management effort or service provider interaction, and then scaled accordingly.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">A cloud-computing model can be composed of various characteristics such as, for example, on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, measured service, and so forth. A cloud-computing model can also expose various service models, such as, for example, Software as a Service (&#x201c;SaaS&#x201d;), Platform as a Service (&#x201c;PaaS&#x201d;), and Infrastructure as a Service (&#x201c;IaaS&#x201d;). A cloud-computing model can also be deployed using different deployment models such as private cloud, community cloud, public cloud, hybrid cloud, and so forth.

For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, content management system <b>802</b> (e.g., content management system <b>104</b>) may generate, store, manage, receive, and send digital content (such as digital videos). For example, content management system <b>802</b> may send and receive digital content to and from client devices <b>806</b> by way of network <b>804</b>. In particular, content management system <b>802</b> can store and manage a collection of digital content. Content management system <b>802</b> can manage the sharing of digital content between computing devices associated with a plurality of users. For instance, content management system <b>802</b> can facilitate a user sharing a digital content with another user of content management system <b>802</b>.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">In particular, content management system <b>802</b> can manage synchronizing digital content across multiple client devices <b>806</b> associated with one or more users. For example, a user may edit digital content using client device <b>806</b>. The content management system <b>802</b> can cause client device <b>806</b> to send the edited digital content to content management system <b>802</b>. Content management system <b>802</b> then synchronizes the edited digital content on one or more additional computing devices.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">In addition to synchronizing digital content across multiple devices, one or more embodiments of content management system <b>802</b> can provide an efficient storage option for users that have large collections of digital content.
