Conventional string trimmers include an elongated shaft with a rotating element or head near the end of the elongated shaft, and a spool or string head is attached to the gear head. Typically, the string head includes a monofilament line (i.e., trimmer/cutting line) rotated by the head for cutting and trimming along landscaped areas, fences, walls, etc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such line is wrapped around a spool and may be dispensed from the string head during a cutting operation, in which the line is often broken or shortened due to obstructions (e.g., fence, stone, pavement, etc.) in a cutting region of the line. More line may be selectively dispensed from the string head until an amount of line on the spool is depleted or an error occurs during a line dispensing process. For example, the line may become blocked, stuck, or the like. During these occurrences, maintenance may be done on the string head to enable the dispensing process.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Often times, spools are also re-Tillable such that, once the among of cutting line is fully depleted, a new cutting line may be wrapped around the spool. An exemplary re-Tillable spool typically includes a single chamber for receiving the cutting line.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure

The upper line space <b>132</b><i>a </i>receives a first, upper cutting line portion <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the cutting line <b>20</b>. The lower line space <b>132</b><i>b </i>is defined by a lower side of the third flange <b>158</b> and an upper side of the second flange <b>156</b> and receives a second, lower cutting line portion <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the cutting line <b>20</b>. The first, second, and third flanges <b>152</b>, <b>156</b>, <b>158</b> are arranged in parallel planes in some embodiments. In other embodiments, one or more of the flanges (e.g., first, second, and third flanges <b>152</b>, <b>156</b>, <b>158</b>) extend around the central body <b>130</b> along a helical path, for instance.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the spool <b>18</b> may include additional flanges. Any or all of the flanges (e.g., first, second, and third flanges <b>152</b>, <b>156</b>, <b>158</b>) may be planar, disc shaped, gear shaped, or another shape depending on a desired construction of the trimmer head <b>10</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, as specifically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the third flange <b>158</b> includes sloped edges <b>159</b> that extend radially outwardly from the central body <b>130</b> and toward one another and toward the cutting plane/axis <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Teeth <b>160</b> are formed on the first flange <b>152</b> and are selectively engageable with the second series of teeth <b>118</b> on the retainer <b>42</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, teeth <b>162</b> are formed on the second flange <b>156</b>. In some embodiments, the teeth <b>162</b> are selectively engageable with teeth or apertures formed on the main body <b>30</b>. In other embodiments, the spool <b>18</b> may be received in the trimmer head <b>10</b> of the trimmer <b>1</b> in another orientation, or even in a trimmer head of another trimmer. In such embodiments, the teeth <b>160</b> and/or the teeth <b>162</b> of the spool <b>18</b> may engage portions of the trimmer head in which the spool <b>18</b> is received.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">With specific reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, the third flange <b>158</b> at least partially surrounds the first and second apertures <b>138</b><i>a</i>, <b>138</b><i>b </i>and the unitary tube <b>134</b> such that the unitary tube <b>134</b> has radially opposite ends opening into the upper- and lower-line spaces <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b</i>. More specifically, the first aperture <b>138</b><i>a </i>opens to the first line space <b>132</b><i>a</i>, and the second aperture opens to the second line space <b>132</b><i>b</i>, thereby defining portions of the cutting line <b>20</b> as first and second cutting line portions <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>. The first aperture <b>138</b><i>a </i>further opens/transitions into a first recess <b>170</b><i>a </i>or ramped relief surface formed in the sloped edge <b>159</b>, and the second aperture <b>138</b><i>b </i>opens/transitions into a second recess <b>170</b><i>b </i>or ramped relief surface formed in the sloped edge <b>159</b>. The recesses <b>170</b><i>a</i>, <b>170</b><i>b </i>accommodate a smooth or soft transition for the cutting line <b>20</b> between the unitary tube <b>134</b> and the respective upper- and lower-line spaces <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Directing the cutting line <b>20</b> along two different paths at least partially partitioned from one another may lessen an amount that the cutting line <b>20</b> tangles, thereby reducing the amount of jams or other interruptions in operation caused by the cutting line <b>20</b> (e.g., tangled or caught cutting line <b>20</b>, improper feeding of cutting line <b>20</b>, cutting line <b>20</b> getting stuck within the trimmer head <b>10</b>, etc.).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the first and second cutting line portions <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>are directed into different line receptacles (e.g., upper line space <b>132</b><i>a</i>, lower line space <b>132</b><i>b</i>) to continue wrapping around the spool <b>18</b> in a common rotational direction (e.g., clockwise). In some embodiments, the first and second cutting line portions <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>wrap around the spool <b>18</b> in opposite or otherwise different directions. In some embodiments, as more coils of cutting line <b>20</b> wrap around the spool <b>18</b>, the ramped relief surfaces <b>170</b><i>a</i>, <b>170</b><i>b </i>force the coils of cutting line <b>20</b> to stay in an order in which coils of cutting line <b>20</b> were wrapped around the spool <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Stated another way, the third flange <b>158</b> and partitioned upper- and lower-line spaces <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b</i>, in some embodiments, prevent coils of the cutting line <b>20</b> from overlapping and tangling. In some instances, this arrangement may prevent a coil of cutting line <b>20</b> from being pulled tight under a previous coil of cutting line <b>20</b> which may lead to a tangle. In some instances of severe or increased tangling, most or all of the cutting line <b>20</b> may need to be unwrapped/uncoiled (e.g., by a user). In such instances of severe tangling, the cutting line <b>20</b> may need to be re-wrapped/re-coiled around the spool <b>18</b>. Stated another way, this arrangement may, in some embodiments, prevent the need for a user to completely remove the cutting line <b>20</b> from the spool <b>18</b> and start over with a new cutting line <b>20</b> or re-install a previously tangled cutting line <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a spring (not shown) is located at the lower end of the spool <b>18</b> to bias against the housing <b>14</b> (specifically, against a portion of the main body <b>30</b> in the illustrated embodiment). In the biased position, the retainer <b>42</b> and main body <b>30</b> are biased downwardly by the spring and the spool <b>18</b> is drivingly connected to the housing <b>14</b> via the second series of teeth <b>118</b> located on the lower surface of the retainer <b>42</b> cooperating with the teeth <b>160</b> on the first flange <b>152</b> of the spool <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">To install cutting line <b>20</b>, an end of a single cutting line <b>20</b> is fed through the passageway in one eyelet <b>22</b>, into and through the first aperture <b>138</b><i>a</i>, through the unitary tube <b>134</b>, and out of and through the second aperture <b>138</b><i>b </i>of the spool <b>18</b>. The end of the cutting line <b>20</b> is then fed through the passageway in the other eyelet <b>22</b>, such that an equal amount of line extends from each eyelet <b>22</b>. The cutting line <b>20</b> is centered to define generally equal first and second cutting line portions <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>and then wound onto the spool <b>18</b> (e.g., by turning the housing <b>14</b> in a direction opposite to a feed direction while holding the top plate <b>34</b>) until sufficient cutting line <b>20</b> extends from each eyelet <b>22</b>. During installation of the cutting line <b>20</b>, the spool <b>18</b> is wound to shorten an amount of cutting line <b>20</b> outside of the eyelets <b>22</b>, thereby increasing an amount of cutting line <b>20</b> wound on the spool <b>18</b>. As the spool <b>18</b> is wound, the first aperture <b>138</b><i>a </i>and first relief <b>170</b><i>a </i>direct the first cutting line portion <b>20</b><i>a </i>into the first line space <b>132</b><i>a</i>, and the second aperture <b>138</b><i>b </i>and second relief <b>170</b><i>b </i>direct the second cutting line portion <b>20</b><i>b </i>into second line space <b>132</b><i>b</i>, thereby defining portions of the cutting line <b>20</b> as substantially equal first and second cutting line portions <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>positioned in respective upper- and lower-line spaces <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Stated another way, as the spool <b>18</b> is wound, the cutting line <b>20</b> is directed to opposite sides of the third flange <b>158</b> to reduce an amount of cutting line <b>20</b> in a single space, thereby reducing the likelihood of tangling of the line.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In operation, the trimmer <b>1</b> is operated to rotate the drive shaft <b>5</b> and, thereby, the spool <b>18</b>. As mentioned above, in the biased, initial position, the housing <b>14</b> and the retainer <b>42</b> are biased downwardly via the biasing spring, and the spool <b>18</b> is drivingly connected to the housing <b>14</b> via the plurality of cooperating interfaces <b>118</b>, <b>160</b> located on the retainer <b>42</b> and the top end of the spool <b>18</b>. As a result, the trimmer <b>1</b> can be operated to rotate the drive shaft <b>5</b>, thereby rotating the spool <b>18</b> (along with the housing <b>14</b> and the retainer <b>42</b>) and the cutting line <b>20</b> so that the cutting line <b>20</b> may cut vegetation.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As the trimmer head <b>10</b> is being operated, the trimmer head <b>10</b> may be &#x201c;bumped&#x201d; against the work surface, for example, to dispense additional cutting line <b>20</b>. The housing <b>14</b> and the retainer <b>42</b> move axially relative to the insert molded nut <b>26</b> against the spring bias to disengage the cooperating interfaces (e.g., teeth <b>160</b>, <b>118</b>) on the top of the spool <b>18</b> and the bottom of the retainer <b>42</b>. With these cooperating interfaces <b>160</b>, <b>118</b> disengaged, the housing <b>14</b> is free to rotate relative to the spool <b>18</b> so as to dispense additional cutting line <b>20</b>. The housing <b>14</b> may be depressed until the retainer <b>42</b> engages the top plate <b>34</b>. At this time, a plurality of cooperating interfaces (e.g., ramps, or teeth, <b>114</b> formed on the bottom of the top plate <b>34</b> and ramps, or teeth, <b>60</b> formed on the top of the retainer <b>42</b>) engage with one another so as to momentarily drivingly connect the housing <b>14</b> with the spool <b>18</b>. Once the housing <b>14</b> disengages the surface, the spring biases the housing <b>14</b> and the retainer <b>42</b> downwardly into the biased position. As the cooperating interfaces <b>114</b>, <b>60</b> on the bottom of the top plate <b>34</b> and the top of the retainer <b>42</b> are disengaged, the housing <b>14</b> is again free to rotate relative to the spool <b>18</b> so as to dispense additional cutting line <b>20</b> until the cooperating interfaces <b>160</b>, <b>118</b> on the top of the spool <b>18</b> and the bottom of the retainer <b>42</b> become engaged in the biased position.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Although aspects of the invention have been described in detail with reference to certain preferred constructions, variations and modifications exist within the scope and spirit of one or more independent aspects of the invention as described.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Various features of the disclosure are set forth in the following claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
