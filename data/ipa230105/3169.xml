EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present disclosure relates to a heat exchanger for a turbine engine, specifically a gas turbine engine, and the method of forming the heat exchanger. The heat exchanger can include a conduit or a circuit. Specifically, the conduit can be in the form a set of ducts defining a first interior. A set of rails support the duct relative to a portion of the turbine engine and define a second interior. A carrier plate can be positioned between the duct and rail. The set of ducts, the set of rails and the carrier plate can together be defined as an integral heat shield. It will be appreciated that this disclosure relates to a heat exchanger located on a radially outer portion of an engine casing. The heat exchanger and the engine casing, together, can define an active clearance control (ACC) system. As used herein, an ACC system can refer to a portion of the gas turbine engine which can be used to vary or maintain the clearance or distance between a stationary component or stator, and rotating component or rotor of the gas turbine engine. This minimizes an amount of leakage fluid flowing between the rotor and the stator. As a non-limiting example, the stationary component can be a radially inner portion of the ACC system such as the engine casing, while the rotating component can be a rotating blade within the gas turbine engine.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The method disclosed herein can provide for an additive manufacturing process to form the heat exchanger. Specifically, the heat exchanger can be formed through an electrodeposition manufacturing process such as through electroforming. As such, the present disclosure relates to a method of electroforming a heat exchanger that can be used in an ACC system. For the purposes of illustration, one exemplary environment within which the heat exchanger can be utilized will be described in the form of a turbine engine. Such a turbine engine can be in the form of a gas turbine engine, a turboprop, turboshaft or a turbofan engine having a power gearbox, in non-limiting examples. It will be understood, however, that aspects of the disclosure described herein are not so limited and can have general applicability within other heat exchangers. For example, the disclosure can have applicability for heat exchanger in other engines or vehicles, and can be used to provide benefits in industrial, commercial, and residential applications.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As used herein, the term &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; refers to a direction that is opposite the fluid flow direction, and the term &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; refers to a direction that is in the same direction as the fluid flow. The term &#x201c;fore&#x201d; or &#x201c;forward&#x201d; means in front of something and &#x201c;aft&#x201d; or &#x201c;rearward&#x201d; means behind something. For example, when used in terms of fluid flow, fore/forward can mean upstream and aft/rearward can mean downstream.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Additionally, as used herein, the terms &#x201c;radial&#x201d; or &#x201c;radially&#x201d; refer to a direction away from a common center. For example, in the overall context of a turbine engine, radial refers to a direction along a ray extending between a center longitudinal axis of the engine and an outer engine circumference. Furthermore, as used herein, the term &#x201c;set&#x201d; or a &#x201c;set&#x201d; of elements can be any number of elements, including only one.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">All directional references (e.g., radial, upper, lower, upward, downward, left, right, lateral, front, back, top, bottom, above, below, vertical, horizontal, clockwise, counterclockwise) are only used for identification purposes to aid the reader's understanding of the disclosure, and do not create limitations, particularly as to the position, orientation, or use thereof. Connection references (e.g., attached, coupled, connected, and joined) are to be construed broadly and can include intermediate members between a collection of elements and relative movement between elements unless otherwise indicated. As such, connection references do not necessarily infer that two elements are directly connected and in fixed relation to each other. The exemplary drawings are for purposes of illustration only and the dimensions, positions, order, and relative sizes reflected in the drawings attached hereto can vary. As used herein, a &#x201c;set&#x201d; can include any number of elements, including only one. &#x201c;Integral monolithic body&#x201d; or &#x201c;monolithic body&#x201d; as used herein means a single body that is a single, non-separable piece, or formed as a single unitary piece at manufacture, as opposed to being formed by combining separate elements into one during manufacture.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional diagram of a turbine engine, specifically a gas turbine engine <b>10</b> for an aircraft.

The combustion gases are discharged into the LP turbine <b>36</b>, which extracts additional work to drive the LP compressor <b>24</b>, and the exhaust gas is ultimately discharged from the gas turbine engine <b>10</b> via the exhaust section <b>38</b>. The driving of the LP turbine <b>36</b> drives the LP spool <b>50</b> to rotate the fan <b>20</b> and the LP compressor <b>24</b>. The pressurized airflow <b>76</b> and the combustion gases can together define a working airflow that flows through the fan section <b>18</b>, compressor section <b>22</b>, combustor section <b>28</b>, and turbine section <b>32</b> of the gas turbine engine <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A portion of the pressurized airflow <b>76</b> can be drawn from the compressor section <b>22</b> as bleed air <b>77</b>.

In the context of a turbine engine, the hot portions of the engine are normally downstream of the combustor <b>30</b>, especially the turbine section <b>32</b>, with the HP turbine <b>34</b> being the hottest portion as it is directly downstream of the combustion section <b>28</b>.

As a non-limiting example, the coolant circulated out of the heat exchanger <b>100</b> can be merge with the fluid within the exhaust section <b>38</b>. Alternatively, the heat exchanger <b>100</b> can be fluidly coupled to a coolant circuit such that the coolant within the heat exchanger <b>100</b> is circulated out of the heat exchanger <b>100</b>, cooled (e.g., through another heat exchanger, or air-conditioning system) and then circulated back into the heat exchanger <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The heat exchanger <b>100</b> and the engine casing <b>46</b>, together, can define an ACC system. As discussed above, during operation of the gas turbine engine <b>10</b>, the coolant within the heat exchanger <b>100</b>, specifically within the interior channel <b>118</b> of the rails <b>104</b>, can be exhausted from the outlets <b>127</b> and impinge a portion of the engine casing <b>46</b>. The cooling fluid <b>192</b> can be of a lower temperature than the working airflow <b>98</b> such that the cooling fluid <b>192</b> can cool the engine casing <b>46</b>. As the engine casing <b>46</b> is heated by the working airflow <b>98</b>, the engine casing <b>46</b> can expand radially outward with respect to the engine centerline <b>12</b>. However, the cooling fluid <b>192</b> can counteract the expansion of the engine casing <b>46</b> by cooling the engine casing <b>46</b>, thus eliminating the radial expansion of the engine casing <b>46</b>. This, in turn, can maintain radial space between or clearance between the radially inner surface <b>142</b> of the engine casing <b>46</b> and a corresponding rotating blade. As a non-limiting example, the cooling fluid <b>192</b> can be used to contract the engine casing <b>46</b> such that the clearance between the radially inner surface <b>142</b> and the rotating blades is reduced. In either case, the ACC system can expand or contract depending on the operational state of the gas turbine engine such that the space or clearance between the tips and a radially inner portion of the ACC system (e.g., the radially inner surface <b>142</b> of the engine casing <b>46</b>) can vary. The ACC system can dynamically control the clearance between the engine casing <b>46</b> and the rotating blades, which can ultimately reduce the amount of working airflow <b>98</b>, defined as a leakage airflow, that is able to flow radially around the rotating blades. It is contemplated that the larger the amount of leakage airflow that is present within the gas turbine engine <b>10</b>, the less effective the rotating blades are in generating work as the leakage airflow does not contact the rotating blades and generate torque. The ACC system can minimize the amount of leakage airflow or maximize the amount of working airflow <b>98</b>, thus increasing the overall performance of the gas turbine engine <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">During operation of the gas turbine engine <b>10</b> the pressurization of the fluid within the engine core <b>44</b> (e.g., the working airflow <b>98</b>) can generate a force on the heat exchanger <b>100</b>. As a non-limiting example, the pressurization can exert a hoop stress on the engine casing <b>46</b> and the heat exchanger <b>100</b> extending radially, circumferentially, and axially about the engine casing <b>46</b> and the heat exchanger <b>100</b>. As discussed previously, the stiffener <b>134</b> can physically couple the set of ducts <b>102</b> to the set of rails <b>104</b>. As such, the stiffener <b>134</b> can distribute the hoop stress evenly throughout the set of ducts <b>102</b>, the set of rails <b>104</b>, and the plate <b>156</b>, thus reducing the effect that the hoop stress has on a single portion of the heat exchanger <b>100</b>. In other words, the stiffener <b>134</b> can counteract the hoops stress. As used herein, the term &#x201c;counteract&#x201d; can be defined as the ability of a component (e.g., the heat exchanger <b>100</b>) to withstand or otherwise be resilient to a force exerted on the component.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of an electroforming process for forming the heat exchanger <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, by way of an electrodeposition bath <b>140</b> and a mold <b>158</b>.

The method <b>300</b> can yet further include aligning the at least one of the tabs <b>182</b>, which extend through at least one of the openings <b>126</b>, with at least one of the set of receivers <b>184</b> such that at least one tab <b>182</b> extends into at least one corresponding receiver <b>184</b>, thus coupling the first sacrificial element to the second sacrificial element, with the plate <b>156</b> disposed therebetween.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In yet another non-limiting example, the method <b>300</b> can further include coating at least a portion of the first sacrificial element and the second sacrificial element with a conductive coating (e.g., the carbon pain) such that the first sacrificial element and the second sacrificial element define the set of cathodes or a cathode layer.

The method <b>300</b> can yet further include removing the cathode layer with an etchant, which can be any suitable etchant such as, but not limited to, acetone.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In yet another non-limiting example, the method <b>300</b> can further include tooling at least a portion of the heat exchanger <b>100</b> after electroforming has occurred. For example, the method <b>300</b> can include tooling, by drilling or cutting, the outlets <b>127</b> within the set of rails <b>104</b>. As yet another non-limiting example, the method <b>300</b> can include tooling, by drilling or cutting, the set of openings <b>116</b> of the set of ducts <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Benefits of the present disclosure include a method of forming a heat exchanger without the need for conventional coupling methods that are needed in conventional heat exchangers. As a non-limiting example, a benefit of the present disclosure includes a method for forming a heat exchanger for an ACC system without the need for conventional coupling methods that are needed when forming a conventional heat exchanger for a conventional ACC system. For example, conventional heat exchangers such as those found in conventional ACC systems include a set of rails, a set of ducts, and a plate disposed therebetween. The rails, the ducts, and the plate are all prefabricated components that need to be physically coupled to one another through various methods such as welding, adhesion, fastening, or the like. These points where the prefabricated components are physically coupled to one another can establish points along the conventional heat exchanger that may be more susceptible to failure from use of the heat exchanger. For example, during operation of the gas turbine engine, the conventional heat exchanger can have forces (e.g., the hoop stress) or be exposed indirectly to high heats (e.g., the heat radiating from the engine casing), which can ultimately cause the points of coupling to fail. This, in turn, can negatively affect the life expectancy of the conventional heat exchangers. The heat exchangers that can be used in the ACC system, as described herein, however, do not use the conventional coupling methods. Instead, the heat exchanger, as described herein, is additively manufactured through electrodeposition, specifically electroforming. This process of additive manufacturing eliminates the areas of physical coupling that would otherwise act as potential points of failure that are present in the conventional heat exchangers. As such, the heat exchanger, as described herein, can have a longer life-expectancy and be more resilient to the forces and heat within the turbine engine than the conventional heat exchanger.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Further benefits of the present disclosure include a heat exchanger that can better withstand the forces exerted on the heat exchanger during operation of the turbine engine when compared to conventional heat exchangers. As a non-limiting example, a benefit of the present disclosure includes a heat exchanger for an ACC system that can better withstand the forces exerted on the heat exchanger when compared to conventional heat exchangers for conventional ACC systems. For example, conventional heat exchangers, include a set of ducts and a set of rails that are continuous and homogenous about its entire circumferential extent. This, in turn, makes the conventional heat exchanger susceptible to various stresses that will be exerted on the heat exchanger during operation of the turbine engine, such as the hoop stress exerted on the heat exchanger from the pressure of the working airflow. The heat exchanger that can be used in the ACC system, however, includes the set of stiffeners provided along the set of ducts and the set of rails, which extend through the stiffener opening of the carrier plate and physically couple the set of rails to the set of ducts. The set of stiffeners act to reduce the hoop stress within the set of rails, the carrier plate, and the set of ducts by distributing the hoop force along the heat exchanger. This, in turn, reduces the susceptibility of the heat exchanger with regards to the forces exerted on the heat exchanger during the operation of the turbine engine when compared to conventional heat exchangers. This, ultimately, increases the efficiency and lifetime of the heat exchanger.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Yet another benefit of the present disclosure includes a heat exchanger that is lighter and minimizes waste when compared to a conventional heat exchanger. As a non-limiting example, another benefit of the present disclosure includes a heat exchanger for an ACC system that is lighter and minimized waste when compared to conventional heat exchangers for conventional ACC systems. For example, as discussed above, conventional heat exchangers rely on prefabricated parts when constructing the conventional heat exchanger. In heat exchangers with two or more ducts and rails, the ducts and rails can be formed as a single prefabricated part such that material spans across the distance between adjacent ducts or rails. Alternatively, the two or more rails or two or more ducts can be formed as separate pieces that each need to be physically coupled to the plate in some way, shape, or form. Additionally, the ducts and rails of conventional heat exchangers need to be physically coupled to the carrier plate. All of this adds additional material to the assembly, which, in turn, increases the overall weight of the conventional heat exchanger. The heat exchanger as described herein, however, is formed through additive manufacturing and includes the set of stiffeners coupling the set of rails the set of ducts as described previously Further yet, a monolithic metal layer is deposited over the entirety of the first set of mandrels, the second set of mandrels and the plate. This, in turn, means that every component of the heat exchanger is formed as a unitary metallic piece and thereby coupled to each other. In other words, there is no need to connect adjacent ducts or adjacent rails to one another, or to the carrier plate. This ultimately reduces the total material needed to form the heat exchanger when compared to conventional heat exchangers. Further yet, the bracket of the carrier plate includes a cut out, whereas conventional brackets do not. This yet further eliminates additional material needed to create the heat exchanger. Ultimately, the heat exchanger as described herein is lighter than conventional heat exchangers. This, in turn, reduces the overall weight of the turbine engine, thus increasing the efficiency of the turbine engine when compared to conventional turbine engines.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">To the extent not already described, the different features and structures of the various aspects can be used in combination with each other as desired.
