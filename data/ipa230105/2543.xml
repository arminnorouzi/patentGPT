Moreover, depending on the types of monomers used in polymerization, a carbon-carbon double bond may also be present in a substituent bonded to the main chain or a 5-membered ring or in a condensed ring with a 5-membered ring (hereinafter, these are referred to as side chains). Hydrogenation of the norbornene-based polymer yields a hydrogenated product in which these carbon-carbon double bonds have been hydrogenated to form saturated bonds. There are instances in which conversion to a hydrogenated product enhances characteristics such as heat resistance, weatherability, light resistance, solvent resistance, chemical resistance, and water resistance. A commonly known method can be adopted as the method of hydrogenation. For example, the hydrogenation can be performed by supplying hydrogen to a solution of the norbornene-based polymer and performing an addition reaction in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst. The hydrogenation catalyst is preferably a catalyst that hydrogenates carbon-carbon double bonds in a main chain and that does not hydrogenate a naphthalene ring of a naphthyl group. Examples of such hydrogenation catalysts include ruthenium catalysts (chlorohydridocarbonyltris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium) and palladium catalysts. Supply of hydrogen may be performed by adding hydrogen at high pressure (for example, 1 MPa or higher) and performing stirring at high temperature (for example, 120&#xb0; C. or higher).</p><p id="p-0220" num="0211">&#x3c;Collection Step&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0221" num="0212">A norbornene-based polymer that is obtained through the polymerization step or a hydrogenated product that is obtained through the hydrogenation step can be collected as the cycloolefin polymer.
