Each of these have their benefits and detractions. For example, a single wheel with a single bonus event indicator on it, like a simple candy wheel, that can be spun after a player has a winning outcome. It is used to benefit a single pre-identified player after a winning event has occurred.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aspects of the disclosure comprise a bonus providing element (BPE) which is distinct from underlying game play, and methods and systems for triggering a BPE. In certain examples, the BPE enables individual players unique benefits to an underlying game when winning outcomes or triggering outcomes occur.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In certain examples, a bonus providing element distinct from an underlying game enables bonus awards to players at two or more player positions of the underlying game based upon receipt of a predetermined triggering outcome or event in the underlying game, by the bonus providing element providing an indication of at least three individual random indicators, such as: a) a first random indicator configured to provide an identification of a first award to be awarded to qualifying players of the players of the underlying game; b) a second random indicator configured to provide an identification of a single one of the two or more player positions; and c) a third random indicator configured to provide an identification of a second award to be awarded to the player at the single one of the two or more player positions indicated by the second random indictor.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In certain examples, the bonus providing element comprises a plurality of wheels, such as concentric wheels, wherein each wheel includes a plurality of segments or sectors.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In certain examples, the qualifying players comprise players of the underlying game that have placed a wager, such as a side wager.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In certain examples, the bonus providing element is activated when a community event trigger occurs in the underlying game.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In certain examples, the third indicator, such as a third concentric wheel, is only activated when the selected one of the player positions is a qualifying player.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In certain examples, the bonus providing element is presented as a graphical representation on a video display. The underlying game may comprise at least one of: a game presented at an electronic gaming table, an online game, a mobile game and a game presented at physical gaming table.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In certain examples, the first award is awarded to all qualifying players except the selected single one of the players that is awarded the second award.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another example of the disclosure comprises a system and method for activating a bonus providing element, including selecting a triggering event therefore. In certain examples, the system may comprise a controller; at least one input device configured to provide an output to the controller regarding the underlying game; a memory; at least one display device; and machine-readable code stored in the memory and executable by the controller to cause the controller to: (a) select a triggering event associated with the underlying game, the triggering event selected from a set of triggering events utilizing at least one random number generated by the at least one random number generator; (b) utilize the output from the at least one input device to determine if the triggering event has occurred and, if so (c) activate the bonus providing element.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In certain examples, the triggering event may be selected from a plurality of triggering events in a manner in which the certain triggering events are more likely to be selected than others. As one example, relative to an underlying roulette game, the triggering event might comprise a single roulette wheel number, two roulette wheel numbers or three roulette wheel numbers, such as where the single roulette wheel number triggering event is selected on average 60% of the time, the two roulette wheel number triggering event is selected on average 30% of the time, and the three roulette wheel number triggering event is selected on average 10% of the time.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In one aspect of the present invention, a bonus providing device distinct from underlying game play that enables a plurality of players unique benefits to an underlying game winning outcome or triggering outcome, is provided. The bonus providing device provides indications of at least three individual random indicators. At least two of the at least three individual random indicators are linear. Each one of the plurality of players is associated with a player station. The player stations are divided into a plurality of groups, with a predetermined number of player stations being associated with each of the groups. The three individual random indicators include:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0015">a) an identification of a randomly selected one of the groups;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0016">b) an identification of a randomly selected one of the player stations associated with the randomly selected one of the groups; and,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0017">c) an identification of a randomly selected parameter associated with a bonus award.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">In a second aspect of the present invention, a bonus providing device distinct from underlying game play that enables a plurality of players unique benefits to an underlying game winning outcome or triggering outcome, is provided. The bonus providing device provides indications of at least four individual random indicators. At least two of the at least three individual random indicators are linear. Each one of the plurality of players is associated with a player station. The player stations are divided into a plurality of groups, with a predetermined number of player stations being associated with each of the groups. The four individual random indicators include:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0019">a) an identification of a randomly selected one of the groups;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0020">b) an identification of a randomly selected one of the player stations associated with the randomly selected one of the groups;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0021">c) an identification of a randomly selected first parameter associated with a bonus award; and,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0022">d) an identification of a randomly selected second parameter associated with the bonus award.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0017" num="0023">In a third aspect of the present invention, a computer based method associated with a bonus providing element distinct from underlying game play that enables a plurality of players unique benefits to an underlying trigger condition, is provided. The bonus providing device provides indications of at least three individual random indicators. At least two of the at least three individual random indicators are linear. Each one of the plurality of players is associated with a player station. The player stations are divided into a plurality of groups, with a predetermined number of player stations being associated with each of the groups. The three individual random indicators include an identification of a randomly selected one of the groups, an identification of a randomly selected one of the player stations associated with the randomly selected one of the groups, and an identification of a randomly selected parameter associated with a bonus award. The method includes the step of detecting an occurrence of the trigger condition and responsively randomly selecting a group of player stations from a set of available groups of player stations, randomly selecting a player station within the selected group from a set of available player stations, and providing an indication to the players of the award of the bonus player parameter using a bonus providing element.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0024">Further objects, features, and advantages of the present disclosure over the prior art will become apparent from the detailed description of the

details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough description of the present disclosure. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art, that the present disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known features have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0049">Bonus Providing Element</p><p id="p-0044" num="0050">With reference to the drawings, in which like elements are numbered similarly, a bonus providing element or BPE is described. One example of the disclosure is a bonus providing element (BPE) distinct from underlying game play. The BPE enables individual player unique benefits to an underlying game winning outcome. The device may be electronic (e.g., with multiple player positions around a table or arena or viewing screen) or physical and describable as including a bonus providing element distinct from underlying game play that enables individual players or groups of players unique benefits to the underlying game winning outcome or triggering outcome.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0051">In certain examples, the bonus providing element provides a linear indication of at least three individual random indicators, wherein the at least three individual random indicators may comprise:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0052">a) an identification of a single one of at least two different player positions;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0053">b) at least one of an absolute amount or multiplier of a winning outcome payout; and</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0054">c) at least one of a multiplier, prize or an absolute amount larger than or smaller than any absolute amount or multiplier in b).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0046" num="0055">In a stadium or venue example, the bonus providing element may provide indications of at least three individual random indicators, wherein at least two of the at least three individual random indicators are linear. As discussed in further detail below, each one of the plurality of players is associated with a player location. The player locations are divided into a plurality of player station groups with a predetermined number of player locations being associated with one of the player location segments. In one embodiment, each player location group is a row of player locations. In another embodiment, each player station group is a section having a plurality of rows of player locations. The three individual random indicators may be an identification of one of the player sections, an identification of one of the play locations associated with the one of the player sections, and a parameter associated with a bonus award.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0056">In certain examples, when a winning outcome or triggering outcome by a first player position (any player position in a group of players) occurs in an underlying game, the bonus providing element is subsequently activated to randomly provide random outcomes for each of the at least three individual random indicators, and the random outcomes for the three individual random indicators is applied as i) one random outcome for the first player position, and ii) a combination of two remaining random outcomes indicates an award to at least one player position different from the first player position.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0057">In the bonus providing element, linear indication may be provided by at least three distinct and randomly rotating concentric elements with a first rotating concentric element defining a sector of a first concentric circular wheel indicating one of a), b) and c), and a second rotating concentric element defining a sector of a second rotating concentric wheel one of a), b) and c) without repeating any one of a), b) and c), and a third rotating concentric element defining a sector of a third rotating concentric wheel one of a), b) and c) without repeating any one of a), b) and c).</p><p id="p-0049" num="0058">The bonus providing element may have linear indication provided by at least two distinct and randomly rotating concentric elements with an inner element defining a sector of a circular wheel indicating one or two of a), b) and c), and at least one outer element defining a truncated sector at least one of a), b) and c) without repeating any one of a), b) and c) defined by inner element, with a total of exactly three of a), b) and c) provided by the inner element and the at least one outer element.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0059">The bonus providing element may have linear indication provided by three distinct and randomly rotating concentric elements with an inner element defining a sector of a circular wheel indicating one of a), b) and c), and a first outer element defining a truncated sector with one of a), b) and c) without repeating any of a), b) and c) defined by the inner element; and a second outer element defining a truncated sector with one of a), b) and c) without repeating any of a), b) and c) defined by the inner element and the first outer element with a total of exactly three of a), b) and c) provided by the inner element, the first outer element and the second outer element.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0060">The bonus providing elements may have the inner element provide exactly one of a), b) and c), and the outer element provide remaining ones of a), b) and c) not provided for in the inner element, or the outer element provide exactly one of a), b) and c), and the inner element provide remaining ones of a), b) and c) not provided for in the inner element.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0061">The bonus providing element may have the bonus providing element providing a linear indication of at least three individual random indicators comprising three rows of at least six columns, all random outcomes for a), b) and c) distributed with all combinations of one of a), b) and c) distributed within respective ones of a top row, middle row and bottom row, and the linear indication comprising a single column.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0062">The bonus providing element may alternatively have the bonus providing element is providing a linear indication of at least three individual random indicators comprising six rows of at least three columns, all random outcomes for a), b) and c) distributed with all combinations of one of a), b) and c) distributed within respective ones of a left column, middle column and right column, and the linear indication comprising a single row.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0063">The bonus providing elements may be provided by physical elements including a rotating inner sector and rotating outer truncated sectors, or by virtual elements comprising a rotating inner sector and rotating outer truncated sectors provided on a video display in communication with a processor, memory and a random number generator, the random number generator providing random ones of a), b) and c) for display on the video display.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0064">The bonus providing element in a virtual display may have random outcomes provided by virtually horizontally shifting columns on the video display or provided by virtually vertically shifting columns on the video display.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0065">The bonus providing elements may be associated with a single a casino table configured for use with a physical playing card game, dice game, or wheel game (e.g., roulette or Big Six), multiple linked tables, an arena set up of multiple player positions, a multiplayer platform with individual players sharing a common screen or dealer and the like. The bonus providing element may be associated with a single casino table configured for use with a physical playing card game, dice game, or wheel game. The virtual or physical playing card game, dice game, or wheel game may be selected from the group consisting of blackjack, baccarat, poker, craps, sic bo, and roulette.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0066">The wheel system is a progressive/side bet bonus system for table games. In certain examples, all players must place a separate wager before the table game begins is to participate. As described in more detail below, the bonus providing element may be activated by one or more triggers, such as a specific event that occurs during the underlying game (such as a community event, including Boxcars in craps, a 0 or 00 in roulette, trips in Sic Bo, a dealer 3 card seven in Baccarat). The wheel system contains 3 randomly generated events. In one version, the first event is a community prize that all participating players win. The second event is a player position at the table. The third event is an enhanced prize (either a multiplier of the community prize, a fixed dollar amount, a physical prize (car), or a progressive jackpot) which the player position selected in the second event wins. The selected player position must be participating in the bonus wager to receive the prize. The system may reveal the three randomly generated events in any order. In another example, the trigger is an event unique to at least one participating player (e.g. A dealt blackjack in Blackjack, a flush in Pai Gow). The wheel system contains 3 randomly generated events. The first event is a prize that the at least one participating player with the triggered event wins. The second event is a player position at the table. The third event is an Envy prize which the player position selected in the second event wins (the third event may be a percentage of the prize selected in the first event, or an absolute amount). The selected player position must be participating in the bonus wager to receive the prize. The system may reveal the three randomly generated events in any order.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0067">The Wheel Bonus System is for all formats and all table games&#x2014;Live, ETG, Virtual, Online, Mobile.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0068">A common problem with community games is that all combinations of cards, dice and roulette results that trigger a progressive jackpot do so for all of the participating players, and the players have to share the progressive.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0069">A method for providing bonus events to an underlying gaming event including multiple players at identified player positions may be performed by:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0070">1) at least one player placing a wager in the underlying gaming event;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0071">2) executing an event to conclusion of an outcome of the underlying gaming event; identifying the outcome as a predefined triggering outcome;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0072">3) after identifying the outcome as the predefined triggering outcome, activating a bonus providing element distinct from underlying game play to enable individual players or groups of players unique benefits in the underlying game triggering outcome, the bonus providing element providing a linear indication of at least three individual random indicators, the three individual random indicators including:</li>        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0073">a) an identification of a single one of at least two different player positions;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0005" num="0074">b) outcomes of at least one of an absolute amount or multiplier of a winning outcome payout; and</li>        <li id="ul0008-0006" num="0075">c) outcomes of at least one of a multiplier, prize or an absolute amount larger than or smaller than any absolute amount or multiplier in b); wherein, in combination with the triggering outcome by a first player position in the underlying game, the bonus providing element randomly provides random outcomes for each of the three individual random indicators, and the random outcomes for the three individual random indicators is applied as i) one random outcome for at least the first player position, and ii) a combination of two remaining random outcomes indicates an award to at least one player position that may be different from the first player position.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0061" num="0076">The method may have the bonus events available to only players wagering a predetermined minimum amount on the underlying game or available to only players wagering a side bet or progressive wager.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0077">In certain examples of the method, a single one of at least five different player positions may be awarded only one of a), b) or c), and at least one of at least four remaining player positions in the underlying game are awarded a fixed award different from the only one of a), b) and c) awarded to the single one of the at least five player positions.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0078">The underlying game may be a playing wagering event executed on a physical gaming table, and the bonus providing event comprises a separate physical random 25 event generator or electronic random generator comprising the three individual random indicators. The method may be executed wherein b) and c) are each unequally weighted among frequencies of b) and c) outcomes and a) is equally weighted among individual different player position frequencies.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0079">The three randomly generated events can be displayed in several different formats.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0080">One example uses a wheel with three rings (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>). One ring of the wheel determines the community prize won or an individual player position won. A second ring determines a player position. This second ring can have a number of sections which equals the number of player positions at the table OR can have a number of sections which equals the number of participating players at the table.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0081">A third ring determines what the enhanced prize is (either a multiplier of the community prize, a fixed dollar amount, a physical prize (car), or a progressive jackpot). The wheel may display the three rings in any order (SEE <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0082">Another example uses a wheel with two rings. One ring of the wheel determines the community prize won. The second ring determines a player position AND an enhanced prize (either a multiplier of the community prize, a fixed dollar amount, a physical prize (car), or a progressive jackpot). This second ring can be displayed in two ways. The second ring can have a number of sections which display the enhanced prizes. Each of these sections can be divided into different sectors to determine which player position wins the enhanced prize (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The size of the sections can be proportionate to the likelihood of winning the enhanced prize (Example . . . a sector for a 2 x. multiplier can be larger than the jackpot sector, indicating it is more likely under the secondary RNG). However the section sizes can also be the same size, with some sections being more likely than others. In another example the second ring can have a number of sections which display the player positions. Each of these sections can be divided into different sectors to determine the enhanced prize.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0083">Another example uses 3 individual wheels&#x2014;each wheel displaying one of the three randomly generated events.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a frontal view of a physical (or virtual) two concentric spinning wheel system <b>2</b>.

The activation of the BPE may occur when a predetermined triggering event occurs. The triggering event may comprise, for example, a particular event associated with the play of the underlying game.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0092">One aspect of the disclosure is a method and system for activating a BPE, such as (but not limited to) the BPE described and illustrated herein, including selecting triggering events therefor.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a system <b>300</b> for implementing a BPE, including activating the BPE. As illustrated, the system <b>300</b> comprises a controller <b>302</b>. The controller <b>302</b> may comprise, for example, a processor which is configured to execute machine-readable code (e.g. &#x201c;software&#x201d;), which code may be stored in a memory (not shown) which is associated with the processor. The controller <b>302</b> might comprise, for example, a table controller which is located at or associated with a gaming table at which a wagering game is being presented, or might comprise a controller associated with a gaming system server or the like.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0094">The controller <b>302</b> is preferably in communication with one or more input devices. Such input devices might comprise sensors <b>304</b> and/or other input devices <b>306</b>. The sensors <b>304</b> might comprise, for example, one or more cameras, IR sensors, RFID readers or various other sensors, such as associated with a gaming table or elements thereof (such as a card shuffler, card shoe, roulette wheel, etc.). The input devices <b>306</b> might comprise devices which are configured to receive input from a user, such as a button, touch-screen, mouse, keyboard, etc., or might comprise a device which generates an output, such as a card shuffler, card shoe, etc.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0095">The controller <b>302</b> is preferably in communication with one or more displays <b>308</b>. The display(s) <b>308</b> may comprise, for example, a video display. The display <b>308</b> might also comprise a physical wheel or reel or other device.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0096">In certain examples, the controller <b>302</b> implements, such as via the machine-readable code, a random number generator (RNG), such as which generates random numbers or values, or other types of random selectors.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0097">Additional details of the system <b>300</b> will be appreciated from a description of a method of use thereof.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0098">In certain examples, at one or more times, the controller <b>302</b> is configured to select one or more triggering events <b>312</b>. The one or more triggering events may be selected using a random value (such as at least one random number) <b>314</b> which is generated by the RNG <b>310</b>. As one example, a look-up table of triggering events may be provided, wherein the random value <b>314</b> is used to select one of the events from the table. In certain examples, the event table may include a plurality of triggering events, such as identified by a position or other identifier, and the random value may be correlated to one of the positions or identifiers, thus result in the selection of the triggering event associated with that position or other identifier.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0099">As described below, the triggering event is preferably selected from a set of triggering events (e.g. at least two events). In certain examples, the probability of selecting at least one triggering event may be different than the probability of selecting another triggering event (so that the frequencies of certain triggering events being selected may vary from one another). Further, the triggering event may have more than one component, such as a first component which identifies a first aspect of the triggering event (such as a number of roulette wheel numbers than will comprise triggers) and a second component which identifies a second aspect of the triggering event (such as the individual roulette wheel numbers that comprise each of the triggers).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0100">The controller <b>302</b> then determines if a triggering event has occurred <b>316</b>. This determination is made by comparing game play input information <b>318</b> to the one or more selected trigger events. The game play inputs <b>318</b> may depend upon the particular game and might comprise, for example, one or more cards, one or more hands, an outcome of a roulette wheel spin or other event associated with the play of the underlying game. As indicated, such information may be provided by the one or more input device, such as the sensors <b>304</b> or other input devices <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0101">As one example, a triggering event might comprise the outcome of a roulette wheel spin as the roulette wheel number &#x201c;Red 23.&#x201d; The outcome of the roulette wheel spin may be provided to the controller <b>302</b> via a sensor, such as a sensor associated with the roulette wheel, or might be provided by the croupier (such as by input to a touch-screen display), for comparison to the triggering event.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0102">If the triggering event does not occur, then the BPE is not activated (e.g. in the above example, such as if the outcome of the roulette wheel spin was the selection of a roulette wheel number other than Red 23). However, if the selected triggering event did occur, then the controller <b>302</b> may be configured to activate the BPE. This may comprise the controller <b>302</b> generating an output <b>322</b>, such as information to be displayed by the one or more displays <b>308</b>, an output signal which causes a physical wheel to be rotated (such as with a motor, etc.). Of course, the controller <b>302</b> might activate the BPE in conjunction with other inputs or signals. For example, In certain examples, a player or dealer might be permitted to provide an input which implements the BPE. As one example, the controller <b>302</b> might activate the BPE and then display a &#x201c;touch to spin&#x201d; button on the display <b>308</b>. A player or the dealer might then provide a spin input, such as via a spin button. Upon receiving that input, the controller <b>302</b> might generate the BPE output or send that output to the display(s) <b>308</b> so as to cause them to display the BPE event.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0103">One example of the disclosure comprises a method and system for activating a BPE associated with a roulette game. In certain examples of the disclosure, the triggering event for a particular roulette game may comprise different numbers of triggers, such as one (1) roulette number, two (2) roulette numbers, or three (3) roulette numbers. Most preferably, the frequencies of those triggering events differs, such as by having the 1-number trigger be selected more frequently than the 2-number trigger, which is selected more frequently than the 3-number trigger. As one example, the 1-number trigger might be configured to be selected approximately or on average 60% of the time, the 2-number trigger 30% of the time, and the 3-number trigger 10% of the time (e.g. whereby one or more of the triggering events has a higher probability of being selected than one or more other triggering events). This could be implemented in various manners, such as by a look-up table with slots 1-10, where the 1-number trigger is associated with positions 1-6, the 2-number trigger with slots 7-9, and the 3-number trigger with slot 10, such as shown in Table 1 below:</p><p id="p-0089" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="84pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Position</entry><entry>Triggers</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>&#x2002;1</entry><entry>1 number</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x2002;2</entry><entry>1 number</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x2002;3</entry><entry>1 number</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x2002;4</entry><entry>1 number</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x2002;5</entry><entry>1 number</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x2002;6</entry><entry>1 number</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x2002;7</entry><entry>2 numbers</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x2002;8</entry><entry>2 numbers</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x2002;9</entry><entry>2 numbers</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>10</entry><entry>3 numbers</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0090" num="0104">The RNG output may then be compared to the table. For example, the RNG output might comprise the numbers 1-10, such that the random selection of the number &#x201c;6&#x201d; would result in the selection of position 7 in the table, and thus a 2-number triggering event. Given that two times as many &#x201c;1-number triggers&#x201d; are associated with the table than &#x201c;2-number triggers&#x201d;, it would be expected that a 1-number trigger would be selected approximately twice as often as a 2-number trigger.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0105">Once the type of triggering event (in this case the number of triggers) has been selected in this manner, the one or more individual roulette numbers which comprise the triggers might then be separately selected (in other examples, the particular roulette wheel numbers for each might be fixed), such as again via the RNG, such as by using one or more additional or second random numbers. As one example, assuming that the roulette wheel being used is a &#x201c;00&#x201d; wheel, a table might be provided with spaces 1-38, wherein positions 1-36 correspond to the numbers 1-36, position 37 corresponds to the number 0 and position 38 corresponds to the number 00, such as illustrated in Table 2 below:</p><p id="p-0092" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="112pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" rowsep="1">TABLE 2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Position</entry><entry>Roulette Wheel Number</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>&#x2002;1</entry><entry>&#x2002;1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>&#x2002;2</entry><entry>&#x2002;2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>etc . . .</entry><entry>etc . . .</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>36</entry><entry>36</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>37</entry><entry>&#x2002;0</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>38</entry><entry>00</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0093" num="0106">If the RNG outcome was 38, then the roulette wheel number selected would be 00. In this configuration, a first output of the RNG may be used to select the required number of roulette wheel numbers or positions (e.g. the number of triggers) and additional RNG outputs may be used to select the individual triggers, e.g. the specific roulette wheel number or numbers For example, if a 1-number trigger was selected, then one roulette wheel number is selected using the RNG, such as 00. If a 2-number trigger had been selected, then two roulette wheel numbers are selected using the RNG, such as the numbers 00 and 6.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0107">Of course, the controller <b>302</b> may be configured to generate or select the triggering events in other manners. For example, a complex look-up table might be generated which has positions corresponding to 1, 2 and 3 number triggering events, wherein each position also designates the particular roulette wheel numbers (e.g., Position 1: 4; Position 2: 23,35; Position 3: 10, 17 and 31), where the number of positions that correspond to each type of triggering event might vary (for example, 60% of the positions may be 1-number positions, etc.).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0108">In certain examples, once the roulette game triggering event has been selected by the controller <b>302</b>, it may be displayed or otherwise indicated to the players and dealer, such as via display on the display <b>308</b>. In certain examples, a roulette game triggering event it selected for each roulette game (whereby the triggering event for each game is variable).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0109">Another example of the disclosure comprises a method and system for activating a BPE associated with a craps game. In certain examples, the selection of the triggering event may comprise the selection the combined point total of the roll of two dice (e.g. a dice roll count), such as any number between 2 and 12. In certain examples, however, the triggering event comprises only a sub-set of those numbers which comprise craps &#x201c;points&#x201d; or point values, e.g. dice roll count totals of 4/5/6 and 8/9/10. In certain examples, the triggering event comprises a single one of these points, but might comprise more than one (in similar manner to the roulette triggering event described above, such as any 1 point, any 2 of the points, etc.). Further, in certain examples, the frequency of the selection of each point may be the same, but in other examples, it might vary.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0110">In certain examples, the triggering event for a craps game may be selected at various times, such as before the come out roll for the game. Once again, the triggering event for the craps game may be indicated, such as by the display, to the players.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0111">Of course, the principles of the disclosure may be applied to other underlying games.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Stadium or Arena Bonus Providing Element</heading><p id="p-0099" num="0112">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>20</b>C</figref>, in another aspect of the present invention, a stadium bonus providing device <b>600</b> for use in a stadium or arena environment <b>500</b> may be provided.
