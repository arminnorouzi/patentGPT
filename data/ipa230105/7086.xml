In addition, the terms &#x201c;include&#x201d; and &#x201c;have,&#x201d; and any variations thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion, for example, a process, method, system, product, or apparatus that includes a series of steps or units is not necessarily limited to those steps or units that are expressly listed, but may include other steps or units that are not expressly listed or inherent to such process, method, product, or apparatus.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">It should be understood that, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; as used herein is only an association relationship that describes associated objects, and indicates that three relationships may exist. For example, A and/or B may indicate three cases: A exists alone, A and B exist simultaneously, and B exists alone. &#x201c;/&#x201d; indicates a relationship of &#x201c;or.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Wireless screen transmission is also known as wireless co-screen, flying screen, and screen sharing. In some embodiments, it is to display a screen picture of an electronic apparatus A on the screen of another electronic apparatus B in &#x201c;real time&#x201d; through screen transmission technology. Wherein the electronic apparatus A, for example, may be an apparatus such as a mobile phone, a tablet, a notebook, or a computer; and the electronic apparatus B, for example, may be an apparatus such as an interactive white board, a notebook, a computer, a TV, an integrated machine, or a projector.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Content of the picture can include various media information and real-time operation pictures, such as documents, videos, photos, etc. As long as the electronic apparatus A and the electronic apparatus B are in the same local area network environment, the screen picture of the electronic apparatus A can be transmitted to the screen of the electronic apparatus B for display. Exemplarily, both the electronic apparatus A and the electronic apparatus B are installed with a screen transmission application.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Typically, the size of the screen-transmission code is relatively fixed, such as a 6-bit screen-transmission code or an 8-bit screen-transmission code. In some embodiments, the screen-transmission code is obtained by processing the IP address using a screen-transmission-code generation algorithm, and the screen-transmission code and the IP address are in a one-to-one correspondence. Considering that the IP address assigned to the interactive white board is different each time, the screen-transmission code corresponding to the same electronic apparatus also changes as the IP address changes. In this way, the user needs to manually input the screen-transmission code of the electronic apparatus B on the electronic apparatus A before transmitting the screen picture of the electronic apparatus A to the electronic apparatus B. However, IP addresses have a large range in the local area network, in order to make the screen-transmission code and the IP address in a one-to-one correspondence, the screen-transmission code has a relatively complex composition, for example, the screen-transmission code includes English letters and numbers, etc., resulting in slow and error-prone manual input by the user when the user manually inputs the screen-transmission code.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Based on the above problems, the present disclosure provides an information processing method, device and storage medium. Through semi-automatic input, the input efficiency of the screen-transmission code is accelerated, and at the same time, the error probability of the screen-transmission code is reduced, that is, rapid and accurate input of the screen-transmission code can be realized.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, an application scenario involved in the present disclosure is described by way of example.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>is an example diagram of an application scenario according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

By the information processing method provided in the present disclosure, the screen-transmission code of the electronic apparatus B can be rapidly and accurately input into the electronic apparatus A. In an embodiment, the electronic apparatus A establishes a connection with the electronic apparatus B according to the screen-transmission code, and performs screen transmission processing.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, the electronic apparatus A takes a notebook as an example, and the electronic apparatus B takes an interactive white board as an example, but the present disclosure is not limited thereto. Wherein the interactive white board is integrated with any one or more of functions such as a projector, an electronic white board, a screen, audio, a TV and a video conference terminal. In an embodiment, the interactive white board is installed with a screen transmission application, and when the user starts the screen transmission application, the interactive white board in response to the startup operation acting on the screen transmission application, generates the screen-transmission code of the interactive white board based on the IP address, and displays the screen-transmission code on the screen of the interactive white board, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i></figref>.

In two electronic apparatus that perform wireless transmission through the screen transmission technology, one is the screen-transmission sending end, and the other is the screen-transmission receiving end, both of which can be interchanged depending on actual situations. In general, there may be one or more screen-transmission sending ends, which is set according to an application scenario and is not limited in the embodiment.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, the screen transmission application may be pre-installed in the screen-transmission sending end and/or the screen-transmission receiving end, or may be downloaded from a third-party apparatus or server and installed and used when the screen-transmission sending end and/or the screen-transmission receiving end starts the screen transmission application. Wherein the third-party apparatus is not limited in the embodiment. In an embodiment, the screen transmission application is configured to acquire content displayed by the screen-transmission sending end as screen transmission data, and instruct the screen-transmission receiving end to display the content. In an embodiment, a case in which the screen-transmission sending end and the screen-transmission receiving end are both installed with a screen transmission application is taken as an example for description. Wherein the screen transmission application of the screen-transmission sending end is configured to acquire screen transmission data and send the screen transmission data directly or indirectly to the screen-transmission receiving end. In the case of indirect sending, the screen-transmission sending end may send the screen transmission data to the screen-transmission receiving end through a transfer device, which may be a wireless screen transmission device or another device having a data transferring/processing function. The screen transmission application of the screen-transmission receiving end is configured to receive the screen transmission data, and convert the screen transmission data into corresponding content, so as to facilitate display by the screen-transmission receiving end.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">It is added that, in the scenario shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a</i></figref>, the screen-transmission receiving end is an interactive white board which is installed with a screen transmission application and integrated with reception and display functions.

Therefore, in order to display the screen transmission data in the screen of the screen-transmission receiving end, the screen transmission application needs to determine a screen mapping relationship according to the resolutions of the screens of the screen-transmission sending end and the screen-transmission receiving end, and then convert the screen transmission data according to the screen mapping relationship to obtain screen transmission content. It should be noted that, in the embodiment, the screen transmission content and the display content of the screen transmission data are substantially the same, but differing only in resolution.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">An information processing method according to the present disclosure will be explained below with reference to the embodiments.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart of an information processing method according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

According to the present disclosure, the target screen-transmission code can be determined when a user inputs the first N characters of the target screen-transmission code, and displayed in the input box, wherein N is less than the number of characters contained in the target screen-transmission code, thereby realizing rapid and accurate input of the screen-transmission code.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">On the basis of the above embodiment, since the number of target screen-transmission codes determined according to the input characters is at least one, at this point, the screen-transmission sending end may further display at least one candidate screen-transmission code containing the input characters, respond to a second operation acting on the target screen-transmission code, and determine the target screen-transmission code, wherein the at least one candidate screen-transmission code includes the target screen-transmission code. That is, the screen-transmission sending end determining the target screen-transmission code according to the input characters may include: displaying at least one candidate screen-transmission code containing the input characters, wherein the at least one candidate screen-transmission code includes the target screen-transmission code; determining the target screen-transmission code in response to a second operation acting on the target screen-transmission code.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Still taking a case in which the target screen-transmission code is &#x201c;G678SE&#x201d; as an example, after the user inputs &#x201c;G6,&#x201d; the screen-transmission sending end displays, according to the input characters &#x201c;G6,&#x201d; a candidate screen-transmission code containing &#x201c;G6,&#x201d; For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an schematic diagram of an interface when the screen-transmission sending end is a notebook, wherein the reference numeral <b>3</b> is used to identify at least one candidate screen-transmission code that is listed and displayed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an schematic diagram of an interface when the screen-transmission sending end is a mobile phone, and the reference numeral <b>4</b> is used to identify at least one candidate screen-transmission code that is listed and displayed.
