Like reference numerals denote like members throughout the drawings.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of a hybrid vehicle to which the present disclosure is applicable. The hybrid vehicle is configured such that power of an engine E is transmittable to a transmission T through an engine clutch EC and a motor M is provided on an input shaft of the transmission T to form a hybrid powertrain.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The transmission T is provided with an electric oil pump (EOP) for generating an oil flow rate to be used for controlling the transmission T and the engine clutch EC under the control of an oil pump control unit (OPU).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">For reference, a hybrid starter and generator (HSG) is provided in the engine E to start the engine E and generate power. The motor M is installed in the engine E and controlled by an inverter.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The transmission T is controlled by a transmission control unit (TCU), and the OPU is also controlled by the TCU. Thus, the following present disclosure is substantially performed by a controller such as the TCU or the OPU, and the OPU serves to directly drive the EOP under the control of the TCU.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an embodiment of a method of controlling an EOP of a vehicle according to the present disclosure is described. The method of controlling an EOP includes: confirming a gear shift type when a gear shift of a vehicle is started (S<b>10</b>); compensating for the number of revolutions of the EOP according to the confirmed gear shift type (S<b>20</b>); confirming whether a measured line pressure converges on a command line pressure while the compensating for the number of revolutions of the EOP according to the gear shift type is performed (S<b>30</b>); and additionally compensating for the number of revolutions of the EOP when it is determined that the measured line pressure does not converge on the command line pressure (S<b>40</b>).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In other words, according to the present disclosure, when the gear shift of the vehicle is started, the compensation is performed at the number of revolutions greater than the number of revolutions of the EOP, which is driven so far so as to supply a required hydraulic pressure according to a shift type. The number of revolutions of the EOP may be maintained relatively low to improve the fuel efficiency of the vehicle and an additional hydraulic pressure may be supplied according to a situation in which a hydraulic pressure is further required during a gear shift.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In addition, as described above, while the number of revolutions of the EOP is compensated for according to the gear shift type, it is confirmed whether the measured line pressure converges on the command line pressure. When it is determined that the measured line pressure does not converge on the command line pressure, the number of revolutions of the EOP is additionally compensated for.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In other words, according to the present disclosure, the compensation for the number of revolutions of the EOP according to the gear shift type, and the compensation for the number of revolutions of the EOP according to a degree of the convergence on the command line pressure, are duplicately performed. These compensations are performed so that compensation is performed for the optimal number of revolutions of the EOP suitable for the currently performed gear shift type. Further, even when an amount of hydraulic leakage is increased due to aged deterioration of a hydraulic circuit of the transmission, compensation for the number of revolutions of the EOP is additionally performed so that stable gear shift performance may always be secured and a gear shift failure may be prevented.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Substantially, the above-described control of the present disclosure may be performed by a controller such as the OPU.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The measured line pressure refers to a line pressure measured by a pressure sensor installed to measure the line pressure in the hydraulic circuit of the transmission. The command line pressure refers to a line pressure commanded by a controller such as the OPU.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">When compensating for the number of revolutions of the EOP according to the confirmed gear shift type, the number of revolutions of the EOP is compensated for from a time at which the gear shift is started until a gear shift phase set for each gear shift type becomes a predetermined compensation termination phase.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In other words, each of the various gear shift situations performed in the vehicle is defined as the gear shift type. Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the compensation termination phase is set in advance for each gear shift type. Further, the map set as described above is used so that it is possible to determine whether to compensate for the number of revolutions of the EOP to which gear shift phase in the currently performed gear shift type.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Here, the gear shift phase refers to an operation in which a gear shift is performed in each gear shift type and each gear shift type is divided into a plurality of phases. The total number of gear shift phases is the same in all the gear shift types. As described above, the compensation termination phase is set differently according to a characteristic of each gear shift type.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The compensation termination phase may be mainly set in consideration of an operating time of a solenoid valve operated when a gear shift of each gear shift type is performed.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, when the confirmed gear shift type is a power-on up-shift type, the compensation termination phase may be set to a higher gear shift phase than when the gear shift type is a kick-down shift type.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">When compensating for the number of revolutions of the EOP according to the confirmed gear shift type, the EOP is controlled at the number of revolutions obtained by adding the number of revolutions for gear shift situation compensation, which is determined according to a current line pressure and an oil temperature, to a basic number of revolutions of the EOP.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Here, the basic number of revolutions of the EOP may refer to the number of revolutions of the EOP before the gear shift is performed. In other words, before the gear shift is performed, the EOP is driven at the basic number of revolutions to maintain the number of revolutions of the EOP as low as possible so as to further improve fuel efficiency of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Since a relatively large amount of a flow rate and a relatively large amount of a hydraulic pressure are consumed in the transmission before the gear shift is performed to reach the compensation termination phase, the EOP is additionally driven by the number of revolutions needed for the gear shift situation compensation to satisfy the above-described need of the transmission.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">When confirming whether the measured line pressure converges on the command line pressure, it may be determined that the measured line pressure does not converge on the command line pressure when the measured line pressure is smaller than a pressure obtained by subtracting a predetermined measurement deviation from the command line pressure.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Here, the measurement deviation is for determining whether the line pressure of the hydraulic circuit of the transmission is substantially the same as the command line pressure. In consideration of accuracy and resolution of the pressure sensor, (e.g., for measuring the measurement line pressure), the measurement deviation may be properly set by a number of experiments and interpretations.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">When additionally compensating for the number of revolutions of the EOP, the EOP is controlled at the number of revolutions obtained by additionally adding the number of revolutions of additional compensation, which is determined according to the current line pressure and the oil temperature, to the number of revolutions obtained by adding the number of revolutions of the gear shift situation compensation to the basic number of revolutions of the EOP.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In other words, as described above, when frequent operation of the solenoid valve of the hydraulic circuit of the transmission is performed, a situation may occur in which the measured line pressure does not converge on the command line pressure. For instance, the amount of the hydraulic leakage is increased due to aged deterioration or end play of a friction element (such as a clutch) is increased, causing an increase in an accommodation flow rate of the friction element. Thus, in this situation, the EOP is driven at the number of revolutions obtained by adding both of the number of revolutions of the gear shift situation compensation and the number of revolutions of the additional compensation to the basic number of revolutions of the EOP. Thus, even after the aged deterioration of the transmission progresses, a sufficient hydraulic pressure and a sufficient flow rate, which are required for a gear shift, may be continuously supplied.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition, when the gear shift phase reaches the compensation termination phase and thus the compensating for the number of revolutions of the EOP according to the gear shift type is terminated, the EOP may be controlled again at the basic number of revolutions of the EOP, thereby contributing to fuel efficiency improvement of the vehicle as much as possible.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In accordance with the present disclosure, in a hybrid vehicle equipped with a hydraulically controlled transmission, a hydraulic pressure required for the transmission may be appropriately supplied, according to a vehicle situation, to improve fuel efficiency of the hybrid vehicle. Even when an amount of hydraulic leakage is increased according to aged deterioration of the transmission, constant gear shift performance can be maintained. Thus, a gear shift failure may be prevented.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Although specific embodiments of the present disclosure have been described and illustrated, those having ordinary skill in the art should appreciate that various alternations and modifications are possible without departing from the technical spirit of the present disclosure as disclosed in the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
