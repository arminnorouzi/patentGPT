More particularly, the technical field relates to buried heterostructure semiconductor optical amplifiers and related systems, and methods for fabricating the same.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">An optical amplifier is a device that receives an input signal and generates an output signal having a higher power than the input signal.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Existing types of optical amplifiers include but are not limited to erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA), Raman amplifier (ROA) and semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA). These optical amplifiers are all associated with respective challenges. For example, the EDFA is not only expensive to manufacture, but it is also bulky, because it requires a pump source, a coupler and an isolator. The ROA is associated with similar challenges but is even more expensive to produce than the EDFA. The SOA is typically more compact than the EDFA and ROA, can be more easily monolithically integrated with other devices and is also generally cheaper to produce. However, the noise figure is generally better in EDFA and ROA than in SOA.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Buried heterostructure SOA (BHet SOA) is a subclass of optical amplifiers. The fabrication of a BHet SOA has been commonly carried out along the &#x3c;011&#x3e; direction of the substrate (sometimes referred to as the &#x201c;conventional direction&#x201d;). One method for manufacturing a BHet SOA relies on three epitaxial growth steps, such as metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) growth steps, resulting in a complex and lengthy process.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is thus a need for techniques, methods, systems and devices that addresses or mitigate at least some of the challenges presented above.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with one aspect, there is provided a method for fabricating a buried heterostructure semiconductor optical amplifier, comprising:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">coating a substrate with a dielectric layer;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">defining openings in the dielectric layer to obtain uncovered regions of the substrate;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">etching, in situ, the uncovered regions of the substrate to form angles at corresponding edges thereof;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0010">diffusing, in situ, a p-dopant in the substrate to obtain a p-dopant distribution in a portion of the substrate, the p-dopant distribution having a distribution profile being provided by the angles formed at the corresponding edges of the uncovered regions of the substrate;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0011">etching, in situ, a portion of the p-dopant, thereby defining a tapered recess in the substrate;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0012">growing a n-blocking layer in the tapered recess;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0013">sequentially growing an active region over a portion of the n-blocking layer, a p-overclad over the active region, a p-contact over the p-overclad and a p-metal contact over the p-contact;

In this method, a base epitaxial growth including a n-InP layer and an active region layer is carried out on an n-InP substrate. After forming a narrow mesa via an ex-situ etching, a blocking layer is grown via a SAG process. Then, a blanket p-type overclad is grown. Finally, a mesa is formed via an ex-situ etching, followed by a metallization step. In this method, the current confinement is achieved via npnp blocking layers that are formed as a result of the process. This method, relying on three MOCVD growth steps is complex and lengthy. In addition, the relatively poor quality of the npnp blocking layer overgrown along the &#x3c;0-11&#x3e; has hindered the success of this method.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0077">An alternative method would be to employ a SAG technique to reduce the number of epitaxial steps during the fabrication of the SOA.

A non-limitative example of the dielectric layer <b>24</b> is a silicon oxide (SiO<sub>x</sub>). The dielectric layer <b>24</b> can be provided on the substrate <b>22</b> using coating and deposition techniques that are already known in the art. The substrate <b>22</b> is an n-type substrate, such as, for example and without being limitative, InP. It is to be noted that, in some embodiments, the method includes one or more precleaning steps before coating the substrate <b>22</b>. Such precleaning steps can be useful to remove contaminants from the external surface of the substrate <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0084">The step of coating the substrate <b>22</b> is followed by a step <b>100</b> of defining openings <b>26</b> in the dielectric layer <b>24</b> to obtain uncovered regions of the substrate. Coating the substrate <b>22</b> with the dielectric layer <b>24</b> and defining the openings <b>26</b> therein to obtain the uncovered regions of the substrate <b>22</b> are made using common microfabrication techniques. For example, and without being limitative, the step <b>100</b> of defining the openings <b>26</b> in the dielectric layer <b>24</b> may include patterning a photoresist layer provided on top of the dielectric layer <b>24</b> and etching the same after its patterning. The dielectric layer <b>24</b> can be coated with a photoresist layer of positive photoresist or negative photoresist. A characteristic of the positive photoresist is that the portion of the positive photoresist that is exposed to light (e.g., through a photomask during an &#x201c;exposition step&#x201d;) becomes soluble to a photoresist developer (i.e., during a &#x201c;developing step&#x201d;). Upon exposition to light through the photomask, the photo-sensitive material forming the positive photoresist will be degraded by light and the photoresist developer will dissolve the portions exposed to light, whereas the blocked or unexposed portions of the photoresist remain insoluble to the photoresist developer. After exposition and development of the positive photoresist, the patterns provided therein are thus a copy of the mask. A characteristic of the negative photoresist is that the portion of the negative photoresist that is exposed to light (i.e., through the photomask during the &#x201c;exposition step&#x201d;) becomes insoluble to the photoresist developer (i.e., during the &#x201c;developing step&#x201d;). Upon exposition to light through the photomask, the photo-sensitive material forming the negative photoresist will be cross-linked or polymerized by light and the photoresist developer will dissolve the blocked portions or portions unexposed to light, whereas the exposed portions of the photoresist remain insoluble to the photoresist developer. After exposition and development of the negative photoresist, the patterns provided therein are thus complementary to the mask. The photoresist, positive or negative, can be spin-coated on the dielectric layer core or could alternatively be coated or deposited with other deposition techniques. In a typically spin-coating step, a few milliliters of the photoresist are placed, poured or dispensed on the dielectric layer. A rotational movement is then imparted to the substrate <b>22</b> having the dielectric layer <b>24</b> thereon and a rotational speed equal to or greater than 1000 rpm can be reached. The centrifugal force due to the rotation of the substrate <b>22</b> spreads the dispensed photoresist into a thin film of substantially uniform thickness and the excess is spun off the edge of the substrate <b>22</b> and dielectric layer <b>24</b>. Part of the solvent contained in the photoresist can evaporate from the photoresist layer during the rotation of the substrate. The photoresist layer is then exposed to electromagnetic radiation through openings provided in a photomask placed above the photoresist layer. Of note, electron beam lithography could alternatively be used. As in most microfabrication process, the electromagnetic radiation is in the UV range. In some embodiments, exposing the photoresist layer to electromagnetic radiation comprises illuminating the photoresist layer with a beam having at least one ultraviolet spectral line. In some embodiments, the spectral line comprises 436 nm, 405 nm and 365 nm. After the exposition of the photoresist layer, the photoresist layer is developed in an appropriate solvent. In some embodiments, remaining portions of the photoresist layer after the development can be thermally treated in order to harden the same. In some embodiments, the remaining portions can be hardened using deep ultra-violet (DUV) radiation. Once the development of the photoresist is complete, a step of etching the exposed portions of the dielectric layer, which is followed by a step of stripping off the remaining portions of the photoresist layer, thus resulting in the dielectric layer having openings defined therein and portions of the substrate being uncovered, namely the uncovered regions. An example of the dielectric layer <b>24</b> coating the substrate <b>22</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0085">In some embodiments, the thickness of the dielectric layer <b>24</b>, which corresponds to the depth of the openings <b>26</b> provided therein, is in the range of about 1000 &#x212b; to about 15000 &#x212b;. As for the width (i.e., an opening size), it is typically in the range of about 2 &#x3bc;m to about 5 &#x3bc;m. Such openings <b>26</b> are referred to as &#x201c;narrow openings&#x201d;. It is to be noted that the dielectric layer <b>24</b> can also be provided with large openings to control the global growth rate during the SAG step(s).

For example, and without being limitative, the angles <b>27</b> can supplementary, i.e., their sum can be 180&#xb0;. In the context of the current description, the angles <b>27</b> are measured in a direction aligned with the width of the openings <b>26</b> (i.e., perpendicular to their longitudinal axis). This step <b>102</b> could be referred as a &#x201c;shallow etch step&#x201d;, as the depth of this etching is relatively small. Indeed, the aim of this in situ etching is to form the angles <b>27</b> at the edges of the openings <b>26</b> of the dielectric layer <b>24</b>, rather than etching the substrate <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, the depth of the shallow in situ etching is in the range of about 0.1 &#x3bc;m to about 0.5 &#x3bc;m. Non-limitative examples of precursors that can be used for this step <b>102</b> are methyl iodide, carbon tetrabromide, carbon chloride tetrabromide, carbon bromide trichloride, carbon tetrachloride and other precursors that are compatible with MOCVD technologies. An example of the result of this step <b>102</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0088">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, It is to be noted that the longitudinal axis of the openings <b>26</b>, i.e., the one running perpendicular to both the width and the depth of the same, is generally aligned along the &#x3c;0-11&#x3e; direction of the substrate or forms an angle &#x3b8; ranging from about 0&#xb0; to about 10&#xb0; relative to the &#x3c;0-11&#x3e; direction. In some embodiments, the angle is about 0&#xb0;. In other embodiments, the angle is about 7&#xb0;. The angle of about 7&#xb0; can be useful to minimize back-reflections from the facets.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0089">The step <b>102</b> of forming the angles <b>27</b> at the edges of the openings <b>26</b> is followed by a step <b>104</b> of diffusing, in situ, a p-dopant in the uncovered regions of the substrate to obtain a p-dopant distribution <b>28</b> in a portion of the substrate <b>22</b>. This step <b>104</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>. In some embodiments, the p-dopant is Zn. The portion of the substrate <b>22</b> is generally aligned with the uncovered regions of the substrate <b>22</b>, but also extends, in some implementations, under at least a portion of the dielectric layer <b>24</b>. The p-dopant distribution <b>28</b> has a distribution profile that is provided by the angles <b>27</b> formed at the corresponding edges of the uncovered regions of the substrate <b>22</b> being aligned with the openings <b>26</b>. The p-dopant distribution <b>28</b> could either be isotropic or anisotropic. In the first case, the ratio of lateral to vertical diffusion rate is approximately the same, whereas, in the second case, the ratio of lateral to vertical diffusion rate is relatively different. In some embodiments, the diffusion depth (i.e., vertical direction) is in the range of about 0.4 &#x3bc;m to about 1.0 &#x3bc;m. In some embodiments, the ratio of lateral to vertical diffusion rate is in the range of about 0.5 to about 1.0. It is to be noted that the ratio of lateral to vertical rate depends at least on the diffusion conditions and the shallow etching depth carried out in the prior step <b>102</b>. For instance, the presence of the angles <b>27</b> at the edges of the openings <b>26</b> generally increases the lateral diffusion rate of the p-dopant (with respect to the vertical diffusion rate).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0090">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>, the method also includes a step <b>106</b> of etching, in situ, a portion of the p-dopant, thereby defining a tapered recess <b>29</b> in the substrate. In some embodiments, the depth (i.e., vertical dimension) of this in situ etching is in the range of about 0.7 &#x3bc;m to about 1.7 &#x3bc;m. Unetched portion(s) of the p-dopant can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>. As illustrated, the dimensions of the tapered recess <b>29</b> can be different (e.g., smaller) that the distribution profile of the p-dopant. In the illustrated embodiment, the distribution profile of the p-dopant has a semi-circular or semi-elliptical cross-section and the tapered recess <b>29</b> has a truncated v-shaped cross-section. The result of the etching of the truncated v-shaped cross-section in the semi-elliptical cross-section of the distribution profile of the p-dopant is two p-dopant regions each having a cross-section having a shape resembling a fin, the two p-dopant regions being located on a respective side of the tapered recess <b>29</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0091">The method then includes subsequent growth steps <b>108</b> to <b>114</b>, as illustrated in the non-limitative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>E-H</figref>. An n-blocking layer <b>30</b> is grown in the tapered recess <b>29</b> in step <b>108</b>. A non-imitative example of an n-blocking layer <b>30</b> is an n-InP layer. In some embodiments, the thickness of the n-blocking layer <b>30</b> is in the range of about 0.5 &#x3bc;m to about 0.8 &#x3bc;m. While various n-doping levels can be achieved, the n-doping level of the n-blocking layer <b>30</b> typically ranges from about 6e17 cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>to about 2e18 cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>. The method also includes a step <b>110</b> of growing an active region <b>32</b> over at least a portion of the n-blocking layer <b>30</b>. It is to be noted that the active region <b>32</b> is electronically and/or optically active and could be made from a broad variety of architectures, designs, structures and/or materials. For example, and without being limitative, the active region <b>32</b> could be in the form of a bulk material, multi-quantum wells, quantum dots or a combination thereof. The refractive index of the active region <b>32</b> is larger and, in some implementations, much larger than the refractive index of its surrounding, thus enabling the required optical confinement for the device to operate. A p-overclad <b>34</b> is then grown over the active region <b>32</b> in step <b>112</b>. The p-overclad <b>34</b> is epitaxially grown. A non-limitative of the material forming the p-overclad <b>34</b> is InGaAs. The p-doping of can be achieved, for example and without being limitative, using Zn or any other appropriate dopants. While various doping levels could be used, the p-doping level of the p-overclad <b>34</b> is in the range of about 5e17 cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>to about 2e18 cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>. The method then includes a step <b>114</b> of a growing a p-contact <b>36</b> above the p-overclad <b>34</b>.

The doping level of the p-contact layer <b>36</b> is in the range of about 1e19 cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>to about 2e19 cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>. A p-metal contact <b>38</b> is then grown over the p-contact <b>36</b> in step <b>116</b>, and an n-metal contact <b>40</b> is grown on a backside of the substrate to obtain the buried heterostructure semiconductor optical amplifier in step <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0092">A schematic representation of the obtained device is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>H</figref>, and images of structures fabricated according to the present method are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> to <b>8</b></figref>. The achieved lateral npnp configuration is useful to laterally confine the current, and thus for avoiding or at least minimizing the leakage thereof. The double blocking layer, i.e., the two npnp junctions defined by the substrate <b>22</b>, the p-dopant distribution <b>28</b>, the n-blocking layer <b>30</b> and the p-overclad <b>30</b> do not only confine the current in the active region <b>32</b>, but also confines the current down of the valley (i.e., the bottom region of the active region <b>32</b>).
