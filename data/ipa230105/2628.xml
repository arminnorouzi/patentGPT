wherein n is an integer of 2 to 7.</p></abstract><description id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a printing ink composition or varnish composition, which is suitable to be used for any kind of printing technique, such as for offset printing.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Printing inks usually contain pigment, binder, solvent and several additives. While the pigment is responsible for the color of the dried printing ink, the solvent has the function to keep the binder and pigment liquid before the printing ink is allowed to dry. During the drying of the printing ink, the solvent evaporates or permeates into the substrate and the binder connects on account of its crosslinking and/or gluing properties the pigment of the printing ink with the printed substrate. In other words, the purpose of the binder is to completely encase the pigments and to fix the pigments on the printed substrate. Printing varnish compositions are composed likewise to the printing ink compositions except that printing varnish compositions do not contain pigment.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A plurality of printing techniques is known, such as offset printing, lithography printing, intaglio printing, flexographic printing, gravure printing and the like. The commercially available printing ink compositions and varnish compositions are tailored concerning their compositions so as to comply with the specific requirements of the printing technique(s) for which they are offered, such as an optimal viscosity for the printing technique(s), a good dissolution of the binder component, an excellent oxidation resistivity, a suitable boiling point and the like. On account of these reasons, the types of binders and solvents used in a printing ink composition and varnish composition depend on the printing technique, for which they are offered. For instance, sheet-fed offset printing ink/varnish compositions typically contain as solvent vegetable oils and/or fatty acid esters, whereas web offset printing ink/varnish compositions usually contain mineral oils or vegetable oils and gravure as well as flexographic printing ink/varnish compositions usually contain alcohols or esters as solvent.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, any of the solvents usually included in printing ink/varnish compositions has drawbacks. Mineral oils and lower alcohols are flammable and irritating. Moreover, mineral oils are fossil resources. Other solvents, such as vegetable oils, are nutrition and therefore ethically critical as long as starvation exists. Moreover, most of the known solvents used in commercial printing ink/varnish compositions are not carbon dioxide neutrally producible.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view thereof, the object underlying the present invention is to provide a printing ink composition or varnish composition, which comprises a solvent which is not harmful, non-toxic and particularly non-carcinogen, which has a comparably high flashpoint, which is easily disposable, which is not a nutrition and which is carbon dioxide neutrally producible, but which nevertheless is perfectly well suitable for printing ink/varnish compositions designed for established printing techniques, such as offset printing, flexographic printing, intaglio printing and others.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with the present invention, this object is satisfied by providing a printing ink composition or varnish composition containing a binder component and a solvent component, wherein the solvent component comprises at least one oxymethylene ether.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This solution bases on the surprising finding that oxymethylene ethers, which are currently evaluated as diesel substitute material, have the properties required for a solvent of a printing ink composition or varnish composition, such as a suitable viscosity, a good dissolution of those binder components typically included in printing ink/varnish compositions, an excellent oxidation resistivity, a suitable boiling point and the like. Moreover, oxymethylene ethers are non-toxic and particularly non-carcinogen, have a suitable volatility and flashpoint, if they are flammable at all. Furthermore, they are easily disposable, since they are usually classified in water hazard class 1. In addition, oxymethylene ethers are no nutrition and thus do not stand in competition of being used as human or pet food. Apart from that, oxymethylene ethers may be easily produced for instance from carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methanol and may be even produced from biomass, in particular from waste material in agriculture and forestry, which is no nutrition. Consequently, oxymethylene ethers produced in this way are no competition to the food production and may be produced with green electricity from renewable resources and carbon dioxide neutrally. Finally, oxymethylene ethers offer a suitable migration potential in typical food package substrates, such as paper, cardboard, films and metal foils, and are therefore particularly suitable for being used in printing ink/varnish compositions designed to be used for printing food packagings.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Preferably, the at least one oxymethylene ether included in the solvent component of the printing ink composition or varnish in accordance with the present invention is an oxymethylene dialkyl ether, such as an oxymethylene dimethyl ether, an oxymethylene diethyl ether, an oxymethylene dipropyl ether or an oxymethylene dibutyl ether. However, it is preferred that the at least one oxymethylene ether is an oxymethylene dimethyl ether.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It has been found that in particular oxymethylene ethers having a small or medium length have the aforementioned characteristics in good balance. In accordance with a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, it is therefore proposed that the solvent component of the printing ink composition or varnish composition in accordance with the present invention comprises at least one oxymethylene ether according to the general formula (I):</p><p id="p-0011" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>CH<sub>3</sub>[OCH<sub>2</sub>]<sub>n</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>,<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0012" num="0000">wherein n is an integer of 1 to 10, preferably 2 to 10 and more preferably 2 to 7.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0010">The synthesis of oxymethylene ethers in general and in particular of those with the aforementioned general formula (I) is known. For instance, they may be synthesized via an aqueous synthesis route by an acidic catalyzed reaction of methanol and formaldehyde or via an anhydrous synthesis route by an acidic catalyzed reaction of trioxane and methylal. A method for synthesizing oxymethylene ethers according to the general formula (I) with n being 2 to 10 via the aforementioned anhydrous synthesis route is for example described in WO 2006/045506 A1. In particular, the oxymethylene ethers may be produced with a carbon dioxide neutrally process from waste material derived from renewable raw material, such as it is described by Nicolaus Dahmen et al. in &#x201c;Erneuerbare Energie&#x201d;, herausgegeben von Thomas B&#xfc;hrke and Roland Wengenmayr im WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &#x26; Co. KGaA, Weinheim, 2007, ISBN: 978-3-527-40727-9, Seiten 59 bis 63. The synthesized oxymethylene ethers may then be purified by pervaporation and/or distillation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">In accordance with the present invention, the printing ink composition or varnish composition contains a solvent component, which includes at least one oxymethylene ether species. If not completely purified, oxymethylene ether usually contains two or more oxymethylene ether molecules with a different chain length. For instance, if oxymethylene ether according to the general formula (I) with n being 3 is synthesized, typically a mixture of several oxymethylene ethers will be obtained, wherein oxymethylene ether with n being 3 is the main component and oxymethylene ethers with n being 2, 4 and 5 are by-products. By purification for instance via distillation, the content of the target compound oxymethylene ether with n being 3 in the mixture may be increased up to more than 99% by weight. In accordance with the present invention an oxymethylene ether containing at least 95% by weight and preferably at least 95% by weight of a certain molecule length, such as of the general formula (I) with n being 3, is considered as pure oxymethylene ether, i.e. in this example as oxymethylene ether with n being 3, and not as mixture. However, if at least 5% by weight of oxymethylene ether molecules with a different molecule length are contained, the component is considered to be a mixture of at least two different oxymethylene ethers.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0012">In particular when a mixture of two or more different oxymethylene ethers is used, it is preferred that the solvent component of the printing ink composition or varnish composition in accordance with the present invention comprises oxymethylene ether having a weight average molecular weight of 106 to 256 g/mol. In accordance with the present invention, the weight-average molecular weight of oxymethylene ethers is determined by mass spectroscopy or by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0013">Moreover, it is preferred that the oxymethylene ether has a boiling point at 23&#xb0; C. of 200 to 350&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0014">In a further development of the idea of the present invention it is proposed that the printing ink composition or varnish composition comprises 5 to 90% by weight and preferably 30 to 85% by weight of solvent component based on the total weight of the printing ink composition or varnish composition. The solvent component is defined in the present invention to comprise any solvent contained in the printing ink composition or varnish composition, irrespective of whether the solvent is for dissolving the binder resin or other components. In the field of offset printing, solvent is sometimes considered as part of the binder. In accordance with the present invention, the binder component is the sum of all binder resins included in the printing ink composition or varnish composition, whereas the solvent component is the sum of all solvents included in the printing ink composition or varnish composition.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0015">In order to largely achieve the effects of the present invention, it is preferred that the solvent component comprises at least 20% by weight, more preferably at least 50% by weight, even more preferably at least 70% by weight and most preferably at least 90% by weight of at least one oxymethylene ether.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0016">In accordance with a particular preferred embodiment of the present invention, the solvent component of the printing ink composition or varnish composition consists of at least one oxymethylene ether, i.e. the solvent does not contain any other solvent except for the one or more oxymethylene ethers. In particular, the solvent and in fact the printing ink preferably does not contain any cyclic ester, any oxyethylene dialkylether or any oxypropylene dialkylether.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0017">In accordance with an alternative, less preferred embodiment of the present invention, the solvent component of the printing ink composition or varnish composition comprises in addition to one or more oxymethylene ethers one or more other solvents. In this embodiment, the solvent component of the printing ink composition or varnish composition comprises preferably 20 to 95% by weight and more preferably 50 to 80% by weight of at least one oxymethylene ether and the remainder to 100% by weight of one or more solvents being selected from the group consisting of mineral oils, vegetable oils, fatty acid esters being different from vegetable oils, alcohols, esters, ethers, glycols, cyclic or linear hydrocarbons, ketones, lactones, alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, aromatic compounds and arbitrary combinations of two or more of the aforementioned solvents.

Good results are in particular obtained, when the printing ink composition or varnish composition comprises 10 to 70% by weight and more preferably 10 to 45% by weight of binder component based on the total weight of the printing ink composition or varnish composition. Again, the binder component is according to the present invention the sum of all binder resins included in the printing ink composition or varnish composition, whereas any kind of solvent, even if it is contained for dissolving the binder resin, is not considered in the present invention as part of the binder component, but as part of the solvent component.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0019">Suitable examples for the ingredient(s) of the binder component are binders being selected from the group consisting of polyesters, polyethers, polyurethanes, urethane-modified resins, polyamide resins, polyacrylates, maleic resins, rosin modified fumaric resins, collophonium resins, dimerized and polymerized rosins, rosin esters, tallic resins, tall oil based resins, ketonic resins, aldehyde resins, alkyd resins, collophonium modified phenolic resins, hydrocarbon-resin modified phenolic resins, hydrocarbon resins, modified hydrocarbon resins, maleic modified resins, silicates, silicones, phenolic resins, urea urethane resins, melamine resins, epoxy resins, polyterpene resins, shellac, copal, dammar, lignin derivatives, natural resins, poly-vinylalcohols, polyvinylethers, polyvinylacetates, vinylacetate copolymers, polyvinylchlorides, polyvinylpropionates, polyvinylbutyrates, polymethacrylates, polystyrenes, styrene-modified resins, styreneacrylate resins, polyolefines, coumarone-indene resins, aromatic formaldehyde resins, carbamide acid resins, sulfonamide resins, chlorinated resins, nitrocellulose, ethylcellulose, CAB (cellulose acetate butyrate), CAP (cellulose acetate propionate), cellulose compounds, acrylate resins, amino acrylic resins, aminopolyester resins, asphalt, Ca/Mg resinates, rubbers, polysaccharides, polyol/iscocyanate compounds, temperature curing resins and arbitrary combinations of two or more of the aforementioned binders.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0020">Furthermore, the printing ink composition or varnish composition may contain one or more additives.
