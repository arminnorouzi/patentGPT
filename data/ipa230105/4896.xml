The first user may correspond to a user who has a personal account, a corporate account, or a service account registered in the instant messaging service, and the second user may correspond to a user who has a corporate account or a service account registered in the instant messaging service.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to an example embodiment, the first user may request the instant messaging server for the counseling through the channel of the second user using a terminal. As an example, the terminal or the first user may be input with a command from the first user for requesting the counseling from a website or application linked to the channel of the second user and transmit a signal for requesting the instant messaging server for the counseling through the channel of the second user. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the terminal of the first user responses to an input of the first user who selects (e.g., clicks) a button <b>211</b> for requesting the counseling on a website <b>210</b> linked to the channel of the second user to transmit a signal requesting the counseling through the channel of the second user to the instant messaging server. As another example, the terminal of the first user may request the counseling on the channel of the second user through an interface related to the channel of the second user provided in the instant messenger. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the terminal of the first user responses to an input of the first user who selects (e.g., clicks) a button <b>221</b> for requesting the counseling on an interface <b>220</b> related to the channel of the second user provided in the instant messenger to transmit a signal for requesting the counseling through the channel of the second user to the instant messaging server. In this case, the counseling request for the channel of the second user may be transmitted to the counseling center server through the instant messaging server.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The instant messaging server according to an example embodiment may provide the terminal of the first user with a chat interface for counseling corresponding to the channel of the second user in response to the input of the first user requesting the counseling through the channel of the second user. The chat interface for counseling according to an example embodiment may correspond to a user interface for transmitting and receiving a chat message for counseling and displaying the transmitted and received message.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The chat interface for counseling according to an example embodiment may include a chat window corresponding to a virtual chat space in which at least one account or channel participates. The &#x2018;virtual chat space&#x2019; may be referred to as a &#x2018;chat room&#x2019;. According to an example embodiment, the instant messaging server may create a chat room for counseling in which the first user's account and the second user's channel participate in response to an input of the first user requesting the counseling through the channel of the second user and may provide the terminal of the first user with the chat interface corresponding to the created chat room.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">According to an example embodiment, when the terminal of the first user who requested the counseling through the channel of the second user is not logged in to the instant messaging service, the instant messaging server may request the terminal of the first user to log in for the instant messaging service. For example, the instant messaging server may call an instant messenger application installed in the terminal of the first user and provide an interface for logging in to an account registered in the instant messaging service. The instant messaging server may provide a chat interface for counseling corresponding to the channel of the second user to the terminal of the first user logged in to the instant messaging service with the account of the first user. Hereinafter, description will be followed by assuming that the terminal of the first user is logged in with the account of the first user registered in the instant messaging service.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, when an input of the first user requesting the counseling is received from the website, the instant messaging server may provide a chat interface in the form of web chatting through the website. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the instant messaging server responses to a counseling request through a website <b>310</b> to provide a chat interface <b>311</b> for counseling corresponding to the second channel in the form of web chatting through the website <b>310</b>. Also, it is possible to provide a chat interface through an instant messenger application by calling the instant messenger application installed in the terminal of the first user. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the instant messaging server responds to a counseling request through a website or a counseling request through a channel interface of the second user provided in the instant messenger so as to call the instant messenger application installed in the terminal of the first user and provide a chat interface <b>320</b> through the called instant messenger application.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to an example embodiment, the terminal of the first user logged in with an account of the first user accesses the chat room of the second user's channel in which the account of the first user participates through the chat interface, or transmits a message through the chat room of the channel of the second user so as to transmit the input of the first user requesting the counseling. The input of the first user requesting the counseling may be transmitted to the instant messaging server, and the instant messaging server may transmit the same to the counseling center server. In other words, operation <b>110</b> according to an example embodiment may include receiving an input of the first user requesting the counseling through the channel of the second user from the instant messaging server.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to an example embodiment, operations of creating the chat room, requesting login, and providing the chat interface described above as being performed in the instant messaging server may be performed in the counseling center server. In this case, operation <b>110</b> according to an example embodiment may include directly receiving, by the counseling center server, an input of the first user requesting the counseling from the terminal that is logged in with the account of the first user.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The counseling type according to an example embodiment may include a first counseling type corresponding to the unmanned counseling and a second counseling type corresponding to the manned counseling depending on a conducting type of the counseling. The first counseling type corresponding to the unmanned counseling is a counseling type that is conducted without a counselor, a natural individual, which may include, for example, a counseling type conducted using a chatbot and/or a counseling type conducted using a database. The unmanned counseling may include counseling types conducted in various ways without counselors of natural individual. However, for convenience of explanation below, described below with an example is the unmanned counseling referred to a counseling type conducted via a previously created chatbot for counseling. The second counseling type corresponding to the manned counseling is a counseling type conducted with a counselor of natural individual. For example, it may include a counseling type that is conducted in a <b>1</b>:<b>1</b> chatting manner through a chat interface between the first user who requested the counseling and a counselor linked to a channel of a second user. The counselor linked to the second user's channel may correspond to a user who is able to transmit and receive a chat message regarding the counseling with another user account requesting the counseling using the channel of the second user.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to an example embodiment, the channel of the second user may be linked with at least one of a counselor and a chatbot previously created for counseling. In other words, the channel of the second user may be linked to both the counselor and the chatbot or may be linked to only one of the counselor and the chatbot. In the case that the counselor is linked to the channel of the second user but not the chatbot, the counseling through the channel of the second user may be conducted via the manned counseling. In the case that the chatbot is linked to the channel of the second user but not the counselor, the counseling through the channel of the second user may be conducted via the unmanned counseling. When the channel of the second user is linked to both the counselor and the chatbot, counseling through the channel of the second user may support both the manned counseling and the unmanned counseling. Accordingly, when the channel of the second user is linked to both the counselor and the chatbot, the counseling type may be determined to be one of the manned counseling and the unmanned counseling prior to the initiation of the counseling, and the counseling type may be changed even while the counseling is being conducted. For example, the counseling type through the channel of the second user may be selected as either one of the manned counseling and the unmanned counseling by the first user, and the counseling type may be determined according to a predetermined criterion corresponding to the channel of the second user.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to an example embodiment, an input of the first user requesting the counseling on a channel may include information indicating the type of counseling. For example, the input of the first user for requesting the counseling on a channel may include an input for requesting chatting with a chatbot linked to the channel or an input for transmitting a message by designating a chatbot linked to the channel as a recipient. In this case, the input of the first user may correspond to an input for requesting the unmanned counseling for the channel. Also, for example, the input of the first user requesting the counseling on a channel may include an input for requesting chatting with a counselor linked to the channel or an input for transmitting a message by designating a counselor linked with the channel as a recipient. In this case, the input of the first user may correspond to an input for requesting the manned counseling for the channel.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to an example embodiment, a server may transmit the counseling type acquired in operation <b>110</b> to the instant messaging server, and the instant messaging server may add an interfacing object indicating the counseling type to the chat interface.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The interfacing object is a configuration set to interact with a user within an interface, and may include, for example, an object that may receive an input from a user while providing the user with specific information (e.g., visual information, etc.). The interfacing object may include a button created to make a predetermined function performed (e.g., switching to another screen, etc.) by an input of user selection (e.g., click).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The interfacing object according to an example embodiment may include a function of displaying a counseling type. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, the chat interface may include interfacing objects <b>411</b> and <b>421</b> that visually display the counseling type, and a visual sign of the interfacing object <b>411</b> corresponding to the first counseling type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> may be distinguished from that of the interfacing object <b>421</b> corresponding to the second counseling type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>. Also, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, in order to inform the user that the counseling is the first counseling type conducted with the chatbot, the text saying &#x2018;Send a message to the chatbot&#x2019; may be displayed in an input window <b>412</b> of the chat message. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, in order to inform the user that the counseling is the second counseling type conducted with a counselor, the text saying &#x2018;Send a message to the counselor&#x2019; may be displayed in an input window <b>422</b> of the chat message.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The interfacing object according to an example embodiment may include a guide comment corresponding to the visual sign. As will be described in detail below, the guide comment may include information for explaining the current counseling state to the user, and may be controlled to be changed to text of different contents depending on the state of counseling. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, the guide comment <b>431</b> included in the interfacing object may be set to be displayed as a default on the chat interface. Also, for example, when performing a predetermined input (e.g., mouseover (hover)) to the interfacing object <b>411</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, a guide comment <b>431</b> may be set to be added as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to an example embodiment, the terminal of the first user may transmit, to the server, a signal for requesting switch between the manned counseling and the unmanned counseling. The request for switching between the manned counseling and the unmanned counseling may correspond to a command for requesting the server to switch the counseling type to the second counseling type if the current counseling type is the first counseling type corresponding to the unmanned counseling, and may correspond to a command for requesting the server to switch the counseling type to the first counseling type if the current counseling type is the second counseling type corresponding to the manned counseling.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an interfacing object <b>511</b> corresponding to the current counseling type may be displayed on the chat interface if the current counseling type is the first counseling type corresponding to the unmanned counseling. When a request for switching between the manned counseling and the unmanned counseling is received from the first user, the first counseling type corresponding to the unmanned counseling may be switched to the second counseling type corresponding to the manned counseling, and an interfacing object <b>513</b> corresponding to the counseling type switched to the second counseling type may be displayed on the chat interface. As an example, in order to explicitly indicate that the counseling type is to be switched, an interfacing object <b>512</b> indicating that the counseling type is being switched may be displayed while an operation of switching from the first counseling type to the second counseling type is performed. As another example, a visual sign indicating a time to be connected with a counselor may be added to the interfacing object while an operation for switching from the first counseling type to the second counseling type is performed.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to an example embodiment, the request for switching between the manned counseling and the unmanned counseling may be received via the interfacing object. In other words, the interfacing object may include a function of requesting the switch between the manned counseling and the unmanned counseling. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, by selecting (e.g., clicking) the interfacing object <b>511</b> corresponding to the first counseling type, the user may transmit a request for switching between the manned counseling and the unmanned counseling to the server, and the server may switch the first counseling type to the second counseling type in response to the request. Conversely, by selecting (e.g., clicking) the interfacing object <b>513</b> corresponding to the second counseling type, the user may transmit a request for switching between the manned counseling and the unmanned counseling to the server. In this case, the server may switch the second counseling type to the first counseling type in response to the request.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As described above, the channel of the second user may be linked to both the counselor and the chatbot, or may be linked to only one of the counselor and the chatbot. The interfacing object according to an example embodiment may include a function of requesting switch between the manned counseling and the unmanned counseling when both the counselor and the chatbot are linked to the channel of the second user, and may not include the function of requesting switch between the manned counseling and the unmanned counseling when only one of the channel of the second user is linked to the channel of the second user. The interfacing object that the channel is linked with both the counselor and the chatbot and the interfacing object that the channel is linked with only one of the counselor and the chatbot may be displayed differently. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, when the channel is linked to any one of the counselor and the chatbot <b>610</b> or <b>620</b>, an interfacing object <b>611</b> or <b>621</b> is displayed depending on the counseling type to provide the first user with information on the counseling type. On the other hand, when the channel is linked with both the counselor and the chatbot <b>630</b>, an interfacing object <b>631</b> indicating the first counseling type or a plurality of interfacing objects <b>632</b> to <b>634</b> indicating the second counseling type is displayed depending on the counseling type to provide the first user with information on the counseling type. As will be described in detail below, any one of the plurality of interfacing objects <b>632</b> to <b>634</b> indicating the second counseling type may be displayed based on the changed state of the second type of counseling ticket. According to an example embodiment, the interfacing objects <b>631</b> to <b>634</b> displayed when the channel is linked to both the counselor and the chatbot may include a function of receiving an input from the user like a button. As an example, in response to an input for selecting (e.g., clicking) an interfacing object of a user, switching between the first counseling type and the second counseling type may occur. On the other hand, when the channel is linked with any one of the counselor and the chatbot, the interfacing object may not include a function of receiving an input from the user.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to an example embodiment, acquiring of a counseling type (<b>110</b>) may include setting the counseling type to a default value of a predetermined counseling type corresponding to the channel of the second user and controlling the interfacing object so as to instruct the counseling type set to the default value on the chatting interface. For example, the default value for the counseling type may be predetermined as a first counseling type corresponding to the unmanned counseling. The operation of controlling the interfacing object according to an example embodiment will be described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Operation <b>120</b> according to an example embodiment may include creating a first type of counseling ticket when the counseling type acquired in operation <b>110</b> is the first counseling type corresponding to the unmanned counseling, and creating a second type of counseling ticket when the counseling type is the second counseling type corresponding to the manned counseling. The counseling ticket is a unit of counseling objectified in the server, and the counseling ticket may correspond to a session for counseling between a specific user and a counselor or a chatbot linked to a specific channel. The counseling between a specific user and a specific channel is objectified as a counseling ticket to be stored in the server, and the counseling ticket may include a chat log between a specific user and a specific channel transmitted and received during the counseling.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As an example, the counseling ticket may be created to correspond to the chat room as the first user who requested the counseling inputs a chat message in the chat room of the channel through the chat interface for counseling. In the case that the counseling type at the time of inputting the chat message of the first user is the first counseling type corresponding to the unmanned counseling, a first type of counseling ticket, which is a counseling ticket corresponding to the chatbot, may be created. In the case that the counseling type at the time of inputting the chat message of the first user is the second counseling type corresponding to the manned counseling, a second type of counseling ticket, which is a counseling ticket corresponding to the counselor, may be created.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As another example, the counseling ticket may be created in response to an input of the first user selecting an interfacing object displayed on the chat interface for counseling. As described above, the input for selecting the interfacing object may correspond to a request for switching of the counseling type. When the counseling type is switched to the first counseling type by the input for selecting the interfacing object, the first type of counseling ticket may be created, and when the counseling type is switched to the second counseling type by an input for selecting the interfacing object, a second type of counseling ticket may be created.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to an example embodiment, the state of the counseling ticket may be changed according to a state change event related to the counseling ticket that occurs in the course of the counseling. For example, the state change event may include at least one of a creation event, an end event, a connection event, and a pending event, and the state of the counseling ticket may be changed based on the occurrence of the state change event.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">According to an example embodiment, a state change event that may occur with respect to the counseling ticket may vary depending on the type of the counseling ticket, and the state in which the counseling ticket may take may also vary. In other words, the type of state change event that may occur with respect to the first type of counseling ticket and the type of state change event that may occur with respect to the second type of counseling ticket may be different from each other. Also, the type of state that the first type of counseling ticket may take and the type of state that the second type of counseling ticket may take may be different from each other.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">According to an example embodiment, a creation event and/or an end event may occur with respect to the first type of counseling ticket, and the state of the first type of counseling ticket in which the creation event has occurred may correspond to a progress state, and the state of the first type of counseling ticket in which the end event has occurred may correspond to an end state. A creation event, a connection event and/or an end event may occur with respect to the second type of counseling ticket. The state of the second type of counseling ticket that the creation event occurred may correspond to a waiting state, the state of the second type of counseling ticket that the connection event occurred may correspond to the progress state, and the state of the first type of counseling ticket that the end event occurred may correspond to the end state. The connection event may correspond to an event that occurs when an account of a counselor allocated with the counseling ticket accesses a chat room corresponding to the counseling ticket or transmits a message through the chat room corresponding to the counseling ticket.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">According to an example embodiment, the waiting state for the second type of counseling ticket may be divided into an unallocated state and the waiting state depending on the occurrence of an allocation event. In other words, the second type of counseling ticket may correspond to the unallocated state when the creation event occurs, and may correspond to the waiting state when an allocation event that the counseling ticket is allocated to a specific counselor occurs.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to an example embodiment, when the end condition for the counseling ticket created by operation <b>120</b> is satisfied, an end event related to the created counseling ticket may occur. The end condition may be satisfied when a command for the end is received from the user and/or when there is no response from the user for a certain period of time. A connection event may occur when the created second type of counseling ticket is allocated to a counselor so that the counselor accesses a chat room corresponding to the second type of counseling ticket or when a message is transmitted through a chat room corresponding to the counseling ticket. The second type of counseling ticket may be changed to the progress state by the occurrence of the connection event.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to an example embodiment, the second type of counseling ticket may take the pending state. When the counselor allocated with the second type of counseling ticket requests hold for the counseling ticket, a pending event for the counseling ticket may occur, and the counseling ticket may be changed to the pending state.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Operation <b>130</b> according to an example embodiment may include monitoring a state change event for changing the state of the counseling ticket and changing the state of the counseling ticket based on the occurred state change event. In other words, the server may monitor the state change event for the counseling ticket to detect the occurrence of the state change event and change the state of the counseling ticket based on the occurred state change event.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As an example, the monitoring of the state change event (<b>130</b>) may further include changing the state of the counseling ticket to the end state based on the end event that occurs as the end condition for the counseling ticket is satisfied. In other words, the server may determine whether the end condition for the counseling ticket is satisfied to detect the occurrence of the end event for the counseling ticket, and change the state of the counseling ticket to the end state based on the end event. The end condition may be predetermined in correspondence with the channel. For example, the end condition may include a condition in which the first user requests an end of the counseling, a condition in which the duration of the counseling ticket exceeds a predetermined threshold value, a condition in which a chat message has not been received from the first user for a certain period of time, a condition in which a request for switching between the manned counseling and the unmanned counseling is received from the first user, or various combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As another example, the monitoring of the state change event (<b>130</b>) may further include changing the state of the second type of counseling ticket to the progress state based on a connection event occurring when a counselor for the channel allocated with the second type of counseling ticket accesses the chat room corresponding to the second type of counseling ticket or transmits a message through the chat room corresponding to the counseling ticket. In other words, the server may determine whether the counselor is connected to the chat room corresponding to the second type of counseling ticket to detect the occurrence of the connection event related to the counseling ticket and may change the state of the counseling ticket to the progress state. The progress state of the counseling ticket may refer to the state in which the counseling ticket is allocated to a counselor linked to the channel of the second user, and the counselor may chat with the first user for counseling by accessing the chat room of the channel for counseling. For example, the connection of the counselor may be determined whether the counselor transmitted a chat message through the chat room and may also be determined whether the counselor received the chat message transmitted from the first user through the chat room.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As another example, the monitoring of the state change event (<b>130</b>) may further include changing the state of the second type of counseling ticket to the pending state based on the pending event that occurs when the pending condition for the second type of counseling ticket is satisfied. In other words, by determining whether the holding condition for the second type of counseling ticket is satisfied, the server may detect the occurrence of the pending event for the counseling ticket and change state of the counseling ticket to the pending state. The counselor allocated with the second type of counseling ticket may request the server to hold the counseling ticket, and when the request for hold from the counselor is valid, the pending condition of the counseling ticket may be satisfied. The counseling ticket in the pending state may not be changed to the end state even if the end condition is satisfied. The counseling ticket in the pending state may be changed from the pending state to another state based on a pending release request from a counselor or a pending release condition such as a case that the pending state continues for a certain period of time or longer.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Operation <b>130</b> according to an example embodiment may further include providing the first user with information on the change of the state of the counseling ticket through the chat interface when the state of the counseling ticket is changed due to occurrence of the state change event for the counseling ticket. When the state of the counseling ticket is changed, the server may provide the first user with information on the change of the state of the counseling ticket by transmitting a chat message notifying that the state of the counseling ticket is changed through the chat interface.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, when the end condition for the counseling ticket includes a condition in which no response time of the first user exceeds a predetermined second threshold value, the server may change the state of the counseling ticket to the end state (<b>720</b>) and may transmit a message informing the first user of the end of the counseling through the chat interface (<b>730</b>) in order to inform the first user that the state of the counseling ticket is changed to the end state. According to an example embodiment, operation <b>720</b> and operation <b>730</b> may be performed simultaneously, or operation <b>720</b> may be performed after operation <b>730</b> is performed first. For example, after the operation <b>730</b> of transmitting a message informing the first user of the end of the counseling is first performed, the operation <b>720</b> of changing the state of the counseling ticket to the end state may be performed. According to an example embodiment, the server presets a first threshold value that is smaller than the second threshold value regarding the end condition so as to transmit a message informing the end of the counseling (<b>710</b>) when no response time of the first user exceeds the first threshold value so as to notify the first user that the state of the counseling ticket is about to be changed to the end state.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Operation <b>140</b> according to an example embodiment may include controlling the interfacing object based on whether the counseling type is switched and whether the state of the counseling ticket is changed upon occurrence of a state change event.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">According to an example embodiment, the operation of controlling the interfacing object may include the operation of transmitting a signal for controlling the interface object to the instant messaging server.

The instant messaging server may receive the switched counseling type and/or the changed state of the counseling ticket so as to change the interfacing object to indicate the switched counseling type and/or the changed state of the counseling ticket.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">As described above, the channel of the second user may be linked to both the counselor and the chatbot. In this case, the controlling of the interfacing object (<b>140</b>) may further include switching the counseling type based on the request for switching between the manned counseling and the unmanned counseling received from the first user through the chat interface and controlling the interfacing object to correspond to the switched counseling type. For example, when the counseling type is switched from the first counseling type to the second counseling type upon the request for switching between the manned counseling and the unmanned counseling received from the first user, the server may notify the instant messaging server that the counseling type is switched to the second counseling type. In addition, the instant messaging server may change the interfacing object included in the chat interface to indicate the second counseling type.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">According to an example embodiment, the counseling state may be determined based on the counseling type and the state of the counseling ticket. The counseling state may include a plurality of counseling states switched based on the counseling type and the state of the counseling ticket. The counseling state may be switched to another counseling state as the counseling type is switched or the state of the counseling ticket is changed. For example, the counseling state may include a first state and a second state corresponding to the first counseling type. When the counseling ticket is changed to the creation state upon occurrence of an event that the first type of counseling ticket is created, the first state may be switched to the second state. When the counseling ticket is changed to the end state upon occurrence of an event that the first type of counseling ticket is ended, the second state may be switched to the first state.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">According to an example embodiment, the interfacing object may correspond to each counseling state, and as the counseling state is switched, the interfacing object may be changed to an interfacing object corresponding to the switched counseling state. In other words, operation <b>140</b> according to an example embodiment may include switching the counseling state based on at least one of the switch of the counseling type and the change of the state of the counseling ticket, and transmitting a signal for controlling the interfacing object based on the switched counseling state. As an example, based on a signal for controlling the interfacing object, the interfacing object may perform at least one of operations of changing a visual sign included in the interfacing object, adding a visual effect to the interfacing object, and changing the interfacing object to make the interfacing object display the switched counseling state such as an operation of changing the guide comment included in the interfacing object.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the counseling state may include first to fifth states, the first state and the second state may correspond to the counseling state corresponding to the first counseling type, and the third state to fifth state may correspond to counseling states corresponding to the second counseling type. The interfacing object corresponding to each counseling state may include visual signs <b>811</b> to <b>814</b> corresponding to each counseling state and guide comments <b>821</b> to <b>824</b> shown with a mouseover effect.
