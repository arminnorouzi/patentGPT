The phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes catalyzed by protein kinases can regulate a variety of biological processes in different cells, such as metabolism, cell differentiation, cell survival, apoptosis, organ formation, angiogenesis, immune response, etc. (Shchemelinin I., et al. 2006<i>, Folia Biol., </i>52: 81-100).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">JAK kinases (Janus kinases, JAKs for short, including four known members JAK3, JAK1, TYK2, JAK2) are a small family in the cytoplasmic non-receptor tyrosine protein kinase superfamily. JAK3 is distributed in the bone marrow and lymphatic system, while JAK1, TYK2, and JAK2 are widely distributed in a variety of tissue cells. When JAKs bind to cytokine receptors on the cell surface, the receptor-coupled JAKs are activated, and then the receptors are phosphorylated, which provides a recruitment response site for the cytoplasmic signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT proteins, including STAT1 to 4, STAT5a, STAT5b, STATE), JAKs phosphorylate STAT proteins, which dimerize and transfer to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. This pathway is the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (O'Shea J. J., et al. 2013<i>, N. Engl. J. Med., </i>368: 161-170).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">The JAK/STAT signaling pathway is a signal transduction pathway stimulated by a variety of cytokines and growth factor receptors, including interleukins (IL-2 to 7, IL-9, IL-10, IL-15, IL-21), interferons (IFN-&#x3b1;, IFN-&#x3b2;, IFN-&#x3b3;), erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thrombopoietin (TPO), etc., which play a key role in the biological processes of immune cell and hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and immune regulation (Ghoreschi K., et al. 2009<i>, Immunol. Rev., </i>228: 273-287). Different receptors can activate different subtypes of JAK kinases, thereby achieving differentiated biological functions.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">CN 105399685 A discloses the following compound of Formula (1):</p><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="51.82mm" wi="67.48mm" file="US20230000863A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">which has protein kinase inhibitory activity and can be used for the treatment and/or prevention of an autoimmune disease, inflammatory disease or cancer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">During the experiment, the inventor found that the compound of Formula (1) has problems such as low bioavailability.
