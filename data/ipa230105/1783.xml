For example, Patent Literature 1 describes a method of manufacturing a fuel tank, in which a built-in component having a head portion, a neck portion, and a shoulder portion is built. According to this method of manufacturing a fuel tank, air is fed into a parison from outside the parison during the molding of a tank body to shape the parison along the neck portion and to fix the built-in component to the tank body. At this time, the air around the neck portion is discharged toward the body portion to vent the air using holes formed in the neck portion having a cylindrical shape and the shoulder portion surrounded by the neck portion.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0004">Patent Literature 1: International Patent Application Publication No. 2018/225413</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">From the manufacturing point of view, it is desirable that the structure of the built-in component be simple, but the formation of air vent holes makes the structure of the built-in component complex and the manufacturing process complicated. Further, if air vent holes are formed, the holes are filled with parison before air venting is completed, and air venting paths are blocked. If the air around the neck portion is not sufficiently discharged, it becomes difficult to form the parison around the neck portion without fail. This may lead to a decrease in the fixing strength.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention has been devised from such a viewpoint, and an object of the present invention is to provide a fuel tank which is simple in structure and can reliably form a parison around a neck portion.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to solve the above problem, the present invention provides a fuel tank made of plastic resin and comprising a built-in component having a head portion, a neck portion, and a shoulder portion, the built-in component being anchored to a tank body by blowing air from outside a parison to cause the parison wrap around the neck portion during molding of the tank body, wherein a slit extending in one direction only is formed on a surface of the shoulder portion as an air vent path, the slit has a cross-sectional shape such that a width thereof becomes narrower in a depth direction, and the plastic resin enters the slit and a cavity is formed on a distal side of the slit in the depth direction.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the present invention, there is no need to provide a complicated air vent path, and the structure of the built-in component can be simplified. This makes it easy to manufacture a molding die for molding the built-in component and can reduce the manufacturing cost. Further, the air around the neck portion can be discharged through the slit during the molding, so that it is possible to reliably form a parison around the neck portion.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, since a parison is less likely to enter the slit, it is possible to prevent the slit from being blocked by the parison before the discharge of air around the neck portion is completed. Accordingly, it is possible to more reliably form a parison around the neck portion.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is preferable that the slit have a triangular cross-sectional shape and that an angle between a first wall portion and a second wall portion that constitute the slit be an acute angle. With this configuration, a parison is much less likely to enter the slit.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is preferable that the slit be provided on each side of the neck portion. This allows the air around the neck portion to be discharged efficiently in a well-balanced manner.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the present invention, the fuel tank is simple in structure and can reliably form a parison around a neck portion.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0010" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a fuel tank according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an external perspective view of a built-in component.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a front view of the built-in component.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a plan view of the built-in component.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is an enlarged front view of the built-in component.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a slit.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic vertical cross-sectional view of a fuel tank manufacturing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram to illustrate transferring a parison around an end portion of the built-in component during molding.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a diagram to illustrate transferring a parison around an end portion of the built-in component during molding.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> is a diagram to illustrate a step of injecting a parison in a method of manufacturing a fuel tank with the fuel tank manufacturing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> is a diagram to illustrate a step of introducing the built-in component in the method of manufacturing a fuel tank with the fuel tank manufacturing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref> is a diagram to illustrate a step of temporary setting the built-in component in the method of manufacturing a fuel tank with the fuel tank manufacturing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> is a diagram to illustrate a step of closing a molding die in the method of manufacturing a fuel tank with the fuel tank manufacturing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> is a diagram to illustrate a step of blow molding in the method of manufacturing a fuel tank with the fuel tank manufacturing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref> is a diagram to illustrate a step of cooling the parison in the method of manufacturing a fuel tank with the fuel tank manufacturing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>D</figref> is a diagram to illustrate a step of opening the molding die in the method of manufacturing a fuel tank with the fuel tank manufacturing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the slit according to a first modification.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the slit according to a second modification.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>C</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the slit according to a third modification.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0011" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0012" level="2">&#x3c;&#x3c;Fuel Tank According to One Embodiment&#x3e;&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A fuel tank T shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a fuel tank to be mounted on a transportation means such as an automobile, a motorcycle, and a ship, and mainly includes a tank body Ta and a built-in component <b>6</b>.
