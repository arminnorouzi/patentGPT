The information processing apparatus <b>1</b> is connected to each of the display apparatus <b>14</b> and the operation device <b>15</b> by wired connection or wireless connection through the interface unit <b>13</b>. In particular, the interface unit <b>13</b> is assumed to include a multimedia interface such as High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) (registered trademark) in order to transmit video data supplied from the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> to the display apparatus <b>14</b>.

The operation device <b>15</b> may include push buttons or a touch panel placed on the surface of the housing of the information processing apparatus <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the following, functions implemented by the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> includes functions of a display element controlling unit <b>21</b> and a transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b>. These functions are implemented by operation of the control unit <b>11</b> according to a program stored in the storage unit <b>12</b>. This program may be provided to the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> through a communication network such as the Internet or may be provided as a computer-readable information storage medium such as an optical disc in which the program is stored.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The display element controlling unit <b>21</b> creates a screen image including one or a plurality of display elements and causes the display apparatus <b>14</b> to display the screen image in a display area of the display apparatus <b>14</b>. It is assumed that, in the present embodiment, any display element displayed by the display element controlling unit <b>21</b> includes a target display element E that becomes a target of transition control hereinafter described.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Here, it is assumed that the target display element E is a display element that becomes a target of an operation by a user. In particular, it is assumed that, if a user performs a predetermined operation input to the operation device <b>15</b>, then the display element controlling unit <b>21</b> causes the display state of the target display element E to transit from a certain state to a different state.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The transition of a display element in the present embodiment indicates that the state of the display element on a screen changes and includes at least any one of movement of the display element on the screen (change in position), magnification or contraction (change in magnitude), and deformation (change in shape). It is to be noted that the target display element E may perform transition including any combination of them. For example, the display element controlling unit <b>21</b> may perform transition for changing the position and the magnitude of the target display element E at the same time according to an instruction from the user.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a case where the display element controlling unit <b>21</b> accepts an instruction from the user for causing a target display element E to transit in a state in which the target display element E is displayed on the screen, it determines a state of the target display element E after transition. In the following description, a state of the target display element E before transition is referred to as an initial state, and a state of the target display element E after the transition is referred to as a target state.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> are views depicting an example of the initial state and the target state of the target display element E, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts the initial state and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts the target state. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, it is assumed that the target display element E is a sub window that includes information to be presented to a user, and in the initial state, the target display element E is placed at a position PO in the proximity of the left lower corner of the screen. Here, in a case where the user performs an operation for the operation device <b>15</b> to instruct change of the placement position of the target display element E, the display element controlling unit <b>21</b> determines a placement position of the target display element E after the change as the target state. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, it is assumed that the target display element E after transition is displayed at a position PG in the proximity of the upper right corner of the screen.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">After the display element controlling unit <b>21</b> determines the target state of the target display element E, it requests the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> to display a moving image indicating a procedure of transition from the initial state to the target state.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> creates a moving image indicating a procedure of transition of the target display element E from the initial state to the target state according to the request from the display element controlling unit <b>21</b> and causes the display apparatus <b>14</b> to display the moving image. In the following description, the moving image indicative of a transition procedure is referred to as a transition moving image.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The transition moving image in the present embodiment is a moving image indicating a procedure of change of the target display element E immediately after the start of transition and a procedure of change of the target display element E immediately before the end of the transition and is a moving image in which an intermediate procedure between them is omitted. In other words, the transition moving image is a moving image indicating a procedure of only part of a first stage and part of a last stage of all procedures of change from the initial state to the target state.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In particular, the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> determines, as a state on the way of a procedure of change from the initial state to the target state, a first intermediate state closer to the initial state than the target state and a second intermediate state closer to the target state than the initial state. Then, the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> successively displays, as a transition moving image, the first moving image indicating a procedure of change from the initial state to the first intermediate state and the second moving image indicating a procedure of change from the second intermediate state to the target state. In other words, the procedure of change from the first intermediate state to the second intermediate state is not included in the transition moving image and is not displayed on the screen. Consequently, it is possible to allow the user to feel that, in comparison with an alternative case in which a moving image that indicates all procedures of change from the initial state to the target state is displayed, the transition is performed rapidly and the response to an operation is quick.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> depict a particular example of the first intermediate state and the second intermediate state in a procedure in which a transition moving image is displayed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, display examples on the way of change of the transition moving image that indicates a manner in which the target display element E moves from the position PO in the initial state depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> to the position PG in the target state. In particular, the first intermediate state is a state in which the target display element E is displayed at a position P<b>1</b> closer to the position PO in the first state than to the position PG in the target state, and the second intermediate state is a state in which the target display element E is displayed at a position P<b>2</b> closer to the position PG in the target state than to the position PO in the initial state.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, an arrow mark of a broken line indicates a locus of movement of the target display element E in the display of the transition moving image. In particular, the first moving image is a moving image that indicates a procedure of movement of the target display element E from the position PO in the initial state to the position P<b>1</b> in the first intermediate state, and an arrow mark of a broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> indicates a locus of movement of the target display element E in the display of the first moving image. Similarly, the second moving image is a moving image that indicates a procedure of movement of the target display element E from the position P<b>2</b> in the second intermediate state to the position PG in the target state, and an arrow mark of a broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> indicates a locus of movement of the target display element E in the display of the second moving image. Since the procedure of change from the first intermediate state to the second intermediate state is not included in the transition moving image as described above, after the display of the first moving image comes to an end and the first intermediate state depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is entered, the display immediately switches to the second intermediate state depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, and display of the second moving image is started. In short, the transition moving image in the present example is a moving image that indicates a procedure of movement of the target display element E from the position PO to the position P<b>1</b> and then from the position P<b>2</b> to the position PG.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Furthermore, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the position P<b>1</b> in the first intermediate state and the position P<b>2</b> in the second intermediate state are placed on a line segment that interconnects the position PO in the initial state and the position PG in the target state. Therefore, the direction of movement of the first moving image from the position PO in the initial state to the position P<b>1</b> in the first intermediate state and the direction of movement from the position P<b>2</b> in the second intermediate state to the position PG in the target state coincide with each other. By successively displaying a procedure in which the same target display element E moves in the same direction in this manner, although the procedure of movement from the position P<b>1</b> to the position P<b>2</b> is omitted, the user can recognize that the first moving image and the second moving image indicate a continuous change and can grasp that the target display element E has transited from the initial state to the target state without having an uncomfortable feeling.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">It is to be noted that the first moving image and the second moving image may not be moving images for a same period of time. In order to induce a user to pay attention to the target state, it is desirable to make the second moving image easier to catch the eye of the user than the first moving image. To this end, for example, the speed of movement of the target display element E in the second moving image (namely, the speed of change of the target display element E) may be made lower than the speed of movement in the first moving image to make a period of time for which the second moving image is displayed longer than a period of time for which the first moving image is displayed. Here, each speed of movement of the target display element E in the first moving image and the second moving image may not be fixed, and for example, the speed of movement of the target display element E may be controlled such that the target display element E is gradually accelerated in the first moving image but is gradually decelerated in the second moving image.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Moreover, the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> may make the display time period of the second moving image longer by making the distance of movement of the target display element E in the second moving image (namely, the amount of change of the target display element E) longer than the distance of movement in the first moving image. This can be implemented by making the distance between the position P<b>2</b> and the position PG longer than the distance between the position PO and the position P<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further, the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> may display a preliminary moving image at the start of display of a transition moving image prior to display of a first moving image. This preliminary moving image is a moving image in which the target display element E is changed a little in a direction opposite to the direction of change from the initial state to the target state. For example, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a preliminary moving image in which the target display element E is moved once in a direction in which it is spaced away from the position PG in the target state from the start point given by the position PO in the initial state may be displayed. Thereafter, the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> displays a first moving image that indicates a procedure of movement of the target display element E in a direction in which the target display element E approaches the position PG in the target state from the start point given by the position at the point of time at which the display of the preliminary moving image comes to an end (position on the opposite side to the position PG in the target state with respect to the position PO in the initial state). Further, after this, a second moving image similar to that in the example described hereinabove is displayed. In particular, the transition moving image in this example is a moving image that includes the preliminary moving image, the first moving image, and the second image in this order. This makes it possible to further emphasize the transition of the target display element E.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a change of the position of the target display element E while the transition moving image is displayed in a case where such a preliminary moving image as described above is displayed. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the axis of ordinate indicates the position of the target display element E with respect to the origin given by the position PO in the initial state. The axis of abscissa indicates a time change in a case where a moving image in which the target display element E is moved to transit from the initial state to the target state without omitting the movement of the target display element E during a period of time from the first intermediate position to the second intermediate position as described hereinabove. The inclination of a solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> indicates a speed of movement of the target display element E.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in a case where the target display element E is moved to transit from the initial state to the target state, after the target display element E is moved once in a direction in which it is spaced away from the position PG in the target state (in the negative direction of the axis of ordinate), the target display element E is moved toward the position PG while it is gradually accelerated. Then, after the speed of movement reaches the highest speed, the target display element E continues to move at a substantially fixed speed toward the position PG. Then, the target display element E finally reaches the position PG while it is gradually decelerated. This indicates a natural change in speed when an object moves after it moves by back action once.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the present embodiment, the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> omits display of a moving image corresponding to a portion indicated by a broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Here, the position P<b>1</b> in the first intermediate state preferably coincides with a timing at which the speed of movement of the target display element E reaches the highest speed or with a timing immediately preceding the timing. Since it is a typical phenomenon that, as the speed increases, the movement of the object becomes less likely to be caught by the eyes of human being, not displaying the target display element E in a state in which the target display element E is being accelerated in this manner causes a user to have less uncomfortable feeling, even if the procedure of the movement of the target display element E is omitted. In this case, while the first moving image is displayed, the speed of the movement of the target display element E continues to gradually increase. Further, the position P<b>2</b> in the second intermediate state preferably coincides with a timing at which it starts deceleration or with a timing immediately preceding the timing. In this case, while the second moving image remains displayed, the speed of the movement of the target display element E continues to gradually decrease. It is to be noted that, at a timing at which the target display element E reaches the position PG in the target state, unlike a timing at the start of the movement, there is no necessity to display such a movement as to finally stop after movement in the reverse direction, which is reverse to the movement of the preliminary moving image.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is to be noted that, although it is described in the foregoing description that, immediately after display of the first moving image comes to an end and the target display element E enters the first intermediate state, display of the second moving image is started from the second intermediate state, the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> may otherwise provide an interval state in which the target display element E is not displayed for a given period of time such that display of the second moving image is started after the period of time for the interval state elapses. The period of time for the interval state in this case should be set so as not to exceed a period of time T corresponding to the portion indicated by the broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. In other words, it is preferable to set the period of time for the interval state shorter than the period of time required in a case where it is assumed that the target display element E is moved at a fixed speed to the second intermediate state, keeping a speed of movement at the timing at which the target display element E reaches the first intermediate state. This makes it possible to give the user such an impression that the target display element E transits rapidly.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, although it is described in the foregoing description that contents of the target display element E do not change between the initial state and the target state and, when the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> displays a transition moving image, it continues to display the target display element E of the same contents from the start to the end of the display. However, the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> may be configured such that contents of the target display element E also change together with transition of the state. For example, in a case where the user performs an operation for the instruction to display new information, it is necessary to change the display position of the target display element E and change contents of the display such that the target display element E includes the new information. In this case, contents of the target display element E differ between the initial state and the target state. If it is assumed that, in such a case as just described, all procedures of gradual movement of the target display element E from the initial state to the target state are displayed, it is necessary to switch contents of the target display element E at some timing in the procedures. This may give the user such an impression that contents of the target display element E change suddenly, resulting in possibility that the user may have an uncomfortable feeling.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">To address this problem, the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> may be configured so as to display, in the first moving image, the target display element E with display contents same as those in the initial state and to display, in the second moving image, the target display element E with display contents same as those in the target state. In particular, the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> newly draws contents of the target display element E to be displayed after state transition at a timing at which display of the second moving image is started and displays the second moving image indicating a manner in which the newly drawn target display element E moves to the position PG in the target state. Since this switches contents of the display at a timing at which the target display element E moves (discontinuously) to the second intermediate state far away from the first intermediate state, the user is less likely to have an uncomfortable feeling.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is to be noted that, in a case where such control as described above is performed, drawing of the target display element E before the start of transition and during display of the first moving image and drawing of the target display element E after the completion of transition and during display of the second moving image may be implemented by programs different from each other. As an example, the target display element E before the start of transition and during display of the first moving image may be drawn by a system program, and the target display element E after the completion of transition and during display of the second moving image may be drawn by a game program.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, when the first moving image is displayed, the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> may gradually change the position of the target display element E and perform image processing for gradually making the target display element E less conspicuous by gradually raising the transparency or gradually decreasing the brightness of the target display element E itself. In this case, the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> may perform, for the second moving image, image processing for gradually making the target display element E conspicuous to a state in which the target display element E is finally displayed in an ordinary way, unlike the first moving image, by gradually decreasing the transparency from a state in which the transparency is high or gradually increasing the brightness from a state in which the brightness is low. By such control as just described, it is possible to make a discontinuous change from the first intermediate state to the second intermediate state less conspicuous and make the user less likely to have an uncomfortable feeling.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Although the foregoing description is given of an example of a transition moving image in which the target display element E is moved, this is not restrictive, and the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> can display a transition moving image in which an intermediate procedure is omitted similarly also in a case where a change of any other type is caused. In the following, examples in which transition for magnifying the target display element E are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> to <b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts an example of a display of the target display element E in the initial state. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a plurality of thumbnail images are displayed side by side as display elements, and in a case where a user performs an operation for selecting any one of them, the selected thumbnail image is determined as the target display element E, and the display transits to a state in which an image magnified from the thumbnail image is displayed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts an example of a display of the target display element E in the target state. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, it is assumed that detailed information, an operation button, and the like regarding the selected image are added to the target display element E in the target state and that contents of the display have changed from the target display element E (thumbnail image) in the initial state. Also, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, since, in the target state, the target display element E is displayed at the center of the screen, not only the size but also the position of the target display element E on the screen has changed together with the transition of the state.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this example, if the user performs a selection operation of the target display element E in the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, then the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> displays a first moving image in which the target display element E is magnified from the initial state to the first intermediate state and then displays the second moving image in which the target display element E is magnified from the second intermediate state to the target state. Then, the display finally transits to the display of the target state depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. Here, the first intermediate state is a state in which the target display element E is displayed with a size that is greater than that in the initial state and besides is smaller than that in the second intermediate state, and the second intermediate state is a state in which the target display element E is displayed with a size that is greater than that in the first intermediate state and besides is smaller than that in the target state.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts an example of a display in the first intermediate state, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> depicts an example of a display in the second intermediate state. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, the target display element E in the first intermediate state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is same in contents of display as that in the initial state depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, and the target display element E in the second intermediate state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is same in contents of display as that in the target state depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. In other words, contents of the display of the target display element E are changed at a timing at which the display switches from the first intermediate state to the second intermediate state.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Also in the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, by omission of the display of the state between the first intermediate state and the second intermediate state, an impression that state transition according to an operation of the user has been performed rapidly can be given to the user. On the other hand, by displaying a manner in which the target display element E starts magnification from the initial state is displayed as the first moving image and then a manner in which the target display element E is magnified subsequently to perform display of the target state is displayed as the second moving image, the user can easily grasp that the original state of the target display element E has transited to a display of the target state.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">It is to be noted that, also in the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, the amount of change in the second moving image may be made greater than that in the first moving image or the speed of change in the second moving image may be made lower than the speed of change in the first moving image similarly as in the example of the transition moving image described hereinabove in which the target display element E is moved. Further, prior to the first moving image, a preliminary moving image that indicates a manner in which the target display element E contracts a little from the initial state may be included in the transition moving image.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Also in a case where the target display element E that has not been displayed until then is to be displayed newly on the screen, the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> may display a transition moving image similar to any of those described hereinabove. In this case, the initial state is a state in which the target display element E is not displayed, and it is assumed that the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> displays a transition moving image that includes a first moving image in which the target display element E is magnified from the size 0 to the first intermediate state and a second moving image in which the target display element E is magnified from the second intermediate state to the final target state. This makes it possible to present a window, which is to be displayed newly in a case in which a popup display of a window is to be performed in response to an operation of the user, in an easy-to-understand manner to the user.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, the target display element E in the initial state and/or the target state may be displayed only at part thereof on the screen. For example, the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> may display a transition moving image in which, starting from an initial state in which, although part of the target display element E is displayed on the screen, it is not entirely displayed, the display transits to the target state in which the target display element E is displayed entirely on the screen.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> may not always display a transition moving image in which such an intermediate procedure of change as described above is omitted. For example, in a case where the degree of change by a state transition is low (in a case where the distance of movement is small, for example), the transition moving image displaying unit <b>22</b> may display a transition moving image that includes all procedures of change from the initial state to the target state without omitting an intermediate procedure.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As described above, with the information processing apparatus <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment, a state transition according to an operation of a user can be presented in an easy-to-understand manner and besides in a high responsiveness to the user.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">It is to be noted that the embodiment of the present invention is not limited to that described above.
