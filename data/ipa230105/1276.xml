<b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c</i>) that are propelled by the effect of said elastic band (<b>13</b>), to cross said connecting bridges (<b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the context of the present invention, without limiting the scope of protection, &#x201c;modular&#x201d; is understood as an element that can be easily articulated and disarticulated, and that is particularly versatile, since it allows to vary its position with respect to the other elements that are articulated.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The geometry of the modular platform (<b>11</b>) having a polygonal shape does not limit the scope of the present invention. It can be, for example, a triangle, a square, a pentagon, among others. In a preferred embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, the modular platform (<b>11</b>) has a hexagonal shape, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">On the other hand, the material of said modular platform (<b>11</b>) and its walls (<b>12</b>) do not limit the scope of the present invention. In a particularly advantageous embodiment, the material of said modular platform (<b>11</b>) and its walls (<b>12</b>) is a rigid material, selected from the group consisting of: cardboard, plastic, metal, glass, wood. It may also be a mixture of some of the materials listed above. In a preferred embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, the modular platform (<b>11</b>) and its walls (<b>12</b>) are made of plastic. Additionally, the sizes of said modular platform (<b>11</b>) and its walls (<b>12</b>) do not limit the scope of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, each of the edges of the hexagon of said modular platform (<b>11</b>) measures between 10 centimeters and 30 centimeters, with a thickness of between 0.2 centimeters and 1 centimeter. In an even more preferred embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, each of the edges of the hexagon of said modular platform (<b>11</b>) measures 20 centimeters, with a thickness of 0.5 centimeters. With respect to the walls (<b>12</b>), the length is limited by the sizes of each of the edges of the hexagon of said modular platform (<b>11</b>). In a preferred embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, the height of each of the walls (<b>12</b>) measures between 1 centimeter and 10 centimeters, with a thickness of between 0.2 centimeters and 1 centimeter. In an even more preferred embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, the height of each of the walls (<b>12</b>) measures 3 centimeters, with a thickness of 0.5 centimeters.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the context of the present invention, without limiting the scope of protection, an &#x201c;elastic band&#x201d; will be understood as a thin and long element that has the capacity of recovering its original sizes once it is subjected to a mechanical force that causes a change in its shape.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The material of the elastic band (<b>13</b>) does not limit the scope of the present invention. In a particularly advantageous embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, the elastic band (<b>13</b>) is made of a flexible material, selected from the group consisting of: elastin, rubber or any rubber-like material, nylon, latex, wool, silicone. It may also be a mixture of some of the materials listed above. In a preferred embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, the elastic band (<b>13</b>) is a rubber band. The sizes of said elastic band (<b>13</b>) do not represent a limiting characteristic; the length of the elastic band (<b>13</b>) is limited by the length of the edges of the hexagon of the modular platform (<b>11</b>). In a preferred embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, the elastic band (<b>13</b>) has a length of between 15 centimeters and 35 centimeters, with a diameter of between 0.1 centimeters and 1 centimeter. In an even more preferred embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, the elastic band (<b>13</b>) has a length of 25 centimeters, with a diameter of 0.3 centimeters.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the context of the present invention, a &#x201c;firm connection&#x201d; will be understood as a connection between two or more elements, which stays firm during the game session, so that said elements cannot move or become detached until the players decide to modify the difficulty setup.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The elastic band (<b>13</b>) is positioned close to and parallel to the bottom wall of the modular platform (<b>11</b>), being connected firmly to the side walls of the same. The way of connecting firmly said elastic band (<b>13</b>) to the side walls of said modular platform (<b>11</b>) does not limit the scope of the present invention; it can be, for example: through a glue, staples, through a stop element, nailed or bolted, among others. In a preferred embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, the elastic band (<b>13</b>) is connected firmly to the side walls of said modular platform (<b>11</b>) in a through way and knotting the excess material, wherein said knot functions as stop element. The distance between said elastic band (<b>13</b>) and the bottom wall of said modular platform (<b>11</b>) does not limit the scope of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, the distance between said elastic band (<b>13</b>) and the bottom wall of said modular platform (<b>11</b>) is between 2 centimeters and 10 centimeters. In an even more preferred embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, the distance between said elastic band (<b>13</b>) and the bottom wall of said modular platform (<b>11</b>) is 4 centimeters. On the other hand, the height between said elastic band (<b>13</b>) and the surface of said modular platform (<b>11</b>) is limited by the height of each of the sliding pucks that form said plurality of sliding pucks (<b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c</i>). In a preferred embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, the height between said elastic band (<b>13</b>) and the surface of said modular platform (<b>11</b>) is 0.5 centimeters. Additionally, the modular platform (<b>11</b>) comprises a cavity (<b>14</b>) positioned in the wall opposite said bottom wall. The shape, location, and sizes of said cavity (<b>14</b>) do not limit the scope of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, the cavity (<b>14</b>) has a rectangular shape and is located centered on the wall opposite said bottom wall, it has a length between 8 centimeters and 28 centimeters, and is complete with respect to the height, that is, it has a height equal to the height of said wall. In an even more preferred embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, the cavity (<b>14</b>) has a length of 15 centimeters and a height of 3 centimeters.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the cavity (<b>14</b>) of the modular platform (<b>11</b>) a connecting bridge (<b>15</b>) is connected, which is selected from a plurality of interchangeable connecting bridges (<b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>), wherein said connecting bridges define arches of different sizes, that is, the size of the arches that define said connecting bridges (<b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>) are variable and do not limit the scope of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. It could be, for example, an arch of 4 centimeters long and 2 centimeters high, and another arch of 6 centimeters long and 2 centimeters high. The material of each of the connecting bridges (<b>15</b>) that form said plurality of connecting bridges (<b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>) does not limit the scope of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, each of the connecting bridges (<b>15</b>) that form said plurality of connecting bridges (<b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>) are made of plastic. The sizes of each of the connecting bridges (<b>15</b>) that form said plurality of connecting bridges (<b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>) also do not limit the scope of the present invention. However, in a particularly advantageous embodiment, the size of said connecting bridges coincides with the size of the walls of the hexagon of the modular platform (<b>11</b>). In a preferred embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, it has a length of 20 centimeters and a height of 3 centimeters.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the context of the present invention, and without limiting the scope of the present invention, &#x201c;sliding puck&#x201d; will be understood as a cylindrical body whose base is considerably greater than its height, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and that it is intended to slide or slip along the surface that contains it.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The material of said plurality of sliding pucks (<b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c</i>) does not represent a limiting characteristic for the present invention. However, in a particularly advantageous embodiment, said plurality of sliding pucks (<b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c</i>) are made of a material exhibiting high toughness, that is, that are capable of withstanding impacts or collisions without breaking. It can be, for example, steel, copper, iron, wood, plastics, concrete. It may also be a mixture of some of the materials listed above. In a preferred embodiment, and without limiting the scope of protection, said plurality of sliding pucks (<b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c</i>) are made of plastic. On the other hand, the sizes of said plurality of sliding pucks (<b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c</i>) do not limit the scope of the present invention either. As mentioned above, the height must be greater than the height where the elastic band (<b>13</b>) is connected firmly to the side walls of the modular platform (<b>11</b>).

This also allows to adjust the difficulty of the game, through the different sizes of the connecting bridges (<b>15</b>), depending on the ability of the players, that is, if the players are children, it is advisable to use connecting bridges (<b>15</b>) with larger arches; or, if the players are adults with a higher degree of expertise, it is recommended to use connecting bridges (<b>15</b>) with smaller arches. Similarly, the difficulty can be adjusted, providing different diameters of sliding pucks (<b>16</b>).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Regarding the operation of the multiplayer game (<b>1</b>), a determined number of sliding pucks (<b>16</b>) are provided in each of the modular platforms (<b>11</b>) positioned opposite each other. Each of the players propel said sliding pucks (<b>16</b>) through the action of the elastic band (<b>13</b>), which is tightened by the fingers of each player's hands or any other element to pull the elastic band back. The objective is for each of the sliding pucks to cross the arches defined by said connecting bridges (<b>15</b>), sending them to the rival modular platform (<b>11</b>). The winner, without limiting the scope of the present invention, is the player who manages to get rid of all the sliding pucks (<b>16</b>), leaving his or her modular platform (<b>11</b>) empty.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLES OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a first embodiment of the sliding puck multiplayer game (<b>1</b>) with adjustable difficulty, and without limiting the scope of the present invention, the multiplayer game (<b>1</b>) comprises two modular platforms (<b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>) connected facing each other by means of a connecting bridge (<b>15</b>) coincidentally positioned in the joint between both cavities of said two modular platforms (<b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a second embodiment of the sliding pucks multiplayer game (<b>1</b>) with adjustable difficulty, and without limiting the scope of the present invention, the multiplayer game (<b>1</b>) comprises three modular platforms (<b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>, <b>11</b><i>c</i>) connected facing each other by means of a triangular connecting element (<b>17</b><i>a</i>) and three connecting bridges (<b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>c</i>), each one of them coincidentally positioned in the joint between the respective cavities of said modular platforms (<b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>, <b>11</b><i>c</i>) and said joining element triangular (<b>17</b><i>a</i>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a third embodiment of the sliding puck multiplayer game (<b>1</b>) with adjustable difficulty, and without this limiting the scope of the present invention, the multiplayer game (<b>1</b>) comprises four modular platforms (<b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>, <b>11</b><i>c</i>, <b>11</b><i>d</i>) connected facing each other by means of a quadrangular connecting element (<b>17</b><i>b</i>) and four connecting bridges (<b>15</b><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>, <b>15</b><i>c</i>, <b>15</b><i>d</i>), each one of them coincidentally positioned in the joint between the respective cavities of said modular platforms (<b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>, <b>11</b><i>c</i>, <b>11</b><i>d</i>) and said quadrangular connecting element (<b>17</b><i>b</i>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
