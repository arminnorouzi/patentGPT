More particularly, implied spread financial transactions may be generated using information from requests for quotes.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Traders often desire to trade multiple financial instruments in combination. Each component of the combination is called a leg. Traders can define the combination (e.g., an exchange-defined combination) and submit orders for each leg or in some cases can submit a single order for multiple financial instruments. Such orders may be called a strategy order, a spread order, or a variety of other names. The counter party orders that are matched against such a combination order may be individual, &#x201c;outright&#x201d; orders or may be part of other combination orders. In the case of spread orders, the matching system may imply the counter party order by using multiple orders to create the counter party order. Examples of spreads include implied IN, implied OUT, 2nd- or multiple-generation, crack spreads, straddle, strangle, butterfly, and pack spreads.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Implied IN spread orders are derived from existing outright orders in individual legs. Implied OUT outright orders are derived from a combination of an existing spread order and an existing outright order in one of the individual underlying legs. Implied orders can fill in gaps in the market and allow spreads and outright futures traders to trade in a product where there would otherwise have been little or no available bids and asks. Thus, the liquidity of the product is enhanced by the use of implied orders.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A spread is an order for the price difference between two contracts. This results in the trader holding a long and a short position in two or more related futures or options on futures contracts, with the objective of profiting from a change in the price relationship. A butterfly spread is an order for two inter-delivery spreads in opposite directions with the center delivery month common to both spreads. A calendar spread, also called an intra-commodity spread, for futures is an order for the simultaneous purchase and sale of the same futures contract in different contract months. (i.e., buying a September CME S&#x26;P 500&#xae; futures contract and selling a December CME S&#x26;P 500 futures contract). A crush spread is an order, usually in the soybean futures market, for the simultaneous purchase of soybean futures and the sale of soybean meal and soybean oil futures to establish a processing margin. A crack spread is an order for a specific spread trade involving simultaneously buying and selling contracts in crude oil and one or more derivative products, typically gasoline and heating oil. Oil refineries may trade a crack spread to hedge the price risk of their operations, while speculators attempt to profit from a change in the oil/gasoline price differential.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A straddle is an order for the purchase or sale of an equal number of puts and calls, with the same strike price and expiration dates. A long straddle is a straddle in which a long position is taken in both a put and a call option. A short straddle is a straddle in which a short position is taken in both a put and a call option. A strangle is an order for the purchase of a put and a call, in which the options have the same expiration and the put strike is lower than the call strike, called a long strangle. Also the sale of a put and a call, in which the options have the same expiration and the put strike is lower than the call strike, called a short strangle. A pack is an order for the simultaneous purchase or sale of an equally weighted, consecutive series of four futures contracts, quoted on an average net change basis from the previous day's settlement price. Packs provide a readily available, widely accepted method for executing multiple futures contracts with a single transaction. A bundle is an order for the simultaneous sale or purchase of one each of a series of consecutive futures contracts. Bundles provide a readily available, widely accepted method for executing multiple futures contracts with a single transaction.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">By linking the spread and outright markets, implied spread trading increases market liquidity. For example, a buy in one contract month and an offer in another contract month in the same futures contract can create an implied market in the corresponding calendar spread. An exchange may match an order for a spread product with another order for the spread product. Some existing exchanges attempt to match orders for spread products with multiple orders for legs of the spread products. With such systems, every spread product contract is broken down into a collection of legs and an attempt is made to match orders for the legs. Examples of implied spread trading includes those disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/986,967, entitled &#x201c;Implied Spread Trading System,&#x201d; which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, implied IN spreads may be created from existing outright orders in individual contracts where an outright order in a spread can be matched with other outright orders in the spread or with a combination of orders in the legs of the spread. An implied OUT spread may be created from the combination of an existing outright order in a spread and an existing outright order in one of the individual underlying leg. Implied IN or implied OUT spreads may be created when an electronic match system simultaneously works synthetic spread orders in spread markets and synthetic orders in the individual leg markets without the risk to the trader/broker of being double filled or filled on one leg and not on the other leg.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Large exchanges typically have order books for numerous spread products and legs of the spread products. However, the identification and processing of potential implied spreads inside electronic trade systems consumes valuable processing resources that could otherwise be used to process outright orders. In a typical central limit order book implementation, the system component for receiving electronic trades from users appears as a single processing thread with a single point of control. In such an implementation, there is a requirement that one order matches only another order, and does not result in two competing processes both matching different orders against a single order. Therefore, implementations have been limited in such trading systems.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, traders (and others) may submit a request for quote (RFQ) to an exchange. RFQs are similar to orders submitted to an exchange, however, RFQs differ significantly from an order in that an RFQ is not binding and not actionable. RFQs are well known in the art and commonly used by traders, clearinghouses, and/or exchanges to inquire as to the current market for a particular financial instrument. RFQs, however, are sometimes abused. For example, a trader may flood the market with RFQs in an attempt to ascertain other traders' positions on particular financial instruments without binding himself to an order. Those that respond to RFQs (e.g., market makers, other traders, etc.) may disregard the RFQs due to the enormous quantity of RFQs. Unfortunately, a non-abusive RFQ may be left unresponded to because of such behavior. Furthermore, in some scenarios, market makers, which although they are under a contractual obligation to respond to RFQs, may still be less than diligent in responding to RFQs, thus resulting in a negative perception of an exchange.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, there exists a need for enhanced systems and methods to address one or more of these and other deficiencies in the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Aspects of the invention overcome at least some of the above problems and limitations by providing systems and methods for using request for quotes (RFQs) to assist in detecting implied orders, and disseminating responses to RFQs to a user community. Systems and methods for receiving an RFQ using a request for quote processor module, and sending some information from the RFQ for use by an implied spread determination module. An example includes a system with a processor and memory storing a search list and computer-executable instructions, where the instructions determine whether the financial instrument associated with an RFQ is on the search list and then use the financial instrument to determine if an implied order exists in combination with that financial instrument. In some embodiments, a timer may be used to track a predetermined amount of time before an RFQ processor module may submit information to determine if implied orders exist.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, aspects of the invention may be implemented on a computer-readable medium, for example, by storing computer-executable instructions or modules, or by utilizing computer-readable data structures. Of course, the methods and systems of the above-referenced embodiments may also include other additional elements, steps, computer-executable instructions, or computer-readable data structures. For example, one skilled in the art will recognize that the various modules described herein may be implemented using programming code (e.g., C++, C, Java, etc.) and be associated with a processor on a computing device that may execute the module. The programming code may include common elements of software programming, such as &#x201c;for loops&#x201d;, &#x201c;do-while loops&#x201d;, function calls, if-else syntax, &#x201c;switch&#x201d; syntax, and other well-known elements.

More particularly, implied spread financial transactions are generated using information from requests for quotes (RFQs). In an attempt to, inter alia, enhance efficiency of implied order generation, an RFQ processor module may be used to focus the calculations performed by an implied spread determination module. A financial instrument associated with an RFQ may be provided to the implied spread determination module to trigger the determination of whether implied orders exist related to that particular financial instrument.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an illustrative operating environment that may be used to implement various aspects of the disclosure. The operating environment is only one example of a suitable operating environment and is not intended to suggest any limitation as to the scope of use or functionality of the disclosure. Aspects of the present disclosure are preferably implemented with computing devices and networks for exchanging, transmitting communicating, administering, managing and facilitating trading information including, but not limited to performance bond amount requirements and trading information. An exchange computer system <b>100</b> may receive market data, analyze historical data, and/or calculate various values, e.g., performance bond amounts, in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Exchange computer system <b>100</b> may be implemented with one or more mainframes, servers, gateways, controllers, desktops or other computers. The exchange computer system <b>100</b> may include one or more modules, processors, databases, mainframes, desktops, notebooks, tablet PCs, handhelds, personal digital assistants, smartphones, gateways, and/or other components, such as those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Moreover, computer system <b>100</b> may include one or more processors (e.g., Intel&#xae; microprocessor, AMD&#xae; microprocessor, RISC processor, a 64-bit processor, etc.) and one or more memories (e.g., solid state, DRAM, SRAM, ROM, Flash, non-volatile memory, hard drive, registers, buffers, etc.)</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition, an electronic trading system <b>144</b>, such as the Globex&#xae; trading system, may be associated with an exchange <b>100</b>. In such an embodiment, the electronic trading system includes a combination of globally distributed computers, controllers, servers, networks, gateways, routers, databases, memory, and other electronic data processing and routing devices. One skilled in the art will appreciate that numerous additional computers and systems may be coupled (i.e., in operative communication) to exchange computer system <b>100</b>. Such computers and systems may include clearing, regulatory and fee systems, such as clearinghouse <b>140</b>. The trading system may include a trading system interface having devices configured to route incoming messages to an appropriate device associated with the trading system. The trading system interface may include computers, controllers, networks, gateways, routers and other electronic data processing and routing devices. Orders that are placed with or submitted to the trading system are received at the trading system interface. The trading system interface routes the order to an appropriate device. An exchange computer system <b>100</b> receives orders and transmits market data related to orders and trades to users. In another example, the trade engine <b>144</b> may be configured to process orders for instruments associated with another exchange or third-party electronic trade matching system.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">A user database <b>102</b> may include information identifying traders and other users of exchange computer system <b>100</b>. Such information may include user names and passwords. A trader operating an electronic device (e.g., computer devices <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> and <b>122</b>) interacting with the exchange <b>100</b> may be authenticated against user names and passwords stored in the user database <b>112</b>. Furthermore, an account data module <b>104</b> may process account information that may be used during trades. The account information may be specific to the particular trader (or user) of an electronic device interacting with the exchange <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A match engine module <b>106</b> may match bid and offer prices for orders configured in accordance with aspects of the disclosure. Match engine module <b>106</b> may be implemented with software that executes one or more algorithms for matching bids and offers for bundled financial instruments in accordance with aspects of the disclosure. The match engine module <b>106</b> and trading system interface may be separate and distinct modules or components or may be unitary parts. Match engine module may be configured to match orders submitted to the trading system. The match engine module may match orders according to currently known or later developed trade matching practices and processes. In an embodiment, bids and orders are matched on price, on a FIFO basis. The matching algorithm also may match orders on a pro-rata basis or combination of FIFO and pro rata basis. Other processes and/or matching processes may also be employed. The match engine module <b>106</b>, after executing matching trades, may also report on the last price for a financial instrument.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Moreover, a trade database <b>108</b> may be included to store historical information identifying trades and descriptions of trades. In particular, a trade database may store information identifying or associated with the time that an order was executed and the contract price. The trade database <b>108</b> may also comprise a storage device configured to store at least part of the orders submitted by electronic devices operated by traders (and/or other users). A confirmation message may be sent when the match engine module <b>106</b> finds a match for an order and the order is subsequently executed. The confirmation message may, in some embodiments, be an e-mail message to a trader, an electronic notification in one of various formats, or any other form of generating a notification of an order execution.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Furthermore, an order book module <b>110</b> may be included to compute or otherwise determine current bid and offer prices. The order book module <b>110</b> may be configured to calculate the price of a financial instrument. Also, a market data module <b>112</b> may be included to collect market data and prepare the data for transmission to users. In addition, a risk management module <b>134</b> may be included in computer system <b>100</b> to compute and determine the amount of risk associated with a financial product or portfolio of financial products. An order processor module <b>136</b> may be included to receive data associated with an order for a financial instrument. The module <b>136</b> may decompose delta-based and bulk order types for processing by order book module <b>110</b> and match engine module <b>106</b>. The order processor module <b>136</b> may be configured to process the data associated with the orders for financial instruments.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Similar to an order processor module <b>136</b>, a request for quote (RFQ) processor module <b>142</b> may receive requests for quotes (RFQs) from traders operating computer devices <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>. The RFQ processor module <b>142</b> may also receive RFQs from other sources, including, but not limited to the exchange and/or clearinghouses <b>140</b>. RFQs may include information about the terms related to a financial instrument, such as price, instrument identifier, expiration date (in the case of an options contract), and other terms known to those skilled in the art. The RFQ processor module <b>142</b> may receive the RFQ and communicate with market makers <b>130</b> and/or traders to obtain a response to the RFQ. For example, the RFQ processor module <b>142</b> may broadcast RFQs to subscribers (e.g., market makers <b>130</b>, traders, etc.) to inform them that quotes are requested on particular financial instruments. In some instances, no response may be obtained and the RFQ may remain unanswered. In other embodiments, the RFQ processor module <b>142</b> may be able to provide information to the requesting entity/individual (e.g., a trader).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Exchange computer system <b>100</b> may also include an implied spread determination module <b>138</b>. The implied spread determination module <b>138</b> may be used to determine if an order in combination with one or more pending unmatched orders (i.e., resting orders) in an order book creates an implied spread. The implied spread determination module <b>138</b> may perform the determination in parallel with and/or apart from the electronic match engine <b>106</b> in the exchange. Furthermore, as graphically depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the implied spread determination module <b>138</b> may be located inside or outside the exchange computer system <b>100</b>. For example, the implied spread determination module <b>138</b> may be located in a remote computer system <b>120</b> outside the exchange computer system <b>100</b>. In another embodiment, the module <b>138</b> may have multiple instances running inside and outside the exchange. One skilled in the art will recognize that the implied spread determination module <b>138</b> may be implemented using programming code (e.g., C++, C, Java, etc.) and executed on a processor located in a computing device.

Exchange computer system <b>100</b> may also exchange information with other trade engines, such as trade engine <b>144</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A clearinghouse <b>140</b> enables an exchange computer system <b>100</b> to provide contracts with a lower likelihood of default than over-the-counter (OTC) products. A clearinghouse <b>140</b> arranges for transactions to be settled and cleared. Clearing is the procedure through which a clearinghouse <b>140</b> becomes buyer to each seller of a contract (e.g., futures contract, equities, currencies, interest rate products, etc.), and seller to each buyer, and assumes responsibility for protecting buyer and seller from financial loss by assuring performance on each contract. A clearinghouse <b>140</b> may settle trading accounts, clear trades, collect and maintain performance bond funds, regulate delivery and report trading data. In some scenarios an exchange may operate its own clearinghouse <b>140</b> through a division of the exchange through which all trades made are confirmed, matched, and settled each day until offset or delivered. Alternatively, one or more other companies may be provided the responsibility of acting as a clearinghouse <b>140</b> with the exchange (and possibly other exchanges). An exchange may have one or more clearinghouses associated with the exchange. An exchange may offer firms qualified to clear trades to provide a clearinghouse <b>140</b> for the exchange computer system <b>100</b>. In some instances, these clearing members may be designated into different categories based on the type of commodities they can clear and other factors.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The clearinghouse <b>140</b> may establish minimum performance bond (i.e., margin) requirements for the products it handles. A customer may be required to deposit a performance bond with the clearinghouse <b>140</b> (or designated account) for the purpose of insuring the clearinghouse <b>140</b> against loss on open positions. The performance bond helps ensure the financial integrity of brokers, clearinghouses, and exchanges as a whole. If a trader experiences a drop in funds below a minimum requirement, the clearinghouse <b>140</b> may issue a margin call requiring a deposit into the margin account to restore the trader's equity. A clearinghouse <b>140</b> may charge additional performance bond requirements at the clearinghouse's discretion. For example, if a clearinghouse's potential market exposure grows large relative to the financial resources available to support those exposures, the clearinghouse <b>140</b> may issue a margin call.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In another embodiment, the clearinghouse <b>140</b> may require a larger performance bond based on a credit check (e.g., an analysis of the credit worthiness, such as using a FICO&#x2122; or comparable score, inter alia) of the customer/trader. The credit check may be performed (i.e., initiated) by a clearinghouse <b>140</b> or an exchange <b>100</b>. In the example where the clearinghouse <b>140</b> performs the credit check, the clearinghouse <b>140</b> may send a message (e.g., enforcement message) to the exchange <b>100</b>. If the credit check indicates that a customer/trader is a high risk, the enforcement message may increase the margin requirements of the customer/trader, or otherwise adjust the capabilities/constraints of the customer/trader commensurate with the higher risk. In the example where the exchange <b>100</b> initiates the credit check, the exchange <b>100</b> may send a message to one or more clearinghouses associated with the exchange <b>100</b> to update them on the increased/decreased risk associated with the customer/trader.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In recognition of the desire to promote efficient clearing procedures and to focus on the true intermarket risk exposure of clearinghouses, a cross-margining system may be used. By combining the positions of joint and affiliated clearinghouses in certain broad-based equity index futures and options into a single portfolio, a single performance bond requirement across all markets may be determined. The cross-margining system may greatly enhance the efficiency and financial integrity of the clearing system.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The principal means by which a clearinghouse <b>140</b> mitigates the likelihood of default is through mark-to-market (MTM) adjustments. The clearinghouse <b>140</b> derives its financial stability in large part by removing debt obligations among market participants as they occur. Through daily MTM adjustments, every contract is debited or credited based on that trading session's gains or losses. For example, as prices move for or against a position, funds flow into or out of the trading account. This cash flow is known as settlement variation.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Of course, numerous additional servers, computers, handheld devices, personal digital assistants, telephones and other devices may also be connected to exchange computer system <b>100</b>.

In one embodiment, the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may be used to receive new orders <b>202</b> that are used to focus an implied spread determination module <b>138</b> on particular financial instruments for which implied spread orders may exist. In another embodiment in accordance with the disclosure, the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may be used to direct an implied spread determination module <b>138</b> as to which financial instruments to perform analysis on to determine if implied spread orders may exist. Along these lines, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a method for determining implied spreads in accordance with various embodiments of the disclosure; in particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a method for using a request for quote (RFQ) to focus the computations involved in identifying existing implied orders on order books.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In accordance with one embodiment of the disclosure, a new order <b>202</b> for a financial instrument may be received at an exchange computer system <b>200</b>. The new order <b>202</b> may be an outright order for a single futures contract or any other financial product (e.g., an options contract, a derivative product, security, bond, etc.) Alternatively, the new order <b>202</b> may be a spread order with a butterfly, crack, or other configuration. The new order <b>202</b> may be received at communication interface <b>204</b> in exchange computer system <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, the communication interface <b>204</b> may be an input/output (I/O) port on a communications card (e.g., an Ethernet card) on a computing device at the exchange computer system <b>100</b>. Alternatively, the communication interface <b>204</b> may be in communication with a user's computing device <b>120</b> that permits the user to enter/select an order <b>220</b>. One skilled in the arts will appreciate that the communication interface <b>204</b> may be used to communicate with a variety of devices and/or modules inside or outside an exchange.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The new order may be sent to an implied spread determination module <b>208</b> to determine if the new order in combination with one or more pending orders creates an implied spread. Meanwhile, the new order <b>202</b> may also be nearly simultaneously submitted to the electronic match engine <b>106</b> for processing. As described in greater detail in commonly assigned, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/617,915, granted as U.S. Pat. No. 7,805,360, entitled &#x201c;Template Based Matching,&#x201d; which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, match engine module <b>106</b> may attempt to match new order <b>202</b> to data included in a collection of almost matched orders and pending orders included in various order books. The collection of almost matched orders and/or various order books may be stored in a memory accessible to a microprocessor used to implement a match engine.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Sometime during or after the time the electronic match engine <b>106</b> receives the new order, the implied spread determination module <b>208</b> may perform in parallel the step of determining if any implied spreads are created using the new order <b>202</b>. Some benefits of such an embodiment include reduced match engine <b>106</b> workload and quicker response times from match engine <b>106</b>. In addition, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the implied spread determination module may be various locations. For example, an implied spread determination module <b>212</b> may be executed at a remote computer outside the exchange. The remote computer may be a computer located physically outside an exchange, but controlled by the exchange. Alternatively, the remote computer may be a trader's computer <b>120</b>. In yet another example, the implied spread determination module <b>210</b> may be running in a processing thread on a computer located inside the exchange and running in parallel with one or more other implied spread determination modules <b>208</b>. Therefore, numerous implied spread determination modules <b>208</b>, <b>210</b> may be running in parallel with each other (e.g., different modules may each be searching some portion or depth of the possible implied space). Moreover, the implied spread determination modules <b>210</b>, <b>208</b>, <b>212</b> may be running simultaneous with the electronic match engine <b>106</b>. At least one benefit of such a parallel processing distributed architecture is the greater computational power available at a given time.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, an implied spread determination module <b>138</b> may determine (in step <b>304</b>) if any implied spreads can be created involving the financial instrument of a request for quote (RFQ) <b>206</b> received in step <b>302</b>. In one embodiment, order books are analyzed to generate a collection of needed orders <b>216</b> that each when combined with one or more existing orders meet the requirements of one of the acceptable trade templates. Trade templates are discussed in greater detail in commonly assigned, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/617,915, granted as U.S. Pat. No. 7,805,360, entitled &#x201c;Template Based Matching,&#x201d; which was previously incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. The implied spread determination module <b>138</b> may compare any new orders <b>202</b> and pending orders related to the financial instrument of the RFQ <b>206</b> to the collection of needed orders <b>216</b>. If any of these orders match one of the needed orders, the implied spread determination module <b>208</b> creates an implied spread.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The implied spread created (in step <b>320</b>) by the implied spread determination module <b>208</b> may comprise multiple legs. For example, the implied spread may include a first leg corresponding to a new order <b>202</b> and a second leg corresponding to a pending order. In one example, the new order <b>202</b> may be the order that completes the unmatched leg of an implied spread awaiting a match. The number of legs in the implied spread may be dependent on the resources (e.g., amount of processing power and time) available to the implied spread determination module <b>208</b> to attempt to identify possible implied spreads.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">After the implied spread determination module <b>208</b> determines that an implied spread exists, a notification may be sent (in step <b>306</b>) through a communication interface <b>204</b> to the electronic match engine <b>106</b> informing the engine of the matching combination. The notification may comprise order book identifiers that permit the matching engine to, in one embodiment, verify that all legs of the implied spread are valid. For example, the identifiers may be used to check the appropriate order books to verify that the appropriate resting orders are still unmatched. One skilled in the art will appreciate that a communication interface <b>204</b> may include an input/output (I/O) port on a communications card (e.g., an Ethernet card) on a computing device at the exchange computer system <b>100</b>. Alternatively, information may be sent through the communication interface <b>204</b> to an output device (e.g., a display monitor) to alert a user (e.g., manager) of an exchange that an implied match exists so the user may respond accordingly.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Using the information provided in the notification, the electronic match engine <b>106</b> matches (e.g., executes) all of the multiple legs of the implied spread. The execution (or the notification) may trigger the RFQ processor module <b>138</b> to send (in step <b>326</b>) a response to the RFQ <b>206</b>. For example, an RFQ may be received for a particular financial instrument with no current trading activity (i.e., no volume and/or illiquidity). The generation and matching/execution of the implied spread order that includes the particular financial instrument may create trading activity for the particular financial instrument. Such trading activity provides information (e.g., current trading price) that may be used to create the response to be sent in step <b>326</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Using the information provided in the notification, the plurality of trades that match the legs of the implied spread may be contemporaneously executed such that all of the trades are executed before a material change in the appropriate markets. The abundance of processing power at the electronic match engine <b>106</b> is at least one factor that permits the matching of the legs of the implied spread with minimal or no legging risk. For example, after an implied spread determination module <b>208</b> has identified the corresponding legs of an implied transaction, the electronic match engine <b>106</b> may execute the implied transaction inline without requiring a locking of the markets involved. In alternate embodiments, an exchange may lock one or more markets for the orders involved to eliminate possible legging risk.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The electronic match engine <b>106</b> may be configured to determine if a new order <b>202</b> or a pending order in combination with one or more pending orders for particular financial instruments creates an implied spread. In some embodiments, the electronic match engine <b>106</b> may limit the determination to only those financial instruments located in a search list <b>214</b>. The search list <b>214</b> may comprise a plurality of financial instruments that are cleared to be monitored for determining implied spreads. The new order <b>202</b> may be compared to the search list <b>214</b> before determining if an implied spread is created. At least one benefit of such an embodiment is that it allows an exchange to restrict the electronic match engine <b>106</b> from searching a potentially unlimited number of new orders for implied spreads by focusing it on those financial instruments of new orders that it believes may be more conducive to an implied spread.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In another example in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure, the RFQ processor module <b>142</b> (or another comparable module) may determine (in step <b>312</b>) if the financial instrument associated with an incoming RFQ <b>206</b> may be used to determine (in step <b>304</b>) if an implied spread may be generated. In one example, a search list <b>214</b> may be used to further this determination (of step <b>312</b>). The search list used by the RFQ processor module <b>142</b> may be the same or a different list as the search list used by the electronic match engine <b>106</b>. If a match is found in the search list <b>214</b>, the RFQ processor module <b>142</b> may be configured to submit a request to an implied spread determination module <b>138</b> (e.g., implied spread determination modules <b>212</b>, <b>210</b>, or <b>208</b>) to determine (in step <b>304</b>) if an implied spread may be generated using one or more pending orders for the particular financial instrument of the RFQ <b>206</b>. One skilled in the art after review of the entirety disclosed herein will appreciate that at least one benefit of such an embodiment is that it allows an exchange to focus the potentially unlimited number of combinations that may possibly lead to implied spreads, thus enhancing efficiency of processing and/or memory consumption.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one example, the search list <b>214</b> of RFQ processor module <b>142</b> may comprise a plurality of financial instruments (or a name of a predefined group of financial instruments) that are to be monitored to determine implied spreads. In an alternate embodiment, the search list <b>214</b> may be the inverse of the prior example. In other words, the search list <b>214</b> may comprise those financial instruments which the RFQ processor module <b>142</b> should exclude from acting as a trigger for determining implied spreads. At least one purpose of such an embodiment may be to prevent particular financial instruments with historically high liquidity from overloading the exchange computer system <b>100</b> and/or implied spread determination module <b>138</b>. In yet another embodiment, the search list <b>214</b> may serve as a switch to turn on and turn off various functionality. For example, the search list <b>214</b> may be temporarily cleared when the generation of implied spreads is to be turned off. Accordingly, the search list <b>214</b> may act as a switch to prevent additional load on the system due to implied spread generation. The search list <b>214</b> may be restored (i.e., undoing the temporary clearing) when such functionality is desired to be turned on again.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Furthermore, in one embodiment in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, the search list may be updated (in step <b>316</b>) based on the determining occurring in an implied spread determination module <b>138</b>. As such, the search list may be an adaptive list that allows electronic match engine <b>106</b> to try to detect implied spreads where there is a higher probability of finding them. This may be determined based on past success, market conditions, submitted request for quotes (RFQs) and/or through monitoring activity of the implied spread determination module <b>138</b> and/or the electronic match engine <b>106</b> itself.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Likewise, the operation of an implied spread determination module <b>138</b> may be adjusted based on prior findings of implied spreads. For example, the collection of needed orders <b>216</b> may be updated (in step <b>316</b>) based on the determination of implied spreads occurring in the implied spread determination module <b>208</b>. As such, the collection of needed orders <b>216</b> may be dynamically adjusted to identify those financial instruments that have a higher probability of contributing to an implied spread. Like the search list <b>214</b>, the adjustment may be based on past success, market conditions, submitted request for quotes (RFQs) and/or through monitoring activity. In one embodiment in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure, an implied spread determination module <b>138</b> may include its own search list. Such a search list may operate similar to search list <b>214</b> to enhance the operation of the implied spread determination modules <b>208</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in another embodiment in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure, the RFQ processor module <b>142</b> may be configured to wait (in step <b>324</b>) a predetermined amount of time before submitting a request (in step <b>324</b>) to an implied spread determination module <b>138</b>. For example, the RFQ processor module <b>142</b> may receive an RFQ <b>206</b> at time t<b>1</b>. A timer component in the RFQ processor module <b>142</b> may begin counting down from time t<b>1</b> for a predetermined amount of time (e.g., 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 3 minutes, less than 5 minutes, etc.) until a response to the RFQ is received. If a response to the RFQ is received before the predetermined amount of time expires, then the RFQ response may be sent (in step <b>326</b>) to the requesting entity/individual (e.g., a trader requesting a quote on a particular financial instrument). If no response is received within the predetermined time, the financial instrument associated with the RFQ may be submitted to an implied spread determination module <b>138</b>. In some examples the RFQ processor module <b>142</b> may consult with a search list <b>214</b>, as described above, before requesting the implied spread determination module <b>138</b> begin determining (in step <b>304</b>) if implied orders exist. In some examples the RFQ processor module <b>142</b> may submit the financial instrument associated with the RFQ to an implied spread determination module <b>138</b> even if a response is received (e.g., from a market maker <b>130</b>) within the predetermined amount of time.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In yet another embodiment in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, the implied spread determination module <b>138</b> may automatically stop calculations to determine (in step <b>304</b>) if an implied order exists after a predefined amount of time has passed. For example, an implied spread determination module <b>138</b> may receive a financial instrument from RFQ processor module <b>142</b> at time t<b>1</b>. A timer in the implied spread determination module <b>138</b> may begin counting down starting at time t<b>1</b> for a predefined amount of time (e.g., 0.5 seconds, 1 second, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, 30 seconds, less than 1 minute, etc.) and stop calculations once the timer expires. One skilled in the art will appreciate that a timer is just one way of calculating the passage of time and other components (e.g., counter, clock, adder, etc.) for accomplishing the function are contemplated by the term &#x201c;timer.&#x201d; In addition, the aforementioned timer may be located in components outside of the implied spread determination module <b>138</b>; for example, the timer may be located in the RFQ processor module <b>142</b>, and upon expiration, the RFQ processor module <b>142</b> may instruct the particular implied spread determination module <b>138</b> to stop further calculations. One skilled in the art will appreciate after review of the entirety disclosed herein that at least one benefit of a timer to regulate the determination performed by the implied spread determination module <b>138</b> is that it reduces the stress/load on the system created by memory/processor intensive implied determination calculations.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an implied spread determination module <b>208</b> in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure may identify an implied spread for a new order <b>410</b> using pending spread orders <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, <b>408</b>, and an outright order <b>406</b>. The new order may be an order to buy <b>9700</b> oil future call contracts. The implied spread determination module <b>138</b> may calculate that the legs of butterfly spread <b>402</b> may be combined with the legs of calendar spread <b>408</b> and calendar spread <b>404</b>. In addition, the module <b>138</b> may calculate that one of the two remaining unmatched legs of the butterfly spread <b>402</b> may be filled by a pending outright order <b>406</b>. The remaining unmatched leg may match an order to sell <b>9700</b> oil future call contracts. Therefore, the implied spread determination module <b>138</b> may send a notification to the electronic match engine <b>106</b> indicating that the combination of the pending orders <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, <b>406</b>, and <b>408</b> and new order <b>410</b> complete a match. The notification may include identifiers directing the match engine <b>106</b> to the appropriate order books to find the appropriate pending orders.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Such a notification may, in one embodiment in accordance with aspects of the disclosure, include order book identifiers without also including a copy of the orders. Since the best priced orders on an order book will be used for matching, the electronic match engine <b>106</b> does not necessarily require a copy of the order itself. Moreover, since new orders may arrive during any period of time, the system may further check the order book to identify any additional orders. In addition, such an embodiment allows customers that only possess aggregate book information to take part in the process. For example a customer who only knows the number and quantity of orders present at a price level in an order book may be able to detect and transmit a possible implied without knowing the detailed information about orders on the book. Since the implied spread determination module <b>138</b> is running in parallel with the match engine <b>106</b>, the module <b>138</b> may be able to run through greater combinations of orders to determine if an implied spread may be formed.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In yet another example in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure, a user external to the exchange computer system <b>100</b>, such as a user of a trading terminal <b>120</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>116</b>, may monitor the market and order books to calculate an implied spread. The terminal <b>120</b> may send a new order <b>220</b> (e.g., an outright order, a synthetic spread order, etc.) to the exchange that uses the implied spread to obtain an advantageous trade price. The new order may be in a recognized format (e.g., the FIX/FAST format) and include information in its message format that facilitates matching by an electronic match engine <b>106</b> of the new order <b>220</b> with the one or more pending orders. That information may include multiple order book identifiers or other information useful to the match engine <b>106</b> to match the order <b>220</b>. In one embodiment, the order may be marked as &#x201c;Fill and Kill&#x201d; or &#x201c;Fill or Kill;&#x201d; thus, further reducing the customer's risk by ensuring that the order does not rest on the order book if the implied matching possibility no longer exists.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The match engine <b>106</b> may, in some embodiments, verify the information that facilitates matching by confirming the status of pending orders that will be matched against the legs of the implied spread. The exchange computer system <b>100</b> may perform the verifying in the match engine <b>106</b> itself, or alternatively, delegate this activity to an implied spread determination module <b>208</b> where the verifying may occur in a separate thread running in parallel with the match engine <b>106</b>. If the verification finds the implied spread to be valid, then a notification of the implied spread may be sent to the match engine <b>106</b> for executing all of the legs of the implied spread against the pending orders identified in the order <b>202</b>. At least one advantage of executing all of the legs of the implied spread in a nearly simultaneous manner is that there is miniscule slippage risk to the user. In some embodiments, a limit may be placed on the number of legs that may be submitted in an implied spread in order to guarantee that the legging risk is averted.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The present disclosure has been described herein with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that a person understanding this disclosure may conceive of changes or other embodiments or variations, which utilize the principles of this disclosure without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the disclosure as set forth in the appended claims. For example, the operation of generally determining and executing an implied spread is depicted for illustrative purposes in steps <b>320</b>, <b>306</b>, and <b>316</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In some embodiments in accordance with various aspects of the disclosure, these aforementioned steps may be illustrated as a single high-level step for determining and executing an implied spread associated with a financial instrument provided by the RFQ processor module <b>142</b>. One or more of the steps may be optional and may be omitted from various embodiments. For example, in some embodiments locking may be omitted or replaced by a step that performs an equivalent function (i.e., of preventing legging risk).</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
