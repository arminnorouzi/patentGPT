The VR all-in-one machine has functions of independent computing, inputting and outputting. Although the functions of the VR all-in-one machine are not as powerful as those of an external VR head-mounted display device, the VR all-in-one machine has no constraints with connection lines and has a higher degree of freedom.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">In the related art, in order to achieve a good display effect of the VR all-in-one machine, a display is continuously performed in a high-resolution and a high-frame rate manner. However, performance of the application processor in the VR all-in-one machine is usually weak; during image rendering and calculation, the application processor has a high load and generates heat seriously, which will cause an overall temperature of the machine to be too high. In a case where the temperature exceeds a certain limit, the application processor will automatically reduce frequency to run, and reduce an image refresh rate in turn, thereby causing an image to freeze and reducing an experience effect.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">For example, VR vision correction devices belong in a category of VR all-in-one machines, and an application processor in a VR vision correction device is often in a high load operation state for a long time. As a result, an overall temperature and a display frame rate of the VR vision correction device are unstable, and a user experience effect is very poor; furthermore, the VR vision correction device may only be used for one to three hours after being fully charged, and power consumption is very fast.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">Based on this, some embodiments of the present disclosure provide an imaging system, a control method thereof, a control device and a storage medium that having at least the following technical effects. First, it is possible to ameliorate problems of excessive rendering pressure and serious heating of an application processor in the imaging system. Second, it is possible to ameliorate problems of fast power consumption and short usage time of a battery. Third, there are no obvious differences in a display effect compared with traditional solutions. The imaging system may be the VR all-in-one machine, the VR vision correction device, or VR glasses. The imaging system and the control method thereof, the control device and the storage medium will be described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram showing an imaging principle of an imaging system, in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the imaging system <b>100</b> includes a display device <b>1</b> and a dimming lens <b>2</b> disposed on a display side <b>10</b> of the display device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">The display device <b>1</b> may display images such as pictures and videos. For example, the display device may be a liquid crystal display device, an organic light emitting diode display device, a projection display device, or the like. The embodiments of the present disclosure do not limit a type of the display device, that is, the display device <b>1</b> may be any device having a display function.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">The dimming lens <b>2</b> may move toward or away from the display device <b>1</b> to adjust an object distance a from the display device <b>1</b> to the dimming lens <b>2</b>. A position of the dimming lens <b>2</b> may be adjusted manually or automatically. In a case where the position of the dimming lens <b>2</b> is adjusted manually, a manual adjustment structure connected to the dimming lens <b>2</b> may be pushed or rotated by a human hand, so that the dimming lens <b>2</b> is driven to move toward or away from the display device <b>1</b> by the manual adjustment structure. In a case where the position of the dimming lens <b>2</b> is adjusted automatically, for example, the imaging system further includes a driving member (e.g., a motor) connected to the dimming lens <b>2</b>, and the driving member may drive the dimming lens <b>2</b> to move toward or away from the display device <b>1</b> automatically. It will be understood that the above is only an example, and a method for controlling the dimming lens <b>2</b> to move toward or away from the display device <b>1</b> in the present disclosure is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">On this basis, a control method for an imaging system provided in some embodiments of the present disclosure is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the control method includes S<b>11</b> to S<b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">In S<b>11</b>, when the dimming lens <b>2</b> moves to a set position, the object distance a is determined.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the set position refers to a position where the dimming lens <b>2</b> is located when a user may view a clear image (i.e., a clear virtual image <b>1</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) through the dimming lens <b>2</b>. It will be understood that image distances b are not the same when users with different vision view a clear image. In other words, the image distance when a user with good vision views a clear image is greater than the image distance when a user with poor vision views a clear image. Moreover, in a case where a focal distance of the dimming lens <b>2</b> is constant, since the image distances b are not the same when users with different vision view a clear image, the object distances a corresponding to users with different vision are also different, that is, set positions corresponding to the users with different vision are not the same. Based on this, by the above S<b>11</b>, when the different users each move the dimming lens <b>2</b> to a respective set position, a respective object distance a may be determined.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">In S<b>12</b>, according to the object distance a, the image distance b from the virtual image <b>1</b>A, generated by a display image of the display device <b>1</b> through the dimming lens <b>2</b>, to the dimming lens <b>2</b> is determined.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">For example, the image distance b may be determined according to the following formula:</p><p id="p-0069" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00002" num="00002"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mrow>    <mfrac>     <mn>1</mn>     <mi>a</mi>    </mfrac>    <mo>-</mo>    <mfrac>     <mn>1</mn>     <mi>b</mi>    </mfrac>   </mrow>   <mo>=</mo>   <mfrac>    <mn>1</mn>    <mi>f</mi>   </mfrac>  </mrow>  <mo>;</mo> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">where a is the object distance, b is the image distance, f is the focal distance of the dimming lens, and a is less than f (a&#x3c;f). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the object distance a is set to be less than the focal distance f, so that the virtual image <b>1</b>A and the display device <b>1</b> are located on the same side of the dimming lens <b>2</b>, and in this case, a user may view the virtual image <b>1</b>A corresponding to the display image of the display device <b>1</b> through the dimming lens <b>2</b> from a side of the dimming lens <b>2</b> away from the display device <b>1</b>. The virtual image <b>1</b>A is an upright enlarged display image.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">In S<b>13</b>, according to the determined image distance b and a correlation between the image distance and a resolution of the display image, a resolution corresponding to the calculated image distance b is determined, and the display device <b>1</b> is controlled to display the display image at the determined resolution.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069">The correlation between the image distance and the resolution of the display image means that, for any calculated image distance b, there is a resolution of the display image corresponding to the image distance b. For example, different image distances b may correspond to different resolution respectively; or, a group of image distances b (e.g., a plurality of image distances b in the same value range) may correspond to a same resolution, and in this case, a plurality of groups of image distances b correspond to different resolution respectively.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070">In addition, the correlation between the image distance and the resolution of the display image may be pre-stored in an internal memory of the imaging system, or may be pre-stored in an external memory coupled to the imaging system. Moreover, a storage manner for pre-storing the correspondence relationship is not limited here.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0071">By S<b>11</b> to S<b>13</b> in the above control method, for different users, the object distances and the image distances corresponding to when the different users view the clear virtual image <b>1</b>A may be determined respectively, and different display image resolution may be provided according to the different image distances, which is beneficial to prevent the application processor in the imaging system from running at a high load for a long time. As a result, the problems of excessive image rendering pressure and serious heat generation of the application processor are ameliorated, and the problems of fast power consumption and short usage time of the battery in the imaging system are ameliorated. Moreover, compared with the traditional solutions, the imaging system has no obvious differences in the display effect.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0072">It is worth noting that, when the human eye views objects, the closer objects are larger, and the farther objects are smaller. Therefore, even if a high-definition display image is rendered, the display image may have effects of stretching and enlarging in a case where the image distance is large. That is to say, even if the resolution of the display image displayed by the display device is high, in the case where the image distance is large, it is difficult for the human eye to view the virtual image as clear as the display image. Therefore, in this case, unnecessary image rendering pressure may be caused to the application processor in the imaging system. Especially for the VR vision correction device, since the VR vision correction device needs to adjust the image distance of the virtual image frequently, if a display is always performed at the resolution of the display device, a burden on the application processor may be increased undoubtedly, and a good display effect may not be achieved in a case where the image distance is far away. As a result, problems such as serious heat generation and fast power consumption are prone to occur.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0073">Based on this, in some embodiments, the image distance has a negative correlation with the resolution of the display image. With this design, the resolution of the display image decreases as the image distance increases, thereby reducing the image rendering pressure of the application processor in the imaging system in a case where the image distance is large, and preventing the application processor from running at the high load for a long time, so as to ameliorate problems such as serious heat generation and fast power consumption of the application processor and the entire imaging system. As a result, it is not easy for the application processor to automatically reduce frequency to run due to the serious heat generation, and it is not easy for the imaging system to have problems such as a reduction in an image refresh rate and an image freeze.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0074">In some other embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, S<b>13</b> includes S<b>131</b> and S<b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0075">In S<b>131</b>, if the determined image distance b is within a first image distance range, it is determined that the resolution corresponding to the determined image distance b is equal to a screen resolution of the display device.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0076">In S<b>132</b>, if the determined image distance b is within a second image distance range, it is determined that the resolution corresponding to the determined image distance b is smaller than the screen resolution of the display device. Each image distance value in the second image distance range is greater than each image distance value in the first image distance range.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0077">In the embodiments, if the determined image distance b is within the first image distance range, it means that a distance between the virtual image and the human eye is relatively small. In this case, the determined resolution corresponding to the determined image distance b is equal to the screen resolution of the display device. That is, in this case, the display device displays the display image at a resolution equal to the screen resolution thereof, so that the human eye may view a clear virtual image. If the determined image distance b is within the second image distance range, it means that the distance between the virtual image and the human eye is relatively large. In this case, the determined resolution corresponding to the determined image distance b is smaller than the screen resolution of the display device. That is, in this case, the display device displays the display image at a resolution smaller than the screen resolution thereof, in this way, it is possible to reduce the image rendering pressure of the application processor in the imaging system, and prevent the application processor from running at a high load for a long time, so as to ameliorate problems such as serious heat generation and fast power consumption of the application processor and the entire imaging system. As a result, it is not easy for the application processor to automatically reduce frequency to run due to the serious heat generation, and it is not easy for the imaging system to have problems such as a reduction in an image refresh rate and an image freeze.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0078">Based on this, for example, each image distance value in the first image distance range is greater than or equal to 0.1 meters and less than or equal to 3 meters. With this design, the display device displays the display image at the resolution equal to the screen resolution of the display device in a case where the determined image distance b is greater than or equal to 0.1 meters and less than or equal to 3 meters, so that the human eye may view a clear virtual image.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0079">In a case where the second image distance range includes a third image distance range and a fourth image distance range, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the S<b>13</b> further includes S<b>133</b> and S<b>134</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0080">In S<b>133</b>, if the determined image distance is within the third image distance range, it is determined that the resolution corresponding to the determined image distance is a first resolution.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0081">In S<b>134</b>, if the determined image distance is within the fourth image distance range, it is determined that the resolution corresponding to the determined image distance is a second resolution.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0082">Each image distance value in the fourth image distance range is greater than each image distance value in the third image distance range. The first resolution is smaller than the screen resolution of the display device and larger than the second resolution. The number of horizontal pixels of the second resolution is 0.5 times the number of horizontal pixels of the screen resolution of the display device, and the number of vertical pixels of the second resolution is 0.5 times the number of vertical pixels of the screen resolution of the display device. In other words, the second resolution is a quarter of the screen resolution of the display device.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0083">In the embodiments, if the determined image distance b is within the third image distance range, it means that the distance between the virtual image and the human eye is relatively large. In this case, the determined resolution corresponding to the determined image distance b is the first resolution. That is, in this case, the display device displays the display image at the first resolution smaller than the screen resolution of the display device and larger than the second resolution, in this way, it is possible to reduce the image rendering pressure of the application processor in the imaging system and prevent the application processor from running at a high load for a long time, so as to ameliorate problems of serious heat generation and fast power consumption of the application processor and the entire imaging system. As a result, it is not easy for the application processor to automatically reduce frequency to run due to the serious heat generation, and it is not easy for the imaging system to have problems such as a reduction in an image refresh rate and an image freeze.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0084">However, if the determined image distance b is within the fourth image distance range, it means that the distance between the virtual image and the human eye is large. In this case, the determined resolution corresponding to the determined image distance b is the second resolution. That is, in this case, the display device displays the display image at the second resolution smaller than the first resolution, in this way, it is possible to further reduce the image rendering pressure of the application processor in the imaging system and prevent the application processor from running at a high load for a long time, so as to further ameliorate problems of serious heat generation and fast power consumption of the application processor and the entire imaging system. As a result, it is more difficult for the application processor to automatically reduce frequency to run due to the serious heat generation, and it is more difficult for the imaging system to have problems such as a reduction in an image refresh rate and an image freeze in this case.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0085">On this basis, for example, each image distance value in the third image distance range is greater than 3 meters and less than or equal to 6 meters, and each image distance value in the fourth image distance range is greater than 6 meters and less than or equal to 10 meters.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0086">With this design, in a case where the determined image distance b is greater than 3 meters and less than or equal to 6 meters (i.e., within the third image distance range), the display device displays the display image at the first resolution smaller than the screen resolution and larger than the second resolution. In this case, not only may the image rendering pressure of an independent system in the imaging system be reduced, but also the virtual image viewed by the human eye and the viewed virtual image at the same image distance in the related art have no obvious differences in the display effect.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0087">Similarly, with this design, in a case where the determined image distance b is greater than 6 meters and less than or equal to 10 meters (i.e., within the fourth image distance range), the display device displays the display image at the second resolution smaller than the first resolution. In this case, not only may the image rendering pressure of the independent system in the imaging system be further reduced, but also the virtual image viewed by the human eye and the viewed virtual image at the same image distance in the related art have no obvious differences in the display effect.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0088">It will be noted that the present disclosure does not limit the screen resolution of the display device, as long as the display device may achieve a normal display function. In some examples, the screen resolution of the display device is 1200&#xd7;1200, the first resolution is 800&#xd7;800, and the second resolution is 600&#xd7;600. It will be understood that, the screen resolution of the display device is 1200&#xd7;1200, which means that the number of horizontal pixels in the screen resolution is 1200, and the number of vertical pixels in the screen resolution is 1200; the first resolution is 800&#xd7;800, which means that the number of horizontal pixels in the first resolution is 800, and the number of vertical pixels in the first resolution is 800; the second resolution is 600&#xd7;600, which means that the number of horizontal pixels in the second resolution is 600, and the number of vertical pixels in the second resolution is 600. In addition, a person skilled in the art should understand that the above is only described by taking an example in which the number of horizontal pixels and the number of vertical pixels in each resolution are equal.

In this case, the driving component <b>3</b> is connected to the dimming lens, and the driving component <b>3</b> is configured to drive the dimming lens <b>2</b> to move toward or away from the display device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0090">Based on this, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, S<b>11</b> includes S<b>111</b> and S<b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0091">In S<b>111</b>, according to a state change amount of the driving component <b>3</b>, a moving direction and a moving distance of the dimming lens <b>2</b> when the dimming lens <b>2</b> moves from an initial position to the set position are determined. The initial position may be any position within a movable range of the dimming lens, which is not limited in the present disclosure. For example, a position within the movable range farthest from the display device <b>1</b> may serve as the initial position; for another example, a position within the movable range closest to the display device <b>1</b> may serve as the initial position; for yet another example, a middle position within the movable range may serve as the initial position.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0092">In some examples, the driving component <b>3</b> includes a driving shaft (e.g., a motor shaft). In this case, the state change amount of the driving component <b>3</b> refers to a rotation direction and the number of rotations of the driving shaft. For example, in a case where the driving shaft rotates three times in a forward direction and two times in a reverse direction, it means that the driving shaft rotates only one time in the forward direction. In this case, it may mean that the dimming lens <b>2</b> moves a first distance toward the display device <b>1</b> (the first distance is determined by a transmission component between the driving shaft and the dimming lens <b>2</b>), or it may mean that the dimming lens <b>2</b> moves the first distance away from the display device <b>1</b>. The dimming lens <b>2</b> moves a distance that is an integer multiple of circumference of the driving shaft toward the display device <b>1</b>. Correspondingly, if the driving shaft rotates two times in the forward direction, it means that the dimming lens <b>2</b> moves two first distances toward or away from the display device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0093">In S<b>112</b>, according to an object distance when the dimming lens <b>2</b> is located at the initial position, and the moving direction and moving distance when the dimming lens <b>2</b> moves from the initial position to the set position, the object distance when the dimming lens <b>2</b> is located at the set position is determined. Since the initial position of the dimming lens <b>2</b> is preset, the object distance when the dimming lens <b>2</b> is located at the initial position is also known.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0094">On this basis, combined with the moving direction and moving distance when the dimming lens <b>2</b> moves from the initial position to the set position, the object distance when the dimming lens <b>2</b> is located at the set position may be determined. For example, in a case where the object distance when the dimming lens <b>2</b> is at the initial position is 5 mm, and the dimming lens <b>2</b> moves 3 mm toward the display device <b>1</b> during the period when the dimming lens <b>2</b> moves from the initial position to the set position, the determined object distance when the dimming lens <b>2</b> is located at the set position is 2 mm.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is a block diagram showing a structure of another imaging system in some embodiments of the present disclosure.

In this way, when the same user uses the imaging system for the second time and each time thereafter, the set position corresponding to the identity information of the user and the resolution corresponding to the identity information of the user may be directly called, and then the dimming lens is directly driven by the driving component to move to the set position corresponding to the identity information of the user, and the display device is controlled to display the display image at the resolution corresponding to the identity information of the user.
