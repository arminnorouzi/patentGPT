Within a platoon, vehicles may exchange information such as position and kinematic status in order to enable context-aware cooperation. This would improve vehicle safety as well as efficiency of the road use because it allows vehicles to be aware of the location and direction of other vehicles in the vicinity. Platoon members (e.g., vehicles) within a same platoon may communicate with each other over PC5 interface, which is handled by an access stratum (AS) layer. The AS layer may need to be configured with a specific range based on platoon specific events and/or characteristics (e.g., a number of platoon members, type of devices, etc.). Thus, in order for the platoon members to join and/or leave the platoon at any moment, methods and apparatuses that dynamically adapt the configuration of PC5 communication are needed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Methods and apparatuses are described herein for use in a user equipment (UE) to dynamically adapt PC5 communication in a vehicle to everything (V2X) platoon. For example, a UE may receive, from a vehicle to everything control function (V2X CF) or a vehicle to everything application server (V2X AS), a V2X provisioning message that includes a first transmission profile. The first transmission profile may include includes one or more quality of service (QoS) parameters and one or more V2X specific parameters. Upon receiving the V2X provisioning message, the UE may determine, based on the first transmission profile, a first range to configure PC5 communication of a plurality of UEs associated with the V2X platoon. After the PC5 communication associated with the V2X platoon is initially configured with the first range, when a number of UEs joining the V2X platoon exceeds a maximum number of allowed UEs in the V2X platoon, the UE may transmit, to the V2X CF or the V2X AS, a modification request message requesting a second transmission profile. The UE may then receive, from the V2X CF or the V2X AS, a modification response message that includes the second transmission profile. The second transmission profile may include one or more quality of service (QoS) parameters and one or more V2X specific parameters. Upon receiving the modification response message, the UE may determine, based on the second transmission profile, a second range to reconfigure the PC5 communication of the plurality of UEs associated with the V2X platoon.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A more detailed understanding may be had from the following description, given by way of example in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals in the figures indicate like elements, and wherein:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a system diagram illustrating an example communications system in which one or more disclosed embodiments may be implemented;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a system diagram illustrating an example wireless transmit/receive unit (WTRU) that may be used within the communications system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a system diagram illustrating an example radio access network (RAN) and an example core network (CN) that may be used within the communications system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> is a system diagram illustrating a further example RAN and a further example CN that may be used within the communications system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> according to an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of end-to-end communication between user equipments (UEs) in a vehicle to everything (V2X) platoon;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example vehicle to everything (V2X) architecture;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a signaling diagram illustrating an example high-level overview of vehicle to everything (V2X) platooning;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a signaling diagram illustrating an example platoon configuration and PC5 communication setup;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a signaling diagram illustrating an example of range adaptation based on a new transmission profile; and</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example procedure for range adaption based on a new transmission profile.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example communications system <b>100</b> in which one or more disclosed embodiments may be implemented.

The AP may have an access or an interface to a Distribution System (DS) or another type of wired/wireless network that carries traffic in to and/or out of the BSS. Traffic to STAs that originates from outside the BSS may arrive through the AP and may be delivered to the STAs. Traffic originating from STAs to destinations outside the BSS may be sent to the AP to be delivered to respective destinations. Traffic between STAs within the BSS may be sent through the AP, for example, where the source STA may send traffic to the AP and the AP may deliver the traffic to the destination STA. The traffic between STAs within a BSS may be considered and/or referred to as peer-to-peer traffic. The peer-to-peer traffic may be sent between (e.g., directly between) the source and destination STAs with a direct link setup (DLS). In certain representative embodiments, the DLS may use an 802.11e DLS or an 802.11z tunneled DLS (TDLS). A WLAN using an Independent BSS (IBSS) mode may not have an AP, and the STAs (e.g., all of the STAs) within or using the IBSS may communicate directly with each other.

The primary channel may be a fixed width (e.g., 20 MHz wide bandwidth) or a dynamically set width via signaling. The primary channel may be the operating channel of the BSS and may be used by the STAs to establish a connection with the AP. In certain representative embodiments, Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) may be implemented, for example in in 802.11 systems. For CSMA/CA, the STAs (e.g., every STA), including the AP, may sense the primary channel. If the primary channel is sensed/detected and/or determined to be busy by a particular STA, the particular STA may back off. One STA (e.g., only one station) may transmit at any given time in a given BSS.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">High Throughput (HT) STAs may use a 40 MHz wide channel for communication, for example, via a combination of the primary 20 MHz channel with an adjacent or nonadjacent 20 MHz channel to form a 40 MHz wide channel.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Very High Throughput (VHT) STAs may support 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, and/or 160 MHz wide channels. The 40 MHz, and/or 80 MHz, channels may be formed by combining contiguous 20 MHz channels. A 160 MHz channel may be formed by combining 8 contiguous 20 MHz channels, or by combining two non-contiguous 80 MHz channels, which may be referred to as an 80+80 configuration. For the 80+80 configuration, the data, after channel encoding, may be passed through a segment parser that may divide the data into two streams. Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) processing, and time domain processing, may be done on each stream separately. The streams may be mapped on to the two 80 MHz channels, and the data may be transmitted by a transmitting STA. At the receiver of the receiving STA, the above described operation for the 80+80 configuration may be reversed, and the combined data may be sent to the Medium Access Control (MAC).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Sub 1 GHz modes of operation are supported by 802.11af and 802.11ah. The channel operating bandwidths, and carriers, are reduced in 802.11af and 802.11ah relative to those used in 802.11n, and 802.11ac. 802.11af supports 5 MHz, 10 MHz and 20 MHz bandwidths in the TV White Space (TVWS) spectrum, and 802.11ah supports 1 MHz, 2 MHz, 4 MHz, 8 MHz, and 16 MHz bandwidths using non-TVWS spectrum. According to a representative embodiment, 802.11ah may support Meter Type Control/Machine-Type Communications, such as MTC devices in a macro coverage area. MTC devices may have certain capabilities, for example, limited capabilities including support for (e.g., only support for) certain and/or limited bandwidths. The MTC devices may include a battery with a battery life above a threshold (e.g., to maintain a very long battery life).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">WLAN systems, which may support multiple channels, and channel bandwidths, such as 802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11af, and 802.11ah, include a channel which may be designated as the primary channel. The primary channel may have a bandwidth equal to the largest common operating bandwidth supported by all STAs in the BSS. The bandwidth of the primary channel may be set and/or limited by a STA, from among all STAs in operating in a BSS, which supports the smallest bandwidth operating mode. In the example of 802.11ah, the primary channel may be 1 MHz wide for STAs (e.g., MTC type devices) that support (e.g., only support) a 1 MHz mode, even if the AP, and other STAs in the BSS support 2 MHz, 4 MHz, 8 MHz, 16 MHz, and/or other channel bandwidth operating modes. Carrier sensing and/or Network Allocation Vector (NAV) settings may depend on the status of the primary channel. If the primary channel is busy, for example, due to a STA (which supports only a 1 MHz operating mode), transmitting to the AP, the entire available frequency bands may be considered busy even though a majority of the frequency bands remains idle and may be available.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the United States, the available frequency bands, which may be used by 802.11ah, are from 902 MHz to 928 MHz.

A UE may run multiple V2X applications simultaneously, where each of the V2X application may be associated with a different V2X_Layer2_IDs or V2X group IDs.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Vehicle platooning (or UE platooning) may be one of the main use cases for V2X or enhanced V2X (eV2X). Vehicles (or UEs) of the same platoon may dynamically share information to support platoon operation. For example, a group of trucks heading the same destination may share information to support the delivery operation. Examples of the information may include, but are not limited to, distance between vehicles, relative speed, amount of gas for each vehicles and updates from RSU. Sharing of information may be supported by creating a specific V2X group or V2X platoon within a V2X application.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">All the vehicles (or UEs) in the platoon may receive periodic data from a leading vehicle (or leading UE), in order to carry on platoon operations. Platoon members may be provisioned by a V2X control function (V2X CF) and may interact with V2X application server (V2X AS). Platoon members may communicate with each other using PC5 communication, for example, proximity-based service (ProSe).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">A V2X AS may assign roles (e.g., leader, follower) to V2X platoon members. A platoon leader may be selected and the selected platoon leader may control the group (e.g., handles join, leave requests, or the like); other devices (or UEs) in the platoon may be assigned as followers. The platoon leader may collect information from the platoon and forward the information to the V2X AS. Examples of the information may include, but are not limited to, statistics, alarms, or requests. The platoon leader may share the information with platoon members, potentially from the V2X AS or other platoon members in other platoons. The platoon follower may send information/statistics/alarms to the platoon leader and other platoon members in other platoons.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As described above, UE-to-UE communication (or vehicle-to-vehicle communication) in a platoon may be done over PC5 communication, which is handled at an access stratum (AS) layer. Thus, the AS layer may need to be configured with a specific range, for example, based on the platoon characteristics such as the number of platoon members, distance between UEs, type of devices, or the like. This range configuration may be handled on the UE by the higher layer (e.g., a V2X layer), which is provisioned with this information. The AS layer may pass this range configuration to a BS (e.g., a gNB), which considers it for resource allocation. Moreover, a platoon may need to be dynamic such that the platoon members that form the platoon may join and leave the platoon group at any moment. This means that the PC5 communication may need to adapt to such dynamic behavior. Thus, dynamically adapting the PC5 communication (e.g., range) configuration based on platoon specific events may be needed. In order to dynamically adapt the PC5 communication configuration, it needs to be determined that: (1) who should handle this dynamic adaptation; (2) which procedure should be followed; and (3) how to obtain a new configuration.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Moreover, platooning may be based on multicast communication and V2X multicast communication over PC5, which is not currently supported in 5G. Thus, a procedure to setup a multicast communication needs to be determined.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Lastly, potential tracking of L2 IDs may be identified for unicast and multicast communications. In addition, a multicast group identifier may as well be tracked, thus privacy handling needs to address multicast communications identifiers. Thus, handling privacy of a multicast communication (i.e. peers tracking and multicast group tracking) needs to be determined.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Embodiments that dynamically adapt the PC5 communication (e.g., range) configuration based on platoon specific events are described herein. In such embodiments, a platoon leader (e.g., UE) may be assigned with additional responsibilities. For example, the platoon leader may request a new transmission profile under certain conditions to dynamically adapt PC5 communication. The platoon leader may handle mapping of transmission profile to a range value. The platoon leader may also take local decisions for the platoon for the purpose of a V2X AS.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example high-level overview <b>400</b> of vehicle to everything (V2X) platooning, which may be used in combination of any of other embodiments described herein. Platooning related parameters may be configured onto the UE <b>402</b><i>a</i>. These platooning related parameters may be pre-configured or received at startup and may be updated at any time by a V2X CF (or PCF) and/or a V2X AS. For example, at step <b>406</b>, the UE <b>402</b><i>a </i>may receive, from a V2X CF <b>455</b> (or PCF) or a V2X AS <b>450</b>, a V2X provisioning message that includes such parameters related to the V2X platooning. These parameters may be received by the V2X application <b>405</b> and/or V2X layer (also referred to as higher layer <b>410</b>) running on the V2X device (i.e. UE <b>402</b><i>a</i>). These parameters may be a list of V2X application identifiers that the device is authorized to run. For each application identifier, these parameters may include a list of V2X group identifiers for which the device is a member. For each group identifier, the parameters may include, but are not limited to, a role (e.g. platoon leader or follower) or the like. The parameters such as the maximum number of members allowed, transmission profile, priority, validity timer, validity location or the like may be configured on the selected leader only and/or for each group. The parameters such as a range mapping table and/or mapping of coverage to range may be configured on the selected leader only. In addition, configuration may have an associated validity time and/or validity location, allowing many configuration entries (active/passive) to be selected by the UE (or the higher layer <b>410</b>). At step <b>408</b>, the UE <b>402</b> may locally store and/or maintain these parameters including the transmission profile.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The transmission profile that includes QoS parameters (e.g., transmission rate, maximum end-to-end latency, etc.) may be extended with V2X specific parameters that are used to determine the range to be configured at the AS layer <b>415</b>. For example, the following V2X specific parameters may be included per platoon: device (e.g., platoon members) maximum size (e.g., length, width, height), distance between devices (e.g., front/back, on the side), platoon arrangement (e.g., single line, double line (i.e. two devices side-by-side), etc.), type of required communication (e.g., each device must be able to reach all other devices, each device must be able to reach at least one other device, etc.), number of platoon members, or the like.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">As described above, multiple V2X applications may run on a device and for each of these applications, many multicast groups (i.e. group identifiers) may exist, concurrently. The group identifiers may be unique per application, thus a combination of V2X application identifier and group identifier values may be used to uniquely identify each group. This combination may be referred to as a group ID. This combination may enable a peer UE <b>402</b><i>b </i>receiving data destined to a group ID to determine the associated multicast group and application.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Each group may have a different configuration and the communication layer (i.e. PC5 in this case) may adapt its behavior to such configuration on a per packet basis.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The higher layer <b>410</b> or V2X layer may handle the communication and configuration with the access stratum (AS) layer <b>415</b>. For this purpose, at step <b>415</b>, the higher layer <b>410</b> may map the transmission profile to AS layer parameters such as a range. For example, the higher layer <b>410</b> may determine the range to be configured on the AS layer <b>415</b> using: (1) the configured transmission profile to calculate the required coverage; and/or (2) the configured range mapping table specifying range values corresponding to the required coverage.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The required platoon coverage may be calculated by considering, for example, the number of members, their size, the platoon arrangement or the like. The obtained coverage value may be used with the range mapping table to determine the range that is needed. A range mapping table may have different forms. For example, it may contain a mapping of platoon coverage to a range (e.g., small, medium, large) to be configured at the AS layer <b>415</b>. The range mapping table may be preconfigured at the UE <b>402</b><i>a </i>or received from the V2X CF <b>455</b> (or PCF) or the V2X AS <b>450</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The AS layer <b>415</b> may maintain a groupID-to-range table for V2X group ID/communication parameters (e.g., range) mapping. At step <b>418</b>, the AS layer <b>415</b> may configure the RAN <b>404</b> with a list of configured group IDs and their associated range.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">A V2X CF <b>455</b> (or PCF) may also configure the RAN <b>404</b> with V2X group specific parameters or information about whether a certain UE is allowed to be a platoon leader or request PC5 resources for a particular transmission range. Specifically, at step <b>412</b>, the V2X CF <b>455</b> (or PCF) may send a RAN configuration request message to the AMF <b>482</b>. At step <b>413</b>, the AMF <b>482</b> may forward the configuration request message to the RAN <b>404</b>. The RAN configuration request message or the configuration request message may include a V2X group ID, role, maxim number of members, maximum range, priority level, or the like. Once the RAN <b>404</b> receives the configuration request message, the RAN <b>404</b> may locally store or maintain the contents of the configuration message such as a group ID and maximum range. When the UE <b>402</b><i>a </i>initiates the RAN configuration at step <b>418</b>, the RAN <b>404</b> may accept or reject the configuration requests from UEs based on these parameters. For example, the RAN <b>404</b> may accept the configuration request from the UE <b>402</b><i>a </i>if the range received from the UE <b>402</b><i>a </i>is less than the maximum range received from the V2X CF <b>455</b> (or PCF). Similarly, the RAN <b>404</b> may reject the configuration request from the UE <b>402</b><i>a </i>if the range received from the UE <b>402</b><i>a </i>is greater than the maximum range received from the V2X CF <b>455</b> (or PCF). The RAN <b>404</b> may reserve resource (e.g., channels)_when the configuration request from a UE <b>402</b><i>a </i>is accepted. The RAN <b>404</b> and AS layer <b>415</b> may enforce communication parameters (e.g., range) to the platoon members. Once the RAN configuration between the AS layer <b>415</b> and the RAN <b>404</b> are completed, the AS layer <b>415</b> and RAN <b>404</b> may apply the range for the V2X group associated with the range. For example, the V2X application <b>405</b> may send data with a group ID to the AS layer <b>415</b> at step <b>422</b>. The AS layer <b>415</b> may send the data with the group ID to the platoon member (i.e. UE <b>402</b><i>b</i>) within the range configured by the AS layer <b>415</b> and RAN <b>404</b> at step <b>426</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">A platoon role configured on the UEs <b>402</b><i>a</i>, <b>402</b><i>b </i>may determine the UE's behavior. For example, the UE <b>402</b><i>a </i>selected as the platoon leader may share configuration information with platoon members (e.g., UE <b>402</b><i>b</i>) and dynamically adapt the communication parameters when required, for example, by querying the V2X AS <b>415</b> for new parameters under certain conditions. For example, a platoon leader may receive a new transmission profile and map the transmission profile to a range. The platoon leader may then forward the result to the platoon members. Specifically, if the number of members joining the platoon reaches the maximum number of platoon members allowed at step <b>428</b>, the platoon leader (i.e. UE <b>402</b><i>a</i>) may request a new transmission profile from the V2X AS <b>450</b>, recalculate the range using the new transmission profile and the range mapping table, and configure the AS layer with a new range value associated with the group ID at step <b>430</b>. This new configuration may, for example, result in an increase (or decrease) of transmission power, modulation and coding scheme (MCS), number of retransmissions, or the like. In addition, the platoon leader (i.e. UE <b>402</b><i>a</i>) may configure the platoon members (e.g., UE <b>402</b><i>b</i>) with the new range value so that these platoon members (e.g., UE <b>402</b><i>b</i>) may also adapt their transmission by re-configuring their AS layer as described herein. In order to get the new transmission profile, the UE <b>402</b><i>a </i>may send a modification request message <b>432</b> to the V2X CF <b>455</b> (or PCF) or the V2X AS <b>450</b> at step <b>432</b> and receive a modification accept message <b>434</b> from the V2X CF <b>455</b> (or PCF) or the V2X AS <b>450</b> at step <b>434</b>. Once the new transmission profile is received, the UE <b>402</b><i>a </i>may locally maintain the new transmission profile with a group ID and a role at step <b>436</b>. The UE <b>402</b><i>a </i>may then determine a new range based on the new transmission profile and a range mapping table at step <b>438</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Roles in a platoon are described herein. As described above, a V2X AS may assign roles to V2X platoon members. The roles may be a leader or a follower. A platoon leader may be selected and control the group; other devices in the platoon may be followers. The platoon leader may interact with devices (i.e. followers) within the platoon and with a V2X CF (or PCF) and a V2X AS. The platoon leader may collect information from the platoon and forward this information to the V2X AS (e.g. statistics, alarms, requests, or the like). The platoon leader may share information with the platoon, potentially from the V2X AS or other platoon members. The platoon leader may receive a range mapping table and save it locally. The platoon leader may receive a transmission profile and save it locally. The platoon leader may fetch or request a new transmission profile when it is needed (e.g., when more than the number of allowed UEs are joining the group or after some validity period). The platoon member may calculate the required coverage for a specific platoon (e.g., using the transmission profile) and maps it to a specific range (e.g., using the range mapping table). The platoon leader may configure the AS layer with the range and groupID. The platoon leader may forward (e.g., multicasts over PC5) the range value to the platoon members. The platoon leader may function as a local decision maker (i.e. local decisions are forwarded to platoon members (followers)) and eventually to the V2X AS, for quick reaction (compared to going to the V2X CF and/or V2X AS) and to offload the network/V2X CF/V2X AS (local decisions/tasks). Examples of local decision may include, but not limited to: whether to increase the range because of the increased number of members, whether to increase the allowed number of members, whether to split a group which has become too big (i.e. too many members), and whether to select a platoon leader for the newly formed group (i.e. after the split).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The platoon follower may interact with a platoon leader (directly/indirectly) and other platoon members. The platoon follower may send information/statistics/alarms to a platoon leader. In addition, the platoon follower may receive communication related configuration from the platoon leader (e.g., range) and configure the AS layer accordingly.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example platoon configuration and PC5 communication setup <b>500</b>, which may be used in combination of any of other embodiments described herein. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, at step <b>506</b>, a V2X device (e.g., UE <b>502</b><i>a </i>or UE <b>502</b><i>b</i>) that has a V2X application <b>505</b>, a higher layer <b>510</b> (or V2X layer) and an AS layer <b>515</b> may initially attach to the network that has V2X capabilities are enabled. After the UE <b>502</b><i>a </i>is attached to the network, the first steps for platoon creation may be the platoon leader selection and its provisioning. This may be handled by the V2X AS <b>550</b> (e.g., for the platoon leader selection at step <b>508</b>) and the V2X CF (or PCF) (e.g., for the provisioning at step <b>512</b>). Specifically, the V2X CF <b>555</b> (or PCF) may send a V2X provisioning message to the UE <b>502</b><i>a </i>at step <b>512</b> after the V2X CF <b>555</b> (or PCF) is triggered by a configuration message from the V2X AS at step <b>511</b>. The V2X provisioning message may include, but is not limited to, the role (e.g., a leader, a member, or a follower), V2X application identifiers and V2X group identifiers. A more complete list may be provided as described above.

Examples of such factors may include, but are not limited to, UE's location, UE's capabilities and capacities, number of devices in the platoon, amount of time the UE has been/not been a leader, or information stored in unified data management (UDM).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The V2X device (e.g., UE <b>502</b><i>a </i>or UE <b>502</b><i>b</i>) may be provisioned by the V2X CF <b>555</b> (or PCF) at startup, during registration or UE configuration update procedures. The V2X device may register to the network and may provide identification information, its capabilities (e.g., V2X support, or V2X applications), its capacities (e.g., maximum range, speed, device type, or the like), location information, or the like. The V2X device may be provisioned with V2X specific parameters. The V2X device may also be configured later from the V2X AS <b>550</b> via the V1 interface.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The V2X device (e.g., UE <b>502</b><i>a </i>or UE <b>502</b><i>b</i>) may receive the complete configuration or a minimal configuration in the V2X provisioning message at step <b>512</b>. The V2X device (e.g., UE <b>502</b><i>a</i>) may locally store the configuration information such as a group ID and a role. If it is a minimal configuration, the V2X device may be configured with the role and the group ID. In the latter case, the V2X device (e.g., UE <b>502</b><i>a</i>) configured as a platoon leader may request a transmission profile, range mapping table, or the like when it is needed at step <b>522</b>. For example, the UE <b>502</b><i>a </i>(i.e. the platoon leader) may send a message requesting a transmission profile when a V2X application <b>505</b> is started, initialized, or running. This is illustrated at steps <b>524</b> and <b>526</b>, and steps <b>528</b> and <b>530</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, which are two alternatives for the UE <b>502</b><i>a </i>(i.e. the platoon leader) to fetch the transmission profile associated to the specified group. The steps <b>524</b> and <b>526</b> illustrates how the profile can be obtained from the V2X CF (or PCF). Specifically, the higher layer <b>510</b> (or V2X layer) may send a get request message that includes a group ID and a role to the V2X CF (or PCF) at step <b>524</b>. The higher layer <b>510</b> (or V2X layer) may receive a get response message that includes a maximum number of allowed members and a transmission profile from the V2X CF <b>555</b> (or PCF) and forward the transmission profile to the V2X application <b>505</b> at step <b>526</b>. Alternatively, the steps <b>528</b> and <b>530</b> illustrates how the profile may be obtained from the V2X AS <b>550</b>. Specifically, the V2X application <b>505</b> may send a get request message that includes a group ID and a role to the V2X AS at step <b>528</b>. The V2X application <b>505</b> may receive a get response message that includes a maximum number of allowed members and a transmission profile from the V2X AS <b>550</b> and forward the transmission profile to the higher layer <b>510</b> (or V2X layer) at step <b>530</b>.

At step <b>532</b>, the platoon leader (i.e. UE <b>502</b><i>a</i>) may locally store and maintain the group ID, the role, and the transmission profile. At step <b>534</b>, the platoon leader (i.e. UE <b>502</b><i>a</i>) may use this transmission profile to determine the range to be configured at the AS layer. The range may be determined based on a range mapping table that is associated with the transmission profile. Thus, the range may be different per a transmission profile. The range mapping table may be received or downloaded once from the network, but it may be received or downloaded multiple times from the network when it is needed. Alternative or additionally, the range mapping table may be pre-stored or predetermined in UEs <b>502</b><i>a</i>, <b>502</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The range mapping table may be only sent to the platoon leader. The range mapping table may be provisioned at startup or may be queried later by the platoon leader (e.g., UE <b>502</b><i>a</i>) (as the transmission profile). The range mapping table may have different forms or formats. For example, it may comprise a mapping of platoon coverage to range (e.g., small, medium, large) to be configured at the AS layer <b>515</b>. The platoon coverage may be obtained by calculating number of members, their size, arrangement, or the like. The obtained values may be used with the range mapping table. It may be configured only once. It is however possible for the V2X device (e.g., UE <b>502</b><i>a</i>, UE <b>502</b><i>b</i>) to fetch an updated range mapping table (e.g., to refresh it) in case the range mapping table has been downloaded a long time ago. The V2X CF <b>555</b> (or PCF) or V2X AS <b>550</b> may also decide to re-send the range mapping table with the transmission profile from time to time or when it's updated.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The platoon leader (e.g., UE <b>502</b><i>a</i>) may create the V2X platoon or group that comprises the platoon leader and platoon followers or members. For example, the platoon leader (e.g., UE <b>502</b><i>a</i>) may enable the multicast communication for a specific V2X group. As described above, PC5 communication is handled at the AS layer <b>515</b>. Thus, the platoon leader (e.g., UE <b>502</b><i>a</i>) may need to configure the AS layer <b>515</b> prior to the platoon creation and enablement of communication between platoon members.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The platoon leader (e.g., UE <b>502</b><i>a</i>) may configure the AS layer <b>515</b> with received configuration impacting the AS layer <b>515</b>, for example, range, priority and associated V2X group ID. The AS layer <b>515</b> may keep track of the received configuration and apply the specified range when transmitting data is related to the associated V2X group ID. In order to apply the range to the V2X platoon, the platoon leader (e.g., UE <b>502</b><i>a</i>) may need to configure the range with the RAN <b>504</b> and other platoon members (e.g., UE <b>502</b><i>b</i>). Specifically, once the range is determined at step <b>534</b>, the V2X application <b>505</b> and/or the higher layer <b>510</b> (or V2X layer) may send a set request message to the AS layer <b>515</b> at step <b>536</b> to configure the AS layer <b>515</b> with the range. This set request message may include the range and a group ID associated with the range. The AS layer <b>515</b> may then send another set request message to the RAN <b>504</b> (e.g., a gNB) with the range and the group ID at step <b>538</b>. If the range (i.e. requested range) received from the AS layer <b>515</b> is smaller than the maximum range configured or predetermined in the RAN <b>504</b>, the RAN <b>504</b> may accept the range (i.e. requested range) and allocate resources (e.g., channels) for the UE <b>502</b><i>a </i>at step <b>540</b>.

If the range (i.e. requested range) received from the AS layer <b>515</b> is greater than the maximum range configured or predetermined in the RAN <b>504</b>, the RAN <b>504</b> may send a set response message to the UE <b>502</b><i>a </i>indicating that the requested range is not accepted at step <b>542</b>. The set response message transmitted from the RAN <b>504</b> may also include a group ID, a range (e.g., accepted range, rejected range, or maximum range allowed in the RAN <b>604</b>), and/or an indicator indicating the acceptance or rejection of the range. The RAN <b>504</b> (e.g., gNB) may locally store or maintain the group ID, the maximum range, the requested range, or the like at step <b>546</b>. Once the AS layer <b>515</b> receives the set response message from the RAN <b>604</b>, the AS layer <b>515</b> may send another set response message to the higher layer <b>510</b> (or V2X layer) and the V2X application <b>505</b> with the range (e.g., accepted range, rejected range, or maximum range allowed in the RAN <b>604</b>) at step <b>544</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">As described above, a V2X device (e.g., UE <b>502</b><i>b</i>) may be configured as a member of multiple V2X groups and each group may have different communication requirements (i.e. a different configuration). In this case, there can be a single same platoon leader (e.g., UE <b>502</b><i>a</i>) for each group or multiple different platoon leaders for each group. To support per group configuration, the AS layer <b>515</b> may maintain a groupID-to-range table for V2X group ID vs specific configuration (e.g., range). The configuration may be applied on a per-packet basis (e.g., using the groupID-to-range table). As well, a different leader for each group may be selected or a specific device may be selected as the leader for many platoons. In any case, each device may be configured with a role per platoon.

For example, they may configure their AS layer with minimal parameters (e.g. pre-configured generic range and group ID) and they may listen on PC5 for multicast messages from the platoon leader (e.g., UE <b>502</b><i>a</i>). Once communication is established (i.e. followers have received a message for the group ID), these devices (i.e. followers) may contact the platoon leader (e.g., UE <b>502</b><i>a</i>) to join the group. The platoon leader (e.g., UE <b>502</b><i>a</i>) may configure the followers with communication parameters such as range specific to the group ID or the like. The followers may also configure their AS layer with the received parameters such as specific range and group ID. For example before the UE <b>502</b><i>b </i>become a member of the V2X platoon where the UE <b>502</b><i>a </i>is the platoon leader, the UE <b>502</b><i>b </i>may request the platoon leader (i.e. UE <b>502</b><i>a</i>) to join the V2X group as a follower at step <b>556</b>. The platoon leader (i.e. US <b>502</b><i>a</i>) may accept or reject the request. If the request is accepted, the platoon leader (i.e. UE <b>502</b><i>a</i>) may send the range to the UE <b>502</b><i>b </i>for this V2X group. The UE <b>502</b><i>b </i>may configure its AS layer with the range.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In an embodiment, the multicast communication may be initiated by the platoon leader sending a message (e.g., advertisement message) using the platoon leaders L2 ID as the source L2 ID and the destination L2 ID is set to the group ID. This message may specify the required QoS parameters that the UE who want to join needs to support. There may be no QoS parameters negotiation. The advertisement message may be sent by the platoon leader using a configured (in the UE or by the V2X CF or PCF) broadcast layer 2 destination ID. Interested V2X UE may use this broadcast layer 2 ID to tune to the PC5 broadcast information. The PC5 broadcast information may provide information about the source/destination ID corresponding to particular V2X group/multicast communication. It should be noted that if the platoon leader decides to change the group ID of the multicast communication, it may need to update the information sent on the broadcast PC5 channel. The source/destination ID broadcasted using the broadcast PC5 group ID may also be used by the V2X UEs (e.g., follower UEs) to establish the unicast link with the platoon leader if needed.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">All devices registered as followers (e.g., platoon members) may listen for this specific destination L2 ID. The received message may be passed up to the V2X layer, which is able to decode the message since it is configured with the security related parameters (e.g., keys) that makes PC5 communication secured.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The followers that want to contact the platoon leader (e.g., to join the group) may use their own L2 ID as the source L2 ID and the leaders L2 ID as the destination L2 ID. The leader's L2 ID may be learned from the multicast message. The group ID may be specified in a field of the join request. The leader may save the follower's L2 ID and may use it if needed for unicast communication. For example, if the platoon leader wants to configure a follower as the new leader, it may directly contact the follower using its L2 ID.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The required/advertised QoS parameters for a specific group ID may change, for example, if new QoS parameters are received as part of the transmission profile update procedure (i.e. Get REQ/Get RSP as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). In this case, a new advertisement message may be multicast, including the new required QoS parameters. All members may need to adapt to the new QoS parameters.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">For privacy reasons (e.g., to avoid tracking an L2 ID), the unicast (or destination) L2 ID of the platoon leader and followers may need to be changed periodically for ongoing communication. For multicast communication, since the group ID is used as the destination, the potential tracking issue may also apply to this case. The multicast identifier (i.e. group ID) may also need to be changed periodically. Thus, a method for changing the multicast identifier (group ID) needs to be determined.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Embodiments for a platoon leader and follower L2 ID change are described herein.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">The platoon leader may change its L2 ID periodically (e.g., based on time, location, request from upper layer or peer UE, or the like). The platoon leader may generate a new L2 ID and multicast it to its followers. A platoon leader may use a distinct L2 ID per multicast group. If the same L2 ID is used for many multicast groups, then the new L2 ID may be multicast to all these groups. The leader may multicast its L2 ID few times to make sure all followers received it or may request a response from the followers. A specific time to apply this new L2 ID (i.e. validity time) may be specified to ensure that all followers will use the new L2 ID at the same time.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Followers may change their L2 ID as well periodically (e.g., same triggers as leader). The follower may generate a new L2 ID and send it to the leader using the join message. The current L2 ID may be specified as well as the new L2 ID. The leader receiving this join message may know that the new L2 ID needs to be kept and used in following communication. A join acknowledgement may be sent back to the follower still using the old L2 ID as the destination L2 ID. Further communication may use the new L2 ID. Followers that are allowed to multicast to the group and receive unicast messages from other members may use the multicast method described for the leader (above) to let the members know their new L2 ID.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Embodiments for group ID change are described herein.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">All followers (i.e. devices that have successfully joined the multicast group) may be configured by the platoon leader (or V2X CF) with a new group ID, possibly security parameters, and upper layer identifier that may be applied at a specific time as an example. All followers and platoon leader may then start using this new configuration at the same time and stop using the previous group ID for communication. To make sure that all devices received the new group ID, the leader may multicast it multiple times or may request a response from the followers.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The original information (e.g., group ID and security parameters) may be still maintained at the V2X CF and/or V2X AS and at the leader. Devices may be still provisioned with this information.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">A multicast message using the original group ID (with related security parameters and possibly upper layer identifier) may continue to be sent periodically by the platoon leader in case devices listening to the group ID would like to join. Devices that want to join may use the provisioned information and once the join request is accepted, these devices may be reconfigured by the platoon leader with the new parameters, on a secured link. These new followers may then immediately start using the new group ID and security parameters, and receive the multicast messages.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example 600 of range adaptation based on a new transmission profile, which may be used in combination of any of other embodiments described herein.

In case where the number of UEs joining the V2X platoon (or group) does not reach the maximum number allowed (or a threshold is not reached), the platoon leader <b>602</b><i>a </i>may not request a new transmission profile.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Specifically, at step <b>608</b> or step <b>614</b>, the platoon leader <b>602</b><i>a </i>may query the V2X CF <b>658</b> (or PCF) or V2X AS <b>650</b> to obtain a new transmission profile. For example, when the number of UEs joining the V2X platoon exceeds the maximum number, the V2X application <b>605</b> may send a request to the higher layer <b>610</b> (or V2X layer) indicating that the threshold is reached at step <b>603</b>.

At step <b>622</b>, the UE <b>602</b><i>a</i>, the platoon leader, may then determine the range associated with the new transmission profile and configure its AS layer <b>615</b> with the new range value. For example, the UE <b>602</b><i>a </i>may calculate a coverage value based on the new transmission profile. The UE <b>602</b><i>a </i>may then compare the coverage value with a range mapping table, and determine, based on the new range mapping table, the range associated with the new transmission profile. Specifically, the V2X application <b>605</b> or the higher layer <b>610</b> (or V2X layer) may calculate the coverage that is needed, by considering the current number of members, their size, the platoon arrangement, the distance between the devices, or the like. These parameters may be specified in the transmission profile as described above. Once the required coverage is calculated, the higher layer <b>610</b> may use the range mapping table to figure out which range value should be configured at the AS layer <b>615</b>. For example, a platoon may comprise devices of large size (e.g., trucks with long van), maximum 6 members, arrangement of platoon 1&#xd7;1, or the like. These parameters may map to a range value of medium (e.g., range value=medium). If a new transmission profile increases the maximum number of members to 10 as an example, then the new range value obtained may be large (e.g., range value=large). In another example, a platoon may comprise devices of small size (drone), maximum 20 members, arrangement of platoon 4&#xd7;5, or the like. This may map to a range value of small (e.g., range value=small). The platoon leader <b>602</b><i>a </i>may save the new range locally with the associated group ID. It is noted that the range mapping table may be predetermined in the UE <b>602</b><i>a </i>or received from the V2X CF <b>655</b> (or PCF) or the V2X AS <b>650</b> during the V2X provisioning procedure ad described above.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Once the range is determined, the V2X application <b>605</b> or the higher layer <b>610</b> (or V2X layer) may send a set request message to the AS layer <b>615</b> at step <b>630</b> to configure the AS layer <b>615</b>. This set request message may include the range and a group ID associated with the range. The AS layer <b>615</b> may then send another set request message to the RAN <b>604</b> (e.g., a gNB) with the range and the group ID at step <b>632</b>. If the range (i.e. requested range) received from the AS layer <b>615</b> is smaller than the maximum range configured or predetermined in the RAN <b>604</b>, the RAN <b>604</b> may accept the range (i.e. requested range) and allocate resources (e.g., channels) for the UE <b>602</b><i>a </i>or the V2X group associated with the UE <b>602</b><i>a </i>at step <b>634</b>. The RAN <b>604</b> may send a set response message to the UE <b>602</b><i>a </i>indicating which resources (e.g., channels) the UE <b>602</b><i>a </i>or the V2X platoon may use at step <b>636</b>. If the range (i.e. requested range) received from the AS layer <b>615</b> is greater than the maximum range configured or predetermined in the RAN <b>604</b>, the RAN <b>604</b> may send a set response message to the UE <b>602</b><i>a </i>indicating that the requested range is not accepted at step <b>636</b>.

The transmission profile may include quality of service (QoS) parameters, V2X specific parameters, or the like. The QoS parameters may include a transmission rate, maximum end-to-end latency, or the like. The V2X specific parameters may include, but are not limited to, a maximum size of a UE, a distance between UEs in the V2X platoon, an arrangement of the V2X platoon, a type of required communication between UEs in the V2X platoon, a number of UEs in the V2X platoon and a maximum number of UEs in the V2X platoon.

Specifically, the UE may calculate a coverage value using the QoS parameters and/or the V2X specific parameters in the transmission profile. Once the UE obtained the coverage value, the UE may compare the coverage value with data in the range mapping table and determine, based on the range mapping table, the first range. The range determined based on the range mapping table may indicate small range, medium range, or large range. Examples of parameters from the transmission profile and used to calculate the range may include, but are not limited to, the distance that a signal can reach within a platoon, the distance between devices within a platoon (e.g., from the first vehicle to the last vehicle), a number of device in a platoon, a transmission power. The term range and transmission range may be interchangeably used throughout this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Upon determining the first range, the UE may transmit, to a base station (BS) associated with the RAN, a request message that includes the first range and an indicator indicating that resource allocation associated with the first range is requested to the RAN.

The response message may include the first range, the resource allocation associate with the first range, and an indicator indicating that the resource allocation associated with the first range is accepted by the RAN. The UE may then transmit, to the members of the V2X platoon, the first range and each member in the platoon may configure its respective PC5 communication with the received range. Specifically, each member may configure its respective AS layer to adapt the coverage of the V2X platoon associated with the first range.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Once the PC5 communication of the V2X platoon is configured with the first range, at step <b>715</b>, the UE may monitor for one or more V2X specific events that may trigger the reconfiguration of the first range.

If one or more V2X specific events have not occurred, the UE may keep monitoring the V2X specific events at step <b>715</b>. For example, when a number of UEs joining the V2X platoon exceeds a maximum number of allowed UEs in the V2X platoon (i.e. V2X specific event occurred), the UE may transmit, to the V2X CF (or PCF) or the V2X AS, a modification request message requesting a second transmission profile at step <b>725</b>. The UE may then receive, from the V2X CF (or PCF) or the V2X AS, a modification response message that includes the second transmission profile at step <b>730</b>. Similar to the first transmission profile, the second transmission profile may include one or more quality of service (QoS) parameters and one or more V2X specific parameters. The one or more V2X specific parameters in the second transmission profile may comprise a maximum size of a UE, a distance between UEs in the V2X platoon, an arrangement of the V2X platoon, a type of required communication between UEs in the V2X platoon, a number of UEs in the V2X platoon and a maximum number of UEs in the V2X platoon.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Upon receiving the modification response message, at step <b>735</b>, the UE may determine, based on the second transmission profile, a second range that is used to reconfigure the PC5 communication of other UEs (e.g., followers or members) associated with the V2X platoon. Specifically, the UE may calculate the coverage value using the QoS parameters and/or the V2X specific parameters in the second transmission profile. Once the UE obtained the new coverage value, the UE may compare the coverage value with data in the range mapping table. The UE may then determine, based on the range mapping table, a new range (or second range). The new range determined based on the range mapping table may indicate small range, medium range, or large range Examples of the V2X parameters specified in the transmission profile may include, but are not limited to, the distance that a signal can reach within a platoon, the distance between devices within a platoon (e.g., from the first vehicle to the last vehicle), a number of device in a platoon, a transmission power.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Once the new range is determined, the UE may transmit, to the base station (BS) associated with the RAN, a request message that includes the new range and an indicator indicating that resource allocation associated with the new range is requested to the RAN at step <b>740</b>. The RAN may compare the new range to a maximum range that is predetermined or configured by the V2X CF (or PCF). If the RAN accepts the request (i.e. the new range is less than the maximum range), the RAN may allocate resources (e.g., channels) for the V2X platoon. The RAN (e.g., BS) may then send a response message to the UE and the UE may receive the response message at step <b>745</b>. The response message may include the new range, the resource allocation associated with the new range, and an indicator indicating that the resource allocation associated with the new range is accepted by the RAN. The UE may then transmit, to the members of the V2X platoon, the new range at step <b>750</b>. Each member in the platoon may configure its respective PC5 communication. Specifically, each member may configure its respective AS layer to adapt the PC5 communication of the V2X platoon associated with the second range.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The RAN may need to be configured with a range for resource allocation. This configuration may be received from the V2X CF (or PCF) via the AMF. As described above, the range may be applicable per platoon. Thus, the associated group ID may be specified as well. The RAN may maintain and enforce this range. The V2X CF (or PCF) may also configure other parameters such as priority level. The RAN configuration from the V2X CF (or PCF) and UE side is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The RAN may be configured (e.g., as part of the UE profile at the RAN) with the maximum allowed range and may adapt its transmission with the value specified by the platoon leader. For example, the platoon leader may be configured with a range value smaller than the allowed maximum range value configured at the RAN. The platoon leader may configure its AS layer with its range value, which may then configure the RAN with this same value. This value may then be used for PC5 communication. The platoon leader may eventually request a range increase (or decrease) which goes up to the RAN. Examples of such triggers may be members joining/leaving the group. The RAN may accept/reject the request depending of its maximum allowed range configuration (previously received from the V2X CF or PCF) and potentially other factors such as load. The RAN may return the applied range to the AS layer, which forwards the information to the higher layer (i.e. V2X layer) and up to V2X application.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Platoon splitting and merging are described herein. A V2X AS may decide to split a platoon for various reasons. For example, a platoon may be split when the platoon is becoming too big (i.e. too many members), thereby requiring a very large range. The platoon may be split when some devices may go to different final destinations although a portion of the route is the same (i.e. the whole group may move together for some time and then the group is split when specific location is reached). The platoon may be split for temporary split and merge, (i.e. sub-groups are expected to eventually leave the main group and potentially merging back). The platoon may be split due to hierarchical leadership roles: one group leader and many sub-groups leaders. For example, a group of trucks of different formats is subdivided into two groups. Each group may be configured to stop at a gas station. However, the configuration is different for each group. Specifically, trucks with bigger gas tanks stop later while the trucks with smaller gas tanks stop sooner and more often. Trucks may merge back again somewhere on the route after fueling is done.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Splitting may be done by sending a new configuration to platoon members. A device may need to be selected as the platoon leader for the new platoon. Devices selected to be in this new platoon may be configured with the new group ID. A validity time may be associated with this new configuration to make sure that all members apply the new configuration at the same time.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">The former platoon, which is now smaller, may be reconfigured to, for example, adjust the maximum number of members. The platoon leader may recalculate the required coverage/range once multiple devices have left the group and then reconfigure the AS layer and group members.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">Local decision handled by a platoon leader is described herein. The platoon leader may be configured with a certain level of autonomy. For example, it may be configured to wait for configuration from the V2X CF (or PCF) or V2X AS and then apply and/or forward it to platoon members. Alternatively or additionally, the platoon leader may be configured with local decision authority. This means that the platoon leader may be allowed to take local decisions to be applied immediately to the platoon. The V2X AS may be informed of the decisions and triggering events and may eventually revert or confirm the local decisions.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Authority for local decisions may be allowed to quickly react to certain conditions.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The platoon leader may also be configured to decide or allocate the lead role to another device based on time as a leader, capabilities, load, or the like as the platoon size changes.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">For example, when a group is becoming too large, the platoon leader that is allowed to take local decisions may decide to increase the range while waiting for the V2X AS decision. The platoon leader may configure its AS layer with the new range value and advertise this new value to the platoon members for their own AS layer configuration. The V2X AS is also informed of this new configuration.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In order to achieve this functionality, the platoon leader may be configured with multiple transmission profiles, for example, one profile to be used now and the other profile for increased or decreased number of members. The platoon leader may keep track of the number of members and apply a local decision, for example, when the maximum number of members is reached.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">Later, the V2X AS may decide to maintain the leader's decision, further increasing the range or split the platoon as examples. Specifically, the V2X AS may decide to split a platoon as described above. This may be done by sending a new configuration to the platoon members. A device needs to be selected as the leader for a new platoon. The device selected to be a leader in the new platoon may be configured with the new group ID. A validity time may be associated with this new configuration to make sure that all members will apply the new configuration at the same time.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">Although features and elements are described above in particular combinations, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that each feature or element can be used alone or in any combination with the other features and elements.
