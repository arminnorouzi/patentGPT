This discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the present disclosure. Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Transmitters and/or receivers are commonly included in various electronic devices, and more particularly, portable electronic communication devices, such as phones (e.g., mobile and cellular phones, cordless phones, personal assistance devices), computers (e.g., laptops, tablet computers), internet connectivity routers (e.g., WI-H&#xae; routers or modems), radios, televisions, or any of various other stationary or handheld devices, to enable communication. In some electronic devices, a transmitter and a receiver are combined to form a transceiver. For ease of discussion, transceivers are discussed in the present disclosure, but it should be understood that the following descriptions may apply individually to receivers and/or transmitters (e.g., that may not be included in a transceiver).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Transceivers may transmit and/or receive wireless signals by way of an antenna coupled to the transceiver. Specifically, a wireless transceiver may wirelessly communicate voice and/or data signals over a network channel or other medium (e.g., air) to and from one or more external wireless devices. Wireless data communication may involve transmitting and/or receiving carrier signals (e.g., radio frequency (RF) signals) indicative of the data. By way of example, an electronic device may include a transceiver to transmit and/or receive the RF signals over one or more frequencies of a wireless network (e.g., an RF network). Transceivers may be installed on a printed circuit board (PCB) with signal processing circuitry associated with processing a carrier signal before and/or after wireless transmission into the air. The transceiver may include a variety of circuitry, including, for example, processing circuitry to modulate a data signal onto a carrier wave to generate an RF signal. The transmitter of the transceiver may also include power circuitry, such as a power amplifier (e.g., amplifying circuitry), to increase a power level of the RF signal so that the transmitter may effectively transmit the RF signal into the air via an antenna. Some electronic devices may have circuitry of the transceiver disposed on different, stacked PCBs.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The information to be transmitted is typically modulated onto the RF signal prior to wireless transmission. In other words, the information to be transmitted is typically embedded in an envelope of a carrier signal that has a frequency in the RF range. The envelope is typically referred to as the baseband signal. To embed or extract the information in or from the envelope of the carrier signal, processing may be performed on a received RF signal according to transmission parameters. For example, an electronic device (e.g., user equipment) may demodulate the RF signal (e.g., to remove the carrier signal) to recover the embedded information in the envelope based at least in part on a frequency of the received RF signal.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, a transceiver may enable an electronic device to communicate with an RF network provider via a base station of the wireless network. The transmission parameters and other settings, such as information used to authenticate an electronic device to the RF network, may be provided to the electronic device by way of a subscriber identification module (SIM) card. The RF network may be a wireless network, such as WI-H&#xae;, that facilitates the wireless transmission of information between the electronic device and the RF network provider. The RF network may communicate with the electronic device using information associated with the SIM card and may sometimes perform this communication via a frequency band that overlaps with a frequency band used for device-to-device communications. These device-to-device communications may be exchanged locally and/or over an unregistered network (e.g., a wireless network that an electronic device does not register to before communication) rather than via communication with the RF network. In some cases, the device-to-device communications may use an ultra-wideband (UWB) frequency band and/or UWB communications associated with UWB services accessible by the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, a first electronic device may wirelessly transmit data to an RF network (e.g., a fifth generation (5G) New Radio (NR)) using a first frequency band and a second electronic device may transmit a device-to-device communication to a third electronic device using a second frequency band. In some cases, the first frequency band at least partially interferes with the second frequency band (e.g., overlapping in eligible transmission frequencies of the frequencies bands). For example, the first frequency band may correspond to an NR frequency band and the second frequency band may correspond to a UWB frequency band. It is noted that for purposes of this disclosure, the NR frequency band may correspond to frequencies between 7 gigahertz (GHz) and 25 GHz (e.g., less than 25 GHz, greater than 7 GHz, between 7.125 GHz and 24.25 GHz) and/or the ultra-wideband (UWB) frequency band may correspond frequencies between 3 GHz and 11 GHz (e.g., between 3.1 GHz and 10.6 GHz, between 6.24 GHz and 8.736 GHz, between 3.55 GHz and 3.7 GHz). As such, when the RF network and the first electronic device communicate on the first frequency band while the second electronic device and the third electronic device communicate on the second frequency band, either or both communications may be compromised and/or experience interference due to the using first frequency band overlapping with the second frequency band.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A summary of certain embodiments disclosed herein is set forth below. It should be understood that these aspects are presented merely to provide the reader with a brief summary of these certain embodiments and that these aspects are not intended to limit the scope of this disclosure. Indeed, this disclosure may encompass a variety of aspects that may not be set forth below.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">To avoid or reduce interference between a first electronic device communicating with a radio frequency network (e.g., a fifth generation (5G) network, a New Radio (NR) network, a fourth generation (4G) network, a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network), a third generation (3G) network) on a first frequency band and a second electronic device communicating with a third electronic device on a second frequency band (e.g., an ultra-wideband (UWB) frequency band), systems, devices, and methods are disclosed that cause a base station to temporarily mute communications on the radio frequency network to permit a duration of time during which the second and third electronic devices may communicate on the second frequency band. The base station may generate muting configurations that define muting durations (e.g., period or durations of time during which communications on using the first frequency band are stopped or paused to permit communications using the second frequency band). In this way, a muting configuration may define when radio frequency communication circuitry (RF circuitry) of the first electronic device is to communicate using a first type of communication (e.g., on the first frequency band) and when the RF circuitry of the second electronic device and/or the third electronic device is to communicate using a second type of communication (e.g., on the second frequency band). The first electronic device, the second electronic device, the third electronic device, and/or the base station may each operate in accordance with the muting durations to coordinate otherwise interfering communications (e.g., communications transmitted via at least partially overlapping frequency bands).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Various refinements of the features noted above may exist in relation to various aspects of the present disclosure. Further features may also be incorporated in these various aspects as well. These refinements and additional features may exist individually or in any combination. For instance, various features discussed below in relation to one or more of the illustrated embodiments may be incorporated into any of the above-described aspects of the present disclosure alone or in any combination. The brief summary presented above is intended to familiarize the reader with certain aspects and contexts of embodiments of the present disclosure without limitation to the claimed subject matter.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

introducing elements of various embodiments of the present disclosure, the articles &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to mean that there are one or more of the elements. The terms &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having&#x201d; are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements. Additionally, it should be understood that references to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; of the present disclosure are not intended to be interpreted as excluding the existence of additional embodiments that also incorporate the recited features.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Various processes may be used to generate muting configurations. The processes may apply to a variety of electronic devices. For example, a first electronic device may wirelessly transmit data to an RF network (e.g., a fifth generation (5G) New Radio (NR)) using a first frequency band and a second electronic device may transmit a device-to-device communication to a third electronic device using a second frequency band. The electronic devices may communicate according to communication configurations and a base station of the RF network may communicate according to a communication configuration generated based at least in part on a muting configuration. The base station may use muting durations defined by the muting configuration to provide the second electronic device and the third electronic device a period of time during which to communicate using the second frequency band. It is noted that in some cases the first electronic device may communicate using the second frequency band with the second electronic device and/or with the third electronic device. These processes bring certain advantages to operation, as is described herein. With the foregoing in mind, a general description of suitable electronic devices that may include such a transceiver is provided below.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Turning first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an electronic device <b>10</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure may include, among other things, one or more of processor(s) <b>12</b>, memory <b>14</b>, nonvolatile storage <b>16</b>, a display <b>18</b>, input structures <b>22</b>, an input/output (I/O) interface <b>24</b>, a network interface <b>26</b>, a transceiver <b>28</b>, and a power source <b>30</b>.

The transceiver <b>28</b> may include circuitry useful in both wirelessly receiving and wirelessly transmitting signals (e.g., data signals, wireless data signals, wireless carrier signals, RF signals), such as a transmitter and/or a receiver. Indeed, in some embodiments, the transceiver <b>28</b> may include a transmitter and a receiver combined into a single unit, or, in other embodiments, the transceiver <b>28</b> may include a transmitter separate from a receiver. The transceiver <b>28</b> may transmit and receive RF signals to support voice and/or data communication in wireless applications such as, for example, PAN networks (e.g., BLUETOOTH&#xae;), WLAN networks (e.g., 802.11x WI-FI&#xae;), WAN networks (e.g., 3G, 4G, 5G, NR, and LTE&#xae; and LTE-LAA cellular networks), WIMAX&#xae; networks, mobile WIMAX&#xae; networks, ADSL and VDSL networks, DVB-T&#xae; and DVB-H&#xae; networks, UWB networks, and so forth.

By way of example, the wearable electronic device <b>10</b>E, which may include a wristband <b>43</b>, may be an Apple Watch&#xae; by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, California. However, in other embodiments, the wearable electronic device <b>10</b>E may include any wearable electronic device such as, a wearable exercise monitoring device (e.g., pedometer, accelerometer, heart rate monitor), or other device by another manufacturer.

With the foregoing in mind, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a block diagram of a radio frequency (RF) network provided via a base station <b>52</b> communicating with a first electronic device <b>10</b>F and a second electronic device <b>10</b>G (e.g., NR communications), where the second electronic device <b>120</b>G may communicate using device-to-device communications (e.g., UWB communications) with a third electronic device <b>10</b>H, according to embodiments of the present disclosure. The electronic devices <b>10</b> (e.g., electronic device <b>10</b>F, electronic device <b>10</b>G, electronic device <b>10</b>H) may each have the transceiver <b>28</b> that includes circuitry for a receiver <b>54</b> and for a transmitter <b>56</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the electronic device <b>10</b>F includes the receiver <b>54</b> and the transmitter <b>56</b> in the transceiver <b>28</b>. However, it is noted that an electronic device <b>10</b> may include the receiver <b>54</b> and the transmitter <b>56</b> as separate from the transceiver <b>28</b>, and thus not include the transceiver <b>28</b>. Further, the various functional blocks shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> may include hardware elements (including circuitry), software elements (including computer code stored on a computer-readable medium) or a combination of both hardware and software elements. It should also be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is merely one example of a particular implementation and is intended to illustrate the types of components that may be present. As such, functional blocks may be added or omitted, and their arrangement within the RF network and/or the electronic devices <b>10</b> may be modified. It is also noted that, although the depicted example includes one base station <b>52</b> communicatively coupled to electronic device <b>10</b>F, and the electronic device <b>10</b>G communicatively coupled to the electronic device <b>10</b>H and/or the electronic device <b>10</b>F, this is one example arrangement and other arrangements may be permissible. For example, in some embodiments, electronic device <b>10</b>G and electronic device <b>10</b>F may be a same electronic device <b>10</b> communicating with the electronic device <b>10</b>H and/or additional electronic devices <b>10</b> may communicate with the electronic device <b>10</b>G using device-to-device communications.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The electronic devices <b>10</b> may each include a cell phone (or other user equipment) that communicates with other electronic devices and/or a radio frequency (RF) network provider via the RF network. The electronic devices <b>10</b> may communicate over the RF network using data packets transmitted to and/or received from the base station <b>52</b>. Each electronic device <b>10</b> may include a subscriber identification module (SIM) card that enables registration to the RF network provider. For example, information stored on the SIM card may be used for encryption and/or decryption operations of data packets transmitted between the base station and a respective electronic device <b>10</b>, where the base station <b>52</b> may use a proprietary encryption or decryption method similar to other base stations of the RF network provider and used by the electronic device <b>10</b> via the SIM card. Each base station <b>52</b> may include an electronic system or device (e.g., similar to electronic device <b>10</b>), and thus may include memory <b>14</b>, displays <b>18</b>, processors <b>12</b>, I/O interfaces <b>24</b>, network interfaces <b>26</b>, transceivers <b>28</b>, or the like (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), for performing processing operations associated with maintaining the RF network and for communicating with one or more electronic devices <b>10</b>. Furthermore, the base station <b>52</b> may include one or more systems that enable parallel operations. For example, the base station <b>52</b> may include duplicated transceiver <b>28</b> systems to permit parallel operations (e.g., to enable communications from different electronic devices <b>10</b> to be received at least partially at the same time)</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The base station <b>52</b> may use different transmission frequencies or frequency bands when exchanging data with the electronic devices <b>10</b> via the RF network. Examples of the RF network may include Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) radio access networks (GRAN, GERAN), Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS) radio access networks (UTRAN), and Long Term Evolution (LTE&#xae;) radio access networks (E-UTRAN), and New Radio (NR). In some cases, the base station <b>52</b> may receive preferred transmission bands from the electronic device <b>10</b> and may select a transmission frequency or band from the preferred transmission bands, which may include one or more frequencies as part of a frequency range. The electronic device <b>10</b> may, in turn, receive the transmission frequency or band from the base station <b>52</b> and use the transmission frequency or band in communicating with the radio access network. In some cases, the electronic device <b>10</b> may receive a transmission band from the base station <b>52</b> and select a transmission frequency from the transmission band.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Electronic devices <b>10</b> may communicate with base stations <b>52</b> to receive or transmit data (e.g., data packets, communications), such as data associated with receiving or transmitting a phone call, a text message, browsing the Internet, or the like. To do so, the receiver <b>54</b> of an electronic device <b>10</b> may receive an input signal from the base station <b>52</b> that may be processed and/or modified. The input signal may be wirelessly received via an antenna <b>58</b> operably connected to the receiver <b>54</b>. The input signal may include data transmitted via a carrier waveform. The carrier waveform may be modulated to store the data, and thus data may be retrieved from the input signal for use by the electronic device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some cases, the electronic device <b>10</b> may generate data for transmission to the base station <b>52</b>. The transmitter <b>56</b> may use similar but reverse modulation and amplification operations as the receiver <b>54</b> to transmit the generated data as an RF signal to the base station <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The receiver <b>54</b> and/or the transmitter <b>56</b> may include circuitry that processes the input signal. The receiver <b>54</b> may include a low noise power amplifier (LNA), an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), a baseband filter, or the like, to process the input signal. For example, a LNA may receive a relatively low-power signal from the antenna <b>58</b> and increase its magnitude without significantly increasing noise of the input signal, generating a modified input signal. The receiver <b>54</b> may sometimes regulate power supplied to the LNA according to average power tracking of the modified input signal or envelope tracking of the input signal. Signals output from the LNA or other circuitry of the receiver <b>54</b> may be transmitted to an ADC for additional processing. The ADC may use any suitable conversion method to convert the output into digital data usable by the electronic device <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, a baseband filter may receive an output from the ADC and perform additional processing on the initial data recovered from the carrier waveform. The transmitter <b>56</b> may work in a similar but reverse fashion. For example, data to be transmitted to the base station <b>52</b> may be modulated onto a carrier signal, amplified for transmission to the base station <b>52</b>, and received by the base station <b>52</b> for use.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Electronic devices <b>10</b> communicating with the base station <b>52</b> may use wireless RF signals transmitted at frequencies that fall within certain ranges of frequencies, referred to herein as frequency bands. Some communications of the electronic devices <b>10</b> may transmit on a frequency band that overlaps with another frequency band of another communication.

Since the frequency bands are at least partially overlapping, communicating using the first electronic device may interfere with communicating using the second electronic device, and/or vice versa. A control system <b>60</b> of the base station <b>52</b> and/or control systems <b>62</b> of the electronic devices <b>10</b> (e.g., control system <b>62</b>F, control system <b>62</b>G, control system <b>62</b>H) may control data transmission operations to reduce a likelihood that a data transmission sent or received on a second frequency band (e.g., UWB frequency band) is interrupted by and/or missed due to communication sent or received on a first frequency band (e.g., NR frequency band).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">To help illustrate, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts multiple base stations <b>52</b> and multiple electronic devices <b>10</b>, including the electronic device <b>10</b>F, communicating via an RF network according to a normal mode of operation (e.g., a non-muting operation, as will be appreciated herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>24</b></figref>), according to embodiments of the present disclosure.

Communication types may correspond to a type of originating application and/or service of the base station <b>52</b> and/or the electronic devices <b>10</b> and/or may correspond to a type of network through which the data is to be transmitted. For example, some electronic devices <b>10</b> may receive data from and/or transmit data to the base station <b>52</b> on a New Radio (NR) frequency band corresponding to RF network provider services (e.g., a first type of communication). Furthermore, some electronic devices <b>10</b> may transmit information generated by ultra-wideband services of the electronic devices <b>10</b> on an ultra-wideband (UWB) frequency band (e.g., a second type of communication). It is noted that for purposes of this disclosure, the NR frequency band may correspond to frequencies between 7 gigahertz (GHz) and 25 GHz (e.g., less than 25 GHz, greater than 7 GHz, between 7.125 GHz and 24.25 GHz) and/or the ultra-wideband (UWB) frequency band may correspond frequencies between 3 GHz and 11 GHz (e.g., between 3.1 GHz and 10.6 GHz, between 6.24 GHz and 8.736 GHz, between 3.55 GHz and 3.7 GHz). It should be understood that although the NR frequency band and the UWB frequency band are identified, any suitable frequency bands used by the electronic devices <b>10</b> and/or the base station <b>52</b> to communicate that also at least partially overlap may benefit from use of the systems and methods described herein.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Keeping the foregoing in mind, the electronic device <b>10</b>G may transmit data to the electronic device <b>10</b>F and/or the electronic device <b>10</b>H during a duration of time indicated by the communication configuration to be a transmitting duration. While the electronic device <b>10</b>G transmits data signals to another electronic device <b>10</b>, the base station <b>52</b> may not transmit data signals (e.g., a muting operation). Communication configurations may indicate muting durations for the base station <b>52</b>, and thus allocate a period of time for the electronic device <b>10</b>F to communicate with the electronic device <b>10</b>G. The cooperation enabled by the electronic devices <b>10</b> and/or base stations <b>52</b> mutually operating according to the communication configurations may reduce a likelihood that the data transmission from the electronic device <b>10</b>G is interrupted by and/or missed due to a transmission by the base station <b>52</b> (e.g., reduces to zero or a relatively lower likelihood).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">To elaborate, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an example communication cycle diagram that visualizes a communication configuration of the electronic devices <b>10</b>, such as the electronic device <b>10</b>F, the electronic device <b>10</b>H, and/or the electronic device <b>10</b>G, for device-to-device communication, according to embodiments of the present disclosure. It should be noted that, for the purposes of this disclosure, device-to-device communication indicates direct communication between electronic devices <b>10</b> (e.g., such that an intermediary device, such as the base station <b>52</b>, is not used). The communication configuration includes one or more transmission (TX) durations <b>70</b> and one or more receive (RX) durations <b>72</b>. Idle durations <b>74</b> may be programmed between the TX durations <b>70</b> and the RX durations <b>72</b>. The transmission and receiving operations of the electronic devices <b>10</b> (e.g., electronic device <b>10</b>F, electronic device <b>10</b>G, electronic device <b>10</b>H) may be performed independent of uplink and downlink operations of the base station <b>52</b>. That is, the control system <b>60</b> may operate RF transmission circuitry of the base station <b>52</b> (e.g., a transmitter <b>56</b>, a receiver <b>54</b>) to send or receive data to or from one or more of the electronic devices <b>10</b> during the idle durations <b>74</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In particular, the control system <b>62</b>G may cause, for example, the electronic device <b>10</b>F to receive data from the electronic device <b>10</b>H during a respective RX duration <b>72</b> and/or may cause the electronic device <b>10</b>G to transmit data to the electronic device <b>10</b>H during a respective TX duration <b>70</b>.

It is noted that in some cases, the TX durations <b>70</b> of the electronic device <b>10</b>F may be offset in time from the RX durations <b>72</b> of the electronic device <b>10</b>G.

When the first frequency band does not overlap with the second frequency band, a likelihood of collision or interference due to transmissions to or from the base station <b>52</b> is negligible and communication performance is generally not impacted. However, when the first frequency band at least partially overlaps with the second frequency band, collisions may occur between data transmissions and/or communication interference may be present (e.g., a likelihood may increase of impacted wireless communications). For example, a power level of the signals used for NR-type communications may be greater than that used for UWB-type communications, and thus at least partially simultaneous transmission of the NR-type communications may interference with some ongoing UWB communications. It is noted that in some cases, the power level of the UWB-type communications may be large enough to interfere with at least partially simultaneous transmissions of NR-type communications.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The presently described systems, devices, and methods may address these shortcomings and enable increased and more flexible usage of overlapping frequency bands. In particular, as described herein, muting durations may be included within the communication configuration to reduce or eliminate collisions between transmissions on frequency bands that at least partially overlap. That is, the control system <b>60</b> of the base station <b>52</b> may adjust a muting configuration used to control when the base station <b>52</b> and/or the electronic devices <b>10</b> pauses communications on the first frequency band to permit communications on the second frequency band. For example, the muting configuration may include muting durations that define when the electronic device <b>10</b>F is permitted to transmit data to the electronic device <b>10</b>G and/or to the base station <b>52</b> using the first frequency band (e.g., is permitted to transmit communications of a first type) and when the electronic device <b>10</b>F is permitted to transmit data to the electronic device <b>10</b>G using the second frequency band (e.g., is permitted to transmit communications of a second type). The use of the muting configuration that includes muting durations may be considered a time-domain masking mechanism that permits temporary muting of uplink and downlink communications associated with the base station <b>52</b> and transmitted on the first frequency band, thereby temporarily reducing amounts of interference (e.g., levels of interference) experienced by electronic devices <b>10</b> transmitting data between each other on the second frequency band.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">To help explain, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is an illustrative diagram of the multiple base stations <b>52</b> communicating with a subset of electronic devices <b>10</b> operating according to a static communication configuration during a muting duration, according to embodiments of the present disclosure.

Thus, a quality of information transmitted between electronic devices <b>10</b> on the second frequency band (e.g., communications of the second type, UWB communications) may improve. It is noted that these system and methods described herein may also apply to electronic devices <b>10</b> that are non-smartphone devices capable of communicating on the first frequency band and/or the second frequency band (e.g., UWB-capable devices), such as electronic device <b>10</b>H. For example, the electronic device <b>10</b>H may include a keychain device, a vehicle sensor, a smart thermostat device, a printer device, a smart watch (e.g., electronic device <b>10</b>E), or the like. When the electronic device <b>10</b>H is a keychain device, such as a vehicle key fob, an operator of the electronic device <b>10</b>H may use close-range communications to authenticate with another electronic device <b>10</b>, such as using a key fob for keyless car entry.

Initiation of communication operations may include the base station <b>52</b> powering-on or initializing its RF circuitry (e.g., transmitter <b>56</b>, receiver <b>54</b>, transceiver <b>28</b>). Initializing RF circuitry may include performing a calibration operation to prepare circuitry for use and/or may include performing a tuning operation to identify gains to use or other transmission parameters to permit communication with nearby base stations <b>52</b> and/or electronic devices <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">To distinguish between the time periods indicated by the communication configuration, the base station <b>52</b>, at block <b>148</b>, may analyze an indicated duration.

The base station <b>52</b> may analyze an indicated duration a period of time suitably early to provide enough time to configure the RF circuitry for the upcoming operation. The period of time may correspond to at least an amount of time used to configure the RF circuitry. For example, during a current duration, the base station <b>52</b> may transmit data and may analyze the indicated duration (e.g., a next indicated duration of the communication configuration subsequent to the current duration that is ongoing) to determine that the communication configuration is going to direct the base station <b>52</b> to receive data next. Thus, the base station <b>52</b> may configure its receiver <b>54</b> in response to identifying the indicated duration as a receiving duration (e.g., the uplink duration <b>88</b>). That way, when the indicated duration is the new current duration, the base station <b>52</b> is already prepared to uplink data from the electronic devices <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">As a result of the analysis, the base station <b>52</b>, at block <b>150</b>, may determine whether the indicated duration is a muting duration <b>86</b>.

The base station <b>52</b> may transmit data when the indicated duration permits the base station <b>52</b> to downlink data to the electronic device <b>10</b>F and may receive data when the indicated duration permits the base station <b>52</b> to uplink data from the electronic device <b>10</b>F.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Returning to block <b>150</b>, when the base station <b>52</b> determines that the indicated duration corresponds to a muting duration <b>86</b>, the base station <b>52</b> may, at block <b>154</b>, stop and/or pause communications of the first type (e.g., communications to be transmitted on the first frequency band, NR-type communications). When the base station <b>52</b> pauses transmitting data on the first frequency band, the electronic devices <b>10</b> may communicate data on the second frequency band, such as the UWB frequency band and/or the UWB service that generates data to be transmitted via the UWB frequency band.

For example, the base station <b>52</b> may be adjusted based on a traffic profile indicating an expected load (e.g., a number of electronic devices <b>10</b> expected to be communicatively coupled to one or more base stations at future time), a traffic profile indicating a size of a current load (e.g., a number of electronic devices <b>10</b> communicatively coupled to one or more base stations at a current time), a traffic profile indicating properties of a current load (e.g., characteristics of one or more electronic devices <b>10</b> communicatively coupled to one or more base stations at a current time, average characteristics of one or more electronic devices <b>10</b> communicatively coupled to one or more base stations at a current time), or the like. When adjusting the muting configuration overtime, the base station <b>52</b> may use a muting configuration for a first subset of electronic devices <b>10</b> that is different from a muting configuration for a second subset of electronic devices <b>10</b>. Furthermore, in some cases, a common muting configuration is used in addition to subset-specific and/or device-specific muting configurations, where the common muting configuration may be considered a default muting configuration. These systems and methods are described herein with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>-<b>24</b></figref> to clarify on these examples. It is noted that these examples described below may be used additionally to or alternatively to the systems and methods described above.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">To help explain, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is an illustrative diagram of the multiple base stations <b>52</b> communicating with the multiple electronic devices <b>10</b>, including the electronic device <b>10</b>F, the electronic device <b>10</b>G, the electronic device <b>10</b>H, and the base station <b>52</b>, according to a dynamic communication configuration during a muting duration, according to embodiments of the present disclosure. The base stations <b>52</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> may receive different muting configurations and/or may generate different communication configurations based on receiving the same muting configuration. In particular, the base stations <b>52</b> may generate the different communication configurations using the same muting configuration from the RF network and/or the RF network provider based on different communication traffic profiles in respective geographical locations of the base stations <b>52</b>. Operating according to these dynamically-generated muting configurations and/or dynamic communication configurations may permit a subset of the base stations <b>52</b> to continue to communicate using the first frequency even while a second subset of the base stations are muted.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">For example, the communication configuration of a base station <b>52</b>A may cause the base station <b>52</b>A to pause or mute communications on a first frequency band while the communication configuration of a base station <b>52</b>B may cause the base station <b>52</b>B to continue communications on the first frequency band. When communication configurations and/or muting configurations are dynamic, a subset of the base stations <b>52</b> (e.g., subset including the base stations <b>52</b>A) may be muted to reduce interference of device-to-device communications on a second frequency band at least partially overlapping the first frequency band, such as communications between electronic device <b>10</b>F and the electronic device <b>10</b>G. The base station <b>52</b>B may determine based on the traffic profile that electronic device <b>10</b>H and/or electronic device <b>10</b>I are of suitable distance from the base station <b>52</b>B to not be affected or to be negligibly affected by the communications on the first frequency band. Since communications of the base station <b>52</b>B do not affect device-to-device communications of the electronic device <b>10</b>H and/or electronic device <b>10</b>I, the base station <b>52</b>B may determine to not include muting durations within its communication configuration.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The traffic profile may indicate an expected load, a size of a current load, properties of a current load, expected properties of an expected load, or the like. The traffic profile may be generated by the base station <b>52</b> in response to signals and/nor communications received from the electronic devices <b>10</b>. In some cases, the traffic profile may be transmitted to one or more of the base stations <b>52</b> from the RF network and/or the RF network provider. In some cases, however, the electronic devices <b>10</b> may transmit one or more traffic profiles to the base stations <b>52</b>, such as traffic profiles indicating one or more properties of respective transceiver circuitry <b>28</b> of the electronic device <b>10</b> or indicating other suitable device assistance information indicative of a parameter associated with the receiver <b>54</b> and/or the transmitter <b>56</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The traffic profile may originate from a variety of sources. For example, a calendar application of the RF network provider and/or of a respective base station <b>52</b> may maintain a schedule of nearby events and/or public facilities to provide expected load information corresponding to upcoming events (e.g., events to be held at the physical facility). In this way, a base station <b>52</b> located a threshold distance from a football stadium may receive a traffic profile indicative of an expected load that corresponds to when a football game is expected to end. The base station <b>52</b>, aware that device-to-device communications may increase after the football game ends, may proactively (e.g., preemptively) generate a communication configuration that increases or adjusts durations of the muting durations <b>86</b> to increase an overall length of time allocated to device-to-device communications (e.g., key fobs used to unlock car doors). Furthermore, the base station <b>52</b> may use a number of attendees indicated by the traffic profile to determine by a length of time to extend the muting durations <b>86</b> and/or for how long to repeat use of the adjusted muting durations <b>86</b> (e.g., when attendees have left from the stadium there may be no need to continue use of the adjusted muting durations <b>86</b> or muting durations <b>86</b> at all). In this way, the base station <b>52</b> may compare a number of attendees to historical numbers of attendees, and how suitable a past adjustment was for the historical numbers of attendees, to determine a suitable adjustment.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some cases, the traffic profile may describe properties of the electronic devices <b>10</b> communicatively coupled to the base station <b>52</b>. In these cases, the traffic profile may describe whether one or more electronic devices <b>10</b> support communication on the second, overlapping frequency band (e.g., UWB frequency band). Sometimes the traffic profile may describe a number of electronic devices <b>10</b> expected to use services corresponding to the second frequency band and/or a number of electronic devices <b>10</b> able to use the second frequency band.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The traffic profile may be generated at least in part by information provided by one or more of the electronic devices <b>10</b> as device (e.g., user equipment (UE)) assistance information and received by the base station <b>52</b>. For example, the electronic device <b>10</b>F may indicate a preferred frequency for the base station <b>52</b> to use when communicating with the electronic device <b>10</b>F and/or a preferred frequency for other electronic devices <b>10</b> (e.g., electronic device <b>10</b>G) to use when communicating with the electronic device <b>10</b>F. For example, the preferred frequency and/or set of frequencies may correspond to hardware parameters of the electronic device <b>10</b>F, such that the base station <b>52</b> may change its operation to suitably communicate with the electronic device <b>10</b>F. Thus, the base station <b>52</b> may consider this information as part of the traffic profile and may subsequently adjust the muting configuration with the preferred frequency in mind.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The electronic devices <b>10</b> may additionally or alternatively provide assistance information related to a number of attempts to access the second frequency band (e.g., second frequency spectrum) over a specified period and whether the attempts were successful (or unsuccessful). The number of attempts and specified period may be used by the base station <b>52</b> to determine a rate of successful (or unsuccessful) access by a particular electronic device <b>10</b> (e.g., electronic device <b>10</b>F, electronic device <b>10</b>G) to the second frequency band. The period over which this information (e.g., number of attempts) is aggregated may be configured by the RF network via the base station <b>52</b>. The base station <b>52</b> may adjust the muting configuration based at least in part on the number of attempts and/or the rate of successful (or unsuccessful) access.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In this way, based on overall statistics of frequency ranges requested by the electronic devices <b>10</b>, such as the range of frequencies requested by the electronic devices <b>10</b> for UWB operation, and rates of unsuccessful (or successful) access to the second frequency band (e.g., UWB spectrum), the base station <b>52</b> may adjust the muting configuration periodicity and duration. Thus, the base station <b>52</b> may use the traffic profiles to optimize an allocation of resources for the muting of communications on the first frequency band (e.g., NR muting), and thus optimize a coexistence of the otherwise overlapping communications (e.g., permitting coexistence of NR communications and UWB communications).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">To visualize the adjusted muting durations <b>86</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref> illustrate an adjustment to the muting duration <b>86</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is an example communication cycle diagram depicting a communication configuration that includes the muting durations <b>86</b>, the uplink durations <b>88</b>, the downlink durations <b>90</b>, and the special durations <b>92</b> arranged in a periodic pattern used to manage communication exchange between the electronic device <b>10</b>F, the electronic device <b>10</b>G, and the base station <b>52</b>, according to embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> may be similar to the communication cycle diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, and thus descriptions are relied on herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, however, is an example communication cycle diagram depicting the communication configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> that has been adjusted to include adjusted muting durations <b>170</b>, in addition to the muting duration <b>86</b>, the uplink durations <b>88</b>, the downlink durations <b>90</b>, and the special durations <b>92</b>, according to embodiments of the present disclosure. The adjusted muting durations <b>170</b> are a relatively longer time duration as to keep communications on the first frequency stopped and/or muted for a longer period of time relative to the muting duration <b>86</b>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">To make the adjustment, the downlink duration <b>90</b>A was removed from the communication configuration. The base station <b>52</b> donated the time period corresponding to the downlink duration <b>90</b>A to the adjusted muting duration <b>170</b>A. Similarly, the base station <b>52</b> donated the time period corresponding to the downlink duration <b>90</b>B to the adjusted muting duration <b>170</b>B. When time of a duration is donated, the original transition between durations (e.g., an operational transition between the uplink duration <b>88</b> and the downlink duration <b>90</b>) may be preserved. Preserving the original transition may enable the base station <b>52</b> to return to a periodicity of the communication configuration when an inclusion of muting durations <b>170</b> in the communication configuration is stopped. Returning to a periodicity of the communication configuration may be relatively easier when time is donated from previously allocated time periods than when a time period of the muting duration <b>86</b> is adjusted without conserving a same end time of the time period allocation (e.g., transitions indicated by arrow <b>172</b>A and arrow <b>172</b>B).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> to describe operations of the base station <b>52</b> to consider the traffic profiles when generating muting configurations, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method <b>180</b> for operating the base station <b>52</b> to communicate with the electronic device <b>10</b>G and/or the electronic device <b>10</b>F, according to embodiments of the present disclosure.
