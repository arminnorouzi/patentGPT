The maypole-type machine uses a plurality of spool carriers to carry filament bobbins in serpentine-like paths about a track plate. The track plate consists of two separate paths: each path 180 degrees out of phase from the other. One path moves clockwise, while the other path moves counter clockwise. Horn gears or notched rotors on the deck create the serpentine path. Half the carriers travel in the first path around the braiding point following one serpentine path created by the horn gears while the other half of the carriers travel in the second path, in the opposite direction around the braiding point. As the two sets of carriers travel in opposite directions around the braiding point, each set crosses the path of the other and the strands leaving the filament bobbins are interwoven as they converge to the braiding point. The speed of these machines is limited by the inertia of the carriers and/or changes in tension on the filaments resulting from the continuously changing radial movement towards and away from the point of braid formation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">These types of braiding machines, however, are generally limited to production of braids using lower filament count and/or generally large filaments. Typical braid structures of small filaments are 72, 96 and 144 in a one-over, one-under braid pattern. These same machines, generally of the maypole variety with horn gears and carriers, may also be used to produce 144, 192 or 288 braids of two-over, two-under construction. Very large &#x201c;Megabraiders&#x201d; have been manufactured with up to 800 carriers that will produce high filament count braids. See http://www.braider.com/About/Megabraiders.aspx. These Megabraiders, however, are generally used for large structures and are not suitable for most medical applications that require construction with fine wires that have low tensile strength.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The internal cam rotary-type braiding machine, known as the Wardwell Rapid Braider, uses a high-speed braiding process. This type of machine uses a plurality of lower carrier members and a plurality of upper carrier members, which travel past each other in continuous circular paths centered about the braid axis, going in opposite directions. As the upper and lower carriers travel past each other in opposite directions, strands from bobbins on the lower carriers are intertwined with strands from bobbins on the upper carriers. Deflectors are used to lift strands of the lower carriers up and over strands from the upper carriers, so that only the strands of the lower carriers are alternately passed over and under strands of the upper carriers to create the interwoven pattern. The Wardwell Braider, however, becomes unreliable when trying to braid strands or filaments of material, particularly very fine wire materials, having extremely small diameters. The rotary technique used therein produces so much tension on the very small diameter materials, particularly at one stage of the braiding process, that such extremely fine filaments tend to break, requiring that the machine be stopped.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, it would be desirable to provide a braiding machine and process capable of manufacturing high wire count tubular braids of small diameter filaments without breakage.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The braiding apparatus described herein provides improved means of manufacturing high wire-count (also described as high picks per inch or PPI) tubular braids of small diameter filaments, and is particularly useful for the production of fine wire metallic alloy (e.g. nitinol, cobalt-chrome and platinum-tungsten) for medical applications.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some embodiments of a braiding machine include a disc defining a plane and a circumferential edge, a mandrel extending from a center of the disc and generally perpendicular to the plane of the disc, a plurality of catch mechanisms positioned circumferentially around the edge of the disc, and a plurality of actuators adapted to move the plurality of catch mechanisms in a substantially radial direction relative to the circumferential edge of the disc.

description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0072" num="0072">Discussed herein are devices and methods for creating a tubular braid from a plurality of filaments. Because the braiding machine individually engages a subset of the filaments and moves the engaged filaments relative to the unengaged filaments in discrete steps to interweave the filaments, it does not create the large tension spikes common to the continuous motion braiding machines. Thus, the invention is particularly useful for making braided tubes of ultra-fine filaments, in the order of &#xbd; mil-5 mil, for example, for use in vascular implants, such as embolization devices, stents, filters, grafts, and diverters for implantation in the human body. It will be appreciated, however, that the invention could also be advantageously be used for making braids for other applications and with other sized filaments.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0073">The ability to individually engage a subset of filaments and move the filaments in discrete steps also allows for both flexibility in the loading of the machine and in the braid pattern created. The machine can be programmed to accept multiple loading configurations and create multiple braid patterns by alternating the subset of filaments engaged and/or the distance moved in each discrete step. For example, while a one over-one under diamond braid pattern is shown and discussed, other braid or weave patterns, such as a two over-two under, two over-one under, one over-three under may also be used by varying the filaments engaged and the distances moved in each step. Likewise, by adjusting filaments engaged and the distances moved in each step, the machine can operate when loaded in a variety of configurations, i.e. fully loaded or partially loaded, to create tubular braids with differing numbers of filaments.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0074">It also may be desirable to vary the size of the plurality of filaments. For example, in some uses for implantation in the human body discussed above, the need for stiffness and strength must be balanced with the need to collapse the braid into a small delivery size. Adding several larger diameter filaments to the braid greatly increases the radial strength without much increase in the collapsed diameter of the braid. The braiding machine described herein is able to accommodate different sizes of wires and thereby produce implants that optimize stiffness and strength as well as porosity and collapsed diameter.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0075">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>1</b>A</figref>, the braiding machine <b>100</b> is of the vertical type, i.e., the braiding axis BA of the mandrel <b>10</b>, about which the braid <b>55</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) is formed, extends in the vertical direction. A vertical-type braiding apparatus provides more convenient access by the operator to various parts of the apparatus than a horizontal-type apparatus wherein the braid is formed about a horizontal axis. The braiding machine includes a circular disc <b>20</b>, from which an elongate cylindrical braiding mandrel <b>10</b> extends perpendicularly. The diameter of the mandrel <b>10</b> determines the diameter of the braid formed thereon. In some embodiments, the mandrel may range from about 2 mm to about 50 mm. Likewise, the length of the mandrel <b>10</b> determines the length of the braid that can be formed. The uppermost end of the mandrel <b>10</b> has a tip <b>12</b> having a smaller diameter than mandrel <b>10</b> which forms a recess or notch for loading a plurality of filaments on the tip of mandrel <b>10</b>. In use, a plurality of filaments <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>is loaded onto mandrel tip <b>12</b>, such that each filament extends radially toward circumferential edge <b>22</b> of disc <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0076">The filaments may be looped over mandrel <b>10</b> such that the loop catches on the notch formed at the junction of tip <b>12</b> and mandrel <b>10</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>10</b></figref>, each wire <b>6</b> will create two braiding filaments <b>5</b><i>a,b </i>once looped over and temporarily affixed to the mandrel <b>10</b>. This offers better loading efficiency because each wire creates two braiding filaments. Alternatively, the filaments may be temporarily secured at the mandrel tip <b>12</b> by a constraining band, such as a band of adhesive tape, an elastic band, an annular clamp, or the like. The filaments <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are arranged such that they are spaced apart around the circumferential edge <b>22</b> of disc <b>20</b> and each engage edge <b>22</b> at a point that is spaced apart a circumferential distance d from the points engaged by the immediately adjacent filaments.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0077">In some embodiments, the mandrel may be loaded with about 10 to 1500 filaments, alternatively about 10 to 1000 filaments, alternatively about 10 to 500 filaments, alternatively about 18 to 288 filaments, alternatively 104, 144, 288, 360, or 800 filaments. In the event that a wire is draped over the mandrel, as described above and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, there would be &#xbd; the number of filaments because each wire results in two braiding filaments. The filaments <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may have a transverse dimension or diameter of about 0.0005 to 0.005 inches (&#xbd; to 5 mils), alternatively about 0.001 to 0.003 inches (1 to 3 mils). In some embodiments, the braid may be formed of filaments of multiple sizes. For example, filaments <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>may include large filaments having a transverse dimension or diameter that is about 0.001 to 0.005 inches (1-5 mils) and small filaments having a transverse dimension or diameter of about 0.0005 to 0.0015 inches (&#xbd;-1.5 mils), more specifically, about 0.0004 inches to about 0.001 inches. In addition, a difference in transverse dimension or diameter between the small filaments and the large filaments may be less than about 0.005 inches, alternatively less than about 0.0035 inches, alternatively less than about 0.002 inches. For embodiments that include filaments of different sizes, the number of small filaments relative to the number of large filaments may be about 2 to 1 to about 15 to 1, alternatively about 2 to 1 to about 12 to 1, alternatively about 4 to 1 to about 8 to 1.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0078">Circular disc <b>20</b> defines a plane and a circumferential edge <b>22</b>. A motor, such as a stepper motor, is attached to disc <b>20</b> to rotate the disc in discrete steps. The motor and control system may be housed in a cylindrical drum <b>60</b> connected to the bottom side of the disc. In some embodiments, drum <b>60</b> may have a diameter about equal to disc <b>20</b> such that the longitudinal side of the of drum <b>60</b> can act as a physical mechanism to stabilize the filaments extending over the edge of the disc For example, in some embodiments, the side of the drum may be made of an energy absorbing, slightly textured, grooved surface, or surface having projections such that when the filaments extend over the edge of the disc, they will come to rest against the side of drum <b>60</b> such that the filaments are substantially vertical and not tangled.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0079">A plurality of catch mechanisms <b>30</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>) are positioned around the circumference of disc <b>20</b>, each catch mechanism <b>30</b> extending toward circumferential edge <b>22</b> of disc <b>20</b> and arranged to selectively capture an individual filament <b>5</b> extending over the edge of disc <b>20</b>. The catch mechanisms may comprise hooks, barbs, magnets, or any other magnetic or mechanical component known in the art that is capable of selectively capturing and releasing one or more filaments. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, in one embodiment, the catch mechanism may comprise a double headed hook <b>36</b> at the distal end for engaging a filament located on either side of the catch mechanism. The curve of the hooks may be slightly J-shaped, as shown, to encourage retention of the filament in the hook. Alternatively, the hooks may be more L-shaped to facilitate release of an engaged filament when the hook is rotated away from the filament</p><p id="p-0080" num="0080">The number of catch mechanisms determines the maximum number of filaments that can loaded on the braiding machine, and therefore, the maximum number of filaments in a braid made thereon. The number of catch mechanisms will generally be &#xbd; the maximum number of filaments. Each catch mechanism may handle two threads (or more); therefore, for example, a braiding machine having 144 catch mechanisms extending circumferentially around disc <b>20</b> can be loaded with a maximum of 288 filaments. Because each of catch mechanism <b>30</b> is individually activated, however, the machine can also be operated in a partially loaded configuration loaded with any even number of filaments to create braids having a range of filaments.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0081">Each catch mechanism <b>30</b> is connected to an actuator <b>40</b> through a coupler <b>31</b>. Actuator <b>40</b> controls the movement of the catch mechanism toward and away from circumferential edge <b>22</b> of disc <b>20</b> to alternately engage and release filaments <b>5</b> one at a time. Actuator <b>40</b> may be any type of linear actuator known in the art such as electrical, electromechanical, mechanical, hydraulic, or pneumatic actuators, or any other actuators known in the art that are capable of moving catch mechanism <b>30</b>, and an engaged filament <b>5</b>, a set distance both away from and toward disc <b>20</b>. Catch mechanism <b>30</b> and actuators <b>40</b> are positioned around the circumference of the disc such that the motion of the actuators causes the catch mechanisms to be moved in a generally radial direction away from and toward circumferential edge <b>22</b> of disc <b>20</b>. Catch mechanisms <b>30</b> are further positioned such that catch mechanisms <b>30</b> engage the selected filament <b>5</b> as it extends over the circumferential edge of disc <b>20</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the catch mechanisms are located in a horizontal plane and slightly beneath the plane defined by disc <b>20</b>. Alternatively, the catch mechanisms may be angled such that when they are moved toward the disc, they will intercept the filament at a point below the plane defined by disc <b>20</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, in some embodiments, the plurality of catch mechanisms <b>30</b> and actuators <b>40</b> may be attached to a rotatable circular track <b>42</b>. A motor, such as a stepper motor, may be attached to circular track <b>42</b> to rotate catch mechanisms <b>30</b> in discrete steps relative to disc <b>20</b>. Alternatively, the plurality of catch mechanisms <b>30</b> and actuators <b>40</b> may be attached to a stationary track surrounding the circular disc.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0082">In use, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B-F</figref>, mandrel <b>10</b> is loaded with a plurality of filaments <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>j </i>which extends radially over circumferential edge <b>22</b> of circular disc <b>20</b>. Each of filaments <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>j </i>engage circumferential edge <b>22</b> of disc <b>20</b> at a discrete point a distance d from the point engaged by each immediately adjacent filament. In some embodiments, the points of engagement may comprise of series of pre-marked locations specify identified, for example, by a physical marker. In other embodiments, the points of engagement may further comprise a physical feature such as micro-features, texturing, grooves, notches, or other projections. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, catch mechanisms <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>are initially positioned equidistant between adjacent filaments <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>j</i>, i.e., catch mechanism <b>30</b><i>a </i>is positioned between filaments <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, catch mechanism <b>30</b><i>b </i>is positioned between filaments <b>5</b><i>c </i>and <b>5</b><i>d</i>, catch mechanism <b>30</b><i>c </i>is positioned between filaments <b>5</b><i>e </i>and <i>f</i>, catch mechanism <b>30</b><i>d </i>is positioned between filaments <b>5</b> and h and catch mechanism <b>30</b><i>e </i>is positioned between filaments <b>5</b><i>i </i>and <i>j</i>. Each catch mechanism is further positioned with hooks located beyond the circumference of disc <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0083">To engage a first set of filaments <b>5</b><i>a,c,e,g</i>, and <i>i</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, actuators <b>40</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>attached to catch mechanisms <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>are actuated to move each catch mechanism a discrete distance in a generally radial direction toward disc <b>20</b>. The distal end of each catch mechanism <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>preferably engages filaments <b>5</b><i>a, c, e, g </i>and <i>i </i>at a point beneath the plane of circular disc <b>20</b> as the filaments extend over edge <b>22</b> of disc <b>20</b>. For example, as illustrated here, once hooks <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>have been moved toward the disc in the direction C<sub>2 </sub>such that the tip of each hook <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>extends past hanging filaments <b>5</b><i>a, c, e, g</i>, and <i>i</i>, track <b>42</b> retaining catch mechanisms <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>is rotated counterclockwise, in the direction of arrow C<sub>1</sub>, to contact filaments <b>5</b><i>a, c, e, g</i>, and <i>i. </i>Alternately, disc <b>20</b> may be rotated in the clockwise direction to place the filaments <b>5</b><i>a, c, e, g</i>, and <i>i </i>in contact with catch mechanisms <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>in a similar manner.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0084">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, once filaments <b>5</b><i>a, c, e, g</i>, and <i>i </i>contact catch mechanisms <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>, the actuators attached to catch mechanisms <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>through couplers <b>31</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>are again actuated to retract catch mechanisms <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>in the direction of arrow D, engaging filaments <b>5</b><i>a, c, e, g</i>, and <i>i </i>in hooks <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>and moving engaged filaments <b>5</b><i>a, c, e, g</i>, and <i>i</i>, away from circumferential edge <b>22</b> of disc <b>20</b> in a generally radial direction to a point beyond edge <b>22</b> of disc <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0085">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>, track <b>42</b> is rotated clockwise a distance of 2d, in the direction of arrow E, to cross engaged filaments <b>5</b><i>a, c, e, g</i>, and <i>i </i>over unengaged filaments <b>5</b><i>b, d, f, h</i>, and <i>j</i>. Alternatively, as discussed above, the same relative motion can be produced by rotating disc <b>20</b> in a counterclockwise direction a distance of 2d.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0086">Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref>, actuators <b>40</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>attached to catch mechanisms <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>are again actuated to move the catch mechanisms a discrete distance in a generally radial direction toward disc <b>20</b>, as indicated by arrow F. The hooks <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>are thereby moved toward disc <b>20</b> such that the tip of each hook <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>extends inside the circumference formed by the hanging filaments. This will again place filaments <b>5</b><i>a, c, e, g</i>, and <i>i </i>in contact with edge <b>22</b> of disc <b>20</b> and release filaments <b>5</b><i>a, c, e, g</i>, and <i>i</i>. In addition, when catch mechanisms <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>are rotated in a clockwise direction, filaments <b>5</b><i>d, f, h</i>, and <i>j </i>are engaged by double hooks <b>36</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>on catch mechanism <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. The same steps can then be repeated in the opposite direction to cross filaments <b>5</b><i>b, d, f, h</i>, and <i>j </i>over unengaged filaments <b>5</b><i>a, c, e, g</i>, and <i>i </i>to interweave the filaments in a one over-one under pattern.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0087">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, filaments <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>are thus progressively woven into braid <b>55</b> about mandrel <b>10</b> from uppermost tip <b>12</b> towards the lower end of the mandrel extending from the circular disc. The steps illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B-<b>1</b>D</figref> create a braid <b>55</b> in a one over-one under pattern, i.e. a diamond pattern, however, any number of braid patterns may be created by varying the subset of threads engaged, the distances rotated, and/or the pattern of repetition.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0088">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, at the point where filaments <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>converge to form the braid, i.e. the fell or braid point, former ring <b>70</b> is used in combination with mandrel <b>10</b> to control the dimension and shape of the tubular braid. Former ring <b>70</b> controls the outside diameter of braid <b>55</b> and a mandrel that controls the inside diameter. Ideally, former ring <b>70</b> inner diameter is just larger than the outer cross section of mandrel <b>10</b>. In this way, former ring <b>70</b> pushes braided filaments <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>a short distance to mandrel <b>10</b> with a short path of travel so that braid <b>55</b> is pulled tightly against mandrel <b>10</b>, thereby producing a uniform braid with high structural integrity. Former ring <b>70</b> having adjustable inner diameter <b>72</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B-C</figref>, can be adjusted t closely match the outer diameter of selected mandrel <b>10</b> and used to pull braid <b>55</b> tightly against mandrel <b>10</b>. Adjustable former ring <b>70</b> is made by providing adjustable inner diameter <b>72</b>, for example created by a plurality of overlapping leaves <b>74</b><i>a</i>-<i>h </i>in the form of an iris, which can be adjusted to provide a range of inner diameters. Such adjustable former rings are known in the art and more detail regarding the construction of such adjustable rings can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,679,152, entitled &#x201c;Forming Ring with Adjustable Diameter for Braid Production and Methods of Braid Production,&#x201d; issued on Jan. 20, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0089">Alternatively, a fixed former ring <b>75</b> having a predetermined and non-adjustable inner diameter that closely matches the outer diameter of mandrel <b>10</b> can be used to pull braid <b>55</b> tightly against mandrel <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, former ring <b>75</b>, may be weighted to provide an additional force pushing down on filaments <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>as they are pulled against mandrel <b>10</b> to form tubular braid <b>55</b>. For example, former ring <b>75</b> may include a weight of between about 100 grams to 1000 grams, alternatively of between about 200 grams to 600 grams, depending on the type and size of filaments used, to provide an additional downward force on filaments <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>n </i>pulled through former ring <b>75</b> and as pushed against mandrel <b>10</b> to create tubular braid <b>55</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0090">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>3</b>A</figref>, in an alternative embodiment, multiple catch mechanisms <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may be located on a single &#x201c;rake&#x201d; <b>32</b> for efficiency. For example, as illustrated here, each rake <b>32</b> holds four catch mechanisms <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>(see also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>). Each rake is attached to an actuator <b>40</b>, which simultaneously moves all four catch mechanisms <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>in a generally radial direction toward or away from circumferential edge <b>22</b> of disc <b>20</b> when actuated. This advantageously reduces the number of actuators needed to drive the catch mechanisms, and thereby increases the efficiency of the system. The angle at which each catch mechanism <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>moves when rake <b>32</b> is moved radially toward or away from disc <b>20</b> must be substantially radial to disc <b>20</b> to maintain consistency in the circumferential distances traveled by each filament as the filaments are engaged and the disc and/or catch mechanisms are rotated.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0091">The motion of each individual catch mechanism <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>will not be precisely radial with respect to disc <b>20</b>, however, it will have a radial component that is substantially radial. Because the angle with respect to radial that the catch mechanism is pulled increases with increasing circumferential distance from the axis of the linear motion, the number of catch mechanisms that can be carried by rake <b>32</b> is limited. Ideally, the upper limit for the angle of motion with respect to radial for each the catch mechanisms is about 45&#xb0;, alternatively about 40&#xb0;, alternatively about 35&#xb0;, alternatively about 30&#xb0;, alternatively about 25&#xb0;, alternatively about 20&#xb0;, alternatively about 15&#xb0;, alternatively about 10&#xb0;, alternatively about 5&#xb0;, in order to maintain consistency in the relative circumferential distances move by the engaged filaments. For example, each rake may cover 90&#xb0; of the 360&#xb0; circumference when operating at an angle of 45&#xb0; with respect to radial. In some embodiments, rake <b>32</b> may carry 1-8 catch mechanisms, alternatively 1-5 catch mechanisms, alternatively 1-4 catch mechanisms and still maintain an acceptable deviation from radial motion for all of the catch mechanisms carried thereon.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0092">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>-<b>4</b>B</figref>, in some embodiments, circular disc <b>20</b> may have a plurality of notches <b>26</b> around circumferential edge <b>22</b> to provide a discrete point of engagement for each of the plurality of filaments <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>x </i>and ensure that filaments <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>x </i>remain in the order and spacing during the braiding process. In some embodiments, cylindrical drum <b>60</b> connected to the bottom side of disc <b>20</b> may also comprise a corrugated outer layer <b>62</b> comprising a plurality of corresponding grooves <b>66</b> extending longitudinally around the circumference of drum <b>60</b>. Drum <b>60</b> may have a diameter substantially equal to the diameter of disc <b>20</b> such that longitudinal grooves <b>66</b> can act as an additional physical means to stabilize filaments <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>x </i>extending over the edge of disc <b>20</b> by providing individual grooves <b>66</b> in which each filament <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>x </i>will rest. Ideally, grooves <b>66</b> will be equal in number and aligned with the plurality of notches <b>26</b> in the circular disc. For example, in some embodiments, the circumferential edge of the disc may have between about 100-1500 notches, alternatively between about 100-1000 notches, alternatively between about 100-500 notches, alternatively between about 100-300 notches, alternatively 108, 144, 288, 360, or 800 notches. Similarly, in some embodiments the drum may have an outer layer with between about 100-1500 corresponding grooves, alternatively between about 100-1000 corresponding grooves, alternatively between about 100-500 corresponding grooves, alternatively between about 100-300 corresponding grooves, alternatively 108, 144, 288, 360, or 800 corresponding grooves.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0093">The filaments may also be tensioned with a plurality of individual tensioning elements <b>6</b><i>a</i>-<i>x</i>, such as a weight, or any other tensioning element known in the art for applying between about 2-20 grams of weight to each of the individual filaments. Tensioning elements <b>6</b><i>a</i>-<i>x </i>are sized to fit in the plurality of grooves <b>66</b> on drum <b>60</b>. For example, each tensioning element may comprise an elongate cylindrical weight as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>4</b>A</figref>. Tension elements <b>6</b><i>a</i>-<i>x </i>are separate for each filament <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>x </i>and are individually connected to each filament <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>x</i>. Therefore, the amount of tension applied can be varied for each filament <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>x</i>. For example, a larger tensioning element can be attached to the smaller diameter filaments to apply more tension to the smaller diameter wires relative to the larger diameter wires. The ability to individually tension each filament creates an accurate tensioning system which improves the uniformity and integrity of the braid and enables the braiding machine to operate with multiple diameter wires.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0094">In another alterative embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the plurality of catch mechanisms <b>30</b> and actuators <b>40</b> may be angled with respect to the plane of disc <b>20</b>.

Specifically, catch mechanism <b>30</b> and actuator <b>40</b> will be oriented at an angle of between about 15-60&#xb0;, alternatively at an angle of between about 25-55&#xb0;, alternatively at an angle of between about 35-50&#xb0;, alternatively at an angle of between about 40-50&#xb0;, alternatively at an angle of about 45&#xb0; with respect to the plane of disc <b>20</b>. The plurality of catch mechanisms <b>30</b> and actuators <b>40</b> will be positioned around circumferential edge <b>22</b> of disc <b>20</b>, slightly elevated with respect to disc <b>20</b> such that the actuator <b>40</b> will move catch mechanism <b>30</b> toward circumferential edge <b>22</b> of the disc in a downward diagonal path from the point of elevation. Preferably, catch mechanism <b>30</b> will engage filament <b>5</b> extending over edge <b>22</b> of disc <b>20</b> at a point slightly below the plane of disc <b>20</b>. In addition, when actuator <b>40</b> is actuated to move away from the circumferential edge of disc <b>20</b> with an engaged filament <b>5</b>, filament <b>5</b> will be moved horizontally and vertically away from circular disc <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0095">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>, angled bracket <b>34</b> can also be used with rake <b>32</b> carrying multiple catch mechanisms <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>and actuator <b>40</b> to orient the rake <b>32</b> and actuator <b>40</b> with respect to the plane of disc <b>20</b> so that the path of motion for attached catch mechanisms <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>will be angled with respect to the plane of the disc <b>20</b>.

Catch mechanisms <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may be mounted on rake <b>32</b> in an arcuate configuration, preferably mirroring the curve of disc <b>20</b>. Rake <b>32</b> is then attached to actuator <b>40</b> for actuating the horizontal movement of rake <b>32</b>, and therefore catch mechanisms <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>towards and away from the circular disc. Because the angle with respect to radial that the catch mechanism is pulled increases with increasing circumferential distance from the axis of the linear motion, the motion of each individual catch mechanism <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>will not be exactly radial with respect to disc <b>20</b>. Because the motion of catch mechanisms <b>30</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>needs to be substantially radial, the number of catch mechanisms that can be carried by rake <b>32</b> may be limited. For example, rake <b>32</b> may carry between 1-8 catch mechanisms, alternatively between 1-5 catch mechanisms, alternatively between 1-4 catch mechanisms, and still maintain an acceptable deviation from radial motion for all of the catch mechanisms carried thereon.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0098">It is further envisioned that a braiding machine according to the present invention could use a combination of the single and multiple catch mechanism embodiments arrayed around the circular disc to achieve the optimum balance between efficiency of the machine and flexibility in loading configurations and braiding patterns possible.
