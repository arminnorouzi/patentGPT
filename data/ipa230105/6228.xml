Although fluorenone is natively redox-inactive, embodiments of the disclosed fluorenone/fluorenol derivatives are capable of undergoing a reversible two-electron transfer process. The reversible two-electron process occurs through a comproportionation and disproportionation mechanism. The reaction proceeds through a radical anion intermediate, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> where R represents an electron withdrawing group. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the stepwise oxidation mechanism.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0045">In the absence of the additive, the formation rate and/or concentration of the radical anion intermediate in the anolyte limits the battery rate capability or current density. The battery demonstrates a lower rate capability than that achieved with other organic flow systems. Interestingly, the oxidation rate depends on the electrolyte state of charge. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the oxidation rate of a 25% charged electrolyte is much faster than that of the fully charged electrolyte. By measurement of the radical concentration in-operando with battery operation, 25% SOC electrolyte contains a much higher radical concentration than the fully charged electrolyte.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0046">Although radical anion species can be generated by direct anodic alcohol oxidation on an electrode in the presence of a noble metal catalyst, heterogeneous catalysis is not feasible in a flow battery where the flowing electrolyte can dislodge the catalyst from the electrode surface. The inventors have solved at least this problem by introducing an additive into the anolyte that functions as a homogeneous catalyst to alter the mechanism of radical anion formation and increase the rate of formation of the radical anion.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">I.

The additive is redox inert, i.e., the additive itself does not undergo oxidation or reduction in a redox flow battery in the working potential range. As discussed above, oxidation/reduction of the fluorenone/fluorenol derivative proceeds through a radical anion intermediate. In the absence of the additive, the formation rate and/or concentration of the radical anion in the anolyte limits the current density of the electrolyte. Without being bound by a particular theory, it currently is believed that the additive catalyzes formation of the radical anion from the reduced fluorenol derivative.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing how it currently is believed that the additive (labeled &#x201c;H acceptor&#x201d;) changes the mechanism by which the fluorenol derivative is oxidized to the corresponding fluorenone derivative. In the absence of the additive, the fluorenol derivative oxidizes in the presence of the base (NaOH) to form the radical anion (reaction II), which loses another electron to form the fluorenol derivative (reaction I). When the electrolyte is in a charged state, formation of the anion radical is the rate-limiting step of the oxidation process. However, the additive with its hydrogen acceptor group(s) mediates formation of the radical anion through another mechanism (reaction III), providing an additional source of the radical anion and increasing the magnitude of reaction I. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the additive is a homogeneous organocatalyst, which catalyzes a proton-coupled electron transfer reaction, in contrast to the direct electron transfer that occurs without the additive. The additive accelerates the proton transfer process and the resulting fluorenol oxidation process by providing a different primary mechanism of radical anion formation, thereby enhancing discharge kinetics of the fluorenol-based anolyte. In some embodiments, the reaction occurs at low potentials. A further breakdown of the oxidation mechanism in the absence and presence of the additive is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, respectively, where the additive is represented as B<sup>&#x2212;</sup> in its deprotonated state and H&#x2014;B in its protonated state.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0088">As discussed previously, the oxidation rate of a 25% charged electrolyte is much faster than that of the fully charged electrolyte (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Without being limited to a single theory, it currently is believed that these observations suggested that, on battery discharge, the discharge of the radical anion is not the limiting step (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, reaction I). Instead, the battery kinetics can be highly dependent on the regeneration process of intermediate radical anion species by comproportionation of fluorenone and fluorenol (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, reaction II). The kinetic limitation is more severe at high depth of discharge (DOD) or lower active material concentration due to the bimolecular reaction route. Thus, regeneration of the radical anion species dictates the system discharge kinetics.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0089">The approach illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> utilizes a multi-site proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism, which bypasses a high energy barrier from direct electron transfer. To pre-position the proton acceptor group for such a proton regulation, an H-bonding structure between the additive and fluorenol is formed. In general, proton transfer between fluorenol and the additive is thermodynamically more favorable with increasing additive pKa (the same applies to the second proton transfer). However, free hydroxide anions are not suitable additives for the anolyte because the hydroxides are primarily coordinated as OH<sup>&#x2212;</sup>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4 </sub>clusters in solution and are not available for H-bonding with the fluorenol derivative. The cluster becomes a hurdle for hydroxide to further improve proton transfer efficiency. Additionally, not all organic molecules rich in H-bonding groups are equally effective. Instead, a well-positioned proton acceptor additive with suitable pKa and a shortened proton donor-acceptor distance is most effective. In some embodiments, proton transfer between the fluorenol derivative and the additive is thermodynamically more effective with a larger H-additive pKa (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>). However, in some embodiments, the additive pKa is lower than that of water, in order to generate proton acceptor sites in alkaline aqueous solution.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0090">In some embodiments, the additive comprises two or more proton acceptor groups.

The catholyte is an aqueous solution comprising an electrochemically active material suitable for use in a redox flow battery. In one embodiment, the catholyte comprises a base and the electrochemically active material. In an independent embodiment, the catholyte comprises an acid and the electrochemically active material. The catholyte may consist essentially of, or consist of, water, the base or the acid, and the electrochemically active material. As used herein, &#x201c;consists essentially of&#x201d; means that the catholyte does not include any additional components that may materially affect properties of the anolyte or a battery including the anolyte. For example, the catholyte does not include any electrochemically- or redox-active component (i.e., a component, such as an element, an ion, or a compound, that is capable of forming redox pairs having different oxidation and reduction states, e.g., ionic species with differing oxidation states or a metal cation and its corresponding neutral metal atom) other than the compound as disclosed herein in an amount sufficient to affect performance of the catholyte, and the catholyte does not include more than a trace amount (e.g., no more than 1 wt %) of a non-aqueous solvent. In certain embodiments, the base is the same base as that of the anolyte, and may have the same concentration as the base in the anolyte. In some examples, the electrochemically active material in the catholyte is potassium ferrocyanide (K<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>). In certain examples, the catholyte is an aqueous solution comprising a base and K<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>. Because the disclosed compounds undergo a 2e<sup>&#x2212;</sup> redox process, the amount (number of moles) of K<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6 </sub>in the catholyte in some embodiments is twice the amount of the fluorenone/fluorenol derivative in the anolyte.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0099">In some embodiments, the disclosed anolytes increase current density of an aqueous redox flow battery relative to anolytes that do not include the additive. In certain implementations, the additive increases the current density 1.2&#xd7; to 2.0&#xd7;, such as 1.4&#xd7; to 1.8&#xd7;, relative to the current density in the absence of the additive. In one example, a battery exhibited a 1.6&#xd7; peak current density when &#x3b2;-CD was added to the anolyte. The disclosed anolyte also may increase battery discharge capacity, particularly at higher current densities (e.g., 40-100 mA cm<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>), compared to anolytes that do not include the additive. In certain embodiments, the disclosed anolytes provide long-term cycling stability of an ARFB. For example, a battery with an anolyte comprising 0.7 M 27S4CFL/1 eq NaOH, 0.86 M &#x3b2;-CD, 1 M NaOH exhibited 0.025%/day observed capacity decay rate over the continuous operation of over half year (4,000 cycles), with a voltage efficiency decrease of 9% (Example 2, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>A</figref>). A similar capacity decay rate was observed in a battery with an anolyte comprising 1.67 M 4C7SFL/1eq NaOH dissolved with 0.086M &#x3b2;-CD/1 M NaOH. The battery exhibited a capacity decay rate of 0.020%/day over 160 days (&#x2dc;650 cycles), with around 5% VE drop (Example 2, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>B</figref>).</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">IV.

A simulation suggested the residence time ratio of Complex 1 (1089.164 ps) and Complex 2 (340.037 ps) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>) is 3.2:1, illustrating Complex 1 as a more thermodynamically favored H-bonding structure (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>). DFT calculation also validated that Complex 1 was thermodynamically more favored. The intramolecular H-bonding (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> HB2) between 3&#x2032;O<sup>&#x2212;</sup> and 6&#x2032;O would render this proton even more acidic than individual 3&#x2032; hydroxyl or 6&#x2032; hydroxyl (proton moving back and forth between the two oxygens on 3&#x2032; and 6&#x2032; observed in MD simulation), potentially serving as proton outlet of the complex to bulk solution hydroxide during the proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process with less steric hindrance. This acceleration was also validated experimentally by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) proton exchange (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). With increasing &#x3b2;-CD ratio, the proton exchange rate of fluorenol benzylic C&#x2014;H increased. This observation directly supported the hypothesis that a suitable H-bonding structure could accelerate the deprotonation process in alkaline water. The formation of the bonding structure was cross-verified by both NMR and Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) correlation between FLOH (H1, H3, H4, H5 and H6) and &#x3b2;-CD (H5&#x2032; and H6&#x2032;) illustrated that FLOH mostly interacts with &#x3b2;-CD at the primary hydroxyl on 6&#x2032; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref>, Tables 3 and 4). A cross peak observed between H6 and H6&#x2032; suggested a distance &#x3c;5 &#x212b;. In SAXS, the critical radial distributions functions (RDFs) suggested that FL&#x2014;OH/&#x3b2;-CD bonding structure experienced a cluster shape transformation compared to plain &#x3b2;-CD (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>B</figref>, Table 5). This shape transformation further supports the interaction between FL&#x2014;OH and &#x3b2;-CD at 6&#x2032; position.

Meanwhile, <sup>1</sup>H signals from &#x3b2;-CD are slightly broadened with the addition of 0.5 M FLOH due to the slightly lowered molecular motions as a result of higher viscosity. The NOE correlation between FLOH (H1, H3, H4, H5 and H6) and &#x3b2;-CD (H5&#x2032; and H6&#x2032;) suggests that FLOH mostly interact with the small opening of &#x3b2;-CD. Furthermore, the lowered diffusion coefficient of FLOH-H6 compared to the diffusion coefficient of FLOH aromatic protons in the mixed solution (Tables 3-4) may support the hypothesis that FLOH interacts with &#x3b2;-CD through the hydrogen bonding between FLOH and hydroxyl oxygen of the primary carbon at &#x3b2;-CD.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0123">On the other hand, <sup>1</sup>H signals from FL become a much broader resonance between 6-10 ppm, suggesting that the tumbling motions of FL molecules are highly restricted at the presence of &#x3b2;-CD; meanwhile, H5&#x2032; and H6&#x2032; from &#x3b2;-CD experience the most significant shift by 0.14-0.17 ppm to lower frequency. Combined with the remarkably reduced diffusion coefficients of water and &#x3b2;-CD in the mixed solution, it is believed that the FL molecules are &#x201c;trapped&#x201d; between the small openings of CD molecules in a way that CD may still rotate freely while FL rotations are highly suppressed. This observation corresponded to the data obtained in SAXS.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0124">The SAXS data critical radial distributions functions (RDFs) obtained suggested that plain &#x3b2;-CD exhibited two peaks (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>B</figref>), with the width of the cup at &#x2dc;12 &#x212b; and height of the cup at &#x2dc;4 &#x212b;. FL&#x2014;OH/&#x3b2;-CD bonding structure showed only one peak of diameter at &#x2dc;12 &#x212b;, suggesting a distributed ball-shaped cluster. This shape change further supported that FL&#x2014;OH was interacting with the smaller opening of the cup-shaped &#x3b2;-CD at 6&#x2032; position and transforming the whole cluster into a ball-shaped cluster. FL/&#x3b2;-CD (red curve) illustrated the cup-shaped &#x3b2;-CD being compressed on the width dimension. Combing the increased electron density in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>B</figref>, curve 4, it is proposed that FL entered the CD cavity and changed the cluster shape from cup to more eclipsed. This was also validated in NMR with reduced diffusion coefficient obtained discussed above. While FL&#x2014;OH was interacting on the outside smaller opening of the cup-shape CD (No electron density increased), transforming it into a ball-shaped cluster. Combing information from both NMR and SAXS, a dynamic movement of the FL can be depicted: At discharged state, some of the FL can enter the CD cavity. While charged, FL&#x2014;OH moved out and interacted mainly at the outside of the CD.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0125">A battery current response test at controlled voltage was conducted with 0.1 M 27S4CFL to examine the battery discharge kinetics at different states of charge (SOC) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). In prior tests for this FL derivative, the two plateaus observed in the charging curve (more distinct at faster charging rate) suggested a competitive event between the disproportionation coupled electrochemical process and the consecutive two-electron pure electrochemical process (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The 25% SOC electrolyte solution was considered as radical anion rich electrolyte state due to low SOC at faster charging rate. In situ EPR also validated this understanding.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0126">On the charging towards 25% SOC, the radical anion concentration was increasing and didn't reach a reverse trend point (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>). As the battery was initially charged to 25% SOC at 20 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, the radical concentration was observed increasing to 17 mM during the charging process. On contrary, during the full battery charge process at same current density, the radical concentration was observed to have a concave shape, with the radical concentration increasing in the first half then decreasing. In either case, the radical concentration was observed much smaller the value calculated assuming &#x201c;no disproportionation involved.&#x201d; For example, for a battery charged to 25% SOC (2.8 min), without disproportionation, 50 mM of radical concentration would be expected. For a battery in the full charge process, without disproportionation, 100 mM of radical concentration would be expected at the 50% SOC point. Instead, only 25 mM of radical concentration was captured. The radical concentration at 25% SOC was much higher than in the fully charged electrolyte.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0127">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, at 25% SOC, in the case with &#x3b2;-CD, the battery exhibited a smaller average discharge current density under 0.9V controlled voltage discharge, which suggested a negative effect of &#x3b2;-CD on the discharge of radical anion rich electrolyte (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, reaction I). The battery was constructed with 12 mL 0.1M 27S4CFL anolyte. The catholyte was prepared with 500mL 0.1 M ferrocyanide/0.05 M ferricyanide/1 M NaOH to maintain a relative constant catholyte SOC and constant anode potential under controlled voltage test, based on Nernst Equation. With increasing initial electrolyte SOC (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b></figref>, 50% and 75% SOC), the electrolyte composition at the beginning of the discharge shifted from radical anion rich to fluorenol rich with less radical anion, due to higher SOC (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>). When the &#x3b2;-CD was present, the battery exhibited higher current density than the corresponding blank test. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> (fully charged), the battery electrolyte was first fully charged and fluorenol was the predominant species in the electrolyte (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>). In the case with &#x3b2;-CD, the battery exhibited a 1.6 times peak current density, which suggested a positive effect on the discharge of fluorenol.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0128">A negative effect on the comproportionation reaction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, reaction II) brought by &#x3b2;-CD can be readily verified via UV-vis and EPR. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a graph of UV-Vis results showing that comproportionation was reduced when &#x3b2;-CD was added. Data was collected over 800 seconds. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows EPR spectra of the pristine solution (a mixture of 0.001 M FLOH and 0.001 M FL at a volume ratio of 1:1, solid line) and with the addition of 0.001 M &#x3b2;-CD (dashed line), the samples were mixed inside glove box and EPR was performed at equilibrium (20 min after mixing). The splitting pattern is consistent with a radical center at the close proximity of five protons. The presence of &#x3b2;-CD does not change the radical species but reduced the radical concentration by 60% estimated form peak intensity. The hydrogen bonding between FLOH&#x2014;H6 and &#x3b2;-CD as well as the clustering between FL and &#x3b2;-CD may lead to the lower radical yield. This is also empirically understandable due to larger steric hindrance of &#x3b2;-CD in solution for the bi-molecular comproportionation reaction and slower diffusion of the complex overserved in NMR (Tables 3 and 4).</p><p id="p-0154" num="0129">Taken together the above observations, the result suggested that in flow battery operation, &#x3b2;-CD slightly slowed the radical anion oxidation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, reaction I), slowed the comproportionation reaction to chemically regenerate radical anion to sustain discharge (FIG. 4, reaction II), and significantly boosted the fluorenol PCET process to electrochemically regenerate intermediate radical anion sustaining a much higher discharge current (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, reaction III). This approach bypass the kinetic limitation on chemical regeneration of intermediate radical anion, especially at extreme SOC and DOD.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0130">A measurement of substrate oxidation rate constant was performed using H-cell by Chronocoulometry. Using a pseudo first order reaction model (Hammerich et al., <i>Organic electrochemistry:revised and expanded </i>2015, CRC Press; Sanyal et al., Angew. <i>Chem. Int. Ed. </i>2021, 60:290-296), the measured oxidation kinetics of radical anion and fluorenol were in good agreement with the battery current response test result (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-<b>17</b>B</figref>). IR correction was applied using the current interruption method in Gamry. A diluted solution and a stirring bar were used, and short applied potential time was applied. All contributed to a system excluding mass transfer influence and relatively constant species concentration (on the assumption that surface concentration same to bulk solution in short time period), with a focus on the oxidizable species oxidation rate on the electrode surface. The addition of &#x3b2;-CD resulted in a slightly reduced oxidation of the radical anion. On the other side, the oxidation of fluorenol was much slower than radical anion oxidation, and the addition of &#x3b2;-CD resulted 1.6 times increment of fluorenol oxidation, achieving a faster supply of radical anion. This was verified with in situ EPR measurement in a battery cell under controlled voltage operation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>). In order to reach a relatively constant anode potential, 42 times of catholyte (2:1 ratio of Fe<sup>2+: </sup>Fe<sup>3+</sup>) was paired to maintain a relative constant catholyte SOC. By Nernst equation calculation, a theoretical maximum of 0.36 mV of potential fluctuation would be expected at anode side, which was acceptable in the testing system. Starting the discharge process from a fully charged electrolyte at controlled voltage, the radical concentration generated during the discharge was monitored (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>). When &#x3b2;-CD was present, a higher radical concentration was observed, which corresponded to a higher current density at the same DOD under the same controlled voltage. As a result, the battery discharge kinetics was boosted by a positive-sum outcome of all process involved (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), with increased radical anion supply.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0131">As discussed herein, the stronger the proton acceptor, the more favorable PT thermodynamically. Under same solution pH (hydroxide as proton acceptor), the lower the fluorenol pKa, the higher the PT driving force thermodynamically, the better discharge rate capability. For the same reaction using a fixed fluorenol derivative, though the thermodynamic driving force remains the same, the employment of a proton regulator could function as a kinetic booster for this PT process (as discussed above for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> in proton exchange NMR). From the other side of this PCET process, the ET driving force is also at center of the topic. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, a plot of the reaction log(k<sub>obs</sub>) against ET driving force (F&#x394;E<sub>ox</sub>/2.303RT) was presented using a pseudo first order reaction model (Hammerich et al., <i>Organic electrochemistry:revised and expanded </i>2015, CRC Press; Markle et al., <i>Science Advances </i>2018, 4:eaat5776; Tyburski et al., <i>JACS </i>2021, 143:560-576). The Br{acute over (&#xf8;)}nsted &#x3b1; (defined as the slope of the logarithm of the PCET rate constant versus the scaled driving force (Sayfutyarova, <i>JACS </i>2018, 140:15641-15645) was fitted at 0.58, suggesting PT lagging behind of ET during the transition state (Sav&#xe9;ant, <i>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. </i>2019, 58:2125-2128). With addition of CD, a larger Br{acute over (&#xf8;)}nsted &#x3b1; was obtained, suggesting an even more lagging PT due to proton relay process. In comparison, a deuterated fluorenol oxidation rate was observed of 1.4 times enhancement with addition of &#x3b2;-CD. In the deuterated fluorenol test, the additive boosting effect was smaller than the protonated version. Following the method described in Method section, a KIE value of 2.58 was obtained for the blank test case, and 2.42 for the &#x3b2;-CD case at the applied potential of &#x2212;0.65V vs Hg/HgO. This smaller boosting effect was attributed to heavier deuterium than hydrogen. Kinetic isotope effect values of 2.58 in blank case and 2.42 in &#x3b2;-CD case were obtained.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0132">Proposed mechanisms are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> and discussed below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> shows a proposed fluorenol PCET reaction mechanism to generate radical anion 7 (two protons and one electron removal).

Based on literature (Wang et al., <i>Nat. Commun. </i>2019, 10:2796; Hammerich et al., <i>Organic electrochemistry:revised and expanded </i>2015, CRC Press), during direct alcohol oxidation process on electrode with no novel metal catalyst involved, C&#x2014;H is the first proton being removed in general proposed mechanism (leading to carbon radical 6&#x2032; instead of O radical 6) while O&#x2014;H is indeed the most acidic proton in alcohol. By DFT calculation (method B3LYP/6-311++G**+DFTD3 in implicit water solvent) 6&#x2032; is 32.6 kcal/mol lower energy compared to 6. As a result, 6&#x2032; was considered as the PCET product and 7 was detected in alkaline water solution in EPR. As illustrated during the H-bonding complex discussion above, with increasing &#x3b2;-CD ratio, the proton exchange rate of fluorenol benzylic C&#x2014;H was increased (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). This observation confirmed that complex formation accelerated route a(1&#x2032;-2) PT by lowering the proton exchange barrier. The following reaction 2-7 was challenging to identify a clear pathway between concerted or step-wise PT-ET due to proton exchange observed prior. Alternatively, taking into consideration of the calculated Br{acute over (&#xf8;)}nsted a at a value larger than 0.5 and KIE values resided in concerted pathway range in literature reports, route B was proposed (Hammes-Schiffer, <i>Chem. Rev. </i>2010, 110:6937-6938; Huynh et al., <i>Chem. Rev. </i>2007, 102:5004-6063; Sayfutyarova et al., <i>JACS, </i>2019, 141:15183-15189; Darcy et al., <i>JACS </i>2019, 141:10777-10787; Markle et al., <i>Science Advances </i>2018, 4:eaat5776; Sav&#xe9;ant, <i>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. </i>2019, 58:2126-2128; Tyburski et al., <i>JACS </i>2021, 143:560-576). By forming the H-bonding complex and providing proton acceptor well positioned (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>), a concerted pathway route b (1&#x2032;-6&#x2032;) would bypass the high energy barrier for ET (1&#x2032;-5).

A variation on the oxidation rate was observed due to multiple factors and theoretical limitations on the model applied here. When the pKa is too low (e.g., sodium acetate), the additive cannot accept a proton from the fluorenol derivative. When the pKa is too high (e.g., t-butanol or urea), the proton cannot be delivered to the hydroxide. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, the additive conjugate base serves as proton acceptor to participate in the fluorenol oxidation process. The conjugate base was generated from the added additive in acid form. In the experiment, the total amount of proton acceptors (hydroxide and conjugate base) was controlled the same, except in the NaOAc case to maintain solution pH. The ratio of hydroxide and conjugate base was controlled by the pKa of additive and water. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, varying oxidations rates were measured with different additive pKa values. The additive acid form was employed in alkaline water during the experiments. The pKa of the additive, pKa of water and solution pH were considered. Also due to the intrinsic molecular difference between each proton acceptor, the H-bonding ability between FL&#x2014;OH and additive was considered. For example, in guanidinium salt case, the proton acceptor is a charge neutral species, which may introduce a weaker hydrogen bonding when compared to other anionic proton acceptors. The electrode adsorption influence cannot be excluded from this rate measurement. On a larger picture (assuming the electrode surface substrate adsorption variation is small enough when using low concentration additive), pKa match theory applies here on the observed oxidation rate (C/s), generating a volcanic performance (Wang et al., <i>Nat. Catal. </i>2021, 4:753-762).</p><p id="p-0161" num="0134">The proton regulation strategy was confirmed effective to various degrees in a battery context with a series of additives with a range of pKa values and 27S4CFL as a model fluorenone/fluorenol derivative (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>). CV of the additives was screened to warrant a redox inert character to be applicable in RFB. Within the water window, no redox event was observed from the additives. No obvious alteration was observed on 274FL redox events by CV with additives present. With the addition of organic additives, some physical properties of the electrolyte, such as viscosity, conductivity, full cell resistance, and charge transfer resistance revealed a negative effect on the battery performance, due to the increased viscosity and decreased conductivity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>-<b>25</b></figref>). The results were verified with a battery test result using 2,7-dihydroxyanthraquinone (DHAQ) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b>A-<b>26</b>C</figref>). The battery physical parameters were negatively affected by CD, and the performance was worse, particularly at higher current density. The interaction between FL and &#x3b2;-CD does not occur with DHAQ, thus the influence on the viscosity does not translate into the same ratio for battery rate performance. Additionally, DHAQ was generally reported via CPET mechanism, with no limitation on PT. In the FL battery case, the additive positive-sum effect was an overall result targeting a coupled chemical reaction mechanism and enabling CPET pathway by providing a proton acceptor in an H-bonding structure. In the FL case, in contrast to DHAQ, the rate capability experienced degrees of enhancement (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>). A detailed discussion regarding battery performance in each case is presented below.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0135">As expected, the sorbitol case revealed the highest rate capability enhancement due to its lowest viscosity increment, befitting a better mass transfer. The discharge capacity remained 81.4% at 80 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, 68.4% at 100 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>compared to the 5 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>test. Both &#x3b2;-CD and &#x3b1;-CD cases demonstrated similar effects due to their inherent similar molecular structure and physical property. The guanidium salt containing electrolyte had the lowest electrolyte conductivity with the cell performance lower than other additives cases. This phenomenon was suspected to be related to membrane fouling (<i>Journal of Power Sources </i>2010, 195:30-38). A full cell resistance increment was observed during a 24 h period monitoring, suggesting electrode passivation or membrane fouling (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>). The diglycol case showed the lowest enhancement. A control experiment using diglyme was conducted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>) due to their similar molecular chain like structure except the hydroxyl group and methoxy group difference. Another purpose was to rule out the liquid form diglycol influence, which technically can be considered as organic solvent and may cause a water concentration (proton source) difference compared with other additive cases. The comparison result still suggested under similar ratio of organic solvent and water, that a proton acceptor other than hydroxide was needed for the enhancement. The 2 M urea case test was an example of an additive that doesn't generate anionic RNH<sup>&#x2212;</sup> in alkaline water as a proton acceptor, nor have the ability to serve as a proton acceptor to generate RNH<sub>3</sub><sub><sup2>+</sup2></sub> in alkaline solution. Even with better conductivity and viscosity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-<b>24</b>D</figref>) than the other tested additives, no boosting effect was observed. This example suggested the proton loop is important (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, reaction III). To summarize, suitable proton acceptors can enhance fluorenol PCET process for increased radical anion supply. In a battery context, battery performance was based on the balance of the negative (physical character) and positive effects (fluorenol oxidation) of the additive.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0136">Although the curves are similar, the charge and discharge curves of the test with additives showed increased accessible discharge capacity. The radical anion kinetics were verified to be on par with other reported redox active materials like DHAQ by rotating disk electrode (RDE) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>A-<b>29</b>D</figref>). The study was performed with 27S4CFL (5 mM) in 0.1 M &#x3b2;-CD/1 M NaOH. The calculated diffusion coefficient was 7.56&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>cm<sup>2</sup>/s. The calculated kinetic reduction rate constant for the first electron was 3.51&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>cm/s. The first electron reduction rate constant was similar to a blank test, while the diffusion coefficient was 10 times slower than blank test (Feng et al., <i>Science </i>2012, 372:836). The addition of a proton regulator like &#x3b2;-CD serves as an additional route to supply radical anion for battery discharge and overcome the kinetic limitation by comproportionation reaction rate at high DOD.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0137">This enhancing phenomenon can be extended to other substituted FLs (e.g., 27S4CFL, 4C7SFL, and 27F4CFL) sharing the same coupled chemical reaction electrochemical process mechanism (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b>A</figref>-30C). The additive was controlled at 0.1 M; 1 M NaOH was used as the supporting electrolyte. It should be noted that due to different substituents, the fluorenol compounds have different pKa values and can behave differently in the absence of the additive.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0138">A concave-shaped performance with varying the ratio of FL (0.5 M) and &#x3b2;-CD additive peaked at 5.8:1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>). This concave-shaped performance as a function of material/additive ratio confirms the best battery rate performance is achieved when the negative and positive effects of the additive are balanced. The result suggested the addition of &#x3b2;-CD can exhibit an overall positive effect when added in a suitable amount. The higher the current density, the more pronounced the peak performance was.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0139">For practical battery design, active material solubility is one of the design principles. &#x3b2;-CD is well studied for its interaction with substrates via guest-host interactions, thus resulting in increased guest solubility (Li et al., <i>ChemSusChem </i>2021, 14:745-752). Fluorenone also follows this discipline. The measured solubility of 4C7SFL was close to 1.9 M (corresponding to 101.8 Ah/L volumetric capacity) with less than 0.1 M &#x3b2;-CD added (close to 30% increase compared with the solubility of 4C7SFL without &#x3b2;-CD). With such highly uneven ratio of FL and &#x3b2;-CD, it is believed that the hydrotropic effect plays a major role in the solubility increment. The large molecular structure of &#x3b2;-CD also is an advantage, potentially alleviating crossover during long time operation. With these additional benefits, both 27S4CFL and 4C7SFL were subjected to extended battery cycling test at close to saturated concentration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>32</b>A and <b>32</b>B</figref>, respectively) with &#x3b2;-CD as additive. In the demonstrated 27S4CFL case (0.7 M 27S4CFL/1 eq NaOH, 0.86 M &#x3b2;-CD, 1 M NaOH; catholyte&#x2014;0.3 M potassium ferrocyanide, 0.3 M potassium ferricyanide, 1 M NaOH), the battery exhibited 0.025%/day observed capacity decay rate over the continuous operation of over half year, with VE decreased 9% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>A</figref>). In the galvanostatic step, the current was held at 40 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>until the 1.6 cutoff voltage was reached during charging, and at 20 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>until the 0.2 V cutoff voltage was reached during discharge. In the potentiostatic step, the potential was held at 1.4 V until 2 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>was reached during charging, and at 0.6 V until the 0.2 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>cutoff current was reached during discharging. The catholyte material was refreshed at cycle 1600. This VE decrease suggested the battery experienced internal resistance increase, potentially resulted from membrane fouling and electrode passivation. A similar capacity decay rate was observed in the 4C7SFL case, at 0.020%/day over 160 days, with around 5% VE drop (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>B</figref>). The same galvanic/potentiostatic cycling protocol was applied, except 20 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>was employed at the constant current step. The battery voltage efficiency experienced fluctuations in both cases, which were being tested during the same time period. This fluctuation was attributed to environment temperature change during the testing period. The stable cycling with low capacity decay rate are the comprehensive result of battery operation including material crossover, cell parts/membrane aging and material degradation over a period of more than half year. This demonstration suggested &#x3b2;-CD to be an exceptional additive for higher battery energy density, long time stability and inexpensive/non-toxic homogeneous organic catalyst for battery kinetics.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0140">In view of the many possible embodiments to which the principles of the present disclosure may be applied, it should be recognized that the illustrated embodiments are only preferred examples and should not be taken as limiting the scope of the present disclosure.
