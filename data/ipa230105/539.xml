Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a medical system that includes variations of motor-driven tubular cutter or arthroscopic shavers that are configured for both mechanical cutting and electrosurgical cutting, ablation and coagulation procedures.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Background Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In endoscopic and other surgical procedures including subacromial decompression, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction involving notchplasty, and arthroscopic resection of the acromioclavicular joint, there is a need for cutting and removal of bone and soft tissue. Currently, surgeons use arthroscopic shavers and burrs having rotational cutting surfaces to remove hard tissue in such procedures.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To promote efficiency, endoscopic tool systems including a reusable handpiece and a selection of interchangeable tool probes having different working ends have been proposed. Such working ends may each have two or more functionalities, such as soft tissue removal and hard tissue resection, so such tools systems can provide dozens of specific functionalities, providing great flexibility.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While a significant advantage, the need for one tool system to accommodate such flexibility is a challenge. In particular, it is necessary that the handpiece and control unit for the system be provided with correct information on the identity of the tool probe that has been attached as well as the operational parameters of the tool probe during use.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide improved surgical systems and methods for their use, such as improved arthroscopic tissue cutting and removal system wherein a motor-driven electrosurgical device is provided for cutting and removing bone or soft tissue from a joint or other site. It is a further object invention to provide improved systems and methods for device identification, monitoring, and control, such as controlled operational stopping and starting of motor-driven components in default positions. At least some of these objectives will be met by the inventions described herein.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a first aspect, the present invention provides a tissue cutting probe comprising an outer sleeve assembly and an inner sleeve assembly. Both the outer sleeve assembly and the inner sleeve assembly have a proximal end, a distal end, and central passage extending therebetween, and the inner sleeve assembly is coaxially and rotatably received in the central passage of the outer sleeve assembly. A burr having a plurality of metal cutting edges is carried on or comprises a first side of the distal end of the inner sleeve assembly, and an electrode is carried or comprises a second side of the distal end of the inner sleeve assembly. Such probes are may be used in a variety of tissue cutting, tissue ablation, tissue coagulation and other surgical procedures but will find particular use in procedures involving the cutting of bone and other hard tissues with the burr and the ablation and coagulation of soft tissues with the electrode.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the first side and the second side of the distal end on the inner sleeve assembly are on opposed surfaces of the inner sleeve assembly. For example, the burr may be formed on or comprise a metal member that extends at least 180&#xb0; circumferentially about the distal end of the inner sleeve assembly, and/or the electrode may be carried on or comprise a dielectric body on the distal end of the inner sleeve assembly.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the probe may further comprise a scoop extends distally from the distal end of the outer sleeve assembly. For example, the scoop may be axially aligned with the burr and the electrode on the inner sleeve assembly so that the scoop will alternatively cover each of the burr and the electrode as the inner sleeve assembly is rotated within the outer sleeve assembly.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, one or more aspiration ports may be formed in or through a wall of the outer sleeve assembly and/or one or more lateral openings may be formed in a wall of the inner sleeve assembly. The one or more aspiration ports are typically positioned to align with the one or more lateral openings as the inner sleeve assembly is rotated within the outer sleeve assembly. That is, the aspiration port(s) and the lateral opening(s) will periodically and/or success successively fall into and out of alignment. When aligned, a negative pressure applied through the central passage of the inner sleeve assembly will be able to draw or suction tissue debris though the aligned openings to at least partially clear the surgical field, typically an arthroscopic or other endoscopic field filled with saline or other fluid.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a second aspect, the present invention provides a tissue cutting system comprising a probe and a controller. The probe may comprise an elongated shaft, an active electrode, and a return electrode. The elongated shaft comprises an inner sleeve assembly co-axially mounted to rotate about a longitudinal axis within an outer sleeve assembly. The inner sleeve assembly is rotatable at greater than 1000 RPM within outer sleeve assembly. The active electrode and the return electrode disposed on a distal end of the inner sleeve assembly. The controller is configured to deliver radiofrequency (RF) current to the active and return electrodes and to limit RF current delivery when the active electrode is proximate the return electrode during rotation of the inner sleeve assembly. Such a system allows the physician to deliver current to the active and return electrodes as the inner sleeve assembly is being rotated at very high rates with reduced risk of shorting the active and return electrodes as hey move in and out of proximity to each other as the inner sleeve assembly rotates.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments of the systems of the present invention, the controller is configured to sense current or voltage flowing to the active electrode and compare a sensed value to a reference value. The current flow can be disabled when the sensed value exceeds the reference value, thus inhibiting or prevent shorting between the active and return electrodes. Typically, current flow may be enabled when the sensed value falls below the reference value. For example, the current flow may be enabled or disabled each time the reference value is exceeded or falls below by a threshold value to prevent oscillation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a third aspect, the present invention provides method for cutting tissue comprising engaging a distal end of a probe against a tissue target. A distal end of a sleeve assembly carries a burr having a plurality of metal cutting edges on a first side thereof and an electrode on a second side thereof. The sleeve assembly may be rotated to successively engage the burr and the electrode against the target tissue, typically comprising both hard tissue such as bone and soft tissue. A radiofrequency (RF) current may be selectively applying to the electrode and a return electrode as the sleeve assembly is rotated, where current flow is enable when the electrode is remote from the return electrode and current flow is disabled when the electrode is proximate the return electrode as the sleeve assembly is rotated, thus reducing or eliminating the risk of shorting.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments of the methods of the present invention, rotating may comprise rotating at a speed of at least 1000 RPM.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments of the methods of the present invention, selectively applying current may comprises sensing a current or voltage flowing to the active electrode and comparing a sensed value to a reference value, wherein the current flow is disabled when the sensed value exceeds the reference value. For example, the current flow may be enabled when the sensed value falls below the reference value, e.g. the current flow may be enabled or disabled when the reference value is exceeded or fallen below by a threshold value to prevent oscillation.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments of the methods of the present invention, the active electrode may be on an inner sleeve and the return electrode may be on an outer sleeve, where the inner sleeve is rotated within the outer sleeve.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the methods of the present invention may further comprise drawing a negative pressure on the probe to aspirate cutting debris as the sleeve assembly is rotated.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments of the methods of the present invention, the first side and the second side may be on opposed surfaces of the inner sleeve assembly. For example, the burr may be formed on a metal member that extends at least 180&#xb0; circumferentially about the distal end of the inner sleeve assembly and/or the electrode may be carried on a dielectric body on the distal end of the inner sleeve assembly.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments of the methods of the present invention, a scoop may extend distally from the distal end of the outer sleeve assembly. For example, the scoop may be axially aligned with the burr and the electrode on the inner sleeve assembly so that the scoop will alternatively cover each of the burr and the electrode as the inner sleeve assembly is rotated within the outer sleeve assembly.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In alternative aspects, present invention provides improved apparatus and methods for identifying and controlling working components, such as motor-driven and other powered components, of surgical systems, particularly for arthroscopic and other surgical systems including (1) handpieces having motor drive units and (2) probes which are selectively and removably attached to the handpieces. In exemplary embodiments, the present invention provides methods and systems which rely on magnets and magnetic sensors for providing information to system controllers both in a static mode, where a laparoscopic or other tool is not being driven, and in a dynamic mode, where the tool is being driven by the motor drive. In particular embodiments, the magnets are permanent magnets having North poles and South poles, where the magnets are typically mounted on or otherwise attached or coupled to components of a detachable probe forming part of an arthroscopic system, and the sensors are Hall sensors which are in the handpiece of the arthroscopic system. By using multiple magnets and multiple sensors, different types of information can be provided to the system controller, such as identification of the tool in the detachable probe, operating characteristics of the probe, system calibration information, and the like. While the exemplary embodiments of present invention typically rely on magnetic sensors, static and dynamic data acquisition from the tool probe to the associated controller and be accomplished with other sensors as well, such as optical sensors which are able to read information in both a static mode and in a dynamic mode.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In a first alternative aspect of the present invention, an arthroscopic system comprises a handpiece and a probe. The handpiece includes a motor drive, and the probe has a proximal hub and an elongate shaft which extends about a longitudinal axis to a working end of the probe. The hub is configured for detachably coupling to the handpiece, and the motor drive is configured to couple to a rotating drive coupling in the hub when the hub is coupled to the handpiece. A first magnetic component is carried by the hub, and a second magnetic component is coupled to rotate with the rotating drive coupling.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In specific alternative aspects, the hub may be configured for detachable coupling to the handpiece in opposing rotational orientations, such as an orientation where a working end of the probe is facing upwardly and a second orientation where the working end of the probe is facing downwardly relative to the handpiece. In such embodiments, the first magnetic component may comprise first and second independent magnets, typically permanent magnets have North poles and South poles, disposed in or on opposing sides of the hub and spaced outwardly from the longitudinal axis. The first and second independent magnets of the first magnetic component will typically have a &#x201c;polar orientation,&#x201d; for example the North poles will be oriented in opposite directions relative to said axis. Typically, though not necessarily, the first and second independent magnets may have similar magnetic field strengths. In such embodiments, the handpiece may further comprise a first sensor configured for &#x201c;statically&#x201d; sensing a magnetic field of the first or second independent magnets when located adjacent the first sensor. By &#x201c;statically&#x201d; sensing, it is meant that the magnets do not need to be moving relative to the sensor. The sensor will thus be able to generate a signal indicating whether the working end is in its upward-facing orientation or its downward-facing orientation. The first sensor may be further configured for generating a probe identification signal based on the magnetic field strength (or other magnetic characteristic) which correlates a probe type with different magnetic field strengths, typically by using a look-up table maintained in an associated controller.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In still alternative embodiments, the second magnetic component comprises third and fourth independent magnets disposed in or on opposing sides of the rotating drive coupling. The third and fourth independent magnets of the second magnetic component will typically have North poles in opposing orientations relative to said axis, usually in a manner similar to the first and second independent magnets. The handpiece will further comprise a second sensor configured for sensing a magnetic field of the third or fourth independent magnets as the magnet comes into proximity to the second sensor. In this way, the second sensor can dynamically sense and generate a signal indicating a rotational parameter of the rotating drive coupling. For example, the rotational parameter may comprise a rotational position of the drive coupling. Alternatively or additionally, the rotational parameter may comprise a rotational speed of the drive coupling based on the rotational positioning over a time interval.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">These arthroscopic and other surgical systems may be further configured for determining orientation of the motor-driven component so that the working end can be stopped in a desired position. For example, the second magnetic component carried by the drive coupling may be in a fixed predetermined rotational relationship to a motor-driven component in the working end. In this way, a rotational positioning of the component in the working end van be controlled based on the rotational position of the drive coupling.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Such systems of the present invention may further comprise a controller configured to receive the signals generated by the sensors and provide monitoring and control of the endoscopic or other surgical tool based on the received signals. For example, by receiving signals generated by the first sensor within the hub, at least one of probe-orientation and probe identification can be determined. Similarly, by receiving signals generated by the second sensor within the hub, the controller may be configured to monitor and/or control the motor speed and other operational characteristics.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a second alternative aspect of the present invention, a method for performing an arthroscopic procedure comprises providing a system including a handpiece with a sensor. The system further comprises a probe having a proximal hub, a longitudinal axis, and a working end. The hub typically carries first and second magnets having North and South poles. The hub is selectively coupled to the handpiece with the working end of the probe in either an upward orientation or a downward orientation. The first magnet is located proximately to sensor when the working end is in the upward orientation, and the second magnet is located proximately to sensor when the working end is in the down orientation. In this way, an upward orientation or a downward orientation of the working end can be determined based on whether a North pole or a South pole of the magnet is proximate to the sensor. Such orientational information is used for a variety of purposes, including selecting a controller algorithm for operating the probe based on the identified orientation of the working end.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a third alternative aspect of the present invention, an arthroscopic or other surgical method comprises providing a system including a handpiece with a sensor. The system further comprises a probe with a proximal hub, a longitudinal axis, and a working end. The hub will carry first and second magnets of similar strengths and having North and South poles. The hub is coupled to the handpiece, and a magnetic strength of either (or both) of the magnets is sensed using a sensor in the handpiece to identify the probe type based on the sensed magnetic strength. Identification of the probe type is useful for a variety of purposes, including allowing selection of a control algorithm (to be used by a controller coupled to probe and sensors) to control the working end of the tool based on the identified probe type.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a fourth alternative aspect, an arthroscopic or other surgical procedure comprises providing a system including a handpiece with a motor drive. The system further comprises a probe having a proximal hub, a longitudinal axis, a rotating drive coupling, and a working end. The rotating drive coupling typically carries first and second magnets having North and South poles where each pole is positioned in a different orientation relative to the axis. The hub is attached to the handpiece to couple the motor drive to the rotating drive coupling in the hub. The rotating drive coupling actuates a motor-driven or other component in the working end, e.g. the motor drive may be activated to rotate the drive coupling and actuate the motor-driven component. A varying magnetic parameter is sensed with a sensor in the handpiece as the drive coupling rotates in order to generate sensor signals. A rotational position of the drive coupling can thus be determined, and the corresponding positions of the motor-driven component calculated using a positioning algorithm responsive to the sensor signals. The motor drive can be selectively deactivated at a desired rotational position based on the positional information which has been thus determined. After deactivating the motor drive, the system can dynamically brake the motor drive to thereby stop rotation of the drive coupling and stop movement of the motor-driven component in a selective stop position in a highly accurate manner.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a fifth alternative aspect of the present invention, an arthroscopic procedure comprises providing a system including a handpiece with a motor drive. The system further comprises a probe with a proximal hub and an elongate shaft extending about an axis to a working end. The hub is configured for detachable coupling to the handpiece, and the motor drive is configured to couple to a rotating drive coupling in the hub. The drive coupling, in turn, carries first and second magnets with North and South poles positioned in different orientations relative to the axis. The hub is coupled to the handpiece, and the motor drive is activated to rotate the drive coupling and magnets through an arc of at least 180&#xb0;. A varying strength of each magnet is then sensed with a sensor in the handpiece as the drive coupling rotates. A rotational position of the drive coupling responsive to the varying strength of each magnet can be calibrated in order to increase accuracy in subsequent calculation of the sensed strengths of the magnets.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a sixth alternative aspect of the present invention, an arthroscopic procedure comprises providing a handpiece with a motor drive. The system further comprises a probe having a proximal hub and an elongate shaft extending about a longitudinal axis to a working end having a motor-driven component. The motor-driven component includes a radio frequency (RF) electrode, and a hub is configured for detachable coupling to the handpiece. The motor drive is configured to couple to a rotating drive in the coupling of the hub, and the rotating drive coupling is configured to carry first and second magnets with North and South poles positioned in different orientations relative to the axis. The hub is coupled to the handpiece, and the drive coupling and motor-driven component are positioned in a selected stop position. The RF electrode is typically exposed in the selected stop position and can be introduced to a target site to engage or interface with tissue. RF current is then delivered to the RF electrode, and a positioning algorithm responsive to sensor signals continuously monitors the rotational position of the drive coupling and the corresponding position of the motor-driven component and the RF electrode while RF current is being delivered. Such position monitoring is useful because it allows the positioning algorithm to sense a rotation or rotational deviation greater than a predetermined amount, in which case the delivery of RF current to the RF electrode can be terminated. Additionally or alternatively, the positioning algorithm can further activate or adjust the motor drive to return the RF electrode back to a selected or desired stop position.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a seventh alternative aspect, an arthroscopic procedure comprises providing a handpiece with a motor drive and a probe with a proximal hub. An elongate shaft of the hub extends about an axis to a working end, and a motor driven component in the working end includes an RF electrode. The hub is configured for detachably coupling to the handpiece, and the motor drive is configured to couple to a rotating drive coupling in the hub. The rotating drive carries first and second magnets with North and South poles having different orientations relative to the axis. The hub is coupled to the handpiece, and the drive coupling and motor-driven component may be positioned in a selected stop position. The RF electrode may be engaged against a target issue surface or interface, and an RF current may be delivered to the RF electrode. Using a positioning algorithm responsive to sensor signals indicating a rotational position of the drive coupling, the RF electrode can be oscillated in the range from 20 Hz to 2000 Hz. Often, oscillation of the RF electrode at a rate ranging from 40 Hz to 400 Hz.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an eighth alternative aspect, the present invention comprises a method for providing information from a surgical probe to a controller. A hub of the probe is attached to a handpiece connected to the controller. The hub carries indicia, and a first set of data obtained from reading the first set of indicia on the hub may be read using a first sensor on the handpiece, where the first set of data can then be sent to the controller. A second set of indicia on the hub is also read using a second sensor on the handpiece, and a second set of data obtained from the second reading may also be sent to the controller. The first set of data includes at least one of probe identification information and probe orientation information, and the second set of data includes at least probe operational information.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In alternative embodiments, the first and/or second set of indicia may comprise magnets, as taught in any of previously described embodiments. In alternative embodiments, however, the first and/or second sets of indicia may comprise optical encoding or any other type of data encoding that can be read using sensors in the handpiece. For example, the first set of indicia may comprise optical encoding including a scannable code on a stationary component of the hub, such as a housing. The first set of indicia incorporates said at least one of probe identification information and probe orientation information and can be read when the code is static relative to the handpiece, typically using a stationary optical scanner, such as a bar or 3D code reader. In other examples, the second set of indicia may comprise optical encoding configured to be read by a scannable code reader, e.g., markings on a rotatable component of the hub, wherein at least the probe operational information is configured to read from the markings as the rotatable component dynamically rotates. For example, the markings may be read by an optical counter that can determine a rotation speed, such as revolutions per minute (RPM).</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Various embodiments of the present invention will now be discussed with reference to the appended drawings.

invention relates to bone cutting and tissue removal devices and related methods of use. Several variations of the invention will now be described to provide an overall understanding of the principles of the form, function and methods of use of the devices disclosed herein. In general, the present disclosure provides for variations of arthroscopic tools adapted for cutting bone, soft tissue, meniscal tissue, and for RF ablation and coagulation. The arthroscopic tools are typically disposable and are configured for detachable coupling to a non-disposable handpiece that carries a motor drive component. This description of the general principles of this invention is not meant to limit the inventive concepts in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In one variation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the arthroscopic system <b>100</b> of the present invention provides a handpiece <b>104</b> with motor drive <b>105</b> and a disposable shaver assembly or probe <b>110</b> with a proximal hub <b>120</b> that can be received by receiver or bore <b>122</b> in the handpiece <b>104</b>. In one aspect, the probe <b>110</b> has a working end <b>112</b> that carries a high-speed rotating cutter that is configured for use in many arthroscopic surgical applications, including but not limited to treating bone in shoulders, knees, hips, wrists, ankles and the spine.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>A and <b>3</b>A</figref>, it can be seen that probe <b>110</b> has a shaft <b>125</b> extending along longitudinal axis <b>128</b> that comprises an outer sleeve <b>140</b> and an inner sleeve <b>142</b> rotatably disposed therein with the inner sleeve <b>142</b> carrying a distal ceramic cutting member <b>145</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>).

All of the probes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>7</b></figref> can have a hub similar to hub <b>120</b> of probe <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> for coupling to the same handpiece <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, with some of the probes (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref>) having a hub mechanism for converting rotational motion to linear motion. All of the patent applications just identified in this paragraph are incorporated herein by this reference.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> further shows that the system <b>100</b> also includes a negative pressure source <b>220</b> coupled to aspiration tubing <b>222</b> which communicates with a flow channel <b>224</b> in handpiece <b>104</b> and can cooperate with any of the probes <b>110</b>, <b>200</b>A, <b>200</b>B or <b>200</b>C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>B, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>.

The controller <b>165</b> and microprocessor therein together with control algorithms are provided to operate and control all functionality, which includes controlling the motor drive <b>105</b> to move a motor-driven component of any probe working end <b>110</b>, <b>200</b>A, <b>200</b>B or <b>200</b>C, as well as for controlling the RF source <b>225</b> and the negative pressure source <b>220</b> which can aspirate fluid and tissue debris to collection reservoir <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As can be understood from the above description of the system <b>100</b> and handpiece <b>104</b>, the controller <b>165</b> and controller algorithms need to be configured to perform and automate many tasks to provide for system functionality. In a first aspect, controller algorithms are needed for device identification so that when any of the different probes types <b>110</b>, <b>200</b>A, <b>200</b>B, <b>200</b>C or <b>200</b>D of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>4</b>-<b>7</b></figref> are coupled to handpiece <b>104</b>, the controller <b>165</b> will recognize the probe type and then select algorithms for operating the motor drive <b>105</b>, RF source <b>225</b> and negative pressure source <b>220</b> as is needed for the particular probe. In a second aspect, the controller is configured with algorithms that identify whether the probe is coupled to the handpiece <b>104</b> in an upward or downward orientation relative to the handpiece, wherein each orientation requires a different subset of the operating algorithms. In another aspect, the controller has separate control algorithms for each probe type wherein some probes have a rotatable cutter while others have a reciprocating electrode or jaw structure. In another aspect, most if not all the probes <b>110</b>, <b>200</b>A, <b>200</b>B, <b>200</b>C and <b>200</b>D (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>4</b>-<b>7</b></figref>) require a default &#x201c;stop&#x201d; position in which the motor-driven component is stopped in a particular orientation within the working end. For example, a rotatable cutter <b>145</b> with an electrode <b>155</b> needs to have the electrode centered within an outer sleeve window <b>158</b> in a default position such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. Some of these systems, algorithms and methods of use are described next.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, it can be seen that handpiece <b>104</b> carries a first Hall effect sensor <b>240</b> in a distal region of the handpiece <b>104</b> adjacent the receiving passageway <b>122</b> that receives the hub <b>120</b> of probe <b>110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> corresponds to the probe <b>110</b> and working end <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> being in the upward orientation indicated at UP. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> corresponds to probe <b>110</b> and working end <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> being in the downward orientation indicated at DN. The handpiece <b>104</b> carries a second Hall effect sensor <b>245</b> adjacent the rotatable drive coupling <b>150</b> of the probe <b>110</b>. The probe <b>110</b> carries a plurality of magnets as will be described below that interact with the Hall effect sensors <b>240</b>, <b>245</b> to provide multiple control functions in cooperation with controller algorithms, including (i) identification of the type of probe coupled to the handpiece, (ii) the upward or downward orientation of the probe hub <b>120</b> relative to the handpiece <b>104</b>, and (iii) the rotational position and speed of rotating drive collar <b>150</b> from which a position of either rotating or reciprocating motor-driven components can be determined.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The sectional views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref> show that hub <b>120</b> of probe <b>110</b> carries first and second magnets <b>250</b><i>a </i>and <b>250</b><i>b </i>in a surface portion thereof. The Hall sensor <b>240</b> in handpiece <b>104</b> is in axial alignment with either magnet <b>250</b><i>a </i>or <b>250</b><i>b </i>when the probe hub <b>120</b> is coupled to handpiece <b>104</b> in an upward orientation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>A</figref>) or a downward orientation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>B</figref>). In one aspect as outlined above, the combination of the magnets <b>250</b><i>a </i>and <b>250</b><i>b </i>and the Hall sensor <b>240</b> can be used to identify the probe type. For example, a product portfolio may have from 2 to 10 or more types of probes, such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>4</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, and each such probe type can carry magnets <b>250</b><i>a</i>, <b>250</b><i>b </i>having a specific, different magnetic field strength. Then, the Hall sensor <b>240</b> and controller algorithms can be adapted to read the magnetic field strength of the particular magnet(s) in the probe which can be compared to a library of field strengths that correspond to particular probe types. Then, a Hall identification signal can be generated or otherwise provided to the controller <b>165</b> to select the controller algorithms for operating the identified probe, which can include parameters for operating the motor drive <b>105</b>, negative pressure source <b>220</b> and/or RF source <b>225</b> as may be required for the probe type. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, the probe hub <b>120</b> can be coupled to handpiece <b>104</b> in upward and downward orientations, in which the North (N) and South (S) poles of the magnets <b>250</b><i>a</i>, <b>250</b><i>b </i>are reversed relative to the probe axis <b>128</b>. Therefore, the Hall sensor <b>240</b> and associated algorithms look for magnetic field strength regardless of polarity to identify the probe type.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B and <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref>, the first and second magnets <b>250</b><i>a </i>and <b>250</b><i>b </i>with their different orientations of North (N) and South (S) poles relative to central longitudinal axis <b>128</b> of hub <b>120</b> are also used to identify the upward orientation UP or the downward orientation DN of hub <b>120</b> and working end <b>112</b>. In use, as described above, the physician may couple the probe <b>110</b> to the handpiece receiving passageway <b>122</b> with the working end <b>112</b> facing upward or downward based on his or her preference and the targeted tissue. It can be understood that controller algorithms adapted to stop rotation of the cutting member <b>145</b> in the window <b>158</b> of the outer sleeve <b>104</b> of working end <b>112</b> need to &#x201c;learn&#x201d; whether the working end is facing upward or downward, because the orientation or the rotating cutting member <b>145</b> relative to the handpiece and Hall sensor <b>240</b> would vary by 180&#xb0;. The Hall sensor <b>240</b> together with a controller algorithm can determine the orientation UP or the downward orientation DN by sensing whether the North (N) or South (S) pole of either magnet <b>250</b><i>a </i>or <b>250</b><i>b </i>is facing upwardly and is proximate the Hall sensor <b>240</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In another aspect of the invention, in probe <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and other probes, the motor-driven component of a working end, such as rotating cutter <b>145</b> of working end <b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref> needs to stopped in a selected rotational position relative to a cut-out opening or window <b>158</b> in the outer sleeve <b>140</b>. Other probe types may have a reciprocating member or a jaw structure as described above, which also needs a controller algorithm to stop movement of a moving component in a selected position, such as the axial-moving electrodes of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref> and the jaw structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. In all probes, the motor drive <b>105</b> couples to the rotating drive coupling <b>150</b>, thus sensing the rotational position of the drive coupling <b>150</b> can be used to determine the orientation of the motor-driven component in the working end. More in particular, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, the drive coupling <b>150</b> carries third and fourth magnets <b>255</b><i>a </i>or <b>255</b><i>b </i>with the North (N) and South (S) poles of magnets <b>255</b><i>a </i>or <b>255</b><i>b </i>being reversed relative to the probe axis <b>128</b>. Thus, Hall sensor <b>245</b> can sense when each magnet rotates passes the Hall sensor and thereby determine the exact rotational position of the drive coupling <b>150</b> twice on each rotation thereof (once for each magnet <b>255</b><i>a</i>, <b>255</b><i>b</i>). Thereafter, a controller tachometer algorithm using a clock can determine and optionally display the RPM of the drive coupling <b>150</b> and, for example, the cutting member <b>145</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In another aspect of the invention, the Hall sensor <b>245</b> and magnets <b>255</b><i>a </i>and <b>255</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>A</figref>) are used in a set of controller algorithms to stop the rotation of a motor-driven component of a working end, for example, cutting member <b>145</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref> in a pre-selected rotational position. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, it can be seen that the inner sleeve <b>142</b> and a &#x201c;first side&#x201d; of cutting member <b>145</b> and window <b>154</b> therein is stopped and positioned in the center of window <b>158</b> of outer sleeve <b>140</b>. The stationary position of cutting member <b>145</b> and window <b>154</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> may be used for irrigation or flushing of a working space to allow for maximum fluid outflow through the probe.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> depicts inner sleeve <b>142</b> and a &#x201c;second side&#x201d; of cutting member <b>145</b> positioned about the centerline of window <b>158</b> in the outer sleeve <b>140</b>. The stationary or stopped position of cutting member <b>145</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is needed for using the RF electrode <b>155</b> to ablate or coagulate tissue. It is important that the electrode <b>155</b> is maintained along the centerline of the outer sleeve window <b>158</b> since the outer sleeve <b>140</b> typically comprises return electrode <b>260</b>. The position of electrode <b>155</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is termed herein a &#x201c;centerline default position&#x201d;. If the cutting member <b>145</b> and electrode <b>155</b> were rotated so as to be close to an edge <b>262</b><i>a </i>or <b>262</b><i>b </i>of window <b>158</b> in outer sleeve <b>140</b>, RF current could arc between the electrodes <b>155</b> and <b>260</b> and potentially cause a short circuit disabling the probe. Therefore, a robust and reliable stop mechanism is required which is described next.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">As can be understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, the controller <b>165</b> can always determine in real time the rotational position of drive coupling <b>150</b> and therefore the angular or rotational position of the ceramic cutting member <b>145</b> and electrode <b>155</b> can be determined. A controller algorithm can further calculate the rotational angle of the electrode <b>155</b> away from the centerline default position as the Hall sensor <b>245</b> can sense lessening of magnetic field strength as a magnet <b>255</b><i>a </i>or <b>255</b><i>b </i>in the drive coupling <b>150</b> rotates the electrode <b>155</b> away from the centerline default position. Each magnet has a specified, known strength and the algorithm can use a look-up table with that lists fields strengths corresponding to degrees of rotation away from the default position. Thus, if the Hall signal responsive to the rotated position of magnet <b>255</b><i>a </i>or <b>255</b><i>b </i>drops a specified amount from a known peak value in the centerline default position, it means the electrode <b>155</b> has moved away from the center of the window <b>158</b>. In one variation, if the electrode <b>155</b> moves a selected rotational angle away from the centerline position during RF energy delivery to the electrode, the algorithm turns off RF current instantly and alerts the physician by an aural and/or visual signal, such as an alert on the LCD screen <b>170</b> on handpiece <b>104</b> and/or on a screen on a controller console (not shown). The termination of RF current delivery thus prevents the potential of an electrical arc between electrode <b>155</b> and the outer sleeve electrode <b>260</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">It can be understood that during use, when the electrode <b>155</b> is in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the physician may be moving the energized electrode over tissue to ablate or coagulate tissue. During such use, the cutting member <b>145</b> and electrode <b>155</b> can engage or catch on tissue which inadvertently rotate the electrode <b>155</b> out of the default centerline position. Therefore, the system provides a controller algorithm, herein called an &#x201c;active electrode monitoring&#x201d; algorithm, wherein the controller continuously monitors position signals generated by Hall sensor <b>245</b> during RF energy delivery in both an ablation mode and a coagulation mode to determine if the electrode <b>155</b> and inner sleeve <b>142</b> have been bumped off the centerline position. In a variation, the controller algorithms can be configured to then re-activate the motor drive <b>105</b> to move the inner sleeve <b>142</b> and electrode <b>155</b> back to the default centerline position sleeve if electrode <b>155</b> had been bumped off the centerline position. In another variation, the controller algorithms can be configured to again automatically deliver RF current to RF electrode <b>155</b> when it is moved back to the to the default centerline position. Alternatively, the controller <b>165</b> can require the physician to manually re-start the delivery of RF current to the RF electrode <b>155</b> when it is moved back to the to the centerline position. In an aspect of the invention, the drive coupling <b>150</b> and thus magnets <b>255</b><i>a </i>and <b>255</b><i>b </i>are attached to inner sleeve <b>142</b> and cutting member <b>145</b> in a pre-determined angular relationship relative to longitudinal axis <b>128</b> so that the Hall sensor generates signals responsive to magnets <b>255</b><i>a</i>, <b>255</b><i>b </i>is the same for all probes within a probe type to thus allow the controller algorithm to function properly.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Now turning to the stop mechanism or algorithms for stopping movement of a motor-driven component of working end <b>112</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> schematically illustrates the algorithm and steps of the stop mechanism. In one variation, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the stop mechanism corresponding to the invention uses (i) a dynamic braking method and algorithm to stop the rotation of the inner sleeve <b>142</b> and cutting member <b>145</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref>) in an initial position, and thereafter (ii) a secondary checking algorithm is used to check the initial stop position that was attained with the dynamic braking algorithm, and if necessary, the stop algorithm can re-activate the motor drive <b>105</b> to slightly reverse (or move forward) the rotation of drive coupling <b>150</b> and inner sleeve <b>142</b> as needed to position the cutting member <b>145</b> and electrode <b>155</b> within at the centerline position or within 0&#xb0; to 5&#xb0; of the targeted centerline default position. Dynamic braking is described further below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> schematically illustrates various aspects of controller algorithms for controlling the rotational speed of the cutting member and for stopping the cutting member <b>145</b> in the default centerline position.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, it can be understood that the controller <b>165</b> is operating the probe <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref> at a &#x201c;set speed&#x201d; which may be a PID controlled, continuous rotation mode in one direction or may be an oscillating mode where the motor drive <b>105</b> rotates the cutting member <b>145</b> in one direction and then reverses rotation as is known in the art. At higher rotational speeds such as 1,000 RPM to 20,000 RPM, it is not practical or feasible to acquire a signal from Hall sensor <b>245</b> that indicates the position of a magnet <b>255</b><i>a </i>or <b>255</b><i>b </i>in the drive coupling <b>150</b> to apply a stop algorithm. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, when the physician stop cutting with probe <b>110</b> by releasing actuation of an actuator button or foot pedal, current to the motor drive <b>105</b> is turned off. Thereafter, the controller algorithm uses the Hall sensor <b>245</b> to monitor deceleration of rotation of the drive coupling <b>150</b> and inner sleeve <b>142</b> until a slower RPM is reached. The deceleration period may be from 10 ms to 1 sec and typically is about 100 ms. When a suitable slower RPM is reached which is called a &#x201c;search speed&#x201d; herein (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>), the controller <b>165</b> re-activates the motor drive <b>105</b> to rotate the drive coupling at a low speed ranging from 10 RPM to 1,000 RPM and in one variation is between 50 RPM and 250 RPM. An initial &#x201c;search delay&#x201d; period ranging from 50 ms to 500 ms is provided to allow the PID controller to stabilize the RPM at the selected search speed. Thereafter, the controller algorithm monitors the Hall position signal of magnet strength and when the magnet parameter reaches a predetermined threshold, for example, when the rotational position of drive coupling <b>150</b> and electrode <b>155</b> correspond to the centerline default position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the control algorithm then applies dynamic braking to instantly stop rotation of the motor drive shaft <b>151</b>, drive coupling <b>150</b> and the motor-driven component of the probe. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> further illustrates that the controller can check the magnet/drive coupling <b>150</b> position after the braking and stopping steps. If the Hall position signal indicates that the motor-driven component is out of the targeted default position, the motor drive <b>105</b> can be re-activated to move the motor-driven component and thereafter the brake can be applied again as described above.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Dynamic braking as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> may typically stop the rotation of the drive coupling <b>150</b> with a variance of up to about 0&#xb0;-15&#xb0; of the targeted stop position, but this can vary even further when different types of tissue are being cut and impeding rotation of the cutting member <b>145</b>, and also depending on whether the physician has completely disengaged the cutting member from the tissue interface when the motor drive is de-activated. Therefore, dynamic braking alone may not assure that the default or stop position is within a desired variance.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">As background, the concept of dynamic braking is described in the following literature: https://www.ab.com/support/abdrives/documentation/techpapers/RegenOverview01.pdf and http://literature.rockwellautomation.com/idc/groups/literature/documents/wp/drives-wp004-en-p.pdf. Basically, a dynamic braking system provides a chopper transistor on the DC bus of the AC PWM drive that feeds a power resistor that transforms the regenerative electrical energy into heat energy. The heat energy is dissipated into the local environment. This process is generally called dynamic braking with the chopper transistor and related control and components called the chopper module and the power resistor called the dynamic brake resistor. The entire assembly of chopper module with dynamic brake resistor is sometimes referred to as the dynamic brake module. The dynamic brake resistor allows any magnetic energy stored in the parasitic inductance of that circuit to be safely dissipated during the turn off of the chopper transistor.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The method is called dynamic braking because the amount of braking torque that can be applied is dynamically changing as the load decelerates. In other words, the braking energy is a function of the kinetic energy in the spinning mass and as it declines, so does the braking capacity. So the faster it is spinning or the more inertia it has, the harder you can apply the brakes to it, but as it slows, you run into the law of diminishing returns and at some point, there is no longer any braking power left.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In another aspect of the invention, a method has been developed to increase the accuracy of the stopping mechanism which is a component of the positioning algorithm described above. It has been found that each magnet in a single-use probe may vary slightly from its specified strength. As described above, the positioning algorithm uses the Hall effect sensor <b>245</b> to continuously monitor the field strength of magnets <b>255</b><i>a </i>and <b>255</b><i>b </i>as the drive coupling <b>150</b> rotates and the algorithm determines the rotational position of the magnets and drive coupling based on the field strength, with the field strength rising and falling as a magnet rotates past the Hall sensor. Thus, it is important for the algorithm to have a library of fields strengths that accurately correspond to degrees of rotation away from a peak Hall signal when a magnet is adjacent the sensor <b>245</b>. For this reason, an initial step of the positioning algorithm includes a &#x201c;learning&#x201d; step that allow the controller to learn the actual field strength of the magnets <b>255</b><i>a </i>and <b>255</b><i>b </i>which may vary from the specified strength. After a new single-use probe <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is coupled to the handpiece <b>104</b>, and after actuation of the motor drive <b>105</b>, the positioning algorithm will rotate the drive coupling at least 180&#xb0; and more often at least 360&#xb0; while the Hall sensor <b>245</b> quantifies the field strength of the particular probe's magnets <b>255</b><i>a </i>and <b>255</b><i>b</i>. The positioning algorithm then stores the maximum and minimum Hall signals (corresponding to North and South poles) and calibrates the library of field strengths that correspond to various degrees of rotation away from a Hall min-max signal position when a magnet is adjacent the Hall sensor.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In general, a method of use relating to the learning algorithm comprises providing a handpiece with a motor drive, a controller, and a probe with a proximal hub configured for detachable coupling to the handpiece, wherein the motor drive is configured to couple to a rotating drive coupling in the hub and wherein the drive coupling carries first and second magnets with North and South poles positioned differently relative to said axis, and coupling the hub to the handpiece, activating the motor drive to thereby rotate the drive coupling and magnets at least 180&#xb0;, using a handpiece sensor to sense the strength of each magnet, and using the sensed strength of the magnets for calibration in a positioning algorithm that is responsive to the sensor sensing the varying strength of the magnets in the rotating drive coupling to thereby increase accuracy in calculating the rotational position of the drive coupling <b>150</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Another aspect of the invention relates to an enhanced method of use using a probe working end with an electrode, such as the working end <b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>B</figref>. As described above, a positioning algorithm is used to stop rotation of the electrode <b>155</b> in the default centerline position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. An additional &#x201c;slight oscillation&#x201d; algorithm is used to activate the motor drive <b>105</b> contemporaneous with RF current to the electrode <b>155</b>, particularly an RF cutting waveform for tissues ablation. The slight oscillation thus provides for a form of oscillating RF ablation. The slight oscillation algorithm rotates the electrode <b>155</b> in one direction to a predetermined degree of rotation, which the controller algorithms determine from the Hall position signals. Then, the algorithm reverses direction of the motor drive to rotate in the opposite direction until Hall position signals indicate that the predetermined degree of rotation was achieved in the opposite direction away from the electrode's default centerline position. The predetermined degree of angular motion can be any suitable rotation that is suitable for dimensions of the outer sleeve window, and in one variation is from 1&#xb0; to 30&#xb0; in each direction away from the centerline default position. More often, the predetermined degree of angular motion is from 5&#xb0; to 15&#xb0; in each direction away from the centerline default. The slight oscillation algorithm can use any suitable PID controlled motor shaft speed, and in one variation the motor shaft speed is from 50 RPM to 5,000 RPM, and more often from 100 RPM to 1,000 RPM. Stated another way, the frequency of oscillation can be from 20 Hz to 2,000 Hz and typically between 40 Hz and 400 Hz.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">While the above description of the slight oscillation algorithm is provided with reference to electrode <b>155</b> on a rotating cutting member <b>145</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, it should be appreciated that a reciprocating electrode <b>212</b> as shown in the working end <b>200</b>C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> end could also be actuated with slight oscillation.

The dielectric member <b>440</b> can be a ceramic or glass material and the longitudinal conductive portion <b>442</b> typically is stainless steel.

Thus, it can be seen that the longitudinal metal portion <b>442</b> carries the inner resecting window <b>425</b>. Further, the longitudinal metal portion <b>442</b> extends distally around the tip portion <b>462</b> of the inner sleeve assembly <b>415</b> to thus provide substantial hoop strength as the tip portion <b>462</b> distally surrounds the longitudinal dielectric member <b>440</b> on opposing sides of the distal end <b>464</b> of the dielectric member <b>440</b>.

In the exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, it can be seen that an elongated electrical lead <b>475</b> is adapted to extend longitudinally over the inner tubular member <b>460</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>) to a pad portion <b>477</b> that is bendable and adapted to be inserted into a pad recess <b>478</b> in the longitudinal dielectric member <b>440</b>.

Such a retaining collar <b>725</b> used to fix together the dielectric member <b>720</b> and the metal portion <b>722</b> can be similar to that described in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, this variation differs from previous embodiments in that the electrical lead <b>718</b> extends through a recess <b>730</b> in the dielectric member <b>720</b> and couples to a leg <b>732</b> of the active electrode <b>735</b>. The electrical lead <b>718</b> is not carried on an exterior surface of tubular member <b>724</b>. Instead, the electrical lead <b>718</b> extends to the active electrode <b>735</b> through the interior bore <b>742</b> of the tubular member. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, the electrical lead <b>718</b> extends in the proximal direction from the electrode <b>735</b> and is flexed at bend <b>744</b> to enter the interior bore <b>742</b> of the inner tubular member <b>724</b> and in this variation extends through a hypotube <b>745</b> which is coupled to the wall of the tubular member <b>740</b>.

At least one similar slot (not shown) can be provided along the length of the tubular member <b>724</b> to secure the hypotube <b>745</b> in place. It has been found that is important to carry the electrical lead <b>718</b> within the interior bore <b>742</b> of the tubular member <b>724</b> to protect it from potential damage. In the previous embodiments, for example the version of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the electrical lead <b>475</b> extended in a flat surface <b>486</b> along the outer surface of the inner tubular member <b>460</b> and was then covered with insulator layer <b>488</b>. In the previous embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, since the shaft <b>405</b> of the probe <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) could be torqued and bent significantly during a procedure, high-speed rotation of the inner sleeve assembly <b>415</b> had the potential of abrading and degrading the insulator sleeve <b>488</b> overlying the electrical lead <b>425</b> which could cause an electrical short. Therefore, one aspect of the invention as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>-<b>24</b></figref> includes carrying the electrical lead <b>718</b> in the interior bore <b>742</b> of the metal tubular member <b>724</b> to insure that bending or torque on the shaft <b>705</b> while operating the inner sleeve assembly <b>715</b> at high RPM cannot damage the electrical lead <b>718</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b> and <b>24</b></figref> also show an annular bushing <b>746</b> that is adapted to cover the recess <b>730</b> that is filled with potting material as described previously. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, a heat shrink insulator sleeve <b>748</b> covering the tubular member <b>724</b> and the at least a portion of the bushing <b>746</b>. Thus, in high speed rotation, the insulator sleeve <b>749</b> and bushing <b>746</b> are the bearing surfaces of the inner sleeve assembly <b>715</b> as it rotates in the outer sleeve <b>710</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">It can be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>-<b>24</b></figref> that the inner tubular member <b>724</b> and the hypotube <b>745</b> comprise a return electrode <b>750</b> with conductive saline flowing through the interior channel <b>755</b> of the tubular member <b>724</b>. Thus, obviously the electrical lead <b>718</b> carries its own substantial insulation layer on it surface. In one variation, the electrical lead <b>718</b> is a copper wire instead of a stainless steel wire since such a stainless steel wire would be resistively heated. Preferably, the electrical lead <b>718</b> is of a material that will not be resistively heated as this would heat saline outflows traveling through the channel <b>755</b> which would then elevate the temperature of the handpiece which is undesirable.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Now turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>A and <b>25</b>B</figref>, a perspective view and a cut-away view of the hub <b>702</b> are shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> is an enlarged cut-away view of an interior portion of the hub <b>702</b>.

The proximal end portion <b>760</b> of the electrical lead <b>718</b> is curved outwardly through a slot <b>762</b> in the tubular member <b>724</b> and then extends in an interface <b>765</b> between two polymer collars <b>766</b> and <b>768</b> that together provide a seal over and around the insulation layer on the electrical lead <b>718</b>. Thereafter, a heat shrink material <b>769</b> such as FEP can disposed over the collars <b>766</b> and <b>768</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>B and <b>26</b></figref>, it can be seen that a polymeric coupling sleeve <b>770</b> is fixed to the proximal end portion <b>772</b> of the tubular member that extends proximally to the drive coupler <b>774</b> which is adapted for coupling to the motor drive of the handpiece (not shown). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>B and <b>26</b></figref> further show conductive metal contact ring <b>775</b> is disposed over the insulative coupling sleeve <b>770</b>.

Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>, the proximalmost end <b>777</b> of electrical lead <b>718</b> with its insulator layer removed is in contact with and electrically coupled to the rotating contact ring <b>775</b>. In turn, the contact ring <b>775</b> interfaces with spring-loaded ball contacts <b>780</b><i>a </i>and <b>780</b><i>b </i>in the handpiece (not shown) to carry RF current to from RF source <b>720</b>B to the active electrode <b>735</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>). Spring-loaded ball contacts <b>782</b><i>a </i>and <b>782</b><i>b </i>in the hub are adapted to carry current to or from the outer sleeve assembly <b>710</b> which comprises a return electrode. It should be appreciated that conductive fluid can migrate into various parts of the hub <b>702</b> and it is necessary to prevent any migration of conductive fluid into the interface between the spring-loaded ball contacts <b>780</b><i>a </i>and <b>780</b><i>b </i>and the rotating contact ring <b>775</b>. Any migrating conductive fluid is effectively a return electrode and could cause a short circuit.

In the exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, it can be seen that electrical lead <b>895</b> extends longitudinally over a slightly flattened surface <b>896</b> of sleeve <b>860</b> and an inwardly bent tab <b>898</b> of the tubular member <b>860</b>. The electrical lead <b>895</b> is covered with an insulator (not shown) except for its distal end <b>899</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, the active electrode <b>845</b> again is configured with first and second legs <b>902</b><i>a </i>and <b>902</b><i>b </i>that are adapted for insertion through receiving channels <b>904</b><i>a </i>and <b>904</b><i>b </i>in the dielectric member <b>840</b>. Thus, the electrode <b>845</b> again is cantilevered over a recess <b>910</b> in the dielectric member <b>840</b> distally from the dual receiving channels <b>904</b><i>a </i>and <b>904</b><i>b </i>in the dielectric member <b>840</b>. The distal end <b>899</b> of the electrical lead <b>895</b> is then soldered or otherwise electrically coupled to a leg <b>902</b><i>a </i>or <b>902</b><i>b </i>of the electrode <b>845</b>.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The flattened surface <b>896</b> of the tubular member <b>860</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>-<b>30</b></figref> allows an insulator layer <b>912</b> such as a heat shrink material shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b> and <b>30</b></figref> to cover the entirety of the tubular member <b>860</b> and the insulated electrical lead <b>895</b>. The proximal end (not shown) of the electrical lead <b>895</b> extends into a hub <b>802</b> (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) as described previously to connect to electrical contacts in a handle which allows for rotation of the inner sleeve assembly <b>815</b> and for coupling electrical energy to the electrical lead <b>895</b>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Now turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> and <b>31</b></figref>, it can be seen that the first and second circumferential bushings <b>890</b> and <b>892</b> are fixed around a distal portion of the rotating inner sleeve <b>815</b> when fully assembled. The proximal bushing <b>890</b> comprises a metal material which adds additional strength to the connection between the inner sleeve <b>885</b> and the distal burr <b>825</b>. Further, the proximal or first bushing <b>890</b> is adapted to rotate within the bore <b>856</b> of the outer sleeve <b>810</b> with close tolerances. The second or distal bushing <b>892</b> comprises a polymer material such as PEEK which is adapted to rotate at high speeds within the bore <b>856</b> of outer sleeve <b>810</b> and prevents any metal-on-metal contact in the exposed distal end of the probe to thereby insure that no metal microparticles are being formed in or about the exposed end of probe during high-speed rotation of the inner sleeve assembly <b>815</b> in the outer sleeve <b>810</b>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b> and <b>30</b></figref>, it can be seen that a distal region of outer sleeve <b>810</b> is configured with a plurality of apertures or aspiration ports <b>915</b> therein (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>) that are circumferentially spaced apart and proximal from the distal end opening <b>820</b> of the outer sleeve <b>810</b>. These ports <b>915</b> can range in number from 1 to 10 and are adapted for suctioning fluid and debris from a fluid-filled working site during use. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, it can be seen that the proximal bushing <b>890</b>, inner sleeve <b>860</b> and metal cutting member <b>842</b> provide a lateral opening <b>920</b> in the inner sleeve assembly <b>815</b> that communicates with the interior channel <b>865</b> of metal member <b>842</b> and bore <b>882</b> of the inner sleeve <b>860</b> which further communicates with the negative pressure source <b>420</b>C. Thus, during rotation of the inner sleeve assembly <b>815</b>, it can be understood that the opening <b>920</b> in the inner sleeve assembly <b>815</b> will rotate to intermittently interface with the ports <b>915</b> in outer sleeve <b>810</b> to thereby suction fluid from the working space. Further, it can be appreciated that the stop mechanism controlled by the controller <b>420</b>A can be adapted to stop rotation of inner sleeve assembly <b>815</b> in a particular rotational position, for example, with the electrode side ES facing upwardly as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>. In this position, the ports <b>915</b> in the outer sleeve <b>810</b> are not aligned with the opening <b>920</b> in the inner sleeve so that aspiration forces in the interior bore <b>882</b> of the inner sleeve <b>860</b> will suction fluid through the port <b>922</b> in dielectric member <b>840</b> beneath the electrode <b>845</b> similar to that described previously. In this variation, the aspiration forces through the port <b>922</b> can be effective in removing bubbles from the vicinity of the electrode <b>845</b> during operation.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In other variations, the outer sleeve ports <b>915</b> may be configured for alignment with the inner sleeve opening <b>920</b> when the inner sleeve assembly <b>815</b> is stopped with the electrode side ES facing in an upward position as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>. Depending on the use of the device, it may be desirable to have the ports <b>915</b> and opening <b>920</b> aligned or partly aligned to assist in removing ablated tissue debris from a treatment site during activation of the electrode <b>845</b> and/or to maintain a continuous fluid flow through the probe in any stopped position of the inner sleeve assembly <b>815</b>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">In general, it can be understood that the devices of the invention described above are adapted to function in two different operational modes. First, the working end of the probe <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref> utilizes high-speed rotation of the inner sleeve assembly <b>815</b> to cut and remove tissue. Second, the controller <b>420</b>A can stop rotation of the inner sleeve assembly <b>815</b> so that the active electrode <b>845</b> is exposed and thereafter the electrode can be energized to coagulate or ablate tissue, depending on wave form and power delivered.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In another aspect of the invention, a third mode of operation is provided and consists of contemporaneous rotation of the inner sleeve assembly <b>815</b> together with activation of the active electrode <b>845</b>. This mode of operation can thereby cut and remove tissue at the same time as coagulating or ablating tissue with RF energy. In this third mode of operation, it is necessary to sequence the activation of RF energy to the active electrode <b>845</b> during each 360&#xb0; rotation of the inner sleeve assembly <b>815</b> so that the active electrode <b>845</b>, effectively, does not form a short circuit with the return electrode <b>855</b> of the outer sleeve <b>810</b>. In one variation, micro switches can be provided in the proximal hub of the probe to turn RF energy delivery on and off during each rotation of the inner sleeve assembly. However, such micro switches or other similar encoding mechanisms may that operate instantaneously and effectively during high-speed rotation.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Now turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>32</b>-<b>33</b></figref>, electronic circuitry <b>940</b> is shown that is configured to instantly turn RF delivery ON and OFF during each 360&#xb0; rotation of the inner sleeve assembly <b>815</b> relative to the outer sleeve <b>810</b> in the probe <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>-<b>31</b></figref>. The circuitry <b>940</b> also can be used all other probe variations described above. The controller <b>420</b>A and RF source <b>420</b>B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>27</b></figref>) are designed to prevent the possibility of RF current flowing from the active electrode <b>545</b> carried by an inner sleeve directly to an outer sleeve which comprises return electrode <b>855</b> herein when the active and return electrodes <b>845</b>, <b>855</b> are in contact or in close proximity to one another. The circuit <b>940</b> that accomplishes the instantaneous ON/OFF switching is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>. The circuit <b>940</b> is built around the current sense transformer T<b>1</b>, comparator U<b>2</b> and gate driver U<b>1</b>. The RF current flowing from the electrode <b>845</b> to a nearby electrode or otherwise conductive material in a saline working space is measured using T<b>1</b>. The current is rectified by rectifier D <b>1</b> and sent to the comparator U<b>2</b> where it is compared against a reference voltage that defines an RF output disable threshold. When the rectified voltage exceeds the threshold on the comparator, the comparator output goes down, bringing down the enable input of the gate driver U<b>1</b>, which reduces the RF current by disabling the RF output. Hysteresis in the comparator is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> and is implemented using positive feedback through R<b>1</b> and C<b>1</b>. This hysteresis prevents oscillation around the threshold created by the reference voltage. The RF current must significantly decrease below the threshold for the RF to be re-enabled. By this means, the disable/enable of RF output can occur extremely rapidly, which is set by the time constant of the RC filter in front of the comparator. In one variation, such a time constant is 2.26 ms and the scope of the invention includes such a time constant of less than 10 ms, or less than 5 ms. The RF output can turn ON/OFF practically instantly as the comparator is controlling the enable input of the gate drivers that drive the RF output MOSFETs. The gate driver enable delay is 75 nS (max) and can be as much as ten thousand times faster than the comparator time constant or 2 ms.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">The circuit <b>940</b> described above thus allows controlled RF current delivery contemporaneous with high-speed rotation of an inner sleeve assembly <b>815</b> at rotational speed of at least 5000 RPM, at least 10,000 RPM, at least 12,000 RPM and at least 15,000 RPM. The circuit <b>940</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>32</b> and <b>33</b></figref> can be used with any of the cutting probes described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>26</b></figref> and the burr <b>800</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b> to <b>31</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Although particular embodiments of the present invention have been described above in detail, it will be understood that this description is merely for purposes of illustration and the above description of the invention is not exhaustive.
