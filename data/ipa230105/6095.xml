The conventional face-up semiconductor light-emitting device includes a sapphire substrate serving as a light-transmissible substrate <b>90</b>, and a semiconductor light-emitting stack including a first semiconductor layer <b>91</b>, an active layer <b>92</b> and a second semiconductor layer <b>93</b> that are sequentially disposed on the sapphire substrate in such order. The conventional face-up semiconductor light-emitting device may further include a light-transmissible insulating layer (not shown) that surrounds the semiconductor light-emitting stack.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For a light emitted from the active layer <b>92</b>, a portion of the light emits along a direction (a) toward the second semiconductor layer <b>93</b>. Another portion of the light emits along a direction (b) toward a sidewall of the semiconductor light-emitting stack. Yet another portion of the light emits along a direction (c) toward the light-transmissible substrate <b>90</b>. Since the semiconductor light-emitting stack, the insulating layer and the light-transmissible substrate <b>90</b> may have different refractive indices, the light emitted along the directions (a), (b), and (c) is susceptible to internal reflection within the semiconductor light-emitting device, resulting in a relatively low light extraction efficiency.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows another conventional semiconductor light-emitting device similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, except for the following differences made to enhance the light extraction efficiency of the another semiconductor light-emitting device. For instance, a top surface of the second semiconductor layer <b>93</b> serving as a light-emitting surface may be patterned or roughened to have different critical angles. As such, light emitted along the direction (a) may be diffracted and directed to exit the semiconductor light-emitting device, so as to enhance light extraction efficiency through the light-emitting surface.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, a sidewall of the semiconductor light-emitting stack may be formed as an inclined sidewall, which is also conducive to enhancing light extraction efficiency through the light-emitting surface.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the semiconductor light-emitting device may further include a plurality of protrusions <b>97</b> with inclined lateral surfaces formed on the light-transmissible substrate <b>90</b>, such that light emitted along direction (c) may be reflected back toward the light-emitting surface. The protrusions <b>97</b> might be made of a material (e.g., silicon oxides) having a refractive index lower than that of sapphire which is used for making the light-transmissible substrate <b>90</b>. As such, a great difference in refractive indices between the semiconductor light-emitting stack and the protrusions <b>97</b> allows a large amount of the light emitted along direction (c) to be reflected back toward the light-emitting surface.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, the light emitted along a direction (d) may be partially reflected by an upper surface of the light-transmissible substrate <b>90</b> exposed from the protrusions <b>97</b>, or may penetrate through a backside of the light-transmissible substrate <b>90</b> opposite to the light-emitting surface. Therefore, the semiconductor light-emitting device may further include a reflective layer <b>96</b> disposed on the backside of the light-transmissible substrate <b>90</b>, so as to reflect and direct such light to exit the semiconductor light-emitting device through a sidewall of the light-transmissible substrate <b>90</b>, a sidewall of the semiconductor light-emitting stack, or the light-emitting surface. When the light is reflected back to the upper surface of the light-transmissible substrate <b>90</b> (which is a planar surface), the reflected light might be undesirably reflected back to and transmitted within the light-transmissible substrate <b>90</b>, or even absorbed by the semiconductor light-emitting device, causing reduced light extraction efficiency.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, an object of the disclosure is to provide semiconductor light-emitting devices that can alleviate at least one of the drawbacks of the prior art.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a first aspect, the semiconductor light-emitting device includes a light-transmissible substrate, and a semiconductor light-emitting stack.

Then, the photolithography process and the etching process, such as a dry etching or a wet etching process, are performed on the silicon oxide thin film to obtain the convex structures <b>110</b>. Specifically, a mask pattern having a predetermined size and shape is first formed over the silicon oxide thin film, then the etching process is performed over the mask pattern, so as to obtain the convex structures <b>110</b> with the predetermined size and shape. In certain embodiments, the dry etching process is an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching process using etching gas such as boron trichloride (BCl<sub>3</sub>), hydrogen bromide (HBr), sulphur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>), tetrafluoromethane (CF<sub>4</sub>), octafluorocyclobutane (C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>), trifluromethane (CHF<sub>3</sub>), argon (Ar) or oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>).
