For example, the turbine blades and vanes of a gas turbine engine are exposed to hot gases and reactive materials that may cause the surface of the component to reach temperatures in excess of 1000&#xb0; C. The components of such high temperature mechanical systems may include metal alloys or ceramic-based materials designed to withstand such high temperatures.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">High strength metal alloys (e.g., nickel or cobalt based superalloys) may be useful in a variety of contexts where strength is important. While such components may offer great strength and impact resistance, such components may be susceptible to degradation and fatigue associated with the extreme temperature fluctuations and deleterious reactions observed in the extreme operational environments such as that of a gas turbine engine. Thus, in some examples, a high strength metal alloy material may be coated with a thermal barrier coating, which may thermally insulate the substrate from the extreme temperatures present in the operating environment of high temperature mechanical systems.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Ceramic or ceramic matrix composite (CMC) materials may be useful in a variety of contexts where mechanical and thermal properties are important. Ceramic or CMC materials may be resistant to high temperatures, but some ceramic or CMC materials may react with some elements and compounds present in the operating environment of high temperature mechanical systems, such as water vapor. Reaction with water vapor may result in the recession of the ceramic or CMC material. These reactions may damage the ceramic or CMC material and reduce mechanical properties of the ceramic or CMC material, which may reduce the useful life of the component. Thus, in some examples, a ceramic or CMC material may be coated with an environmental barrier coating, which may reduce exposure of the substrate to elements and compounds present in the operating environment of high temperature mechanical systems.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some examples, the disclosure describes an article for a high-temperature mechanical system including a substrate and a doped calcia-magnesia-alumina-silicate resistant (doped CMAS-resistant) layer on the substrate, the doped CMAS-resistant layer is a thermal barrier coating or an environmental barrier coating and includes a calcia dopant.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some examples, the disclosure describes a method of forming an article for a high-temperature mechanical system, including forming a doped calcia-magnesia-alumina-silicate resistant (doped CMAS-resistant) layer on the substrate, where the doped CMAS-resistant layer includes a thermal barrier coating or an environmental barrier coating, and where the doped CMAS-resistant layer includes a calcia dopant.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some examples, the disclosure describes an article including a substrate comprising ceramic or ceramic matrix composite (CMC), and a doped calcia-magnesia-alumina-silicate resistant environmental barrier coating (doped CMAS-resistant EBC) including ytterbium silicate and a calcia dopant.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The details of one or more examples are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below.

The development of TBCs and EBCs have allowed such high temperatures to be obtained without damaging the underlying substrate materials. The increased operating temperatures, however, may lead to increased damage due to the presence of calcia-magnesia-alumina-silicate (CMAS) deposits within the high temperature environments. The presence of CMAS deposits in the high temperature environments of a gas turbine engine result from the ingestion of siliceous minerals (e.g., airborne dust, sand, volcanic dust and ashes, fly ash, runway debris, concrete dust, fuel residue, and the like) in the intake gas drawn through the gas turbine engine. While CMAS is used as a term used to generally describe such deposits, it is understood that the CMAS deposits and the associated reactions may involve a large number of different compounds and reactive species; however, calcia (CaO), magnesia (MgO), alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), and silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) are recognized as being the predominant oxides associated with the CMAS deposits.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Some of the CMAS deposits have a melting temperatures in the vicinity of about 1200&#xb0; C. to about 1250&#xb0; C. (e.g., about 2200&#xb0; F. to about 2300&#xb0; F.). Therefore, due to the high temperature environments in which the described components are operated, the CMAS deposits may melt and accumulate on the outer surfaces of the components of the gas turbine engine. Additionally, or alternatively, the molten CMAS deposits may diffuse into one or more of the outer coating layers of the component. In some examples, the materials forming the various coating layers or underlying substrate may react with one or more of the CMAS deposits through a series of complex reactions, damaging the component (e.g., the coatings) in the process.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Additionally, in some examples, when the component cools below melting temperature of the CMAS deposits, the CMAS deposit will solidify and exert a strain on the outer coating layers leading to the development of fractures and/or spallation of the outer coating layers. In all, the deleterious reactions and damage associate with CMAS may significantly reduce the useful life of the outer coating layers or underlying component.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some examples, the TBCs and EBCs describe herein may include a dopant material (e.g., calcia). As described further below, the inclusion of the dopant material (e.g., calcia) into the outer TBC or EBC layers may significantly reduce or inhibit the ingress of CMAS and or the deleterious side reactions associated with the diffusion of CMAS into the outer TBC or EBC layers. In some examples, the presence of the dopant material may enable a single TBC or EBC layer to provide similar or improved CMAS resistance compared to a coating including a dedicated, additional CMAS-resistant layer on a TBC or EBC layer.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional view of an example article <b>10</b> for use in a high temperature mechanical system that includes a substrate <b>12</b>, and doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> applied to at least a portion of the substrate <b>12</b>. CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> may be either a TBC or an EBC and includes a calcia (e.g., calcium oxide&#x2014;CaO) dopant. Article <b>10</b> may be a component of a high temperature mechanical system, such as, for example, a gas turbine engine or the like. Example aerospace components may include, for example, seal segments, shrouds, combustion tubes, blade tracks, disc assemblies, airfoils (e.g., blades or vanes), combustion chamber liners, or the like, of a gas turbine engine.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Any suitable material may be used to form substrate <b>12</b>. In some examples, substrate <b>12</b> may include a high strength metal alloy (e.g., a superalloy). Suitable high strength metal alloys may include Si-containing metal alloys such as molybdenum-silicon alloys (e.g., MoSi<sub>2</sub>) and niobium-silicon alloys (e.g. NbSi<sub>2</sub>), or a superalloy based on Ni, Co, Ni/Fe, or the like. In some examples, substrate <b>12</b> may include a Ni-based or Co-based superalloy. In some examples, Ni-based superalloys may be suitable for use in a gas turbine engine disk, gas turbine engine airfoil, or gas turbine engine spacer. The high strength metal alloy from which a substrate <b>12</b> is formed may satisfy certain design criteria including, for example, relatively high yield strength and tensile strength to inhibit yield and fracture of the component, relatively high ductility and fracture toughness to impart tolerance to defects, relatively high resistance to initiation of fatigue cracks, and relatively low fatigue crack propagation rates. Such alloy components may include other additive elements to alter one or more mechanical or chemical properties of substrate <b>12</b> including, for example, the toughness, hardness, temperature stability, corrosion resistance, oxidation resistance, or the like of substrate <b>12</b>. Additional example superalloy materials for producing substrate <b>12</b> may include, for example, those available from Martin-Marietta Corp., Bethesda, Md., under the trade designation MAR-M002 and MAR-M247; those available from Cannon-Muskegon Corp., Muskegon, Mich., under the trade designations CMSX-3, CMSX-4, CMSX-10; and the like.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Properties of the high strength metal alloy from which substrate <b>12</b> is formed may be a function of the composition, the phase constitution, and the microstructure of the alloy. The microstructure of the metal alloy may include the grain size of the alloy and a precipitate phase composition, size, and volume fraction. In some examples, the phase constitution and microstructure of the high strength metal alloy may be affected by mechanical and thermal processing of the alloy. For example, thermal processing, e.g., heat treatment, of the high strength metal alloy may affect grain structure of the resultant alloy, precipitate phase size and/or composition, or the like.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some examples, substrate <b>12</b> includes a polycrystalline Ni-based superalloy, which includes a plurality of grains. Substrate <b>12</b> may include at least one of Al, Ti, or Ta in addition to Ni. In some examples, a concentration of elements, such as between about 2 weight percent (wt. %) and about 5 wt. % Al, between about 2 wt. % and about 5 wt. % Ti, and less than about 3 wt. % tantalum (Ta), in substrate <b>12</b> may be sufficient to result in gamma-prime (&#x3b3;&#x2032;) precipitate formation in substrate <b>12</b>. For example, the concentration of Al, Ti, and/or Ta in substrate <b>12</b> may result in a &#x3b3;&#x2032; precipitate phase volume fraction between about 40 volume percent (vol. %) and about 55 vol. %. In some instances, higher or lower elemental contents of the individual gamma prime forming elements can be employed while maintaining the overall gamma prime phase fraction at desired levels for properties such as strength and ductility. The volume fraction, size, and distribution of the &#x3b3;&#x2032; precipitate phase may be influenced by the alloy composition, heat treatment temperature, heat treatment duration, and cooling rate during heat treatment. Additionally, in some examples, substrate <b>12</b> may include grain sizes between about 5 micrometers (&#x3bc;m) in diameter to between about 30 &#x3bc;m and about 50 &#x3bc;m or more in diameter, engineered for a combination of yield strength, resistance to fatigue crack initiation, creep strength, and resistance to fatigue crack growth. In some examples, substrate <b>12</b> may include additional elements that segregate to grain boundaries of substrate <b>12</b>. The segregating elements may affect creep resistance and low-cycle fatigue resistance of substrate <b>12</b>. Examples of segregating elements include boron (B; up to about 0.03 weight percent (wt. %) of substrate <b>12</b>), carbon (C; up to about 0.05 wt. % of substrate <b>12</b>), and zirconium (Zr; up to about 0.1 wt. % of substrate <b>12</b>).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In other examples, substrate <b>12</b> may include a ceramic or CMC material. The ceramic or CMC may include any useful ceramic or ceramic matrix material including, for example, Si-containing ceramics, such as silica, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, composites having a SiC or Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4 </sub>matrix, aluminosilicates, or silicon oxynitride; aluminum oxynitrides; alumina; and the like. In examples where substrate <b>12</b> includes a CMC, substrate <b>12</b> may further include any desired filler material, such as continuous or discontinuous reinforcement materials in the form of whiskers, platelets, fibers, or particulates. In some examples, the filler material may include a continuous monofilament or multifilament woven or non-woven fibers. The selection of filler material, its respective shape, size, and architecture (e.g., woven or non-woven) may depend in part on the desired properties to the resultant CMC based article. For example, in some implementations, the filler material may be selected to increase the toughness of a brittle ceramic matrix. In other examples, the filler material may be chosen to provide a desired property to substrate <b>12</b>, such as thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, thermal expansion, hardness, and the like. In some examples, the filler composition may be the same as the ceramic matrix material. For example, substrate <b>12</b> may include silicon carbide fibers embedded in a silicon carbide matrix. In other examples, the filler material may include a different composition than the ceramic matrix material.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Substrate <b>12</b> may be manufactured using any suitable technique. For example, depending on its selected composition and construction, substrate <b>12</b> may be formed using a cast-mold process, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), chemical vapor infiltration (CVI), polymer impregnation and pyrolysis (PIP), liquid polymer infiltration (LPI), slurry infiltration, liquid silicon infiltration (LSI), melt infiltration (MI), CVI in combination with MI, or other techniques.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some examples, doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> on substrate <b>12</b> may be either a TBC layer or an EBC layer including a calcia dopant. The inclusion of the calcia dopant in doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> has been found to improve the resistance of the doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> to degradation attributed to the presence of CMAS on or in layer <b>14</b>. For example, the reaction mechanisms associated with CMAS formation and degradation are not fully understood by those in the art, and the CMAS associated reactions are recognized as being complicated, highly esoteric, and difficult to fully characterize. In some examples, there are many reactive intermediates and products associated with CMAS reactions that involve both acidic and basic driven reaction mechanisms. It was discovered by the current inventors that adding calcia (i.e., a primary component of CMAS) as a dopant to a TBC or EBC created an unexpected improvement in the ability of doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> to resist the deleterious effects associated with CMAS degradation compared to an undoped layer. Without wanting to be bound to a specific scientific theory, it is believed the initial presence of calcia in doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> disrupts some of the reaction mechanisms associated with CMAS by disturbing the chemical equilibrium of one or more of the CMAS reaction(s). In particular, because the concentration of calcia within doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> is comparatively high (e.g., compared to other non-doped layers or those with other dopant materials), the initial concentration of calcia lowers one or more of the reaction rates associated with CMAS degradation, thereby creating a reaction gradient within doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> and slowing the reactions between doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> and one or more of the deleterious compounds and/or reactive intermediates associated with CMAS.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Additionally, while again not wishing to be bound by a specific scientific theory, it is believed that the formation of calcia as a component of CMAS is attributed to the basic driven reactions associated with CMAS generation. Therefore, in some examples, by having an initial presence of the calcia dopant in doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b>, the basic driven reactions associated with CMAS are collectively slowed due to the reaction gradient. In some such examples, the slowed basic driven reactions may free up other components in doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> to help combat and mitigate one or more of the acidic driven reactions associated with CMAS. For example, in some examples where doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> is configured as a TBC that includes hafnia or zirconia stabilized with one or more rare earth oxides (e.g., yttria), the inclusion of calcia may impede one or more of the basic driven reactions associated with CMAS, thereby freeing the one or more rare earth oxides (e.g., yttria) and zirconia to act in an acidic manner thereby creating an acidic chemical gradient in the coating that may help to slow/mitigate reaction between the coating and the active silica species in the CMAS.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Additionally or alternatively, the presence of calcia in doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> may further act to slow the molecular diffusion of CMAS into doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> due to the reduced concentration gradient established by initially incorporating a component of CMAS into doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some examples, article <b>10</b> may include one or more optional underlying layers <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> set between substrate <b>12</b> and CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b>. In some examples, the one or more optional underling layers <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> may include a bond layer, a diffusion barrier layer, a passively formed layer (e.g., scale layer), a dedicated EBC layer, a dedicated TBC layer, or combinations thereof and the like. It will be appreciated that while additional layers may be included in the design and construction of article <b>10</b>, the improved design of doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> may permit the exclusion of different layers (e.g., a dedicated EBC layer or a dedicated TBC layer separate from doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b>) or reduce the total number of various coating layers included in the design of article <b>10</b> to provide sufficient thermal or environmental protection to substrate <b>12</b>. For example, doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> may be applied as a single layer, such that doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> is the only dedicated TBC, EBC, CMAS-resistant layer included in article <b>10</b>. Additionally or alternatively, article <b>10</b> may include one or more functional top coats (e.g., an abradable coating) on doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some examples, doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> may be relatively thin (e.g., in comparison to a multi-layer system with a TBC/EBC layer and a CMAS-resistant layer). In some examples, doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> may define a thickness between about 10 micrometers (&#x3bc;m) and about 500 &#x3bc;m (e.g., about 0.0005 inches to about 0.020 inches).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> may be either a TBC layer or an EBC layer. The determination of whether CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> is to be configured as a TBC or EBC may be dependent on the particular application for article <b>10</b> (e.g., whether article is to be used as a hot section component or cold section component of a gas turbine engine), the underlying material selection for substrate <b>12</b> (e.g., superalloy material or ceramic/CMC), or both. For example, in some implementations in which substrate <b>12</b> includes a high strength metal alloy, doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> may be a TBC layer to provide enhanced thermal insulation for the underlying material of substrate <b>12</b>. Alternatively, where substrate <b>12</b> includes ceramic or CMC materials, doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> may be an EBC layer to provide enhanced environmental protection (e.g., water vapor barrier priorities) for the underlying material of substrate <b>12</b>. The usefulness of the calcia dopant in doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> may function to increase the ability of the layer to resist CMAS degradation in both EBC and TBC layer configurations.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Additionally, or alternatively, doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> may include a columnar microstructure. The columnar microstructure may mitigate stress due to thermal expansion mismatches between doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> and other optional layers <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. For example, a columnar microstructure may have microcracks or microgaps that extend through at least a portion of the layer in a direction that is substantially orthogonal to the plane defined by the layer surface. Because of the microgaps, a columnar microstructure may have enhanced mechanical compliance under thermal cycling or when a temperature gradient exists, such as when a high-temperature system is first engaged. Additionally, a layer having a columnar microstructure may provide improved thermal protection to substrate <b>32</b> compared to a layer that is substantially nonporous. While not wishing to be bound by scientific theory, the microcracks or microgaps may provide scattering sites for thermal energy-carrying phonons, which may lower an effective thermal conductivity of a layer having a columnar microstructure compared to a substantially nonporous layer of a similar composition. The columnar microstructure may be formed using plasma spray physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD) to deposit the layer via feeding the material at a rate so that less than all of the coating material is vaporized by plasma resulting in the material being deposited with a columnar microstructure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some examples, doped CMAS-resistant layer <b>14</b> may be a TBC layer. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example article <b>20</b> that includes a substrate <b>22</b>, a doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b>, and an optional bond layer <b>26</b> between substrate <b>22</b> and doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b>. Doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b> may provide thermal protection (i.e., thermal insulation) to underlying substrate <b>22</b> as well as improved resistance to CMAS degradation. For example, in implementations in which article <b>20</b> is a hot section component for a gas turbine engine, such as a flame tube, combustor liner, air foil, or the like, the combustion environment and associated gases may reach temperatures between about 1200&#xb0; C. to about 2000&#xb0; C. during operation. In some such examples, the temperatures of the combustion environment may exceed the softening or melting point of substrate <b>22</b>. The presence of doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b> may thermally insulate substrate <b>22</b>, thereby allowing the combustion environment to be operated at the higher temperatures for a longer period of time while allowing underlying materials of substrate <b>22</b> to remain relatively cool (e.g., below the softening or melting point of substrate <b>22</b>). In some such examples, substrate <b>22</b> may include a high strength metal alloy, such as a superalloy based on Ni, Co, Ni/Fe, or the like. Example superalloy materials for substrate <b>22</b> may include, for example, MAR-M002, MAR-M247, CMSX-3, CMSX-4, or CMSX-10.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b> may include zirconia or hafnia, alone or in combination, combined with one or more rare earth oxides, such as, for example yttria-stabilized zirconia or yttria-stabilized hafnia, as well as a calcia dopant (CaO). Suitable rare earth oxides include oxides of Lu (lutetium), Yb (ytterbium), Tm (thulium), Er (erbium), Ho (holmium), Dy (dysprosium), Tb (terbium), Gd (gadolinium), Eu (europium), Sm (samarium), Pm (promethium), Nd (neodymium), Pr (praseodymium), Ce (cerium), La (lanthanum), Y (yttrium), or Sc (scandium).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The inclusion of the calcia dopant in doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b> may provide the layer with increased resistance to the detrimental effects of CMAS by reducing the ingress and/or reactivity of doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b> with CMAS. In some examples, doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b> may form a metastable tetragonal-prime crystalline phase, a cubic crystalline phase, or a compound phase (Re<sub>2</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7 </sub>or Re<sub>2</sub>Hf<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) depending on the relative amounts of rare earth oxides and calcia added to the layer. In some examples, a metastable tetragonal-prime crystalline phase or a cubic crystalline phase may be obtained using a total amount of rare earth oxides and calcia in the layer <b>24</b> of between about 5 mole percent (mol. %) and about 14 mol. %.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some examples, doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b> may include the calcia dopant, yttria, and either zirconia or hafnia. In some such examples, the calcia in combination with the yttria present in the TBC layer may have a synergistic effect by slowing both the acidic and basic reactions associated with CMAS degradation.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The calcia dopant may be added to doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b> in an amount between about 2 mol. % to about 14 mol. % based on the compositional makeup of doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b> as deposited (e.g., relative to the presence the one or more rare earth oxides (e.g., yttria) and either zirconia or hafnia in the deposited state prior to being exposed to the operating environment). In some examples, of the amount of calcia added to doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b> may be offset by removal of one or more of the rare earth oxides from the zirconia or hafnia based layer. For example, yttria stabilized zirconia may include about 2-40 mol. % yttria and about 60-98 mol. % zirconia. Adding the calcia dopant to the composition may be offset by removing a comparable molar amount of yttria from the composition such that the total amount of zirconia remains between about 60-98 mol. %. In some examples, the as deposited doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b> may include between about 7 mol. % and about 14 mol. % calcia and yttria collectively and between about 86 and about 93 mol. % zirconia. Additionally or alternatively, the relative ratio of calcia to yttria in doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b> may be between about 2:5 (mol:mol) and about 4:3 (mol:mol).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Additionally, or alternatively, doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b> may include a columnar microstructure to improve the thermal insulation properties of the layer. In some examples, the porosity level of the columnar microstructure may be controlled by employing specific deposition method, for example suspension plasma spray, electron beam physical vapor deposition and plasma spray physical vapor deposition, ranging between about 2-25% porosity.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some examples, article <b>20</b> may include an optional bond layer <b>26</b> between doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b> and substrate <b>22</b>. Optional bond layer <b>26</b> may include any suitable material(s) configured to improve adhesion between substrate <b>22</b> and doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b>. For example, when substrate <b>22</b> includes a high strength metal alloy (e.g., Ni or Co based superalloy), bond layer <b>26</b> may likewise include an alloy, such as an MCrAlY alloy (where M is Ni, Co, or NiCo), a PNiAl nickel aluminide alloy (e.g., either unmodified or modified by Pt, Cr, Hf, Zr, Y, Si, and combinations thereof), a &#x3b3;-Ni+&#x3b3;&#x2032;-Ni<sub>3</sub>Al nickel aluminide alloy (either unmodified or modified by Pt, Cr, Hf, Zr, Y, Si, and combination thereof), or the like.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some examples, the composition and resulting phase constitution of optional bond layer <b>26</b> may be selected based on the chemical composition and phase constitution of substrate <b>22</b> and CMAS-resistant TBC layer. For example, if substrate <b>22</b> includes a superalloy with a &#x3b3;-Ni+&#x3b3;&#x2032;-Ni<sub>3</sub>Al nickel phase constitution, optional bond layer <b>26</b> may likewise include &#x3b3;-Ni+&#x3b3;&#x2032;-Ni<sub>3</sub>Al nickel phase constitution to provide better matching of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the layers. Such matching of CTEs between the layers may increase the mechanical stability (adhesion) between optional bond layer <b>26</b> and substrate <b>22</b> or doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b> and optional bond layer <b>26</b> may be deposited on substrate <b>22</b> using any suitable technique including, for example, plasma spraying, suspension plasma spray, plasma spray physical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, directed vapor deposition, electron beam physical vapor deposition, or the like. For example, doped CMAS-resistant TBC layer <b>24</b> may be deposited using plasma spraying, wherein each or the respective components (e.g. calcia, yttria, and zirconia) are provided as a relatively fine powder (e.g., an average particle size of less than about 5 micrometers) and either mixed together prior to being sprayed or as a result of the spraying process.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some examples, CMAS-resistant TBC layer may be relatively thin (e.g., in comparison to a multi-layer system with a TBC layer and a CMAS-resistant layer).

For example, as described above, substrate <b>12</b> may include a ceramic or CMC material such as, for example, a silicon carbide fibers embedded in a silicon carbide matrix. A substrate composed of ceramic or CMC component may be beneficial due to the ability of the substrate to be used at high operating temperatures compared to similar components composed with a high strength metal alloy. However, the underlying ceramic or CMC materials of such substrates have been found to be more prone to degradation caused by oxidation and/or water vapor compared to the high strength metal alloy counterparts. For example, at high temperatures, water vapor can react with the ceramic or CMC materials, e.g., silicon in a silicon carbide/silicon carbide (SiC/SiC) CMC, volatilizing the outer edge of the component and resulting in the slow regression of the CMC cross section.

EBC layers that include ytterbium silicate have been found to exhibit improved resistance to water vapor infiltration and degradation compared to other rare earth silicates (e.g., yttria silicate), but have likewise been found to be more susceptible to CMAS degradation compared to other coatings that include rare earth silicates. The combination of a doped CMAS-resistant EBC layer <b>34</b> including both ytterbium silicate and a calcia dopant may provide both improved resistance to water vapor infiltration and degradation as well as CMAS-resistant compared to a traditional EBC coating.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some examples, doped CMAS-resistant EBC layer <b>34</b> may include ytterbium disilicate (e.g., Yb<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>7</sub>) and the calcia dopant (e.g., deposited as coating of using only ytterbium disilicate and calcia). Ytterbium disilicate may provide a better oxygen barrier compared to ytterbium monosilicate, thereby reducing a rate at which a silica scale forms at an internal layer boundary, e.g., a boundary between optional bond layer <b>36</b> and doped CMAS-resistant EBC layer <b>34</b> or between substrate <b>32</b> and doped CMAS-resistant EBC layer <b>34</b>. In some examples, the presence of a silica scale may reduce the EBC life by increasing coating stress, which may lead to early spallation of the outer layers. Slow growth of silica scale under doped CMAS-resistant EBC layer <b>34</b> including calcia doped ytterbium disilicate may be attributed to stronger chemical bonding and reduced oxygen diffusion. In some examples, doped CMAS-resistant EBC layer <b>34</b> may include between about 2 mol. % and 14 mol. % calcia, with the remainder of the layer (e.g., about 86 mol. % and 98 mol. %) made of ytterbium disilicate based on the composition of the layer as deposited (e.g., before operational use).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some examples, doped CMAS-resistant EBC layer <b>34</b> may have a dense microstructure, a columnar microstructure, or a combination of dense and columnar microstructures. A dense microstructure may be more effective in preventing the infiltration of environmental contaminants, while a columnar microstructure may be more strain tolerant during thermal cycling. The combination of dense and columnar microstructures may be more effective in preventing the infiltration of CMAS or other environmental contaminants than a fully columnar microstructure while also being more strain tolerant during thermal cycling than a fully dense microstructure. In some examples, doped CMAS-resistant EBC layer <b>34</b> with a dense microstructure may have a porosity of less than about 20 vol. %, such as less than about 15 vol. %, less than 10 vol. %, or less than about 5 vol. %, where porosity is measured as a percentage of pore volume divided by total volume of the doped CMAS-resistant EBC layer <b>34</b>, and may be measured using optical microscopy, mercury porosimetry, or the like. Additionally, or alternatively, doped CMAS-resistant EBC layer <b>34</b> may include a columnar microstructure to improve the thermal insulation properties of the layer.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Article <b>30</b> also includes optional bond layer <b>36</b>. Similar to bond layer <b>26</b>, bond layer <b>36</b> may include any suitable material(s) configured to improve adhesion between substrate <b>32</b> and doped CMAS-resistant EBC layer <b>34</b>. For example, when substrate <b>32</b> includes a ceramic or CMC, bond layer <b>36</b> may likewise include ceramics or other materials that are compatible with the underlying ceramic of CMC substrate <b>32</b>. For example, bond layer <b>36</b> may include silicon, mullite, or the like. In some examples, optional bond layer <b>36</b> may further include other elements, such as one or more rare earth silicates (e.g., disilicate or monosilicate), one or more rare earth oxides to enhance the bonding between substrate <b>32</b>, doped CMAS-resistant EBC layer <b>34</b>, or both. In some examples, the materials of optional bond layer <b>36</b> may be selected to provide better matching of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) between the layers. Such matching of CTEs between the layers may increase the mechanical stability (adhesion) between bond layer <b>36</b> and substrate <b>32</b> or doped CMAS-resistant EBC layer <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some examples, bond layer <b>36</b> may include silicon metal, alone, or mixed with at least one other constituent.

The transition metal carbide (e.g., silicon carbide) may modify the oxidation resistance of bond layer <b>36</b>, modify chemical resistance of bond layer <b>36</b>, influence the CTE of bond layer <b>36</b>, improve silicon melt infiltration into bond layer <b>36</b>, or the like. In some examples, the slurry may include sufficient transition metal carbide particles so that bond layer <b>36</b> includes between about 1 vol. % and about 40 vol. % transition metal carbide (e.g., silicon carbide), between about 1 vol. % and about 20 vol. % transition metal silicon carbide, between about 5 vol. % and about 40 vol. % transition metal carbide, or between about 5 vol. % and about 20 vol. % transition metal carbide.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Doped CMAS-resistant EBC layer <b>34</b> and optional bond layer <b>36</b> may be deposited on substrate <b>32</b> using any suitable technique including, for example, plasma spraying, suspension plasma spray, plasma spray physical vapor deposition, physical vapor deposition, chemical vapor deposition, slurry deposition, directed vapor deposition, electron beam physical vapor deposition, or the like.
