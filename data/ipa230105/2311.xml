THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a continuous flow process for the synthesis of hydroxamic acids. The present invention more particularly relates to synthesis of hydroxamic acids in a microreactor system.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Hydroxamic acids can be represented by the structural formula R<sub>1</sub>C(O)N(OH)R<sub>2</sub>, where R<sub>1 </sub>is typically hydrogen or a hydrocarbon radical such as an alkyl radical, a cycloalkyl radical or an aromatic radical and R<sub>2 </sub>can be a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbon radical such as an aromatic radical or an alkyl radical.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hydroxamic acids are known to exhibit microbicidal effect and can be employed in practice for controlling undesirable microorganisms. The active compounds are suitable for use as phytoprotective agents, in particular as fungicides. Fungicidal agents in plant protection are employed for combating plasmodiophoromycetes, oomycetes, chytridiomycetes, zygomycetes, ascomycetes, basidiomycetes and deuteromycetes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Basically, hydroxamic acids have been prepared by different methods, the most common two are; the reaction between acid chloride and hydroxylamine, and the other between esters and hydroxylamine. In the reaction between an ester and hydroxylamine, an alkyl or aryl ester reacts with hydroxylamine in the presence of alkali, the free acid obtained by acidification of cold solution, this reaction takes place in an absolute alcohol and proceeds rapidly at room temperature particularly in presence of an equimolar quantity of sodium alkoxide. In the reaction between acid chloride and hydroxylamine, the N-substituted hydroxylamine is acylated at low temperature diethyl ether medium containing aqueous suspension of sodium hydrogen carbonate.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 3,922,872 disclose an improved method of making fatty hydroxamates. Hydroxylamine sulfate and the methyl ester of a fatty acid are reacted in the presence of dimethylamine in an anhydrous lower alcohol slurry. The free hydroxamic acids formed are neutralized with dimethylamine or an alkali metal base to yield an ammonium or alkali metal salt. However, the disclosed procedure also employs flammable lower alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol, requiring the filtration of the final hydroxamic product, which is hazardous. Moreover, because of the heterogeneous nature of the reaction, the reaction rate is very slow, e.g., on the order 15 hours in methanol and 5 days in isopropyl alcohol, and the yields are relatively low, i.e., on the order of about 75 percent.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">CN103922968A disclosed a process of preparation of hydroxamic acid or hydroxamate. In this process a base is added to a methanol solution of hydroxylamine salt at temperature not more than 45&#xb0; C. which is then further added to an organic carboxylate, for 2-6 hours at 30&#x2dc;70&#xb0; C. After completion of the reaction, system was cooled to below 30&#xb0; C., sulfuric acid was added to the reaction system, and then methanol was recovered by distillation. The drawback of this process is the lower temperature that increases batch cycle time up to 6 hours. Further, distillation step also requires more cost as compare to processes without solvent.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 6,288,246 disclosed a process for preparing a molecule containing a hydroxamic acid group, comprising reacting hydroxylamine, or a salt thereof, with a((C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>)alkyl)<sub>3</sub>silyl halide, preferably ((C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub>)alkyl)<sub>3</sub>silyl chloride, in the presence of a base, followed by reaction with a carboxylic acid halide containing molecule followed by reaction with an acid, with the proviso that the carboxylic acid halide containing molecule does not contain a hydroxy, primary amine, secondary amine or thiol group. The drawback of this process is long reaction time of 12 hours and also reaction temperature is kept as low as 0&#xb0; C. to 30&#xb0; C. that slows down the reaction.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, the processes disclosed above are batch processes, which can require intermittent introduction of frequently changing raw materials, varying process conditions within the vessel, and different purification methods. Typically, in batch processing, vessels are often idle while waiting for raw materials or undergoing quality control checks and cleaning. Therefore, need exist in the art for simple and rapid process for preparation of hydroxamic acid.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Continuous flow processes allow a constant feed of raw materials to the process vessel and continual product withdrawal. Continuous flow process is very promising recent micro reaction technology, as it offers, as compared to the traditional batch system, a very uniform residence time, much better thermal control, and a lower hold-up, leading to a significant step change in terms of chemical yield and selectivity, and safety. Continuous flow microreactors are now widely used in labs for testing and developing new routes of synthesis. For laboratory and development work, they offer a very small hold-up with a sufficient residence time, leading to a very small use of material for testing, which is of particular interest in the development phase, shortening the time required to make a requested quantity, and when the raw material is expensive. In addition, the small amount of material involved makes reduces safety and environmental risks significantly.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An object of the present invention is to provide a process for the synthesis of hydroxamic acids by continuous flow process.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the synthesis of aliphatic hydroxamic acids in a microreactor system.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Yet another object of the invention is to provide a single step continuous flow process for the synthesis of aliphatic hydroxamic acids from lower alkyl esters.

The present inventors performed various continuous flow screening experiments to find the residence time and temperature that resulted in the maximum yield and high purity of hydroxamic acid.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0045">In an aspect the present invention provides a process for production of hydroxamic acid comprising mixing alkyl ester with hydroxylamine salt in presence of a base at predetermined conditions of temperature and pressure and flow rate in a microreactor system.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0046">The microreactor used in the process according to the invention may comprise further functional units which exert additional functions in the chemical process regime.

In general, for example and without limitation, a continuous flow process can allow a continuous flow of reactants that can be charged in a reactor, vessel or line, allowing mixing or reaction of the reactants to form products. This is followed by continuous flow (discharge) of the products from the reactor, vessel or line. Thus, a continuous flow process can be considered as a process where reactants are charged or fed into a reactor, vessel or line, while a product is simultaneously removed during part of the reaction process. A continuous flow process can allow a single step or multiple steps to be performed, where each step independently of the other can be a reaction, separation or purification.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0057">The term &#x201c;alkyl&#x201d; as used herein refers to the radical of saturated aliphatic groups, including straight-chain alkyl groups, branched&#x2014;chain alkyl groups, cycloalkyl (alicyclic) groups, alkyl substituted cycloalkyl groups, and cycloalkyl substituted alkyl groups.

In general, a line refers to, for example and without limitation, a tube, conduit or pipe for conveying or transporting fluids. In a continuous flow process, the line can be designed as an inlet and/or outlet to allow charging and/or discharging of fluids, such as reactants or products. In addition, the line (such as, in a reaction mixing line) can be designed to receive reactants and allow mixing and/or reaction of the reactants. Where the line is designed to receive reactants, the size and shape of the line can be adapted to enhance mixing and permit flow of the reactants into the line, minimizing back pressure.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0060">The term &#x201c;reactor&#x201d; or &#x201c;vessel&#x201d; as used herein are not particularly limited and should be known to a person of skill in the art. In general, a reactor or vessel relates to, for example and without limitation, a container or vat designed to receive chemicals for a chemical process, such as a chemical reaction. In a continuous flow process, the reactor or vessel can be designed to receive continuous charge of the reactants, optionally, a residence time of the reactants within the reactor or vessel, to allow mixing and/or reaction of the reactants to form the products, followed by a continuous discharge of the products.

Repetitive batches were taken in these reactors by varying process parameters, such as flow rates, residence time, reaction temperature and pressure. The temperature of the reaction was varied from 50&#xb0; C. to 90&#xb0; C. and effect of varying temperature was evaluated against yield of aliphatic hydroxamic acids. Optimum pressure required to conduct the reaction was varied between 2-5 bar. It was found that yield upto 98% can be achieved when reaction is conducted at 90&#xb0; C. and pressure is set upto 4-5 bar in a continuous flow microreactors. It is also observed that the amount of certain impurities formed during synthesis of aliphatic hydroxamic acid reduced drastically, leading to high purity and high yield of the aliphatic hydroxamic acid synthesized in continuous flow system according to the present invention. Inventors of the present invention thus successfully prepared aliphatic hydroxamic acids from lower alkyl esters in a continuous flow. The process described above can synthesize aliphatic hydroxamic acid very quickly under controlled conditions.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230002312A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230002312A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230002312A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230002312A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
