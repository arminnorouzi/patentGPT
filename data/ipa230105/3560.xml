Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to magnet fixing implements.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Japanese Registered Utility Model No. 3161399 (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;Patent Document 1&#x201d;) proposes a magnet fixing implement, attached to a rotation center portion of an indicator needle of a pressure gauge, and configured to hold a magnet for detecting a rotation angle of the indicator needle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, because the magnet fixing implement proposed in Patent Document 1 has a cover located above the magnet, it is difficult to reduce a thickness of the magnet fixing implement, and it is not possible to install the magnet fixing implement when a gap between the indicator needle and a transparent plate of the pressure gauge is narrow. Moreover, the magnet fixing implement proposed in Patent Document 1 cannot be installed for general purpose use with respect to indicator needles having various sizes, because the dimensions of each part need to be adapted to the indicator needle having a particular size.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, because the technique proposed in Patent Document 1 requires the provision of a replacement transparent plate having the same external shape as the transparent plate of the pressure gauge, additional costs, such as the cost of components, the cost of molds, or the like, become additionally required for this provision of the replacement transparent plate. Moreover, because the technique proposed in Patent Document 1 requires the provision of the replacement transparent plate according to an outer diameter of a meter, it is not possible to easily adapt to a plurality of kinds of meters having different outer diameters. Further, a conventional method determines a center position of an analog meter, and attaches a magnetic sensor to the center position, but there is a problem in that this method is troublesome to perform.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a magnet fixing implement for fixing a magnet for rotation angle detection, attached to a rotation center portion of an indicator needle of an analog meter, includes a main body; a magnet holder provided on an upper surface of the main body, and configured to hold the magnet at a rotation center of the indicator needle; a slit formed in the main body in a flat shape perpendicular to the rotation center, and configured to accommodate the rotation center portion of the indicator needle; a rotation shaft holder provided below the slit of the main body, and configured to hold a rotation shaft of the indicator needle; and an indicator needle restricting portion protruding toward an outer side from an outer peripheral edge of the main body, and configured to restrict a rotation of the indicator needle with respect to the main body.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another aspect of the present disclosure, a positioning device for positioning a sensor unit with respect to a center of a front surface of a generally circular and transparent cover member covering a display surface of an analog meter, includes a pair of clamping members provided to oppose each other in a first direction, and configured to clamp an outer peripheral surface of an outer frame of the cover member; a rack extending in the first direction, and configured to link the pair of clamping members so that a separation distance of the pair of clamping members is adjustable; a center block positioned on a back surface side of the cover member at an intermediate position of the pair of clamping members, regardless of the separation distance of the pair of clamping members;

The magnet fixing implement <b>100</b> is formed by an injection molding of an elastic resin material, such as a polypropylene (PP) resin or the like, for example. In the following description, for the sake of convenience, a direction along a rotation center AX<b>2</b> of the rotation shaft <b>32</b> is regarded as an up-down direction or a Z-axis direction, a length direction of a long needle portion <b>36</b> of the indicator needle <b>30</b> is regarded as a front-rear direction or an X-axis direction, and a width direction of the long needle portion <b>36</b> of the indicator needle <b>30</b> is regarded as a left-right direction or a Y-axis direction.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the main body <b>100</b>A of the magnet fixing implement <b>100</b> is formed with a slit <b>102</b> having a constant height range and parallel with respect to an XY-plane, at a center portion along the up-down direction (the Z-axis direction). The slit <b>102</b> is a portion that accommodates a portion of the indicator needle <b>30</b> centered about the rotation center AX<b>2</b>. The slit <b>102</b> has an opening <b>102</b>A at an end on a positive side of the Y-axis. Hence, it is possible to slide and insert the rotation center portion <b>30</b>A of the indicator needle <b>30</b> into the slit <b>102</b> from the opening <b>102</b>A. A top surface <b>102</b>B and a bottom surface <b>102</b>C of the opening <b>102</b>A have a tapered shape, and are sloped so that the height range of the opening <b>102</b>A gradually increases toward an outer side (positive side of the Y-axis). Accordingly, the rotation center portion <b>30</b>A of the indicator needle <b>30</b> can easily be inserted into the slit <b>102</b> from the opening <b>102</b>A.

Thus, the outer frame <b>212</b> is clamped by the pair of clamping members <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> according to the outer diameter of the outer frame <b>212</b>, to align the center of the positioning device <b>100</b> to coincide with the center of the front surface <b>210</b>A of the cover glass <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0113">(4) Next, the operator fits the support holes <b>142</b>A and <b>142</b>B of the positioning plate <b>140</b> over the upper ends of the pins <b>151</b> and <b>152</b>, respectively. As a result, the center of positioning device <b>100</b>, the center of the front surface <b>210</b>A of the cover glass <b>210</b>, and the center of the positioning plate <b>140</b> coincide with one another.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0114">(5) Next, the operator peels off the releasing paper of a double-sided tape adhered to a bottom surface of the sensor case <b>301</b>, and fits the protrusion <b>301</b>A of the sensor case <b>301</b> into the retaining hole <b>141</b> of the positioning plate <b>140</b>.

Hence, the positioning device <b>100</b> according to the second embodiment can easily position the magnetic sensor <b>302</b> to the center of the analog meter <b>200</b>, with respect to a plurality of kinds of analog meters <b>200</b> having different outer diameters.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example of Installation of Sensor Unit <b>300</b></heading><p id="p-0122" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a plan view illustrating an example of an installation of the sensor unit <b>300</b> to the analog meter <b>200</b> according to the second embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a side view illustrating the example of the installation of the sensor unit <b>300</b> to the analog meter <b>200</b> according to the second embodiment.

The indicator needle <b>203</b> has the rotation shaft <b>203</b>A, and rotates around the rotation shaft <b>203</b>A as the rotation center thereof, to point and indicate a value of the scale printed on the display surface <b>202</b> according to various measured values. The magnet <b>204</b> has a disk shape, and is attached to the rotation center of the indicator needle <b>203</b>. In the plan view, the magnet <b>204</b> is magnetized to the N pole and the S pole on respective sides of a boundary line passing through a center of the magnet <b>204</b>.
