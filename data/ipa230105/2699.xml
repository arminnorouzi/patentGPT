preparing same and a composition comprising said magnesium salt of one or more PUFAs and at least one stability enhancer.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including omega-3 (&#x3c9;-3) and omega-6 (&#x3c9;-6), have been given much attention since the recognition of their beneficial effects on human nutrition and disease prevention three decades ago. Nevertheless, the average daily dietary intake of PUFAs is inadequate and falls far behind the suggested daily intake of 0.65 g in most of the population because of a variety of reasons, such as the dietary patterns of the population and the accessibility of the dietary lipids rich with PUFAs. Dietary supplementation with PUFAs is therefore an alternative to the substitution of commonly used dietary lipids, which usually exist in three forms: triacylglycerol (TAG) form, ethyl ester (EE) form and free acid form (FFA). The bioavailability of PUFAs in FFA and TAG forms has been demonstrated superior to the PUFAs in EE form. In addition, the PUFAs in FFA form have advantages over the TAG form due to the lack of dependence on pancreatic lipase as well as the complex fatty acid profiles in the glycerial backbone of TAG.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is desired to find a mean to take an adequate dosage of PUFAs to confer the desired benefits while reducing the risk of vitamins overdose as well as an increase in the intake of cholesterol and other saturated fatty acids. The concentrated forms of PUFAs from marine oils have been investigated and several techniques have been developed, such as adsorption chromatography, fractional or molecular distillation, enzymatic splitting, winterization, supercritical fluid extraction and urea complexation. Only a few of them are suitable for large-scale production. Winterization, as a traditional and simple method for the enrichment of PUFAs in certain solvents at a given temperature, has been exploited widely and usually falls into two categories: Category 1: The PUFAs in the form of FFA or EE are concentrated by low-temperature crystallization. Category 2: One PUFA as metal salt (such as EPA) is selectively concentrated by low-temperature crystallization in the presence of others (such as DHA and DPA) from fatty acids.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An aspect relates to a composition comprising a magnesium salt of one or more polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and at least one stability enhancer, wherein said composition is in solid form at a temperature of about 20-25&#xb0;

or &#x201c;PUFA&#x201d; as used herein means fatty acid compounds containing two or more ethylenic carbon-carbon double bonds in their carbon backbone. Two major classes of PUFAs are omega-3 and omega-6 PUFAs, characterized by the position of the final double bond in the chemical structure of PUFAs.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Omega-3 PUFAs refer to the position of the final double bond, which in omega-3, the double bond is between the third and fourth carbon atoms from the &#x201c;omega&#x201d; or tail end of the molecular chain.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The three most important omega-3 PUFAs are docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which has 22 carbons and 6 double bonds beginning with the third carbon from the methyl end and is designated as (C22:6n-3), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which is designated as (20:5n-3), and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) which is designated as (C18:3n-3).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Other omega-3 PUFAs include: Eicosatrienoic acid (ETE) (C20:3(n-3)), Eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA) (C20:4 (n-3)), Heneicosapentaenoic acid (HPA) (C21:5(n-3)), Docosapentaenoic acid (Clupanodonic acid) (DPA) C22:5(n-3), Tetracosapentaenoic acid (C24:5(n-3)), and Tetracosahexaenoic acid (Nisinic acid) (C24:6(n-3)).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Omega-6 PUFAs have their terminal double bond in what is referred to as the omega six-position, meaning the last double bond occurs at the sixth carbon from the omega end of the fatty acid molecule.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Among the omega-6 PUFAs, linoleic acid (C18:2n-6) and arachidonic acid (C20:4n-6) are two of the major omega-6s.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Other omega-6 PUFAs include: Eicosadienoic acid (C20:2(n-6)), Dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) (C20:3 (n-6)), Docosadienoic acid (C22:2 (n-6)), Adrenic acid (C22:4 (n-6)), Docosapentaenoic acid (Osbond acid) (C22:5(n-6)), Tetracosatetraenoic acid C24:4(n-6), and Tetracosapentaenoic acid (C24:5(n-6)).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The terms &#x201c;fat&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;oil&#x201d; used herein refer to any fat and/or oil containing a level of PUFAs suitable for use in the compositions and methods described herein. The PUFA esters present in the fat or oil are as alkyl esters, triglycerides, diglycerides, monoglycerides, or a mixture thereof. In the case of diglycerides or triglycerides, the glycerol unit may optionally bear a phosphorus derivative (hence the fat and/or oil could be or contain phospholipids).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The term &#x201c;stability enhancer&#x201d; as used herein means an agent that is acceptable for use in food or drug compositions that prolongs the stability and shelf life of a composition comprising magnesium salts of PUFAs. It is understood that the stability enhancer should be in an amount efficient to provide an increase in stability and shelf life as assessed by peroxide value (PV), anisidine value (AV) and/or Totox value, known in the art, but also as defined herein. The decrease of at least one of the PV or AV numerical values depends on its original magnitude: very large values, in the hundreds, may be reduced in one treatment to values in the twenties. AV values closer to a regulated value of 25 (say 20 to 50) may be reduced to values around 1 to 5, depending on the species the oil comes from and the amount of stability enhancer added. PV values around 3 to 10 may be reduced to 0.1 to 2, depending on the species the oil comes from and the amount of stability enhancer added. On occasions, the PV value was below detection limits.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The &#x201c;alkali base&#x201d; used herein refers to suitable bases which substantially fully solubilize in the aqueous alcoholic solution and are capable of hydrolyzing (saponifying) the ester linkage between the glycerol and fatty acid of the triglycerides. The alkali base could be for example, but not limited to, an alkali hydroxide such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide and sodium carbonate.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The term &#x201c;dispersive organic solvent&#x201d; used herein to disperse magnesium salts of PUFAs refers to any organic solvent which does not dissolve (or at least not substantially or in an amount that would substantially negatively impact the yield) the magnesium salts of PUFAs.

The source of fat or oil differs from one to another and may contain different species proportions, such as the variety of proportion of triglycerides, diglycerides and monoglycerides.
