The touch panel may be designed either as a touchpad or as a touchscreen. The touchscreen additionally includes display elements and thus being able to graphically display information concerning the present rotational position of the operating element.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is necessary to change an electrical capacitance in order to influence a capacitively detecting touch panel. For this purpose, the body capacitance of a human user is typically utilized in known rotary actuator assemblies via an electrically conductive connection. The disadvantage here is that the correct functioning depends on external factors. If the user is wearing thick gloves, for example, then a function is no longer provided due to the lack of a coupling.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Alternatively, it may be provided that the rotary actuator itself has sufficient capacitance to influence the touch panel. However, this requires provision of a metal body with adequate mass at the rotary actuator. Such a design prevents, firstly, development of particularly compact rotary actuators, and secondly, manufacture of the rotary body, provided as the operating element, from a freely selectable material.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object is to provide a rotary actuator assembly that does not have the above-mentioned problems.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In embodiments of the present invention, a rotary actuator assembly includes a rotary actuator and a touch panel. The rotary actuator includes a stator, a rotary body, and a sensor ring. The stator is situated on a capacitively-sensing detection surface of the touch panel. The stator forms at least one electrical contact point which abuts a fixed position of the detection surface of the touch panel. At least one contact spring is fixed on the stator and is electrically connected respectively to the at least one electrical contact point. The rotary body is rotatably mounted on the stator. The sensor ring is coupled to the rotary body to be rotatable with the rotary body relative to the stator. The sensor ring includes a first ring surface and a second ring surface. The first ring surface includes contact surfaces and insulating surfaces alternately arranged over the circumference thereof. The second ring surface includes a circumferential metal surface that is electrically connected to the contact surfaces of the first ring surface. The contact surfaces and the insulating surfaces are contacted by the at least one contact spring, which is electrically connected respectively to an electrical contact point, as the sensor ring rotates relative to the stator. Rotational position changes of the sensor ring thereby generate variable electrical signals at the least one electrical contact point. The variable electrical signals are detectable by the touch panel. The touch panel includes a &#x201c;mutual capacitance touch sensor&#x201d; assembly.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the present invention achieve the above object and/or other objects in that the touch panel includes a sensor assembly of the mutual capacitance touch sensor type, and in that the second ring surface of the sensor ring includes a circumferential metal surface that is electrically connected to the contact surfaces of the first ring surface.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The proposed rotary actuator assembly achieves the above-stated object in a particularly simple and cost-effective manner.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As explained below based on exemplary embodiments, the rotary actuator assembly functions independently of a coupling to the electrical body capacitance of a human user. This is advantageous for reliable functioning, as the functioning is not so dependent on variable or changing external circumstances. It is particularly advantageous that the rotary actuator assembly may be operated with any kind of gloves or with electrically nonconductive prostheses, and thus functions reliably.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is likewise particularly advantageous that the self-capacitance of the rotary actuator is of secondary importance. Thus, the rotary actuator does not require a solid metal body, which allows the implementation of particularly compact rotary actuators.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">This results in the further advantage that the material of which the rotary body is made may be freely selected. The rotary body may thus be made completely of plastic, for example, or from so-called natural materials such as wood.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is also advantageous that the rotary body may be designed in the particularly advantageous form of a toroidally or hollow cylindrically shaped rotary ring. Such a rotary ring has an inner recess via which portions of the touch panel are discernible. When the touch panel is designed as a touchscreen, information concerning the present rotational position, such as a percentage of the set magnitude, may be displayed within the rotary ring. In particular, when multiple rotary actuators are used on a touchscreen, this in turn allows a simplified association between the rotary actuators and the display, and better utilization of the surface area of the touchscreen.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is also particularly advantageous that the rotary actuator only has to rest against (be in contact with) one or just a few contact points at the touch panel, which also makes it possible to arrange the rotary actuator at the edge of the touch panel while taking up only a small portion of the detection surface.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Operating principles (mode of operations) and possible advantageous embodiments and refinements of a rotary actuator assembly according to the present invention are explained in greater detail below, based on exemplary embodiments illustrated in the drawings.

Another contact pad <b>24</b> that rests against detection surface <b>31</b> of touch panel <b>30</b> is connected to wire ring <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Contact ring <b>26</b> of first ring surface <b>12</b> of sensor ring <b>11</b> comes into contact with at least one of protrusions <b>25</b> of wire ring <b>22</b> from rotary body <b>10</b> shifting or tilting relative to the stator. This results in an electrical connection between conductive surfaces <b>13</b>, <b>16</b>, and <b>26</b> of sensor ring <b>11</b> and contact pad <b>24</b>, which may be detected by touch panel <b>30</b>. An additional pushbutton function is thus achieved in a simple manner.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref> show that for forming the rotary actuator assembly, rotary body <b>10</b> may be situated far out at the edge of touch panel <b>30</b>, so that only a small overlap of rotary actuator <b>1</b> with detection surface <b>31</b> of touch panel <b>30</b> results. This allows better use to be made of detection surface <b>31</b>, or alternatively, allows a relatively small touch panel <b>30</b> to be provided or also a larger number of rotary actuators <b>1</b> to be situated on touch panel <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As illustrated in the sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, this is achieved in that no movable slider moves on detection surface <b>31</b>, and that only relatively few contact pads <b>18</b>, <b>23</b>, and <b>24</b>, which may also be relatively close to one another, need to be situated on detection surface <b>31</b>. Thus, with only the three illustrated contact pads <b>18</b>, <b>23</b>, and <b>24</b> of rotary actuator <b>1</b>, a rotary actuator assembly may be implemented that has detection of the amplitude of rotation and of the rotational direction, as well as a pushbutton function.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">For capacitively sensing touch panels, primarily two functional principles, known as the self-capacitance touch sensor principle and the mutual capacitance touch sensor principle, are known.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The self-capacitance touch sensor principle, not used here, employs an x-y grid of open conducting electrodes that are connected to a controller. These conducting electrodes, the same as a capacitor plate, have a certain capacitance relative to earth ground which may be detected by a sensor system. When an electrode is touched or approached, the detected capacitance at the electrode changes due to the additional capacitance of the human body that acts.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">To implement rotary actuator <b>1</b> according to the present invention, touch panel <b>30</b> is presumed to be a touchpad of the mutual capacitance touch sensor type which uses the mutual capacitance principle for touch recognition. This principle is schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C</figref>, which illustrate the functional principle of a mutual capacitance touch panel, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B, and <b>11</b>C</figref>, which illustrate the operating principle of the mutual capacitance touch panel when touched.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">A touchpad that operates according to this functional principle includes a two-dimensional matrix made up of transmission elements Tx and reception elements Rx situated in alternation. For explaining the function, only a short one-dimensional section from this matrix is illustrated.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The reception elements Rx (illustrated with no shading) are all jointly connected to an evaluation circuit AS. The transmission elements Tx (illustrated with dark shading) are connected to a multiplexer Mux that acts on all transmission elements Tx with a transmission signal, row by row and column by column in succession. For this purpose, via the multiplexer switch MS schematically illustrated here as a changeover switch, only one transmission element Tx is ever connected to a transmission signal line SL, while at the same time, all other transmission elements Tx are connected to device ground GND.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, and <b>10</b>C</figref>, an electrical field E thus migrates from one transmission element Tx to the next and is detected in each case by the reception elements Rx adjacent to the respective transmission element Tx. As long as no contact event takes place, the overall signal strengths detected by reception elements Rx and recorded by evaluation circuit AS are always approximately equal at any point in time.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">This changes when, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, a human finger F is brought into the vicinity of one of the transmission elements Tx.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">When the touched transmission element Tx is actively switched by multiplexer Mux, the finger F capacitively couples to the electrical field E emanating from the transmission element Tx. Due to the relatively high capacitance C of the human body, via the human body there is a further capacitive coupling to ground GND&#x2032;, which greatly weakens the electrical field E. At this point in time the evaluation circuit AS records a reduced intensity of the electrical field E at the reception elements Rx. Since multiplexer Mux and evaluation circuit AS are both part of the same touch panel electronics system, evaluation circuit AS may easily determine the coordinates of transmission element Tx that is active at this point in time.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to this functional principle, it is also possible to recognize contacts at multiple locations within a multiplex cycle, not exactly simultaneously, but very quickly in succession at millisecond intervals, and thus &#x201c;quasi-simultaneously.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">For the rotary actuator assembly according to the present invention, a sensor ring SR according to the above description is used instead of a human finger F. Compared to the human body, the sensor ring SR has only a very low electrical capacitance. Therefore, it initially appears surprising that the sensor ring SR generates an evaluatable or analyzable signal on a capacitive touch panel.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The electrical operating principle of the rotary actuator according to the present invention is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B, and <b>12</b>C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B, and <b>13</b>C</figref> by a sensor ring SR shown schematically and a sliding contact SK shown by a switch symbol. The touching or contact of an electrically conductive contact surface <b>13</b> by contact spring <b>17</b> of sliding contact <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref>), shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B, and <b>13</b>C</figref>, is represented by sliding contact SK being a closed switch, and the contact of an insulating surface <b>14</b> by contact spring <b>17</b> of sliding contact <b>20</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A, <b>12</b>B, and <b>12</b>C</figref>, is correspondingly represented by sliding contact SK being an opened switch. Sliding contact SK thus connects or disconnects the mutually electrically connected conductive surfaces of sensor ring SR by use of a contact pad KP that is capacitively coupled to a transmission element Tx situated underneath.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">If this transmission element Tx is actively switched by multiplexer Mux and sliding contact SK is opened, then the electrical field strength E recorded by reception elements Rx (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>) does not differ from the field strengths that are detected for the other active transmission elements (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>C</figref>), since the self-capacitance of a contact pad KP is relatively low.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">This changes as soon as sliding contact SK is closed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>, the closed sliding contact SK establishes a galvanic connection between contact pad KP and sensor ring SR. This results, on the one hand, in a capacitive coupling between the active transmission element Tx and contact pad KP, and on the other hand, in a further capacitive coupling due to a sufficient proximity of the conductive surfaces of sensor ring SR to the surrounding inactive transmission elements Tx.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Since all inactive transmission elements are connected to device ground GND by the multiplexer, via their capacitive connection, charges may be shifted, which reduces the field strength that is recorded by reception elements Rx around the active transmission element Tx. Evaluation circuit AS may thus distinguish between a closed sliding contact SK and an opened sliding contact SK.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Similarly, multiple sliding contacts <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> of rotary actuator <b>1</b> may of course also be evaluated in a corresponding manner, or a pressure actuation on rotary body <b>10</b> may also be recognized for a push switch function, in this case the contact of contact ring <b>26</b> with wire ring <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>) taking over the role of a closed sliding contact SK.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">LIST OF REFERENCE SYMBOLS</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><b>1</b> rotary actuator</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><b>10</b> rotary body (rotary ring)</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><b>11</b> sensor ring</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><b>12</b> first ring surface of the sensor ring</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><b>13</b> contact surface(s) of the first ring surface</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><b>14</b> insulating surfaces of the first ring surface</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><b>15</b> second ring surface of the sensor ring</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><b>16</b> metal surface of the second ring surface</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><b>17</b> contact spring of the first sliding contact</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><b>18</b> contact pad of the first sliding contact</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><b>19</b> contact point</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><b>20</b> first sliding contact</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><b>21</b> second sliding contact</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><b>22</b> wire ring</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><b>23</b> contact pad</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><b>24</b> contact pad</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><b>25</b> protrusions</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><b>26</b> contact ring</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><b>30</b> touch panel</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><b>31</b> detection surface of the touch panel</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">A, B electrical signals</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">AS evaluation circuit</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">C capacitance (of a human)</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">E electrical field</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">F finger</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">GND (device) ground</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">GND&#x2032; (earth) ground</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">KP contact pad</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">MS multiplexer switch</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Rx reception elements</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">SK sliding contact</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">SL transmission signal line</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">SR sensor ring</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Mux multiplexer</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Tx transmission elements</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">While exemplary embodiments are described above, it is not intended that these embodiments describe all possible forms of the present invention.
