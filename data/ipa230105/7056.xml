The various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in any of numerous ways, as the described concepts are not limited to any particular manner of implementation.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Entities can provide a variety of services for their customers via smart TV devices. For example, a smart TV service can execute on a smart TV device to allow a customer to consume various forms of video or audio content, and to interact with such content. Occasionally, a customer may experience difficulty with the smart TV service and may wish to interact with the company that provides the smart TV service (e.g., through a human representative of the company or an automated electronic service provided by the company) in order to resolve the difficulty, for example by making a request for service. However, it can be difficult for customers to initiate such a service request in a manner that allows the company and the customer to efficiently complete the service request interaction. For example, the issue may arise while the customer is interacting with the smart TV device, but the smart TV device may not be capable of communicating directly with a computing device associated with the company (e.g., an agent's computing device in a contact center environment). As a result, any fault condition or other contextual information from the smart TV device may not be able to be conveyed or transmitted to the computing device associated with the company. Even in instances where such communication may be feasible, the customer may wish to complete the service request interaction through a different communication channel, such as via SMS messages, email, or a telephone call.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, in some instances an entity may provide services to a customer unrelated to a smart TV device or other computing device, but may want to interact with the customer via a smart TV device to complete a service request interaction. For example, interactions between a service provider and a customer may take place at an in person meeting, but this may require a customer to travel to the location of the service provider to complete a service interaction. Depending on the distance between the customer and the service provider, the frequency of such service interactions, and the customer's availability and capability to travel, it can be burdensome for the customer to conduct in-person service request interactions in this manner. As a result, a customer may wish to conduct such service interactions remotely when possible. For example, while a patient may be required to travel to a healthcare provider in order to receive physical treatment or testing, a service request interaction in which the patient consults verbally with the healthcare provider, reviews test results, etc. can be accomplished remotely in some instances.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Media devices, such as smart TV devices, can be used to facilitate such remote service interactions by providing audio and video inputs and outputs to allow a customer to interact with a service provider without traveling to the physical location of the service provider. However, it can be difficult for customers to initiate such a service request in a manner that allows the service provider and the customer to efficiently complete the service request. For example, a smart TV device may not be configured to communicate directly with a computing device of the service provider.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">This disclosure provides systems and methods for establishing such remote service request interactions. For example, connector applications may execute on a smart TV device in a customer's home as well as on a computing device in a contact center of a service provider. In addition, a data processing system intermediary to the smart TV device and the computing device in the contact center environment can execute a respective connector application. Together, the connector application may coordinate to allow the smart TV device and the computing device in the contact center environment to communicate via the data processing system to complete the service request interaction. This technical solution can more quickly access a contact center environment via a communication session with a smart TV device, for example, without a second communication session that initially bypasses the smart TV device. Avoiding the second initial communication session can reduce latency as well as processing power, energy requirements and bandwidth that would otherwise be associated with a second initial communication session.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram depicting an example system <b>100</b> for establishing service request interactions, according to an illustrative implementation.

For example, a television or smart television can include video display capabilities as well as capabilities for executing software such as the smart TV service <b>115</b>, receiving input via the input device <b>140</b>, and receiving content items (e.g., from a remote content item server or from a database storing content items within the device itself). Such a device can be a single integrated device that may implement the functionality of the smart TV device <b>105</b> and the display <b>110</b> together.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The smart TV device <b>105</b> can execute a smart TV service <b>115</b>. The smart TV service <b>115</b> can be an application or script configured to provide video or audio content. For example, the smart TV service <b>115</b> can be configured to receive streaming video content for display by the display <b>110</b> (e.g., from a remote content server or from a database of stored video content local to the smart TV device <b>105</b>). The smart TV service <b>115</b> can also provide a graphical user interface to establish or to facilitate interactions with a user. For example, such an interface can allow the user to select content items to be displayed by the display <b>110</b> and to interact with such content items, such as by pausing or resuming playback of the content items. The user can interact with the content provided by the smart TV service <b>115</b> by using the input device <b>140</b>. For example, the input device <b>140</b> can be one or more of a remote, a pointing device, a keyboard, or the like, and may communicate with the smart TV device <b>105</b> via a wired connection or via a wireless connection such as an infrared signal or other optical input.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some examples, a user may wish to initiate a service request interaction relating to the smart TV service <b>115</b>. For example, occasionally the user may have a problem or question regarding the smart TV service <b>115</b>. The user may therefore want to request help from a service agent or representative. For example, the user may have a question about a user account associated with the smart TV service <b>115</b>, or may have difficulty interacting with a feature provided by the smart TV service <b>115</b>. To address the problem or question, the user may wish to interact with a representative or an automated service of the company that provides the smart TV service <b>115</b>. For example, a customer service representative may work in the contact center environment <b>135</b> to handle service requests made by the user.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The representative may use a device such as the computing device <b>130</b> to process service requests. For example, the computing device <b>130</b> can include a display device, an audio output device such as a speaker, and input devices such as a pointing device and a keyboard, to allow an agent using the computing device <b>130</b> to receive and respond to requests for service from customers. The computing device <b>130</b> may also execute a program that provides an automated service to help the user address a problem or question the user may have. The contact center environment <b>135</b> can include a number of agent or user workstations such as the computing device <b>130</b> connected to the internet or other communication network (e.g., the cloud environment <b>125</b>) to communicate with customer computing devices (e.g., the smart TV device <b>105</b> or the mobile device <b>145</b>), for example via telephone, voice over internet protocol, short message service, instant message, or other mode of communication to manage service requests initiated by the customers.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">It can be a technical challenge to establish or to complete such service request interactions between a customer and a service representative in an efficient and convenient manner. For example, there may be no communication channel directly linking the smart TV device <b>105</b> with the computing device <b>130</b>. If the user of the smart TV device <b>105</b> initiates the service request in a different manner (e.g., via the mobile device <b>145</b>, by calling a telephone number of the computing device <b>130</b> in the contact center environment <b>135</b>), then it may be difficult for the user to provide sufficient information about the issue to the computing device <b>130</b> in the contact center environment <b>135</b>. For example, to adequately address the user's question or problem, it may be beneficial for the computing device <b>130</b> to receive information related to a status of the smart TV service <b>115</b> that executes on the smart TV device <b>105</b>, and this status information may not be available on the mobile device <b>145</b> from which the user initiates the service request interaction.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The system <b>100</b> includes several features that address the technical challenges discussed above. For example, the various device connector applications, such as the TV device connector application <b>150</b>, the data processing system connector application <b>155</b>, the computing device connector application <b>160</b>, and the mobile device connector application <b>165</b>, can be configured to establish communication sessions that allow a user to complete a service request with the computing device <b>130</b> in the contact center environment <b>135</b>. The data processing system <b>120</b> can also be configured to establish communication between the smart TV device <b>105</b> and the computing device <b>130</b>, which may not initially be configured to communicate directly with one another.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Each of the TV device connector application <b>150</b>, the data processing system connector application <b>155</b>, the computing device connector application <b>160</b>, and the mobile device connector application <b>165</b> can be one or more of a script, an API, a software component, a program, or another form of executable code configured to establish connections between the hardware components of the system <b>100</b>. For example, the connector applications can be or can include computer instructions formatted in C #, C++, java, or java script. The TV device connector application <b>150</b> can execute on the smart TV device <b>105</b>. The TV device connector application <b>150</b> can also execute within or as part of the smart TV service <b>115</b>. For example, the TV device connector application <b>150</b> can be implemented as a software plugin formatted to integrate with or be executed by the smart TV service <b>115</b>. Similarly, the mobile device connector application <b>165</b> may also be included within or executed by another application or software component residing on the mobile device <b>145</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The connector applications are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as residing on their respective hardware devices. For example, the TV device connector application <b>150</b> is illustrated as residing on the smart TV device <b>105</b>, the data processing system connector application <b>155</b> is illustrated as residing on the data processing system <b>120</b>, the mobile device connector application <b>165</b> is illustrated as residing on the mobile device <b>140</b>, and the computing device connector application <b>155</b> is illustrated as residing on the computing device <b>130</b>. However, other arrangements are possible. For example, a connector application may reside, may be installed on or may execute on its respective hardware device. However, in other arrangements at least a portion of one or more connector applications may reside on a location remote from its respective hardware device. For example, the smart TV device <b>105</b> may interact with a remote device or remotely executed software providing at least a portion of the functionality of the TV device connector application <b>150</b> without departing from the scope of this disclosure. The other connector applications, or portions thereof, also may reside or execute remotely from their respective hardware devices, as well.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">To establish communication between the smart TV device <b>105</b> and the computing device <b>130</b>, the TV device connector application <b>150</b> can be configured to register the smart TV device <b>105</b> with the data processing system <b>120</b> via the data processing system connector application <b>155</b>. The data processing system connector application <b>155</b> can execute a registration component <b>185</b> that can be configured to complete the registration. For example, the TV device connector application <b>150</b> may store information corresponding to a network address (e.g., an IP address within the cloud environment <b>125</b>, which may be a network such as the Internet) of the data processing system <b>120</b>, and may transmit credentials (e.g., a username and password) to the registration component <b>185</b> that executes on the data processing system connector application <b>155</b> to cause the data processing system connector application <b>155</b> to establish a bidirectional communication channel linking the data processing system <b>120</b> and the smart TV device <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Communications over the channel established between the data processing system <b>120</b> and the smart TV device <b>105</b> may be part of a first communication session. The registration component <b>185</b> of the data processing system connector application <b>155</b> can be further configured to extend the first communication session to the computing device <b>130</b>, for example by registering with the computing device connector application <b>160</b> that executes on the computing device <b>130</b> in a similar manner to establish a bidirectional communication channel between the data processing system <b>120</b> and the computing device <b>130</b>. Thus, the smart TV device <b>105</b> can communicate with the computing device <b>130</b> via the bidirectional links joining the smart TV device <b>105</b> with the data processing system <b>120</b> and joining the data processing system <b>120</b> with the computing device <b>130</b>. A user may wish to complete at least a portion of a service request interaction via the user's mobile device <b>145</b>, rather than via the smart TV device <b>105</b>. Therefore, the mobile device connector application <b>165</b> can also be configured to establish a bidirectional communication channel between the mobile device <b>145</b> and the computing device <b>130</b> by registering itself with the computing device connector application <b>160</b>. Changing the mode of communication during a service request interaction can be referred to in this disclosure as a deflection, and is described further below.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The user may initiate a service request interaction via the smart TV device <b>105</b>, for example by using the input device <b>140</b>. The user can initiate a service request by selecting a button or other user interface element generated by the smart TV service <b>115</b> and displayed on the display <b>110</b>. An example of such an interface is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. As shown, the display <b>110</b> displays a smart TV service interface <b>200</b>. The interface <b>200</b> includes a user prompt <b>205</b> that asks whether the user needs help, and includes interface elements that allow the user to select &#x201c;yes&#x201d; or &#x201c;no.&#x201d; The user can use the input device <b>140</b> to make the selection in response to the prompt <b>205</b>. In response to the user selecting &#x201c;yes,&#x201d; the TV device connector application <b>150</b> can establish a communication channel linking the smart TV device <b>105</b> with the data processing system <b>120</b> by registering itself with the registration component <b>185</b> of the data processing system connector application <b>155</b>, as described above, and the registration component <b>185</b> of the data processing system connector application <b>155</b> can register itself with the computing device connector application <b>160</b> to extend that communication session from the data processing system <b>120</b> to the computing device <b>130</b> to establish the service request interaction.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> depicts the smart TV service interface <b>200</b> showing a second user prompt <b>210</b>. The second user prompt <b>210</b> can be displayed within the smart TV service interface <b>200</b> after the user has initiated a service request (e.g., by selecting &#x201c;yes&#x201d; in the user prompt <b>205</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). The second user prompt <b>210</b> asks whether the user would like to complete the service request interaction via a mobile device (rather than via the smart TV device <b>105</b>). For example, the input device <b>140</b>, with which the user interacts with the smart TV device <b>105</b>, may be a simple remote control having limited functionality and may therefore be less convenient than the mobile device <b>145</b>, which may include more interface functionality, such as any combination of an electronic display, a touchscreen input, a camera, and a microphone. For example, the mobile device <b>145</b> can be a smartphone, a laptop computer, or a tablet computer, and may provide an interface that is easier for the user to use than the smart TV device <b>105</b> and the input device <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, if the user selects &#x201c;yes&#x201d; in response to the user prompt <b>210</b>, the service request interaction may continue via the mobile device <b>145</b>, rather than via the smart TV device <b>105</b>. This can be referred to in this disclosure as a deflection of the service request interaction. Generally, while the deflection of the service request interaction to the mobile device <b>145</b> may require that a second communication session be established between the mobile device <b>145</b> and the computing device <b>130</b> in the contact center environment <b>135</b>, the deflected service request interaction can be continued on the mobile device <b>145</b> in a manner that is convenient for the user. For example, information relating to the service request interaction can be saved by the smart TV device <b>105</b> and transferred to the second communication session so that the user does not have to re-enter such information. Additional techniques for providing a more seamless deflection of the service request interaction to the mobile device <b>145</b> are described further below.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a sequence diagram <b>300</b> depicting the flow of information in an example system, such as the system <b>100</b>, for establishing service request interactions, according to an illustrative implementation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow diagram of an example method <b>400</b> for establishing service request interactions, according to an illustrative implementation. The sequence diagram <b>300</b> shows the flow of information between the smart TV device <b>105</b>, the data processing system <b>120</b>, the computing device <b>130</b>, the input device <b>140</b>, and the mobile device <b>145</b>. In the sequence diagram <b>300</b>, arrows represent information transmitted between these components. Generally, these transmissions of information may correspond to blocks shown in the flow diagram representing the example method <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Therefore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> are discussed together below.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The method <b>400</b> can include receiving fault condition information (ACT <b>405</b>). This can be performed, for example, by the smart TV device <b>105</b> and can correspond to the arrow <b>305</b> shown in the sequence diagram <b>300</b>. Accordingly, the fault condition information can be received from the input device <b>140</b>. The fault condition information can include any type of information associated with a problem or perceived problem that the user experiences with an aspect of the smart TV service <b>115</b>. The fault condition information can also include additional information related to the smart TV service <b>115</b>, such as a current status of one or more parameters of the smart TV service <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The method <b>400</b> can include establishing a first communication session between the smart TV device <b>105</b> and the data processing system <b>120</b> (ACT <b>410</b>). This can be performed, for example, by the smart TV device <b>105</b> via the TV device connector application <b>150</b>, and is represented by the arrow <b>310</b> in the sequence diagram <b>300</b>. The TV device connector application <b>150</b> can be configured to register itself with the registration component <b>185</b> of the data processing system connector application <b>155</b> of the data processing system <b>120</b> to establish the first communication session. For example, the TV device connector application <b>150</b> can transmit registration information to establish a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) or secure shell (SSH) session linking the smart TV device <b>105</b> with the data processing system <b>120</b>. Although not depicted in the sequence diagram <b>300</b>, the act of establishing the first communication session may include transmitting information from the data processing system <b>120</b> to the smart TV device <b>105</b> as well. For example, there may be acknowledgment data transmitted from the data processing system <b>120</b> to the smart TV device <b>105</b> to confirm that the first communication session has been established.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The method <b>400</b> can include transmitting a service request interaction to the data processing system <b>120</b> (ACT <b>415</b>). This can be performed, for example, by the smart TV device <b>105</b>, and is depicted in the sequence diagram by the arrow <b>315</b>. The service request interaction can be transmitted to the data processing system <b>120</b> via the first communication session established in ACT <b>410</b>. The service request interaction can be received by the event handling component <b>190</b> of the data processing system connector application <b>155</b>. For example, the event handling component <b>190</b> can be a software program or other executable instructions configured to receive, transmit, and process one or more events after a communication session has been established. An event can include any information sent from the smart TV device <b>105</b> to the data processing system <b>120</b>, such as fault condition information or contextual information relating to the smart TV service (such as the information displayed on the display <b>110</b> that may have confused the user). The service request interaction may include the fault condition information, as well other information relating to the smart TV service <b>115</b>, the smart TV device <b>105</b>, and the display <b>110</b> that may be relevant to the service request interaction. For example, the service request interaction can include information relating to a state of the smart TV service <b>115</b>, a model number of the smart TV device <b>105</b>, or a model number of the display <b>110</b>. In addition, the service request interaction may include information related to the customer, such as account information, identification information, and the like.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The method <b>400</b> can include extending the first communication session from the data processing system <b>120</b> to the computing device <b>130</b> in the contact center environment <b>135</b> (ACT <b>420</b>).

The extension of the first communication session between the data processing system <b>120</b> and the computing device <b>130</b> can allow for communication to take place between the smart TV device <b>105</b> and the computing device <b>130</b> via the data processing system <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The method <b>400</b> can include transmitting the service request interaction to the computing device <b>130</b> (ACT <b>425</b>). This can be performed by the data processing system <b>120</b>, and is depicted by the arrow <b>325</b> in the sequence diagram <b>300</b>.

The computing device <b>130</b> can generate the diagnostic information based on the fault condition information. For example, the computing device <b>130</b> can maintain a mapping of various types of diagnostic information that correspond to respective types of fault condition information, and can generate or retrieve the correct diagnostic information by referring to this mapping. The diagnostic information can include one or more suggested tasks for a user to perform to address a problem or issue with the smart TV service <b>115</b> for which the user is seeking assistance through the service request interaction. The computing device <b>130</b> can transmit the diagnostic information via the first communication session.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The method <b>400</b> can include transmitting the diagnostic information to the data processing system <b>120</b> (ACT <b>435</b>).

Generally, the computing device <b>130</b> can transmit the diagnostic information via the first communication session that was extended to link the computing device <b>130</b> and the data processing system <b>120</b> in ACT <b>420</b>. The method <b>400</b> can also include transmitting the diagnostic information to the smart TV device <b>105</b> (ACT <b>440</b>).

The smart TV device <b>105</b> can respond to receiving the diagnostic information by displaying at least a portion of the diagnostic information to the user. For example, the smart TV device <b>105</b> can display a recommended action for the user to take. The diagnostic information can be displayed in an interface generated by the smart TV service <b>115</b>, such as the smart TV service interface <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some instances, the service request interaction may not be completed at this point, for example if the user is still experiencing the problem that caused the user to initiate the request even after the user has performed a recommended action to address the problem. The user may therefore wish to continue the service request interaction, for example to receive further information or to interact directly with a customer service representative. The method <b>400</b> can therefore include displaying a prompt to deflect the first service request interaction from the smart TV device <b>105</b> to the mobile device <b>145</b> (ACT <b>445</b>). The prompt can correspond to the user prompt <b>210</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, for example. The method can include receiving a confirmation that the service request interaction should be deflected to the mobile device <b>145</b> (ACT <b>450</b>). For example, the user may use the input device <b>140</b> to make the confirmation, as indicated by the arrow <b>345</b> in the sequence diagram <b>300</b>. However, the sequence diagram <b>300</b> is illustrative only, and therefore the user may instead make the confirmation in a manner not depicted by the sequence diagram <b>300</b>. For example, the user may make the confirmation via the mobile device <b>145</b> itself (e.g., by using a web browsing application residing on the mobile device <b>145</b> to visit a predetermined website to complete the service request interaction).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">After the user has confirmed that the service request interaction should be deflected from the smart TV device <b>105</b> to the mobile device <b>145</b>, the method <b>400</b> can include establishing a second communication between the mobile device <b>145</b> and the computing device <b>130</b> in the contact center environment <b>135</b> (ACT <b>455</b>). This can be performed, for example, by the mobile device <b>145</b> via the mobile device connector application <b>165</b>, as indicated by the arrow <b>350</b> in the sequence diagram <b>300</b>. The TV mobile device connector application <b>165</b> can be configured to register itself with the computing device connector application <b>160</b> of the computing device <b>130</b> to establish the second communication session. For example, the mobile device connector application <b>165</b> can establish a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) or secure shell (SSH) session linking the mobile device <b>145</b> with the computing device <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The computing device <b>130</b> can also establish the second communication session in a non-persistent manner, such as by sending an email to the computing device <b>130</b>. Thus, the second communication session can consist of a series of emails or other forms of correspondence between the mobile device <b>145</b> and the computing device <b>130</b>, even though this correspondence may take place without a dedicated communication channel being established. Although not depicted in the sequence diagram <b>300</b>, the computing device <b>130</b> can also transmit information to the mobile device <b>145</b> to establish the second communication session. The second communication session may facilitate completion of the service request interaction via any mode of communication, including email, short message service (SMS) messages, a live text-based chat session, a live video calling session, a telephone call, or any combination of these or other types of communications. For example, the user may use the mobile device <b>145</b> to communicate with a customer service representative operating the computing device <b>130</b> in the contact center environment <b>135</b>, or with an automated service executing on the computing device <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Using the steps above, a first communication session (represented by the communications within the bracket <b>355</b> in the sequence diagram <b>300</b>) and a second communication session (represented by the communications within the bracket <b>360</b> in the sequence diagram <b>300</b>), separate from the first communication session, are used to facilitate the service request interaction. Although the remainder of the service request interaction may be performed by the user via the separate second communication session, any information transmitted as part of the first communication session linking the smart TV device <b>105</b> with the computing device <b>130</b> via the data processing system <b>120</b> can be saved and made available for use during the second communication session. For example, the fault condition information, the diagnostic information, and any other information relating to the service request information that was initially generated or transmitted as part of the first communication session can be saved for use in the second communication session. At least a portion of this information may also be transmitted to the mobile device <b>145</b>, so that the mobile device <b>145</b> has access to such information during the second communication session. For example, a data file corresponding to the fault condition information, the diagnostic information, or other information from the first communication session can be transmitted from any of the smart TV device <b>105</b>, the data processing system <b>120</b>, or the computing device <b>130</b> to the mobile device <b>145</b>, so that the mobile device <b>145</b> can use this information during the second communication session. Similarly, information relating to the first communication session can be saved by the computing device <b>130</b>, so that the computing device <b>130</b> can access such information in connection with completing the service request information via the second communication session. Thus, the deflection of the service request interaction can be accomplished in a unified and continuous way from the perspective of the user, despite the fact that two separate communication sessions are used to facilitate the service request interaction.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The computing device <b>130</b> can also be configured to authenticate the mobile device <b>145</b> prior (or during the process of) establishing the second communication session. This can help to ensure that any sensitive or private information included in the first communication session is not erroneously transmitted to a device of a different user during the second communication session. The user may be asked to use the mobile device <b>145</b> to perform a specified task to authenticate the mobile device <b>145</b> prior to establishment of the second communication session. For example, the smart TV device <b>105</b> can cause the display <b>110</b> to display a prompt directing the user to visit a webpage having a predetermined URL using a web browsing application of the mobile device mobile device <b>145</b>, to authenticate the mobile device <b>145</b>.

For example, the event handling component <b>190</b> of the data processing system connector application <b>155</b> may modify the service request interaction to use a different communications protocol or data format supported by the computing device <b>130</b> before transmitting the event to the computing device connector application <b>160</b> that executes on the computing device <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">After the service request interaction is transmitted to the computing device connector component <b>160</b>, the computing device <b>130</b> can generate diagnostic information. The computing device <b>130</b> can generate the diagnostic information based on any information contained in the service request interaction. The diagnostic information may include any information that is responsive to the service request interaction. The diagnostic information can be generated in an automated fashion, for example, by the computing device connector application <b>160</b>, based on information included in the event. The diagnostic information can also be generated by a user of the computing device <b>130</b>, responsive to the event, and the user can input the diagnostic information to the computing device connector application <b>160</b>. Generally, the diagnostic information can include one or more suggested tasks for the user to perform.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The method <b>800</b> can include receiving the diagnostic information, responsive to the service interaction request (ACT <b>835</b>). This can be performed, for example, by the event handling component <b>190</b> of the data processing system connector application <b>155</b> that executes on the data processing system <b>120</b>. Generally, the computing device <b>130</b> can transmit the response to the event via the first communication session that was established and extended from the server connector application <b>155</b> to the computing device connector application <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The method <b>800</b> can also include transmitting the diagnostic information to the TV connector application <b>150</b> of the smart TV device <b>105</b> (ACT <b>840</b>). This can be performed by the event handling component <b>190</b> of the data processing system connector application <b>155</b> that executes on the data processing system <b>120</b>. The event handling component <b>190</b> can transmit the diagnostic to the TV connector application <b>150</b> that executes on the smart TV device <b>105</b> via the first communication session. The smart TV device <b>105</b> can respond to receiving the diagnostic information from the data processing system <b>120</b> by causing the display <b>110</b> to display information corresponding to the diagnostic information for view by the user. The user can then input a new information, for example via the input device <b>140</b>, and the ACTS <b>825</b>, <b>830</b>, <b>835</b>, and <b>840</b> of the method <b>800</b> can be repeated to allow the user of the smart TV device <b>105</b> and the representative using the computing device <b>130</b> to interact until the service interaction is completed.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating a general architecture for a computer system that may be employed to implement elements of the systems and methods described and illustrated herein (including the smart TV device <b>105</b>, the data processing system <b>120</b>, the computing device <b>130</b>, the input device <b>140</b>, and the mobile device <b>145</b>), according to an illustrative implementation. The computer system <b>900</b> can be used to provide information via the cloud environment <b>125</b>, for example. The computer system <b>900</b> includes one or more processors <b>920</b> communicatively coupled to at least one memory <b>925</b>, one or more communications interfaces <b>905</b>, and one or more output devices <b>910</b> (e.g., one or more display units, which may correspond to or may be similar to the display <b>110</b>) and one or more input devices <b>915</b>, which may correspond to or may be similar to the input device <b>140</b>. The processors <b>920</b> can be included in the smart TV device <b>105</b>, the data processing system <b>120</b>, the computing device <b>130</b>, and the mobile device <b>145</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The memory <b>925</b> can include computer-readable storage media, and can store computer instructions such as processor-executable instructions for implementing the operations described herein.

For example, the communications interfaces <b>905</b> can be coupled to a wired or wireless network, bus, or other communication means and can allow the computer system <b>900</b> to transmit information to or receive information from other devices (e.g., other computer systems). One or more communications interfaces <b>905</b> can facilitate information flow between the components of the system <b>900</b>. In some implementations, the communications interfaces <b>905</b> can be configured (e.g., via hardware components or software components) to provide a website as an access portal to at least some aspects of the computer system <b>900</b>. Examples of communications interfaces <b>905</b> include user interfaces.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The output devices <b>910</b> can allow information to be viewed or perceived in connection with execution of the instructions.

The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as one or more computer programs, e.g., one or more modules of computer program instructions, encoded on computer storage medium for execution by, or to control the operation of, data processing apparatus. The program instructions can be encoded on an artificially-generated propagated signal, e.g., a machine-generated electrical, optical, or electromagnetic signal that is generated to encode information for transmission to suitable receiver apparatus for execution by a data processing apparatus. A computer storage medium can be, or be included in, a computer-readable storage device, a computer-readable storage substrate, a random or serial access memory array or device, or a combination of one or more of them. While a computer storage medium is not a propagated signal, a computer storage medium can be a source or destination of computer program instructions encoded in an artificially-generated propagated signal. The computer storage medium can also be, or be included in, one or more separate physical components or media (e.g., multiple CDs, disks, or other storage devices).
