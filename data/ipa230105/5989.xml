preferred embodiment <b>1</b> of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the present invention provides a novel memory array structure applied to an in-memory operation. The memory array structure is composed of multiple memory devices <b>20</b> arranged in rows and columns, for example, a 6&#xd7;6 array as shown.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The memory array structure of the present invention is a matrix structure, its core feature which is different from the normal matrix structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is that multiple memory devices <b>20</b> set in different rows and in the same column are connected to the same switch <b>21</b>, and the control leading-out wires of the switches <b>21</b> set in the same column are independently of each other and can be shared with the switches <b>21</b> set in other columns.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Electrical devices inside the memory array structure mainly comprise memory units (memory devices <b>20</b>) and the switches <b>21</b>. each of the rows in the array is set with a row leading-out wire R, each of the columns is set with a column leading-out wire C, and the memory devices <b>20</b> are correspondingly set at intersection points of each the row leading-out wire R and each the column leading-out wire C; meanwhile, each of the rows is set with one to multiple the switches <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Wherein, the first terminal of each of the memory devices <b>20</b> is individually connected to the row leading-out wire of the same row where the memory device <b>20</b> is set, and the second terminal of each of the memory devices <b>20</b> is connected to the first terminal of the switch <b>21</b> in the same column, the second terminal of the switch <b>21</b> is connected to the row leading-out wire of the same row where the switch <b>21</b> is set.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each of the rows in the array is set with one to multiple the switches <b>21</b>, and the first terminal of each of the switches <b>21</b> can be connected to the second terminals of one to multiple the memory devices <b>20</b> in the same column, or even the second terminals of all of the memory devices <b>20</b> in the same column.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Each of the switches <b>21</b> can be set with at least one control terminal; each of the rows in the array can be set with a control leading-out wire S. The control terminals of the switches <b>21</b> set in different columns and in the same row are commonly connected to the control leading-out wire S in the same row; the control terminals of the switches <b>21</b> in the same column are respectively connected to the control leading-out wire S of different rows.

By reasonably controlling the electrical signal at the control terminal of the switch <b>21</b>, each of the columns can output a multiply-accumulating current value of an input signal received by a specified row, instead of receiving a multiply-accumulate result of an input signal in the same row that is selected and turned on, as in an existing array.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The advantage of the above structure of the present invention is that the corresponding analog currents output of input signals of different specified rows according to multiply-accumulate operation requirements of each of the columns can be obtained simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Compared with existing in-memory computing networks, the present invention also has some differences in peripheral controlling, which can be configured according to special application occasions.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, which is a topology schematic diagram of a memory neural network of a memory array structure according to a preferred embodiment <b>2</b> of the present invention.

A transmission mode comprises a digital signal transmission or an analog signal transmission, and the multiply-accumulate operation of the two modes are similar. Taking an analog signal as an example, loading an analog voltage on each of the row leading-out wires R<b>1</b> to R<b>6</b> and loading the same analog voltage on each of the column leading-out wires C<b>1</b> to C<b>6</b>, then currents on the column leading-out wires C<b>1</b> to C<b>6</b> is sum of currents flowing through each of the RRAM units <b>20</b> of the RRAM cluster A, which is equivalent to performing a multiplication operation and an accumulation operation simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, when only the row leading-out wire R<b>1</b> is turned on, currents flow through all of the RRAM devices <b>20</b> of the RRAM clusters Al and A<b>10</b>, while the RRAM devices <b>20</b> of other clusters are turned off</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Compared with a traditional RRAM array, in the RRAM array of the present invention, a corresponding control leading-out wire is not only capable of controlling one RRAM unit in each of the columns, but can select different rows and different amounts of RRAM units in each of the columns as needed. It has an advantage that when performing a multiply-accumulate operation, items for multiplying in each of the columns can be different. In this way, through inputting reasonable signals and selecting reasonable control terminals, multiply-accumulate operations of different input signals of different scales can be performed, which greatly improves operation speed and using efficiency of the array.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, if only the control leading-out wires S<b>2</b> and S<b>6</b> are turned on, then a multiply-accumulate operation is not performed on the first column and the second column, the signals of the row leading-out wires R<b>1</b> to R<b>5</b> are performed the multiply-accumulate operation on the third column, the signals of all of the row leading-out wires are performed the multiply-accumulate operation on the fourth column and the fifth column, and the signals of the row leading-out wires R<b>2</b> and R<b>6</b> are performed the multiply-accumulate operation on the sixth column. Although six inputs are input simultaneously, parts of input signals are performed the multiply-accumulate operation on parts of the columns, which is not possible with the two architectures shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The above descriptions are only the preferred embodiments of the present invention, and the described embodiments are not used to limit the scope of patent protection of the present invention.
