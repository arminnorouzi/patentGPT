Compared with conventional laboratory experiments, clinical trials normally require a large number of cells, which can create a novel challenge when culturing cells.

Clinical cell production involves many complicated and experience-based steps, including surgical tissue collection, sample treatments (dissection, dissociation, and dispersion), and cell seeding. Given the vast individual variation among patient cells, each of these steps for cell production is extremely difficult to perform stably using a standardized protocol. In most clinical cases, cell processing for regenerative cell therapy depends largely on the skill and experience of experts.

The outer diameter is 150 mm, the height is 10 mm, and the cell culture medium volume is 1 mL. Centrifugation was performed to trap isolated individual and grouped primary cultured cells in the same dish. By utilizing this non-invasive system, long-term continuous monitoring, immediately following trapping, was made possible and cell growth and dynamics were successfully observed in the cell culture system.
