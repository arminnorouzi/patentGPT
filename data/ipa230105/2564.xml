widely used in various fields of sanitary materials such as disposable diapers, hygiene products, and portable toilets; agricultural and horticultural materials such as water retention agents and soil improvement agents; and industrial materials such as waterproofing agents and condensation prevention agents. For the water-absorbent resin particles, it is required to control the water absorption rate in addition to the performance such as high water absorption capacity and gel strength. The water absorption rate can be controlled by varying the specific surface area of the water-absorbent resin particles and the use amount of a crosslinking agent, for example. For example, it is disclosed in paragraph [0062] of Patent Literature 1 that by subjecting a hydrogel-like substance having an internal crosslinking structure to a post-crosslinking reaction, the crosslinking density near the surface of a water-absorbent resin is increased, which increases the water absorption rate.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0003">[Patent Literature 1] JP 2016-28117 A</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional water-absorbent resin particles reach a swelling state (a state in which water cannot be absorbed any more) in a relatively short time after coming into contact with a liquid to be absorbed (hereinafter, simply referred to as &#x201c;liquid&#x201d;) such as water and urine. When the water-absorbent resin particles swell, the swelled gel-like water-absorbent resin particles fill the gap originally existing between the water-absorbent resin particles, which makes a liquid difficult to pass through the gap. This is commonly referred to as a gel blocking phenomenon. As a result, it becomes difficult for the liquid to diffuse through the gap, which is a factor causing liquid leakage. In order to prevent the gel blocking phenomenon, measures in which slowing down the water absorption rate thereof (slowing down the time in which the water-absorbent resin particles are in a swelling state, and/or, the time in which water absorption is started, for example) by changing the specific surface area of the water-absorbent resin particles and the use amount of a crosslinking agent are considered, for example. However, changing polymerization conditions of the water-absorbent resin particles are required in these measures, and finding the optimum conditions thereof is complicated.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention has been made in view of such a problem, and an object thereof is to provide a coated resin particle in which the water absorption rate is controlled to be slowed down without changing polymerization conditions of a water-absorbent resin particle, and a method for producing the same.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect of the present invention provides a coated resin particle including: a water-absorbent resin particle; and a coating layer that coats at least a part of a surface of the water-absorbent resin particle, in which the coating layer contains a water-soluble component in which a solubility in 100 g of water is in a range of 1.0 g or more and 150 g or less at 25&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another aspect of the present invention provides a method for producing the above-mentioned coated resin particle, the method including mixing a water-absorbent resin particle, and a coating material containing a water-soluble component in which a solubility in 100 g of water is in a range of 1.0 g or more and 150 g or less at 25&#xb0; C. to form a coating layer on at least a part of a surface of the water-absorbent resin particle.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the present invention, a coated resin particle in which a water absorption rate is controlled to be slowed down without changing polymerization conditions of a water-absorbent resin particle, and a method for producing the coated resin particle can be provided.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0009" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view showing an embodiment of a coated resin particle.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a graph showing water absorption behavior of water-absorbent resin particles and coated resin particles.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Hereinafter, some embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail.

The coating layer contains a water-soluble component in which a solubility in 100 g of water is in a range of 1.0 g or more and 150 g or less at 25&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The coating layer is preferably chemically and/or physically bonded to the surface of the water-absorbent resin particle so that the water-absorbent resin particle does not easily fall off from the water-absorbent resin particle in the state before water absorption. The physical bond is realized by an anchor effect caused by the coating layer entering a fine recess existing on the surface of the water-absorbent resin particle, for example. Hereinafter, an estimation mechanism enabling controlling of the water absorption rate by the coated resin particle of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view showing an embodiment of the coated resin particle. As shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a coated resin particle <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment includes a water-absorbent resin particle <b>10</b>, and a coating layer <b>20</b> that coats at least a part of the surface of the water-absorbent resin particle <b>10</b>. In (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the entire surface of the water-absorbent resin particle <b>10</b> is coated with the coating layer <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Contact with a liquid is blocked by the portion, which is coated with the coating layer <b>20</b>, of the water-absorbent resin particle <b>10</b>. Therefore, when the entire surface of the water-absorbent resin particle <b>10</b> is coated with the coating layer <b>20</b>, the water-absorbent resin particle <b>10</b> cannot absorb the liquid. On the other hand, although not particularly shown, when a part of the surface of the water-absorbent resin particle <b>10</b> is coated with the coating layer <b>20</b>, the liquid can be absorbed at an exposed portion of the surface of the water-absorbent resin particle <b>10</b> (a portion that is not coated with the coating layer <b>20</b>), but the coating layer <b>20</b> functions as a binder that inhibits the swell of the water-absorbent resin particle <b>10</b>. Accordingly, when the coating layer <b>20</b> is provided on at least a part of the surface of the water-absorbent resin particle <b>10</b>, the water-absorbent resin particle <b>10</b> cannot exhibit the original water absorption capacity. However, as described above, since the coating layer <b>20</b> contains the water-soluble component in which the solubility in 100 g of water is in the range of 1.0 g or more and 150 g or less at 25&#xb0; C., when the coated resin particle <b>1</b> comes into contact with the liquid, the coating layer <b>20</b> is gradually dissolved and disappears. As the coating layer <b>20</b> disappears, the water-absorbent resin particle <b>10</b> gradually exhibits its original water absorption capacity, and finally becomes a swollen water-absorbent resin particle <b>10</b><i>a </i>shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As described above, in the coated resin particle of the present invention, since the water-absorbent resin particle is coated with a specific coating layer, the water absorption capacity of the water-absorbent resin particle is suppressed. That is, in the coated resin particle, the time until reaching the swelling state is slower than when using only the water-absorbent resin particle constituting the coated resin particle. Hereinafter, changes in the water absorption amount that can be shown in the coated resin particle will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a graph showing changes in the water absorption amount over time (hereinafter, simply referred to as &#x201c;water absorption behavior&#x201d;) of each of the coated resin particle and the water-absorbent resin particle constituting the coated resin particle after they come into contact with the liquid. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is not a graph obtained by actually measuring specific coated resin particles and water-absorbent resin particles, but is a conceptual diagram showing the concept of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">For example, the water absorption behavior of the coated resin particle may be one in which &#x201c;the time in which water absorption is started is the same (the moment when the coated resin particle comes into contact with the liquid), but the time until reaching the swelling state is slower because the water absorption amount is substantially constantly small as compared to the water-absorbent resin particle&#x201d; as shown in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, may be one in which &#x201c;the time in which water absorption is started and the time until reaching the swelling state are slower as compared to the water-absorbent resin particle&#x201d; as shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, or may be one in which &#x201c;the time in which water absorption is started is the same (the moment when the coated resin particle comes into contact with the liquid), but the time until reaching the swelling state is slower as compared to the water-absorbent resin particle because the water absorption amount at the initial stage is extremely small&#x201d; as shown in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As described above, the coated resin particle has a slower water absorption rate than the case of using only the water-absorbent resin particle. Therefore, by using the coated resin particle of the present invention, the occurrence of the gel blocking phenomenon can be effectively prevented as compared to the case of using only the water-absorbent resin particle. For the coated resin particle, it is preferable that the water absorption amount be significantly increased after the lapse of a certain time as shown in (b) or (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and it is more preferable that the liquid be not absorbed until a certain time elapses as shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In particular, because the coated resin particle showing the water absorption behavior as shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> does not absorb the liquid until a certain time elapses, the occurrence of the gel blocking phenomenon can be more effectively prevented.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">When the coated resin particle shows the water absorption behavior as shown in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the time in which water absorption is started after the coated resin particle comes into contact with an aqueous solution of 0.9% by mass sodium chloride (hereinafter, simply referred to as &#x201c;physiological saline&#x201d;) may be 3 to 120 minutes, 5 to 90 minutes, or 10 to 60 minutes, for example. In addition, when the coated resin particle shows the water absorption behavior as shown in (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the time until the coated resin particle exhibits 10% water absorption power after it comes into contact with physiological saline may be 3 to 120 minutes, 5 to 90 minutes, or 10 to 60 minutes, for example.

The coating liquid may be scattered a plurality of times if necessary. Excessive aggregation of the water-absorbent resin particles can be prevented by adjusting the scattering amount and the scattering frequency of the coating liquid.
