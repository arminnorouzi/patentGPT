A drawback of this approach is that the DRAM chips (or module carrying the DRAM chips) are permanently coupled to the package. As a result, the memory cannot be upgraded (e.g., add more memory or replace with faster memory) or cannot be replaced upon failure.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Some other conventional approaches for memory included in laptops and notebooks includes having memory modules, such as Dual Inline Memory Modules (DIMMs) or Small Outline DIMMs (SO-DIMMs) that are coupled to a system board or the like via an edge connector. Some problems with these architectures include signal degradation at higher frequencies and bandwidths, and increased stack height (also referred to as Z-height). To accommodate the increased Z-height, the laptop, notebook, or other thin profile computing devices housing must be increased.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The foregoing aspects and many of the attendant advantages of this invention will become more readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the various views unless otherwise specified:</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a plan view and a cross-section view of a platform PCB and substrate before assembly with an LP CAMM, according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a plan view and a cross-section view of an assembled platform including an LP CAMM, according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>c </i></figref>shows a side cross-section view of the assembled platform of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>including a pair of fasteners;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>d </i></figref>shows an end cross-section view of an assembled platform of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>including a pair of fasteners;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a plan view of a platform assembly including a DDR CAMM;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a cross-section view of the platform assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref><i>a; </i></p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a plan view and a cross-section view of a platform PCB and substrate before assembly with a pair of LP CAMM, according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a plan view and a cross-section view of an assembled platform including an LP CAMM;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a 3D view of a CMT connector, according to a first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a 3D view of a CMT connector, according to second embodiment;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c </i></figref>shows a 3D view of a CMT connector, according to a third embodiment;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>d </i></figref>shows a close-up view of the top of the spring contact structure used for the CMT pins;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>e </i></figref>shows a 3D view of a spring contact used for the CMT pins, according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an example of an LP memory CAMM, according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a first example of an DDR memory CAMM, according to one embodiment;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a second example of an DDR memory CAMM, according to a one embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a block diagram of an exemplary compute platform in which embodiments described and illustrated herein may be implemented.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiments of Memory on Package (MOP) apparatus with reverse CAMM (Compression Attached Memory Module) and compression mount technology (CMT) connector(s) are described herein.
