To ensure a safe landing responsive to an EO condition, the pilot has to make an optimized airport selection for the EO condition and determine optimal navigation for the EO condition and selected airport in a very brief amount of time, which is cognitively demanding.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some available solutions provide a nearest airport function within the Flight Management System (FMS <b>40</b>), but this function generally does not take into consideration factors such as optimal approach type, runway length, weather, terrain, remaining battery time, and the like. Additionally, regardless of how an airport is selected in response to an EO condition, available solutions generally do not provide adequate visual indication of range during the EO condition.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, improved methods, systems, and aircraft systems for airport selection and display of glide range remaining during engine out (EO) conditions are desirable.

The EO guidance operations including: computing an optimal EO destination airport and corresponding path to the optimal EO destination airport from a current location of the aircraft; commanding the avionic display to present the optimal EO destination airport and the corresponding path for a pilot to review; receiving a pilot selection of the optimal EO destination airport subsequent to presenting the optimal EO destination airport; constructing a lateral and a vertical glide path to the optimal EO destination airport; and creating a plurality of glide profiles for each of a plurality of radials extending from the current location, each glide profile having a range that indicates an aircraft specific performance in wind and loss of potential energy due to lateral maneuvers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also provided is a method of flight guidance for airport selection during engine out (EO) conditions in an aircraft.
