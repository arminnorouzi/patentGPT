The use of electrical energy is now considered not only to meet the functions of the aircraft but also to electrify the functions of the turbomachine.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This observation leads to the study of hybrid engine architecture solutions, combining fossil energy of the fuel and electrical energy to ensure the driving of the propulsion portion (fan of the turbomachine) and the feeding of certain engine and/or aircraft functions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">These architectures can in particular be based on a high bypass ratio and reducer type architecture, but also on a multiple body architecture (2 or 3). In these architectures, the turbomachine comprises a low-pressure body and a high-pressure body, each body comprising a shaft connecting a rotor of a compressor to a rotor of a turbine.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is known to equip an aircraft turbomachine with an electric machine. We recall that an electric machine is an electromechanical device based on the electromagnetism allowing the conversion of electrical energy into work or mechanical energy for example. This process is reversible and can be used to produce electricity.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, depending on the final use of a machine, we use the terms of:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">generator to designate an electric machine producing electrical energy from a mechanical energy,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">motor for an electric machine producing a mechanical energy from an electrical energy.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0009" num="0010">An electric machine can also behave in motor mode as well as in generator mode.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0011">The integration of a high-power electric machine on the low-pressure body of a turbomachine, in particular of the high bypass ratio type, is very complex. Several installation areas are possible but the advantages and the disadvantages of each are numerous and diverse (problem of mechanical integration of the machine, temperature resistance of the machine, accessibility of the machine, etc.).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0012">One solution to this problem would be to integrate the electric machine directly downstream of the fan of the turbomachine. However, one difficulty would be the connection of this machine to the power electronic circuit which is usually located at a distance from the machine.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0013">The use of power harnesses would pose some technical problems in this environment. The large diameter harnesses have very large bending radii, which would not be compatible with this environment. The integration of harnesses would require supports to limit the transmission of vibrations to the surrounding parts and their damage.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0014">The present invention proposes a solution to at least some of the problems discussed above.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0015">The invention proposes an aircraft turbomachine, comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0016">a gas generator having a longitudinal axis,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0017">a fan located at an upstream end of the gas generator and configured to rotate about said axis, and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0018">an electric machine of generally annular shape which is mounted coaxially downstream of the fan, and which comprises a rotor rotatably coupled to the fan and a stator,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0019">the fan being configured to generate a main gas flow, a portion of which flows into a primary annular duct of the gas generator to form a primary flow, and another portion of which flows around the gas generator to form a secondary flow,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0020">the primary duct being delimited by a first and a second annular envelopes coaxial with the gas generator, the primary duct being passed through by arms, referred to as IGV arms, for connecting the first and second envelopes, as well as by tubular arms of an inlet casing located downstream of the IGV arms,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0021">the gas generator comprising a third annular envelope which coaxially surrounds the second envelope, the second and third envelopes being connected together at their upstream ends to form an annular splitter nose for separating the primary and secondary flows,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0007" num="0022">characterised in that the stator of the electric machine is connected to a power electronic circuit by at least one rigid electroconductive bar, this bar comprising a first portion extending substantially radially with respect to said axis inside one of the IGV arms, and a second portion extending substantially parallel to said axis between the second and third envelopes.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0015" num="0023">The present invention thus proposes a solution for the integration of an electric machine, a first advantage being linked to the fact that in the integration area of this machine, ideally directly downstream of the fan and thus upstream of the compressor or the compressors, the temperatures prevailing there are relatively low and thus optimal for this machine. The rotor of the machine is driven by the fan and is therefore at a relatively low speed, in particular if the turbomachine comprises a reducer. In addition, the machine is located as close as possible to the flow ducts of the flows and has a relatively large diameter and can therefore produce significant power compared to the machines of the prior technologies.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0024">Furthermore, the present invention provides a solution to the problem of electric connection of the machine in this environment. This connection is ensured by one or more rigid bars which each run through an IGV arm, i.e. as close as possible to the splitter nose of the primary and secondary flows of the turbomachine.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0025">The turbomachine according to the invention may comprise one or more of the following characteristics, taken in isolation from each other, or in combination with each other:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0026">the bar is generally L-shaped, said first and second portions being substantially straight and connected together by a junction located directly downstream of said splitter nose;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0027">the bar has a polygonal and constant cross-section, and can be twisted;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0028">the turbomachine comprises a nacelle casing that surrounds the gas generator, as well as bladings, referred to as OGV, for connecting the nacelle casing to said third annular envelope;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0029">the nacelle casing defines a secondary flow duct of the secondary flow around the gas generator;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0030">the OGV are located downstream of the IGV arms and substantially in line with the tubular arms of the inlet casing;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0006" num="0031">said second portion extends substantially in line with one of the OGV;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0007" num="0032">the gas generator comprises annular flanges for attaching the OGV which are located between said second and third envelopes and which comprise notches for the passage of said second portion of the bar;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0008" num="0033">the bar is surrounded by an insulating sheath and comprises a first end exposed for releasable attachment to an element for electric connection to said stator, and a second end exposed for releasable attachment to a harness for electric connection to said circuit;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0009" num="0034">the electric machine is located upstream of said splitter nose;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0010" num="0035">the stator of the electric machine is connected to the power electronic circuit by a plurality of rigid electroconductive bars regularly distributed around said axis;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0011" num="0036">the IGV arm through which the bar passes is tubular and oversized compared to the other IGV arms;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0012" num="0037">said power circuit is located between the second and third envelopes;
