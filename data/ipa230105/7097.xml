id="p-0002" num="0001">Travelers on roads, paths, or waterways do not travel alone. They share their travel with those around them, whether they are in separate vehicles, on foot, or in the air, there exists a shared space that all travelers occupy.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Within this shared space, especially on the most common shared space of the road, there may be trucks, buses, cars, motorcycles, scooters&#x2014;all powered by engines&#x2014;interacting with cyclists, skateboarders, and runners. The human-powered travelers are particularly vulnerable on the roads given their slower speeds and lack of protection. The current ways of accident avoidance and communication on the road for the human-powered travelers include awareness amplifiers like lights and reflectors and warning signals like warnings and horns.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Given the amount of network-connected smart travelers, there exists a need to take advantage of a networked traveling public in the interest of communication and safety. But many services that provide connections have a problem with careless handling of users' private data, including the users' current locations. This kind of information can serve a good use without compromising users' privacy.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The ephemeral Proximity as a Service (ePaaS) system assists in networked travel through sharing real-time geolocations, providing proximity alerts, recording and sharing messages that include audio, video, and images through an encrypted technology platform that offers user-initiated privacy controls, and other features. The</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">&#x201c;ephemeral&#x201d; nature of the system is that the location beacons and in some cases the communications shared through the network are temporary in nature and available based on location and/or information type. For example, an &#x201c;alert&#x201d; about a damaged road might only be available to a user as they enter a geographical area, or it may be temporary if it is something like a weather alert for a temporary condition like fog.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is not much camaraderie between drivers and cyclists today and it has become increasingly more unsafe and for cyclists on the road as driver distractions have increased. Thus, the initial use case discussed herein is one mostly based on communications between cyclists and drivers, however, it has broad use cases across interactions between people and vehicles (autonomous and/or manned).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">EPaaS provides cyclists with the ability to share their location though an app and their connected watches/devices or an API to allow drivers who are running the same app or another application that is connected to an ePaaS service to receive alerts as they are approaching cyclists. This potentially saves lives by avoiding accidents. During a cycling or driving session, users may speak into their phones or connected watches to record audio files that include the geolocation and available sensor related data at the time of the recording.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">EPaaS may provide each user with the ability to control their own privacy settings enabling them to: (1) keep their geolocation history, messages and recordings private, (2) hare their real-time location with ephemeral beacons, (3) share their geolocation history, messages, and recordings with individuals or groups, or (4) share their geolocation history, messages, and recordings publicly as they see fit.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">EPaaS may provide a real-time feed of all connected users location data anonymously.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows an embodiment of a network environment.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows block diagrams of a computing device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> shows a high-level overview of the EPAAS system.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows optional registration via mobile device method.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows an ephemeral beacons method depicting the method of the user activating the ephemeral beacons associated with ePaaS along with subsequent options for how those beacons could be shared outside of the default ephemeral and anonymous state.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a flow diagram showing how ephemeral alerts are activated and received.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a flow diagram depicting how ephemeral messages are generated and shared.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the flow of autodetecting the activity type associated with an active user session.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow diagram detailing the method for grouping ephemeral messages.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flow diagram of the method of sharing the activity history of the user.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an illustration that shows two factors of the &#x201c;safety bubbles&#x201d; or channels.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows multiple user ephemeral proximity alerts methods.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Hardware and Network Overview</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The system and method for an ephemeral Proximity as a Service (ePaaS) system as described herein may be implemented using system and hardware elements. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows an embodiment of a network <b>100</b> with one or more clients <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, <b>102</b><i>c </i>that may be local machines, personal computers, nodes, mobile devices, servers, tablets that communicate through one or more networks <b>110</b> with servers <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>104</b><i>b</i>, <b>104</b><i>c</i>, which may be hosts to networks themselves. It should be appreciated that a client <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<b>102</b><i>c </i>may serve as a client seeking access to resources provided by a server and/or as a server providing access to other clients.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The network <b>110</b> may include wired or wireless links. If it is wired, the network may include coaxial cable, twisted pair lines, USB cabling, or optical lines. The wireless network may operate using BLUETOOTH, Wi-Fi, Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), infrared, or satellite networks. The wireless links may also include any cellular network standards used to communicate among mobile devices including the many standards prepared by the International Telecommunication Union such as 3G, 4G, and LTE. Cellular network standards may include GSM, GPRS, LTE, WiMAX, and WiMAX&#x2014;Advanced. Cellular network standards may use various channel communications such as FDMA, TDMA, CDMA, or SDMA. The various networks may be used individually or in an interconnected way and are thus depicted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> as a cloud.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The network <b>110</b> may be located across many geographies and may have a topology organized as point-to-point, bus, star, ring, mesh, or tree. The network <b>110</b> may be an overlay network which is virtual and sits on top of one or more layers of other networks.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The network <b>110</b> may use certain protocols including the Ethernet protocol, the internet protocol suite (TCP/IP), the ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) technique, the SONET (Synchronous Optical Networking) protocol, or the SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) protocol. The TCP/IP internet protocol suite may include application layer, transport layer, internet layer, or the link layer. The network <b>110</b> may be a type of a broadcast network, a telecommunications network, a data communication network, or a computer network.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In most cases, every device on a network has a unique identifier. In the TCP/IP protocol, the unique identifier for a computer is an IP address. An IPv4 address uses 32 binary bits to create a single unique address on the network. An IPv4 address is expressed by four numbers separated by dots. Each number is the decimal (base-10) representation for an eight-digit binary (base-2) number, also called an octet. An IPv6 address uses 128 binary bits to create a single unique address on the network. An IPv6 address is expressed by eight groups of hexadecimal (base-16) numbers separated by colons.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">An IP address can be either dynamic or static. A static address is one that a user can edit and it is less common. Dynamic addresses are assigned by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), a service running on the network. DHCP typically runs on network hardware such as routers or dedicated DHCP servers.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Dynamic IP addresses are issued using a leasing system, meaning that the IP address may be active for a limited time. If the lease expires, the computer may automatically request a new lease. Sometimes, this means the computer may get a new IP address, too, especially if the computer was unplugged from the network between leases. This process is usually transparent to the user unless the computer warns about an IP address conflict on the network (two computers with the same IP address).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Information in the IP Address may be used to identify users, devices, geographies, and networks.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A system may include multiple servers <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>stored in high-density rack systems. If the servers are part of a common network, they do not need to be physically near one another but instead may be connected by a wide-area network (WAN) connection or similar connection.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Management of group of networked servers may be de-centralized. For example, one or more servers <b>1041</b>-<i>c </i>may include modules to support one or more management services for networked servers including management of dynamic data, such as techniques for handling failover, data replication, and increasing the networked server's performance.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The servers <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may be file servers, application servers, web servers, proxy servers, network appliances, gateways, gateway servers, virtualization servers, deployment servers, SSL VPN servers, or firewalls.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the network <b>110</b> is in a cloud environment, the cloud network <b>110</b> may be public, private, or hybrid. Public clouds may include public servers maintained by third parties. Public clouds may be connected to servers over a public network. Private clouds may include private servers that are physically maintained by clients. Private clouds may be connected to servers over a private network. Hybrid clouds may, as the name indicates, include both public and private networks.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The cloud network may include delivery using IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service), PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service), SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) or Storage, Database, Information, Process, Application, Integration, Security, Management, Testing-as-a-service. IaaS may provide access to features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. PaaS may include storage, networking, servers or virtualization, as well as additional resources such as, e.g., the operating system, middleware, or runtime resources. SaaS may be run and managed by the service provider and SaaS usually refers to end-user applications. A common example of a SaaS application is SALESFORCE or web-based email.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A client <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may access IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS resources using preset standards and the clients <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may be authenticated. For example, a server or authentication server may authenticate a user via security certificates, HTTPS, or API keys. API keys may include various encryption standards such as, e.g., Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Data resources may be sent over Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The clients <b>102</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and servers <b>104</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may be embodied in a computer, network device or appliance capable of communicating with a network and performing the actions herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C</figref> show block diagrams of a computing device <b>120</b> that may embody the client or server discussed herein. The device <b>120</b> may include a system bus <b>150</b> that connects the major components of a computer system, combining the functions of a data bus to carry information, an address bus to determine where it should be sent, and a control bus to determine its operation. The device includes a central processing unit <b>122</b>, a main memory <b>124</b>, and storage device <b>124</b>. The device <b>120</b> may further include a network interface <b>130</b>, an installation device <b>132</b> and an I/O control <b>140</b> connected to one or more display devices <b>142</b>, I/O devices <b>144</b>, or other devices <b>146</b> like mice and keyboards.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The storage device <b>126</b> may include an operating system, software, and a service agent module <b>128</b>, in which may reside the service agent logic and method described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The computing device <b>120</b> may include a memory port, a bridge, one or more input/output devices, and a cache memory in communication with the central processing unit.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The central processing unit <b>122</b> may be a logic circuitry such as a microprocessor that responds to and processes instructions fetched from the main memory <b>124</b>. The CPU <b>122</b> may use instruction level parallelism, thread level parallelism, different levels of cache, and multi-core processors. A multi-core processor may include two or more processing units on a single computing component.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The main memory <b>124</b> may include one or more memory chips capable of storing data and allowing any storage location to be directly accessed by the CPU <b>122</b>. The main memory unit <b>124</b> may be volatile and faster than storage memory <b>126</b>. Main memory units <b>124</b> may be dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) or any variants, including static random-access memory (SRAM). The main memory <b>124</b> or the storage <b>126</b> may be non-volatile.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The CPU <b>122</b> may communicate directly with a cache memory via a secondary bus, sometimes referred to as a backside bus. In other embodiments, the CPU <b>122</b> may communicate with cache memory using the system bus <b>150</b>. Cache memory typically has a faster response time than main memory <b>124</b> and is typically provided by SRAM or similar RAM memory.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Input devices may include keyboards, mice, trackpads, trackballs, touchpads, touch mice, multi-touch touchpads and touch mice, microphones, multi-array microphones, drawing tablets, cameras, single-lens reflex camera (SLR), digital SLR (DSLR), CMOS sensors, accelerometers, infrared optical sensors, pressure sensors, magnetometer sensors, angular rate sensors, depth sensors, proximity sensors, ambient light sensors, gyroscopic sensors, or other sensors.

The ephemeral Proximity as a Service ecosystem provides users <b>1</b>C-<b>110</b> with the ability to share their proximity free from privacy concerns. Participating in the ePaaS ecosystem to share real-time position and proximity does not require the use of personal identifiable user information. The method of such sharing the position, proximity, and associated messages via ePaaS may only rely on the cloud services storing the user's last known position by default&#x2014;nothing else need be stored.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> depicts a robust ecosystem in the transportation field connecting navigation systems, fleet vehicles, logistics platforms, Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) infrastructure, Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X), auto manufacturers, in-dash head units, streaming music services, and activity trackers. The ePaaS service is not limited to these providers or markets and may be used in financial services, insurance, customer management, and social platforms to name a few, in spite of the examples discussed herein mostly being directed to transportation.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">This ePaaS ecosystem may offer connections to its API and SDK to any phone, IoT device, bike, scooter, watch, camera or application that offers or would benefit from the connection to a latitude and longitude positional awareness (that may also include altitude) and consumer privacy.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further the ePaaS ecosystem may offer existing platforms, operating systems, and application environments the ability to offer their user base a way to share their location services with the applications that rely on it&#x2014;enabling &#x201c;ephemeral sharing.&#x201d; For example, until recently phones have enabled users to share their location &#x201c;always,&#x201d; &#x201c;only while using the app,&#x201d; or &#x201c;never.&#x201d; With ePaaS enabled applications users may choose &#x201c;always and ephemeral&#x201d; or &#x201c;ephemeral while using app&#x201d; options.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">One example of a use case outside of the transportation industry is a weather app that connects to ePaaS services to receive the real-time location of the user and provide them with a weather forecast in a manner that meets the location sharing interests of the user&#x2014;either &#x201c;always and ephemeral&#x201d; or &#x201c;ephemeral while using app.&#x201d; At this time, there are no means for users to enable location services and disable the application provider's ability to store this location history.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">The EPAAS System Introduction</heading><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The ePaaS system allows users to share location data in a privacy-compliant manner, one where each user's location data is being shared in a fully anonymous form. By default, the user's location/proximity data is shared in a form where the user information is not tracked. An initial use case shares the data in the form of beacons, which would be a pair of latitude and longitude points, along with some metadata that the user may share as the decide. In this use case, the system passes along what kind of activity the user is doing: For example, biking or driving, but this nonlimiting case could expand to more types of metadata, such as emergency events, weather events, and other use cases. An API/SDK service may allow creative developers to incorporate their own applications, all built from EPAAS system that protects user information as described herein.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The ePaaS system backend enables the sharing of location data with target groups or channels (for example, a biker may share location with drivers, so they are aware of bikers' locations), in a privacy-sensitive and compliant manner. It may not require identification of the user unless the user wants to make the data history publicly available or to share it with specific groups or individuals. This is different from existing systems that require users to sign up and tie the data with their identity and personal information at all times.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The communication channel may use web-based technology with the prospect of further optimizing the communication protocol. TLS (successor of SSL) may be used to encrypt the data feed that may be sent to the ePaaS backend. This minimizes the surface of attack for man-in-the-middle attacks. gRPC or HTTPS may be used at the application level according to the OSI model. The payload itself may be transmitted in the form of Protobuf or JSON payloads, respective to the Application level protocol. This allows the efficient use of the mobile device battery in order to transmit the location.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The services may expect/transport the minimal data payload at all times. This may allow high performance and near real-time proximity detection. When using gRPC the user may create a single connection that can be re-used in order to send subsequent location changes. The services may not store the sequence of location data but may remember for a very short period of time the last location of the user. This may be used by the service to securely map-match the proximity with other parties that share their location.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">When using a JSON payload, the data may contain a &#x201c;session identifier&#x201d; generated cryptographically random and may not be seeded or based on anything related to the identity of the user. The lifetime of the &#x201c;SI&#x201d; may be based on a user preference, as it may be generated by the user's device -the user can change the &#x201c;SI&#x201d; at any time. The &#x201c;SI&#x201d; may change at least on each sharing session.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The continuous connection of the &#x201c;SI&#x201d; is needed in order for the service to de-duplicate location data and prevent unnecessary nuisance.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The first implementation of ePaaS may be used to match the proximity of cyclists and drivers, which may allow alerting of the users to be careful when approaching each other. The proximity computation may happen on the server/service side, in this way it is a closed system and the service does not share any other information with the other users of the system. The response of the service may be based on the presence or absence of the proximity and possibly metadata about different proximities&#x2014;that may result in messages. For example, the service may send messages that cars are passing by at 20 meters, cars are approaching at 40 meters and other bikers are 15 meters away.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, the service may allow near real-time proximity to other users. Today's common hazard feeds in the transportation industry have a latency of between 7 to 20 seconds and are for fixed-position hazard warnings for the likes of &#x201c;pothole&#x201d; and &#x201c;car stopped on the roadside,&#x201d; and thus no ephemeral proximity messaging feed like this has existed. The proximity can be set up between different groups of users. Users can also pass the actual location of a user, to individuals, groups, or even make it public, when the user authorizes such sharing.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Location sharing may be done by providing an optional parameter in the API of the backend.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Some users might want to record and view their historical location, routes, and rides. This may be achieved by having the application record location data locally on the device. That way the user owns the data in its entirety. When the user wants to share their location publicly, then the user may need to register (including personal data) with system services using a well-established security mechanism called OpenId Connect. OpenId Connect may use an authentication and authorization framework that allows the user to manage who has access to the data and when the user decides to share the data, the historical data may be uploaded to our services in a GDPR/CCPA compliant manner. The system may use the user's actual location to automatically identify and store the user's activities in a proper manner that includes storing the user's data in our services and databases that are hosted in the actual country location where that user is physically located&#x2014;a GDPR requirement. These shared histories may be made available to the users, channels, and platforms that the user approves if they choose to do so. Revoking access means that the location history of the user may be removed.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">States of EPAAS</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The user may set their data state on their device, is it relates to the ePaaS platform and other users, to one of several pre-determined states in ePaaS.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">-Encrypted Verified User Info</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">This may be an entirely optional state that is presented to the user that would enable the user to share their detailed beacon history with individuals, groups, or channels through a connected cloud service and by storing their detailed beacon history along with their personal account info.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">-Ephemeral and Anonymous</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">This is the state when a user is anonymous with the platform and the platform does not associate them with any registered user.

Once the service is activated a Session Identifier is generated and sent to the ePaaS-connected service. This session identifier may be controlled by the user and may be re-issued in accordance with their preferences as this is the identifier that validates the user on the connected service. This session identifier provides an anonymous means for identifying the user on the connected platform without requiring personal information. After the service is launched the activity type is set in <b>3</b>A-<b>02</b>.

When this calculation is complete the resulting values along with the current information received replaces all of the information previously stored on the connected service. In this manner the connected ePaaS service stores the most recent information known including session ID, activity type, latitude, longitude, speed, and direction. All outdated information is deleted and replaced with the current information every time the connected device sends the service the latest information and the related calculations are completed.

For further details on this process, see the flow diagram in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. With the session ID and the activity type set the ephemeral beacon is activated automatically in <b>3</b>B-<b>02</b>. In addition and during <b>3</b>B-<b>02</b>, when the activity type is set, the &#x201c;safety bubble&#x201d; size and shape is also set&#x2014;for example it could be set to a circle that is 50 meters but its size and shape may be customizable and also further edited and affected by the user's preferences and may be activity-type specific that may further change shape and size based on the current speed and direction of any given activity&#x2014;either the activity session that is causing/generating the message or the activity session that is receiving the message. Further, this &#x201c;safety bubble&#x201d; can also be oriented on a map based on the direction and speed that the user us traveling. This &#x201c;safety bubble&#x201d; is used to generate and provide alerts and/or messages when other users on the platform or associated geographically tagged messages enter the user's safety bubble. The &#x201c;safety bubbles&#x201d; may act as public &#x201c;moving channels&#x201d; that users may publish to and subscribe to.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Once the beacon and activity type have been set the service may begin to poll for any applicable alerts to generate in <b>3</b>B-<b>03</b>. This polling happens at a frequency that is either set by the user or by the use case at the ePaaS service level. For example, this could be set to poll at one-second intervals. When this polling occurs, the service may plot the user's current latitude, longitude, speed, and direction on a map along with the user's &#x201c;safety bubble&#x201d; and its specific orientation and size and then compare that with the surrounding locations of the other current user's. If there are other users that are within the safety bubble of the current user, those users are further analyzed as in <b>3</b>B-<b>04</b> to determining if alerts should be generated. In this case <b>3</b>B-<b>04</b> shows one possible criterion for providing alerts to a &#x201c;bike&#x201d; and a &#x201c;car&#x201d; that may be generated when a current user or use case/activity type enters the &#x201c;safety bubble&#x201d; of the current user. In this case alerts are determined. In <b>3</b>B-<b>05</b> that determination is set and for example the bike activity users may get alerts when a car activity user's user enters their safety bubble and vice versa, and both &#x201c;bike&#x201d; and &#x201c;car&#x201d; users would receive their appropriate messages which could be audio, video or animations in <b>3</b>B-<b>07</b>.

This message can be an audio recording, text, or video and may contain meta data that includes things like numerical values including speed, distance, the relative size of a vehicle, the counts of the number of vehicles that and their proximity in measured or calculated distance from the user. This information can either be manually input by the user or generated automatically through the device that the ePaaS service is running on or through a connected device that may include an IoT device or edge computing device. The frequency of these recordings could be ad-hoc or regular as in every second for example. After the user or connected device has created the message, the message is saved to the user's local storage device with its time and date stamp along with the related latitude, longitude, speed, activity type, and tagged in the proper activity-based channel or channels. <b>3</b>C-<b>04</b> is the point at which it is determined if the user or system's preference is to share the message ephemerally. If the user has set their preference or the system is set to share the message ephemerally then the message is shared as stated in <b>3</b>C-<b>06</b>. This shared message is published to the appropriate activity channels and safety bubbles so that it may be received by users who subscribe to the associated channels and safety bubbles in real time.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The messages may be stored only temporarily until they get bumped out either by the next message or the predetermined amount of time for the specific use case. In this way, the platform server-side acts as message router. The user may store the messages and alerts they receive, but the system server side may not. Said another way, the message is never stored on ePaaS services. Additionally, the message and the related metadata are stored on the user's device as illustrated in <b>3</b>C-<b>05</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><b>3</b>C-<b>08</b> begins the reprocess of sharing the message with specific users. This process requires the user be logged in as shown in <b>3</b>C-<b>09</b>. During this step the user authenticates to the platform with typical personal information that may include email, phone number, and name. Once the user is logged in and authenticated to the platform the user may select other authenticated users that they would like to share messages with by individual user, specific channels or safety bubbles as shown ion step <b>3</b>C-<b>10</b>. Additionally, the user can decide to make the message public as shown in <b>3</b>C-<b>12</b>. The &#x201c;shared limited access&#x201d; and &#x201c;public freely available&#x201d; states may always be attributed to the user's account as they have authenticated themselves in the <b>3</b>C-<b>09</b>.

In <b>6</b>-<b>01</b>, <b>6</b>-<b>02</b>, and <b>6</b>-<b>03</b> the user launches the service, selects their activity, and activates their ephemeral beacon in the same manner as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. If the user's preference is set to not share the activity and message details associated with an activity or series of activities, as shown in <b>6</b>-<b>05</b>, it may only be saved on the users device and/or in the user's cloud storage location including but not limited to a cloud storage. The details associated with an activity may include all geolocation information platted as points or a continuous line on a map made up of latitude, longitude, speed, direction, and all related metadata collected from connected devices including but not limited to audio recordings, text, or video and may contain meta data that includes things like numerical values including speed, distance, the counts of the number of vehicles that and their proximity in measured or calculated distance from the user along with information on the channels and safety bubbles subscribed to.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">If the user has decided to share their activities, they may be required to log in as shown in <b>6</b>-<b>06</b>. After authenticating to the ePaaS service, the user can decide how they would like to share the activity. If they decide to share the activity with specific users in <b>6</b>-<b>08</b>, the user may select other authenticated users that they would like to share message with by individual user, specific channels or safety bubbles as shown ion step <b>6</b>-<b>09</b>. This information may be made available to other users in real-time. If the user who the information is shared with is not connected to the service, the information may no longer be available to them to view to for storage.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">When the user sets the preference to share the information publicly as shown in <b>6</b>-<b>10</b>, the information is available for download in the public channel in real time. This activity and its details may become available to all connected users who have joined the public channel. This makes the activity available for download to other users who subscribe to public channels at the moment the activity history is created and the services acts as a router publishing the information to the appropriate channels for subscription but not storage.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The &#x201c;shared limited access&#x201d; and &#x201c;public freely available&#x201d; states may be attributed to the user's account as they have authenticated themselves in the <b>6</b>-<b>06</b>. These details may not be stored on ePaaS services, may always be stored on the user's device and, may be available to be shared through API and SDK connections to be shared and stored in accordance with the user's preferences.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">For the purpose of defining the term &#x201c;user(s)&#x201d; as those people or entities that the information is shared with&#x2014;they all may have authenticated accounts associated with ePaaS however they can further be defined as people or the APIs that can be associated with individual or corporate accounts.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is an illustration that shows two factors of the &#x201c;safety bubbles&#x201d; or channels. As seen in <b>8</b>-<b>01</b> and <b>8</b>-<b>03</b> the &#x201c;safety bubbles&#x201d; for the CYCLIST and CAR are illustrated as being the same size and shape. These &#x201c;safety bubbles&#x201d; can be any shape, size, and also can be further directionally aligned and dependent on the time of day. For example when biking in New York city at midnight the &#x201c;safety bubble&#x201d; of a cyclist could be a 50 meter circle or it could be a 50 meter rectangle that is 1 meter wide with the cyclist plotted in the middle of it or it could be just a point known to the system as the latitude and longitude location of the cyclist. The relative sizes and shapes of the &#x201c;safety bubble&#x201d; may have automatic parameters associated with them as well as user definable controls.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Further as seen in <b>8</b>-<b>04</b> each interaction between types of activities may have an associated decision matrix associated with it to determine if an alert is played when safety bubbles intersect with each other. The intersection and overlap point is illustrated in <b>8</b>-<b>02</b>. As shown in <b>8</b>-<b>04</b> in a case when a CYCLIST and a CAR have their &#x201c;safety bubbles&#x201d; intersect or overlap with each other the alerts are played to both users. However, when a CAR and a CAR have their safety bubbles intersect or overlap an alert is not played for either user. Further, these decision matrices can also have time of day and location dependencies that may alter the output.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The term alerts in this case can include any form of output including audio, video, or animation and individual alerts can be grouped into single indicators to give users more meaningful feedback.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows multiple user ephemeral proximity alerts methods. This is how users broadcast their proximity and receive ephemeral message and proximity alerts. This is the functionality at the core of the platform which makes other features work. This diagram shows 2 platform users, they could be connected machines, people connected via their machines or anything else that wants to share its proximity with other things. At <b>9</b>-<b>01</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b>-<b>01</b><i>b, </i>the user of the platform connects&#x2014;there may be no personally identifiable information involved the connection is considered anonymous and the client sets a session id that can be changed to avoid even anonymous tracking of the same user.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The connection can subscribe to channels where like ephemeral positional information is shared. This might be a channel for the biking application which helps bikers and motorists share their positions for safety.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">At <b>9</b>-<b>02</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b>-<b>02</b><i>b, </i>the user shares position information with the platform at latency intervals pertinent to the use case. The platform treats this data in this manner:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0107">As mentioned before no personally identifiable information is available to the platform, it is not possible for even the platform to know who a user is as they report.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0108">Only the last location may ever be known at any given time, location is treated as ephemeral and therefore good for the time period the use case permits. In the case of cycling safety, a position reported by a bike may live in the platform for a second since it wouldn't make sense to keep it longer</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0109">Any other meta data may be attached to this location to make the use cases for sharing limitless.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0108" num="0110">At <b>9</b>-<b>03</b>, based on feed of incoming Ephemeral updates proximities for 2 events are matched up whenever new updates are submitted. Based on the use case the match occurs when 2 Ephemeral Updates geographically overlap within the use cases zone. For example, with bikers and motorists a 50-meter perimeter around each might be the zone used for these calculations, when a bike and car get closer than 50 meters then an event is generated.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0111">At <b>9</b>-<b>04</b><i>a </i>and <b>9</b>-<b>04</b><i>b, </i>as described in Proximity Calculation when events are generated due to Ephemeral Proximity overlaps, these events are sent to the connected users involved in the calculation. Depending on the use case the platform may send positional information or may just generate an event for the entire zone. Events may always be:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0112">Ephemeral&#x2014;never stored after they are sent,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0113">set to not contain personally identifiable information, anonymous.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Additional Features</heading><p id="p-0110" num="0114">1. Meta-Data-Driven Privacy Controls</p><p id="p-0111" num="0115">Combinations of activity type and real-time proximity meta data collected may automatically set the sharing and storage options associated with the user or the system for all related activities, beacons, alerts, messages, and metadata in real-time.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0116">For example, when a user's activity is &#x201c;riding&#x201d; and a car passes them, the driver of the vehicle could be connected to the ePaaS service with an activity type of &#x201c;driving&#x201d; although not required. The rider captures metadata of the vehicle with a connected sensor. In this case, the rider records the speed of the overtaking driver as well as the passing distance. In this case, assume that the vehicle is exceeding the speed limit and passing the cyclists with a distance that is less than the legally prescribed 4 feet requirement and the sensors record this (or user manually notes it)&#x2014;these event details could be automatically shared with law enforcement agencies and stored in a publicly accessible cloud location. It is also important to recognize that these are individual &#x201c;events&#x201d; that happen within overall &#x201c;trips&#x201d; that users take.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0117">If there are life-threatening, revenue generating, or ticket issuing events detected in the user's meta data in real time then the user or the system preferences may be modified to share and store them appropriately.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0118">2. Creating Safety Bubbles</p><p id="p-0115" num="0119">Safety bubbles can be created by and broadcast from within or outside of the safety bubble. Specifically, safety bubbles can be created for a person or vehicle who does not have the means to create and broadcast their own safety bubble. The bubbles can be created manually or automatically by the metadata collected around the user. For example, the system:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0120">can identify a child riding a trike, track their location, and broadcast a safety bubble around it to nearby vehicles and infrastructure</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0121">can identify an aggressive driver on the road, track its location and broadcast its safety bubble to riders that are nearby</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0122">can identify a near miss event (which could include metadata like the speed, direction of travel, license plate info) and send the event to nearby riders' safety bubbles or send all of the event details, including personally identifiable information (PII) to local enforcement officers&#x2014;either to fixed or dynamic positions of any size. For example , the system would not broadcast the notification of the pothole to an entire state&#x2014;however the notification could go to the department of streets for the city in a fixed position. Similarly, an aggressive driver notification would not be broadcast system wide, however it could be broadcast to a fixed position processor (like those that process license plates for camera-enforced traffic lights) or broadcast within a broad safety bubble to local police officers who are moving within the safety bubble and it may include the transmission of license plate data.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0116" num="0123">3. Fixed-Position Safety Bubbles</p><p id="p-0117" num="0124">Fixed-position safety bubbles may be created and become &#x201c;affixed&#x201d; to a map and not require an ongoing real-time broadcast of their existence, although they can be updated ongoing and automatically.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0125">In the event the characteristics of the fixed-position safety bubble change over time, like increasing the length or width of bike lanes, the metadata collected by users may contribute to updating the shape and size of the safety bubble.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0126">This includes identifying obstructions in bike lanes, identifying the shoulders on roads, as well as the existence and repair of potholes anywhere on the road.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0127">4. Community-Verified Event Details</p><p id="p-0121" num="0128">The users around a user may verify the activities that are shared in channels. This shared message may be published to the appropriate activity channels and safety bubbles so that it may be received by users who subscribe to the associated channels and safety bubbles in real time.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0129">5.0 Safety Bubble Shapes</p><p id="p-0123" num="0130">There may be various types and shapes of safety bubbles: Transmitting (a safety bubble where activities, beacons, alerts, messages, and metadata are transmitted from), Receiving (a safety bubble where activities, beacons, alerts, messages, and metadata are received within), Intersecting (a safety bubble that is in shape of the intersection area of two or more safety bubbles where activities, beacons, alerts, messages, and metadata can originate from or be transmitted to), Monitoring (a safety bubble where activities, beacons, alerts, messages, and metadata are actively being monitored&#x2014;for example scanning for obstructions suck as parked cars in bike lanes), and Created (a safety bubble that is manually or automatically created by the nearby activities, beacons, alerts, messages, and metadata from within and or outside of Transmitting Receiving, Intersecting, and Monitoring safety bubbles).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0131">Certain activities may send proximity data to specific fixed positions and custom sized safety bubbles. These receiving bubble zones could be entirely disconnected from the safety bubble that it originated within or intersected with.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0132">Safety bubbles can be created dynamically for both fixed-positions and moving objects. The safety bubble does need to be broadcast by anything inside that bubble. These dynamic safety bubbles are created by nearby users based on metadata collected. There can be multiple safety bubbles around a given point, aera, or 3-dimensional space (that includes altitude), and each bubble may broadcast its own unique characteristics including activities, beacons, alerts, messages, and metadata.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0133">Certain activity types and metadata characteristics could include the speed, direction of travel, temperature, altitude, surrounding moving objects, and physical surroundings like building and obstructions to line of sight will change the shape and size of the of the transmitting bubble, the intersecting bubble, or the receiving bubble i.e. when a cyclists is approaching an intersection that safety bubble will expand to be shared further in front of the cyclist and the broadcast will also include more of the space around blind corners.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0134">Certain metadata (like street signage, lines on the road etc.) can be used to create fixed position bubbles of varied shapes and sizes. These are called monitoring bubbles i.e. delineated bike lanes. When moving safety bubbles intersect with or depart from being within these monitoring safety bubbles they can trigger events including the broadcast of alerts, messages, and or metadata.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0135">Altitude may also be used as part of the metadata that affects and alters the shape and size of the safety bubble.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0136">While the invention has been described with reference to the embodiments above, a person of ordinary skill in the art would understand that various changes or modifications may be made thereto without departing from the scope of the claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
