No. 62/881,038 filed on Jul. 31, 2019, which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure generally relates to the isolation of cannabinoids and mixtures of cannabinoids. In particular, the present disclosure relates to separation of cannabinoids from cannabinoid-containing resins or concentrates to isolate pure compounds or purified mixtures.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Naturally available cannabinoids, such as phytocannabinoids that are derived from plants, are typically sourced as a mixture of various cannabinoid compounds. Other plant components include, but are not limited to, lipids such as triglycerides and waxes. Due to the complexity of the mixture, it is challenging to fully understand the pharmacologic effect of individual cannabinoids and mixtures thereof. Furthermore, isolating individual cannabinoids from a source mixture has also proven challenging. Known methods for separating cannabinoids from each other in a mixture of cannabinoids include chromatography, short path distillation, and crystallization.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In chromatography, an input material is dissolved in a solvent to form a mobile phase. The mobile phase passes through a chromatography column. When the mobile phase containing the dissolved mixture passes through the chromatography column, the compounds within the mobile phase can travel at different speeds. The amount of time it takes for a compound to travel through the column is called retention time and it is a result of size, shape, total charge, hydrophobic groups present on the compound's surface, and binding capacity with the chromatography column. A widely used chromatography method for purification of molecules is High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). This method involves passing the mobile phase through a chromatography column under pressures ranging from 10-400 atm and at a high flow rate. During HPLC, the use of small particles and the application of a high pressure increases the separation of the compounds within the mobile phase, which results in a shorter analysis time. However, HPLC requires complex and expensive equipment, generates significant waste, and is costly because of the large quantities of organic solvent required. Generally speaking, organic solvents present specific and further challenges because they can be expensive, toxic if consumed, and they are typically highly flammable and, therefore, they require specific equipment to handle safely. Other forms of chromatography, such as flash chromatography, simulated moving bed chromatography, and centrifugal partition chromatography can all suffer from similar challenges as HPLC with respect to complexity and solvent requirements.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Short path distillation involves a distillate travelling a short distance and it is typically performed under high vacuum to allow for the separation of larger heat-sensitive compounds. This method can run continuously and has the advantage of not using solvents to achieve the desired separation. However, short path distillation relies on a significant difference in vapor pressure between the compounds being separated. While this vapor pressure difference may hold true between cannabinoid compounds, as a whole, versus other components of plant-derived mixtures, the separation of individual cannabinoids from each other, or even from some waxes and oils, is not readily achievable by short path distillation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Crystallization is another methodology that is known for separating cannabinoids from a mixture. Crystallization is possible with some cannabinoid compounds in the neutral form (primarily cannabigerol and cannabidiol) and the carboxylic acid form of all cannabinoids. Crystallization is challenging because it often takes considerable time. Crystallization also uses organic solvent and it is typically only able to produce isolates/single compounds&#x2014;not complex mixtures. Furthermore, crystallization is traditionally a batch style process, which limits its utility or even prevents its integration into a continuous processing method. Crystallization also requires a high purity input prior to beginning the process in order to maximize yields. This means that an alternate separation technology is typically used before crystallization, which results in an overall inefficiency in the separation methodology.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Each of the known methodologies for separating cannabinoids from a mixture are challenged by inefficient and incomplete separation of desired compounds from the mixture, high operational costs and, often times, the necessity of using organic solvents. However, given the potential pharmacological value of individual cannabinoids, improved separation methods to provide highly pure individual cannabinoids&#x2014;or mixtures of cannabinoids with specific relative ratios of one compound to another compound&#x2014;may be desirable.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure relates to apparatus and methods for isolating one or more cannabinoids from an input mixture.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment, the present disclosure relates to an apparatus for isolating one or more cannabinoids from an input mixture, the apparatus comprising: (a) a volatizing unit that is configured to receive and volatilize the input mixture into a cannabinoid-containing vapor stream and a residue; (b) a fractional distillation unit that is in fluid communication with the volatizing unit, the fractional distillation unit comprising a column that defines a plenum for receiving the cannabinoid-containing vapor stream, wherein the plenum is configured to separate a first cannabinoid within the cannabinoid-containing vapor stream from at least a second cannabinoid; and (c) a condenser unit that is configured to receive a portion of the cannabinoid-containing vapor stream comprising the first cannabinoid from the plenum and to form a condensed first cannabinoid output stream and a recirculate stream.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment, the apparatus disclosed herein further comprises a distributor that is configured to receive the recirculate stream and to conduct the recirculate stream to the plenum.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment, the present disclosure relates to a method for isolating one or more cannabinoids from an input mixture, the method comprising steps of: (a) volatilizing the input mixture to provide a cannabinoid-containing vapor stream and a residue; (b) conducting the cannabinoid-containing vapor stream to a fractional distillation unit; (c) separating a first cannabinoid from at least a second cannabinoid within the fractional distillation unit; (d)</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">conducting a portion of the cannabinoid-containing vapor stream comprising the first cannabinoid to a condenser unit; (e) condensing the conducted portion of the cannabinoid-containing vapor stream within the condenser unit to provide a condensed first cannabinoid product stream and a recirculate stream; (f) optionally repeating steps (a) to (e) using the recirculate stream; and (g) collecting a product from the fractional distillation unit, wherein the product comprises at least the second cannabinoid.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, the input mixture is a cannabis concentrate. In an embodiment, the input mixture is a cannabis resin.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Without being bound by any particular theory, carboxylic acid-containing cannabinoids can undergo heat-induced chemical transformations that can include decarboxylation. Free carbon dioxide gas formation can occur during a decarboxylation reaction. When heat-induced decarboxylation occurs during separation by fractional distillation, the change in pressure caused by the liberated gas can result in a change in effective boiling points of the cannabinoids. Complete separation of cannabinoids by fractional distillation can be unsuccessful under changing pressures. Performing more than one iteration of fractional distillation may result in improved separation and produce substantially pure yields of one or more cannabinoids from the mixture. Furthermore, condensing a portion of the more volatile compounds present within the fractional distillation column may provide a further valuable product stream and the option to recirculate a stream from the condensing process back into the fractional distillation column for further processing and isolation of desirable products.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">These and other features of the present disclosure will become more apparent in the following detailed description in which reference is made to the appended drawings.

Optionally, the precursor extract can be substantially or completely depleted of lipids and waxes. The precursor extract can have a cannabinoid concentration of between about 60% and about 90% (wt/wt) or between about 70% and about 80% (wt/wt).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">The precursor extract can be heated to between about 130&#xb0; C. and about 160&#xb0; C. while being stirred to produce the input mixture.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 2&#x2014;Separation</heading><p id="p-0086" num="0084">The input mixture of Example 1 was introduced into the wiped film evaporator unit (i.e. a volatizing unit). The cannabinoids were evaporated from the input mixture into a cannabinoid-containing vapor stream inside the wiped film evaporator unit and the cannabinoid-containing vapor stream was conducted to the fractional distillation unit.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">The cannabinoid-containing vapor stream was conducted through the fractional distillation column where at least one cannabinoid in the vapor stream was separated from the other constituents of the vapor stream.

This is because the VOCs can off gas and interfere with the vacuum pressure of the short path distillation unit. Additionally, the acidic cannabinoids can decarboxylate at the distillation temperatures contemplated herein, which generates CO<sub>2 </sub>that can also interfere with the vacuum pressure of the short path distillation unit. Instead, this type of input mixture can be subjected to a two-staged process that includes a first degassing step and a second short path distillation step and then subjected to the fractional distillation process.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">The first step includes degassing by heating these types of input mixtures to about 100&#xb0; C. in a feed hopper and passing the heated input mixture through a 0.25 cubic foot horizontal wipe-film evaporator that is operating at a temperature of about 150&#xb0; C. and at feed speed of about 150 mL per minute. The vacuum is maintained at about 0.5 atm absolute with appropriately sized condenser set to about 4&#xb0; C. to collect any volatile compounds that are evaporated. This process effectively strips the input mixture of some or substantially all volatile compounds or acidic cannabinoids that may interfere later with shortpath distillation. Alternatively, the input mixture may be heated on a hotplate to about 150&#xb0; C. with stirring until no more gas is produced.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">After this degassing, the input mixture is maintained at about 100&#xb0; C. and pumped into the shortpath distillation system where it is heated to between about 120&#xb0; C. and about 250&#xb0; C.&#x2014;depending on the operating pressure&#x2014;causing the cannabinoids to evaporate. The evaporated cannabinoids can be directed to the fractional distillation unit or they may be re condensed on an internal condenser set at about 50&#xb0; C. and about 60&#xb0; C. and any remaining low boiling point compounds are collected using a cold trap that is at about &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. ahead of the vacuum pump.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 4&#x2014;Short Path Distillation for Enrichment of CBD at Various Temperatures</heading><p id="p-0091" num="0089">An input mixture was prepared using a plant input that had on average 14 wt/wt % CBD and &#x3c;1 wt/wt THC.

When using a substantially constant temperature of about 210&#xb0; C. and a vacuum pressure of about 10 mmHg (13.2-13.4 mbar) for the Short Path Distillation of a Second pass resin, it was found that the most efficient feed speed to promote the greatest evaporation and distillation is about 2.5 Hz. At 2.5 Hz, the material distills over at a distillate to residue ratio of 9.55. Without being bound by any particular theory, this data demonstrates that there may be a significant time to allow for evaporation and distillation of the material.
