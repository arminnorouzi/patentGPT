Specifically, the terminal device may refer to a user equipment (UE), access terminal, subscriber unit, subscriber station, mobile station, mobile platform, remote station, remote terminal, mobile device, user terminal, terminal, wireless communication device, user agent or user device. For example, the terminal device may be a cellular phone, cordless phone, session initiation protocol (SIP) phone, wireless local loop (WLL) station, personal digital processing (Personal Digital Assistant, PDA), handheld device with wireless communication function, computing device or other processing device connected to a wireless modem, on-board device, wearable device, a terminal device in a future 5G network or post-5G network, etc.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Network device: a network device may refer to a device configured to communicate with the terminal device, for example, may be a base station (Base Transceiver Station, BTS) in a global mobile communication (GSM) system, or a code division multiple access (CDMA) communication system, or a node base station (NodeB, NB) in a wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) system, or an evolutional node base station (Evolutional Node B, eNB or eNodeB) in an LTE system; or the network device can be a relay station, an access point, an on-board device, a wearable device, a network-side device in a future 5G network or post-5G network, or a network device in future evolved public land mobile network (PLMN) network, etc.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The network device involved in the embodiments of the present application may also be referred to as a radio access network (RAN) device. The RAN device is connected with the terminal device, and is used for receiving data of the terminal device and sending it to a core network device. The RAN device corresponds to a different device in different communication systems. For example, in 2G system, it corresponds to a base station and a base station controller; in 3G system, it corresponds to a base station and a radio network controller (RNC); in 4G system, it corresponds to evolutional node base station (Evolutional Node B, eNB); in 5G system, it corresponds an access network device (e.g. gNB, centralized unit CU, distributed unit DU) in 5G system such as NR.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Search space: search space in LTE system is defined as a series control channel element (CCE) resources required for blind detection for each aggregation level, including a CEE starting position and a number of candidate resources.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Common search space: one common search space is shared by all terminal devices in one cell.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Specific search space: one specific search space is used by one terminal device.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Control resource set (CORESET): is a type of time-frequency resource set introduced in NR, and a UE performs PDCCH detection in a corresponding control resource set.

The NR system is mainly designed to support the enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) service, which is mainly to meet the requirements of the high efficiency, high spectral efficiency and large bandwidth. In fact, except eMBB, there are many different types of services, such as sensor networks, video surveillance, wearable, etc. These services have different requirements from eMBB services in terms of speed, bandwidth, power consumption, cost, etc. In order to support some applications with low data rate and high transmission delay, Internet of things technologies such as narrow band Internet of things (NB-IOT) and machine type communications (MTC) have been proposed. At present. Internet of things devices in IoT technologies such as NB-IOT and MTC are mainly aimed at low-rate and high-latency scenarios. In low-rate and high-latency scenarios, an IoT device usually meets the requirements of low cost, low complexity, a certain degree of coverage enhancement and power enhancement etc. Based on this, it is proposed to further design a new IoT technology in 5G NR to cover such requirements of medium IoT devices. The capabilities of terminal devices supporting such services are lower than that of those supporting eMBB, such as reduced bandwidth supported, relaxed processing time, reduced number of antennas, etc. Such system is the NR-light system.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a scenario to which the method in this application is applicable will be described.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an application scenario provided by an embodiment of the present application.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the beam B<b>2</b> can only cover a terminal device <b>21</b>, but cannot cover a terminal device <b>22</b>, and the beam B<b>3</b> can only cover the terminal device <b>22</b>, but cannot cover the terminal device <b>21</b>, and so on.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In NR system, each synchronization signal/physical broadcast channel block (SSB) includes a primary synchronization signal (PSS), a secondary synchronization signal (SSS), a PBCH and a demodulation reference signal (DMRS) corresponding to the PBCH. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a SSB provided by an embodiment of the present application, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, one SSB includes one symbol of the PSS, one symbol of the SSS and two symbols of the PBCH, where in time-frequency resource occupied by the PBCH, the DMRS is included to be used to the demodulation of the PBCH.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Public channel and signal in 5G system, such as a synchronization signal (SS) and a broadcast channel, need to cover the entire cell by means of multi-beam scanning, which is convenient for UEs in the cell to receive. The multi-beam transmission of the synchronization signal is realized by defining the SS/PBCH burst set. The SS/PBCH burst set contains one or more SSBs, each SSB corresponds to a beam direction or a port, and one SSB is used to carry the synchronization signal and broadcast channel of one beam. Therefore, one SS/PBCH burst set can include synchronization signal of the SSB number of beams in a cell. In different frequency band ranges, a maximum number of the SSBs included in the SS/PBCH burst set is different, for example, the number L of the SSBs can be determined according to the frequency band of the system: for the frequency band below 3 GHz, L=4: for the frequency band from 3 GHz to 6 GHz, L=8; for the frequency band from 6 GHz to 52.6 GHz, L=64.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">All SSBs in the SS/PBCH burst set are sent within a time window of 5 ms, and are sent repeatedly at a certain period. The period is configured by a high-level parameter SSB-timing, which can be 5 ms, 10 ms, 20 ms, 40 ms, 80 ms, 160 ms, etc. For the UE, the index of the SSB is obtained through the received SSB, the value range of the index of the SSB is [0, L-1], and L is the maximum number of the SSBs corresponding to the frequency band. The SSB index corresponds to a relative position of the SSB within the 5 ms time window, and the UE acquires frame synchronization according to the information and a half-frame instruction carried in the PBCH. The index of the SSB is indicated through the DMRS of the PBCH or information carried by the PBCH.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In NR system, the system information is divided into minimum system information and other system information. The minimum system information is divided into a master information block (MIB) carried on the PBCH and a system information block <b>1</b> SIB1) carried on the physical downlink shared channel. The MIB is used to provide basic system parameters of a cell, and the SIB1 is used to provide configuration information related to initial access. In addition that the PBCH of the synchronization signal needs to perform multi-beam scanning, SIB1, paging, etc., also needs to be sent by means of multi-beam scanning. For the cell that supports the initial access of the UE, the PBCH needs to provide a resource configuration of the PDCCH, including configuration information of the CORESET and a PDCCH search space, and the multiplexing mode of the SSB and the CORESET. The CORESET configuration information includes a frequency band occupied by the PDCCH in the frequency domain and a number of symbols occupied in the time domain, and the search space configuration information includes a starting symbol of the PDCCH and a monitoring period of the PDCCH.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">At present, a PDCCH-ConfigSIB1 information domain in the MIB information carried in the PBCH includes CORESET#0 information and Searchspace#0 information of the type0-PDCCH. The CORESET#0 information is used to indicate resource block (RB) of the type0-PDCCH in a frequency domain and symbols in a time domain, the Searchspace#0 information is used to determine a monitoring occasion of the type0-PDCCH.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Table 1 shows how to obtain the corresponding number of RBs and number of symbols, and the RB offset relative to the SSB according to the CORESET#0 information. As shown in Table 1, when the subcarrier spacing is 15 kHz, the bandwidth of CORESET#0 can be configured as 24, 48, and 96 RBs. In Table 1, the CORESET#0 information indicates one of the indexes in Table 1, and according to the index, the corresponding number of RBs and number of symbols, and the RB offset relative to the SSB are obtained. Table 1 shows a total of 16 indexes from 0 to 15, four bits can be used to store the indexes, and then corresponding information can be obtained according to the indexes in the CORESET#0 information.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>Multiplexing </entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>pattern</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>of SSB and</entry><entry>Number </entry><entry>Number of</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>CORESET </entry><entry>of RBs</entry><entry>symbols</entry><entry>Offset</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Index</entry><entry>(pattern)</entry><entry>N<sub>RB</sub><sup>CORESET</sup></entry><entry>N<sub>symb</sub><sup>CORESET</sup></entry><entry>(RBs)</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="5" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>0</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>24</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>0</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>1</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>24</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>2</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>24</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>4</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>3</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>24</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>0</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>4</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>24</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>5</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>24</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>4</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>6</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>48</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>12</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>7</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>48</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>16</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>8</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>48</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>12</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>9</entry><entry>]</entry><entry>48</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>16</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>10</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>48</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>12</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>11</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>48</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>16</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>12</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>96</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>38</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>13</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>96</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>38</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>14</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>96</entry><entry>3</entry><entry>38</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="182pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>15</entry><entry>Reserved</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">The monitoring occasion of the type0-PDCCH is determined in the following manner, for that the multiplexing pattern of the SSB and the CORESET is pattern 1, the UE monitors a type0-PDCCH common search space in two continuous slots.

The NR-light system is also proposed for a terminal device supporting a reduced bandwidth, similarly, after the bandwidth of the PDCCH is reduced, the transmission performance of the PDCCH can also be improved through the repetitive transmission for the PDCCH.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0087">Firstly, the transmission of the current PDCCH is introduced. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of the distribution of the slots included in a monitoring occasion of the PDCCH provided by an embodiment of the present application, taking the type0-PDCCH as an example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, currently, two continuous slots are included in the monitoring occasion of the type0-PDCCH.
