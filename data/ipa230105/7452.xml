In particular, this specification relates to detecting a degradation in vehicle-to-vehicle communication and dividing a vehicular micro cloud into subgroups to correct the degradation by using radio channels and/or wireless communication technology.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Connected vehicles form clusters of interconnected vehicles that are located at a similar geographic location and referred to as vehicular micro clouds. The cluster of connected vehicles collaboratively perform computation, data storage, communication, and sensing tasks over vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) networks to cope with an increasing network traffic generated for and by connected vehicles. The connected vehicles collaboratively store (or cache) data sets in their onboard data storage devices and compute and share these data sets as requested by other connected vehicles in the vehicular micro cloud.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vehicular micro clouds remove the need for the connected vehicles to access remote cloud servers or edge servers by vehicle-to-network (V2N) communications (e.g., by cellular networks) whenever they need to get access to computing resources such as shared data (e.g., high-definition road map for automated driving), shared computational power, and cloudification services. For some applications, connected vehicles may have to exchange a large amount of data (e.g., sensor data from vehicle on-board sensors) with other vehicles in the vehicular micro cloud using V2V communications. However, too much network traffic easily overloads the V2V communication channel, and in turn leads to degradation of the quality of application performance.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A system of one or more computers can be configured to perform particular operations or actions by virtue of having software, firmware, hardware, or a combination of them installed on the system that in operation causes or cause the system to perform the actions.

The method further includes dividing the vehicular micro cloud into subgroups based on the communication graph. Other embodiments of this aspect include corresponding computer systems, apparatus, and computer programs recorded on one or more computer storage devices, each configured to perform the actions of the methods.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Implementations may include one or more of the following features. In some embodiments, generating the communication graph includes: defining each vehicle in the vehicular micro cloud as a vertex, connecting each pair of the vertices with an edge, and associating each edge with a weight, wherein the weight indicates an amount of network traffic transmitted between a corresponding pair of vehicles in the vehicular micro cloud. In some embodiments, dividing the vehicular micro cloud into subgroups based on the communication graph includes dividing the communication graph into a number of subgraphs such that a total weight of edges across the subgraphs is minimized, wherein a number of subgroups matches the number of subgraphs. In some embodiments, a first subgroup of the subgroups uses one or more of a different wireless channel or a different wireless communication technology than a second subgroup and further comprising: receiving a communication from a first vehicle associated with the first subgroup that is intended for a second vehicle associated with the second subgroup and forwarding the communication to the second vehicle. In some embodiments, the communication is forwarded using a vehicle to cloud to vehicle communication.

The method further includes responsive to a wireless channel associated with the first subgroup becoming saturated, dividing the first subgroup into a third subgroup and a fourth subgroup. The method further includes transmitting instructions to the vehicles in the vehicular micro cloud to form the subgroups, wherein the instructions include assigning a corresponding vehicle to one of the subgroups and a corresponding wireless channel or corresponding wireless communication that is used for communication within the one of the subgroups. In some embodiments, the network statistics include an amount of data transmitted between each pair of vehicles in the vehicular micro cloud, the network statistics are received periodically from the one or more vehicles in the subgroups, and the method further comprises: updating the communication graph based on more recent network statistics, determining that an amount of communications between a first vehicle in a first subgroup and a second vehicle in a second subgroup meet a threshold communication value, and responsive to meeting the threshold communication value, reassigning corresponding vehicles in the subgroups.

A particular vehicle that includes a communication unit and is operable to send and receive V2X communications via a wireless network (e.g., the network <b>105</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is referred to herein as an &#x201c;ego vehicle&#x201d; and other vehicles in the vicinity of the ego vehicle are referred to as &#x201c;remote vehicles.&#x201d; As used herein, the term &#x201c;vehicle&#x201d; includes a connected vehicle. Accordingly, as used herein, the terms &#x201c;vehicle&#x201d; and &#x201c;connected vehicle&#x201d; may be used interchangeably. The embodiments described herein are beneficial for both drivers of human-driven vehicles as well as the autonomous driving systems of autonomous vehicles.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Vehicle Cloudification</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Some of the embodiments described herein are motivated by the emerging concept of &#x201c;vehicle cloudification.&#x201d; Vehicle cloudification means that vehicles equipped with on-board computer unit(s) and wireless communication functionalities form a cluster, called a vehicular micro cloud, and collaborate with other micro cloud members over V2V networks or vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks to perform computation, data storage, and data communication tasks in an efficient way. These types of tasks are referred to herein as &#x201c;vehicular micro cloud tasks&#x201d; if plural, or a &#x201c;vehicular micro cloud task&#x201d; if singular.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, a vehicular micro cloud task includes a coordinated driving maneuver executed by a plurality of vehicles. A coordinated driving maneuver includes the members of a vehicular micro cloud driving to specific locations at specific times or performing other driving tasks in a planned manner, which achieves an overall driving circumstance. In this situation, the vehicular micro cloud task is the overall driving circumstance and the sub-tasks of the vehicular micro cloud task includes the actions performed by the connected vehicles.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In embodiments where a vehicular micro cloud task includes a coordinated driving maneuver executed by a plurality of vehicles, a vehicular micro cloud task includes one or more of the following overall driving circumstances: providing increased safety at a second time relative to the safety of the roadway environment at an earlier first time; isolating a vehicle that is driving erratically or unsafely; enabling safety or faster movement for a particular vehicle or set of vehicles (e.g., emergency responders, a vehicle with a passenger that needs emergency assistance, etc.); enabling faster driving within legal limits for one or more vehicles at a second time relative to the speed of driving at a first time; enabling slower driving within legal limits for one or more vehicles at a second time relative to the speed of driving at a first time; responding to an event such as a pothole, construction, debris, a traffic accident, an animal in the road, flooding, a natural disaster; increasing fuel efficiency for a group of vehicles; and coordinating the most efficient and/or safest evacuation of a group of vehicles away from a natural disaster. This list of overall driving circumstances is not exhaustive and is only intended for illustrative purposes. An overall driving circumstance includes any circumstance in a roadway environment that is achievable by coordinating driving maneuvers executed by a plurality of vehicles.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, a vehicular micro cloud task includes the members of a vehicular micro cloud driving in a particular driving formation to achieve a particular overall driving circumstance at an end time. The sub-tasks include different locations that different vehicles need to be present at for different times in order to achieve the particular formation at the end time. In embodiments where the vehicular micro cloud is divided into subgroups, different subgroups are assigned different sub-tasks, and when these sub-tasks are executed in the aggregate by all the subgroups, the overall result is that the members of the vehicular micro cloud are driving in the particular driving formation at the end time so that the overall driving circumstance is achieved.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, a vehicular micro cloud task includes any computational, data storage, or data communication task collaboratively performed by a plurality of the members of a vehicular micro cloud.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, a computational task includes a processor executing code and routines to output a result. The result includes digital data that describes the output of executing the code and routines. For example, a computational task includes a processor executing code and routines to solve a problem, and the result includes digital data that describes the solution to the problem. In some embodiments, the computational task is broken down into sub-tasks whose completion is equivalent to completion of the computational task. In this way, the processors of a plurality of micro cloud members are assigned different sub-tasks configured to complete the computational task; the micro cloud members take steps to complete the sub-tasks in parallel and share the result of the completion of the sub-task with one another via V2X wireless communication. In this way, the plurality of micro cloud members work together collaboratively to complete the computational task. The processors include, for example, the onboard units or electronic control units (ECUs) of a plurality of connected vehicles that are micro cloud members.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, a data storage task includes a processor storing digital data in a memory of a connected vehicle. For example, a digital data file which is too big to be stored in the memory of any one vehicle is stored in the memory of multiple vehicles. In some embodiments, the data storage task is broken down into sub-tasks whose completion is equivalent to completion of the data storage task. In this way, the processors of a plurality of micro cloud members are assigned different sub-tasks configured to complete the data storage task; the micro cloud members take steps to complete the sub-tasks in parallel and share the result of the completion of the sub-task with one another via V2X wireless communication. In this way, the plurality of micro cloud members work together collaboratively to complete the data storage task. For example, a sub-task for a data storage task includes storing a portion of a digital data file in a memory of a micro cloud member; other micro cloud members are assigned sub-tasks to store the remaining portions of digital data file in their memories so that collectively the entire file is stored across the vehicular micro cloud or a sub-set of the vehicular micro cloud.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, a data communication task includes a processor using some or all of the network bandwidth available to the processor (e.g., via the communication unit of the connected vehicle) to transmit a portion a V2X wireless message to another endpoint. For example, a V2X wireless message includes a payload whose file size is too big to be transmitted using the bandwidth available to any one vehicle and so the payload is broken into segments and transmitted at the same time (or contemporaneously) via multiple wireless messages by multiple micro cloud members. In some embodiments, the data communication task is broken down into sub-tasks whose completion is equivalent to completion of the data storage task. In this way, the processors of a plurality of micro cloud members are assigned different sub-tasks configured to complete the data storage task; the micro cloud members take steps to complete the sub-tasks in parallel and share the result of the completion of the sub-task with one another via V2X wireless communication. In this way, the plurality of micro cloud members work together collaboratively to complete the data storage task. For example, a sub-task for a data communication task includes transmitting a portion of a payload for a V2X message to a designated endpoint; other micro cloud members are assigned sub-tasks to transmit the remaining portions of payload using their available bandwidth so that collectively the entire payload is transmitted.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, a vehicular micro cloud task is collaboratively performed by the plurality of members executing computing processes in parallel that are configured to complete the execution of the vehicular micro cloud task.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Vehicular micro clouds are beneficial, for example, because they help vehicles to perform computationally expensive tasks that they could not perform alone or store large data sets that they could not store alone.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Vehicular micro clouds are described in the patent applications that are incorporated by reference in this paragraph.

The vehicular micro cloud allows vehicles in and around the vehicular micro cloud to request the data content from micro cloud member(s) over V2V communications, reducing the need to access remote cloud servers by vehicle-to-network (e.g., cellular) communications. For some use cases, micro cloud members may also update the cached data contents on the spot with minimal intervention by remote cloud/edge servers (e.g., updating a high-definition road map based on measurements from on-board sensors). This paragraph is not intended to limit the functionality of the embodiments described herein to data storage. As described herein, the embodiments are operable to provide other vehicular micro cloud tasks in addition to data storage tasks.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The endpoints that are part of the vehicular micro cloud may be referred to herein as &#x201c;members,&#x201d; &#x201c;micro cloud members,&#x201d; or &#x201c;member vehicles.&#x201d; Examples of members include one or more of the following: a connected vehicle; an edge server; a cloud server; any other connected device that has computing resources and has been invited to join the vehicular micro cloud by a handshake process. In some embodiments, the term &#x201c;member vehicle&#x201d; specifically refers to only connected vehicles that are members of the vehicular micro cloud whereas the terms &#x201c;members&#x201d; or &#x201c;micro cloud members&#x201d; is a broader term that may refer to one or more of the following: endpoints that are vehicles; and endpoints that are not vehicles such as roadside units.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the communication unit of an ego vehicle includes a V2X radio. The V2X radio operates in compliance with a V2X protocol. In some embodiments, the V2X radio is a cellular-V2X radio (&#x201c;C-V2X radio&#x201d;). In some embodiments, the V2X radio broadcasts Basic Safety Messages (&#x201c;BSM&#x201d; or &#x201c;safety message&#x201d; if singular, &#x201c;BSMs&#x201d; or &#x201c;safety messages&#x201d; if plural). In some embodiments, the safety messages broadcast by the communication unit include some or all of the system data as its payload. In some embodiments, the system data is included in part 2 of the safety message as specified by a Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) protocol. In some embodiments, the payload includes digital data that describes, among other things, sensor data that describes a roadway environment that includes the members of the vehicular micro cloud. In some embodiments, the V2X radio broadcasts communications using an intelligent transportation system that is incorporated with 5G and software defined-networking (SDN) (e.g., ITS-5G).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the coordination system is software installed in an onboard unit (e.g., an electronic control unit (ECU)) of a vehicle having V2X communication capability. The vehicle is a connected vehicle and operates in a roadway environment with N number of remote vehicles that are also connected vehicles, where N is any positive whole number that satisfies a threshold for forming a vehicular micro cloud. The roadway environment may include one or more of the following example elements: an ego vehicle; N remote vehicles; an edge server; and a roadside unit. For the purpose of clarity, the N remote vehicles may be referred to herein as the &#x201c;remote vehicle&#x201d; or the &#x201c;remote vehicles&#x201d; and this will be understood to describe N remote vehicles.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The ego vehicle and the remote vehicles may be human-driven vehicles, autonomous vehicles, or a combination of human-driven vehicles and autonomous vehicles. In some embodiments, the ego vehicle and the remote vehicles may be equipped with DSRC equipment such as a global positioning system (GPS) unit that has lane-level accuracy and a DSRC radio that is capable of transmitting DSRC messages (e.g., BSMs).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, the ego vehicle and some or all of the remote vehicles include their own instance of a coordination system. For example, in addition to the ego vehicle, some or all of the remote vehicles include an onboard unit having an instance of the coordination system installed therein.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the ego vehicle and one or more of the remote vehicles are members of a vehicular micro cloud. In some embodiments, the remote vehicles are members of a vehicular micro cloud, but the ego vehicle is not a member of the vehicular micro cloud. In some embodiments, the ego vehicle and some, but not all, of the remote vehicles are members of the vehicular micro cloud. In some embodiments, the ego vehicle and some or all of the remote vehicles are members of the same vehicular macro cloud but not the same vehicular micro cloud, meaning that they are members of various vehicular micro clouds that are all members of the same vehicular macro cloud so that they are still interrelated to one another by the vehicular macro cloud. An example of a vehicular micro cloud according to some embodiments includes the vehicular micro cloud <b>194</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Accordingly, multiple instances of the coordination system are installed in a group of connected vehicles. The group of connected vehicles are arranged as a vehicular micro cloud. As described in more detail below, the coordination system further organizes the vehicular micro cloud into subgroups. Each subgroup includes at least one member of the vehicular micro cloud such that the coordination system manages communications between different subgroups that all belong to the same vehicular micro cloud.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">A subgroup includes a subset of the members of a vehicular micro cloud. In some embodiments, the members of the subgroup are organized to form the subgroup by a hub vehicle or a server (e.g., a cloud server or an edge server). An example of subgroups includes the first subgroup <b>455</b> and the second subgroup <b>460</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> or the nano cloud <b>505</b>A illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In embodiments where the coordination system is stored on a cloud server or an edge server, the ego vehicle may receive instructions from the server to be associated with a subgroup. The instructions may include an assignment to a particular subgroup, such as a first subgroup, and a wireless channel or wireless communication technology to use to communication with other members of the particular subgroup.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Hub</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the coordination system that executes a method as described herein (e.g., the method <b>600</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> or the method <b>700</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) is an element of a hub or a hub vehicle. For example, the vehicular micro cloud formed by the coordination system includes a hub vehicle that provides the following example functionality in addition to the functionality of the methods described herein: (1) controlling when the set of member vehicles leave the vehicular micro cloud (i.e., managing the membership of the vehicular micro cloud, such as who can join, when they can join, when they can leave, etc.); (2) determining how to use the pool of vehicular computing resources to complete a set of tasks in an order for the set of member vehicles wherein the order is determined based on a set of factors that includes safety; (3) determining how to use the pool of vehicular computing resources to complete a set of tasks that do not include any tasks that benefit the hub vehicle; and determining when no more tasks need to be completed, or when no other member vehicles are present except for the hub vehicle, and taking steps to dissolve the vehicular micro cloud responsive to such determinations.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The &#x201c;hub vehicle&#x201d; may be referred to herein as the &#x201c;hub.&#x201d; An example of a hub vehicle according to some embodiments includes the ego vehicle <b>123</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the coordination system determines which member vehicle from a group of vehicles (e.g., the ego vehicle and one or more remote vehicles) will serve as the hub vehicle based on a set of factors that indicate which vehicle (e.g., the ego vehicle or one of the remote vehicles) is the most technologically sophisticated. For example, the member vehicle that has the fastest onboard computer may be the hub vehicle. Other factors that may qualify a vehicle to be the hub include one or more of the following: having the most accurate sensors relative to the other members; having the most bandwidth relative to the other members; and having the most unused memory relative to the other members. Accordingly, the designation of which vehicle is the hub vehicle may be based on a set of factors that includes which vehicle has: (1) the fastest onboard computer relative to the other members; (2) the most accurate sensors relative to the other members; (3) the most bandwidth relative to the other members or other network factors such having radios compliant with the most modern network protocols; and (4) most available memory relative to the other members.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the designation of which vehicle is the hub vehicle changes over time if the coordination system determines that a more technologically sophisticated vehicle joins the vehicular micro cloud. Accordingly, the designation of which vehicle is the hub vehicle is dynamic and not static. In other words, in some embodiments the designation of which vehicle from a group of vehicles is the hub vehicle for that group changes on the fly if a &#x201c;better&#x201d; hub vehicle joins the vehicular micro cloud. The factors described in the preceding paragraph are used to determine whether a new vehicle would be better relative to the existing hub vehicle.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the hub vehicle includes memory that stores technical data. The technical data includes digital data describing the technological capabilities of each vehicle included in the vehicular micro cloud. The hub vehicle also has access to each vehicle's sensor data because these vehicles broadcast V2X messages that include the sensor data as the payload for the V2X messages. An example of such V2X messages include BSMs, which include such sensor data in part 2 of their payload. In some embodiments, the technical data is included in the member data <b>171</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which vehicles such as the ego vehicle <b>123</b> and the remote vehicle <b>124</b> broadcast to one another via BSMs. In some embodiments, the member data <b>171</b> also includes the sensor data of the vehicle that transmits the BSM as well as some or all of the other digital data described herein as being an element of the member data <b>171</b>. Another example includes ITS-5G communications.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">A vehicle's sensor data is the digital data recorded by that vehicle's onboard sensor set <b>126</b>. In some embodiments, an ego vehicle's sensor data includes the sensor data recorded by another vehicle's sensor set <b>126</b>; in these embodiments, the other vehicle transmits the sensor data to the ego vehicle via a V2X communication such as a BSM, ITS-5G, or some other V2X communication.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, the technical data is an element of the sensor data. In some embodiments, the vehicles distribute their sensor data by transmitting BSMs that includes the sensor data in its payload and this sensor data includes the technical data for each vehicle that transmits a BSM; in this way, the hub vehicle receives the technical data for each of the vehicles included in the vehicular micro cloud.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, the hub vehicle is whichever member vehicle of a vehicular micro cloud has a fastest onboard computer relative to the other member vehicles.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some embodiments, the coordination system is operable to provide its functionality to operating environments and network architectures that do not include a server. For example, the coordination system is an element of a roadside unit that includes a communication unit <b>145</b> but not a server. In another example, the coordination system is an element of another vehicle such as one of the remote vehicles <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some embodiments, the coordination system is operable to provide its functionality even though the vehicle, which includes the coordination system, does not have a Wi-Fi antenna as part of its communication unit. By comparison, some of the existing solutions require the use of a Wi-Fi antenna in order to provide their functionality. Because the coordination system does not require a Wi-Fi antenna, it is able to provide its functionality to more vehicles, including older vehicles without Wi-Fi antennas.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the coordination system is operable to provide its functionality even though the vehicle which includes the coordination system does not have a V2X radio as part of its communication unit. By comparison, some of the existing solutions require the use of a V2X radio in order to provide their functionality. Because the coordination system does not require a V2X radio, it is able to provide its functionality to more vehicles, including older vehicles without V2X radios.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the coordination system includes code and routines that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to control when a member of the vehicular micro cloud may leave or exit the vehicular micro cloud. This approach is beneficial because it means the hub vehicle has certainty about how much computing resources it has at any given time since it controls when vehicles (and their computing resources) may leave the vehicular micro cloud. The existing solutions do not provide this functionality.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the coordination system includes code and routines that, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to designate a particular vehicle to serve as a hub vehicle responsive to determining that the particular vehicle has sufficient unused computing resources and/or trustworthiness to provide micro cloud services to a vehicular micro cloud using the unused computing resources of the particular vehicle. This is beneficial because it guarantees that only those vehicles having something to contribute to the members of the vehicular micro cloud may join the vehicular micro cloud.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, the coordination system manages the vehicular micro cloud so that it is accessible for membership by vehicles that do not have V2V communication capability. This is beneficial because it ensures that legacy vehicles have access to the benefits provided by the vehicular micro cloud. In some embodiments, the coordination system is configured so that a particular vehicle (e.g., the ego vehicle) is pre-designated by a vehicle manufacturer to serve as a hub vehicle for any vehicular micro cloud that it joins.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The existing solutions generally do not include vehicular micro clouds. Some groups of vehicles (e.g., cliques, platoons, etc.) might appear to be a vehicular micro cloud when they in fact are not a vehicular micro cloud. For example, in some embodiments a vehicular micro cloud requires that all its members share unused computing resources with the other members of the vehicular micro cloud. Any group of vehicles that does not require all its members to share their unused computing resources with the other members is not a vehicular micro cloud.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, a vehicular micro cloud formed by a coordination system is operable to harness the unused computing resources of many different vehicles to perform complex computational tasks that a single vehicle alone cannot perform due to the computational limitations of a vehicle's onboard vehicle computer, which are known to be limited. Accordingly, any group of vehicles that does harness the unused computing resources of many different vehicles to perform complex computational tasks that a single vehicle alone cannot perform is not a vehicular micro cloud.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, a vehicular micro cloud can include vehicles that are parked, vehicles that are traveling in different directions, infrastructure devices, or almost any endpoint that is within communication range of a member of the vehicular micro cloud.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, the coordination system is configured so that vehicles are required to have a predetermined threshold of unused computing resources to become members of a vehicular micro cloud. Accordingly, any group of vehicles that does not require vehicles to have a predetermined threshold of unused computing resources to become members of the group is not a vehicular micro cloud in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, a hub of a vehicular micro cloud is pre-designated by a vehicle manufacturer by the inclusion of one bit or a token in a memory of the vehicle at the time of manufacture that designates the vehicle as the hub of all vehicular micro clouds which it joins. Accordingly, if a group of vehicles does not include a hub vehicle having a bit or a token in their memory from the time of manufacture that designates it as the hub for all groups of vehicles that it joins, then this group is not a vehicular micro cloud in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">A vehicular micro cloud is not a V2X network or a V2V network. For example, neither a V2X network nor a V2V network include a cluster of vehicles in a same geographic region that are computationally joined to one another as members of a logically associated cluster that make available their unused computing resources to the other members of the cluster. In some embodiments, any of the steps of a method described herein (e.g., the method depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) is executed by one or more vehicles that are working together collaboratively using V2X communications for the purpose of completing one or more steps of the method(s). By comparison, solutions that only include V2X networks or V2V networks do not necessarily include the ability of two or more vehicles to work together collaboratively to complete one or more steps of a method.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, a vehicular micro cloud includes vehicles that are parked, vehicles that are traveling in different directions, infrastructure devices, or almost any endpoint that is within communication range of a member of the vehicular micro cloud. By comparison, a group of vehicles that exclude such endpoints as a requirement of being a member of the group are not vehicular micro clouds according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, a vehicular micro cloud is operable to complete computational tasks itself, without delegation of these computational tasks to a cloud server, using the onboard vehicle computers of its members; this is an example of a vehicular micro cloud task according to some embodiments. In some embodiments, a group of vehicles that relies on a cloud server for its computational analysis, or the difficult parts of its computational analysis, is not a vehicular micro cloud. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a server in an operating environment that includes the coordination system, the server is an optional feature of the operating environment.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the coordination system enables a group of vehicles to perform computationally expensive tasks that could not be completed by any one vehicle in isolation.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, each subgroup included in a vehicular micro cloud includes its own hub that is responsible for organizing the operation of the members that are included in that particular subgroup. For example, the hub of a nano cloud (i.e., a type of subgroup) is responsible for maintaining and updating the roster for the hub, monitoring the performance of the sub-task, monitoring the efficiency of the completion of the sub-task, monitoring when members join or leave the vehicular micro cloud, or communicating with other hubs of nano clouds to facilitate updates to the roster of the nano clouds to optimize performance of the sub-task or compensate for changes of circumstance caused by the membership in the vehicular micro cloud changing.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Cellular Vehicle to Everything (C-V2X)</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A DSRC-equipped device is any processor-based computing device that includes a DSRC transmitter and a DSRC receiver. For example, if a vehicle includes a DSRC transmitter and a DSRC receiver, then the vehicle may be described as &#x201c;DSRC-enabled&#x201d; or &#x201c;DSRC-equipped.&#x201d; Other types of devices may be DSRC-enabled. For example, one or more of the following devices may be DSRC-equipped: an edge server; a cloud server; a roadside unit (&#x201c;RSU&#x201d;); a traffic signal; a traffic light; a vehicle; a smartphone; a smartwatch; a laptop; a tablet computer; a personal computer; and a wearable device.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, one or more of the connected vehicles described above are DSRC-equipped vehicles. A DSRC-equipped vehicle is a vehicle that includes a standard-compliant GPS unit and a DSRC radio that is operable to lawfully send and receive DSRC messages in a jurisdiction where the DSRC-equipped vehicle is located. A DSRC radio is hardware that includes a DSRC receiver and a DSRC transmitter. The DSRC radio is operable to wirelessly send and receive DSRC messages on a band that is reserved for DSRC messages.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">A DSRC message is a wireless message that is specially configured to be sent and received by highly mobile devices such as vehicles, and is compliant with one or more of the following DSRC standards, including any derivative or fork thereof: EN 12253:2004 Dedicated Short-Range Communication-Physical layer using microwave at 5.8 GHz (review); EN 12795:2002 Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC)-DSRC Data link layer: Medium Access and Logical Link Control (review); EN 12834:2002 Dedicated Short-Range Communication-Application layer (review); and EN 13372:2004 Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC)-DSRC profiles for RTTT applications (review); EN ISO 14906:2004 Electronic Fee Collection-Application interface.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A DSRC message is not any of the following: a WiFi message; a 3G message; a 4G message; an LTE message; a millimeter wave communication message; a Bluetooth message; a satellite communication; or a short-range radio message transmitted or broadcast by a key fob at 315 MHz or 433.92 MHz. For example, in the United States, key fobs for remote keyless systems include a short-range radio transmitter which operates at 315 MHz, and transmissions or broadcasts from this short-range radio transmitter are not DSRC messages since, for example, such transmissions or broadcasts do not comply with any DSRC standard, are not transmitted by a DSRC transmitter of a DSRC radio and are not transmitted at 5.9 GHz. In another example, in Europe and Asia, key fobs for remote keyless systems include a short-range radio transmitter which operates at 433.92 MHz, and transmissions or broadcasts from this short-range radio transmitter are not DSRC messages for similar reasons as those described above for remote keyless systems in the United States.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, a DSRC-equipped device (e.g., a DSRC-equipped vehicle) does not include a conventional GPS unit, and instead includes a standard-compliant GPS unit. A conventional GPS unit provides positional information that describes a position of the conventional GPS unit with an accuracy of plus or minus 10 meters of the actual position of the conventional GPS unit. By comparison, a standard-compliant GPS unit provides GPS data that describes a position of the standard-compliant GPS unit with an accuracy of plus or minus 1.5 meters of the actual position of the standard-compliant GPS unit. This degree of accuracy is referred to as &#x201c;lane-level accuracy&#x201d; since, for example, a lane of a roadway is generally about 3 meters wide, and an accuracy of plus or minus 1.5 meters is sufficient to identify which lane a vehicle is traveling in even when the roadway has more than one lanes of travel each heading in a same direction.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some embodiments, a standard-compliant GPS unit is operable to identify, monitor and track its two-dimensional position within 1.5 meters, in all directions, of its actual position 68% of the time under an open sky.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">GPS data includes digital data describing the location information outputted by the GPS unit.

No. 15/644,197 filed on Jul. 7, 2017 and entitled &#x201c;Computation Service for Mobile Nodes in a Roadway Environment,&#x201d; the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Example Operative Environment</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some embodiments, a group of connected vehicles form a vehicular micro cloud. The vehicles in the vehicular micro cloud collaborate to perform data processing, sensing, and communication tasks (e.g., vehicular micro cloud tasks) through V2X networks.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The coordination system receives network statistics from one or more vehicles that are members of the vehicular micro cloud. In some embodiments, the coordination system receives the network statistics periodically from each member of the vehicular micro cloud. For example, the network statistics may be part of a basic safety message or other V2V or V2X communication. The network statistics may include an amount of data transmitted between each pair of vehicles in the vehicular micro cloud and/or a network condition, such as channel load and throughput.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The coordination system detects a degradation in V2V communication performance based on the network statistics. For example, the coordination system may determine that there is channel congestion or a latency issue based on the network statistics. In some embodiments, the coordination system determines to take action on the degradation of the V2V communication performance based on a threshold amount of degradation. For example, the coordination system determines to take action when the channel congestion experiences a 60% degradation (or 55%, 50%, etc.). In another example, the coordination system determines to take action if the average latency over a predetermined time window exceeds a threshold value (e.g., more than a 0.1 second transmission) or packet loss occurs.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some embodiments, the coordination system generates a communication graph based on the network statistics. The coordination system generates the communication graph by defining each vehicular in the vehicular micro cloud as a vertex. For example, a vehicular micro cloud with six vehicles would have six vertices. The coordination system connects each pair of the vertices with an edge. For example, a communication graph with six vertices includes twelve edges. The coordination system associates each edge with a weight where the weight indicates an amount of network traffic transmitted between a corresponding pair of vehicles in the vehicular micro cloud. For example, the network traffic may be described as an average amount of network traffic in megabytes per second between vehicle A to B and B to A. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> includes an example communication graph and is described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The coordination system divides the vehicular micro cloud into subgroups based on the communication graph. In some embodiments, the coordination system divides the communication graph into a number of subgroups such that a total weight of edges across the subgraphs is minimized and the number of subgraphs matches the number of subgroups. For example, if the communication graph indicates that a first group of three vehicles communicate with each other much more than the other three vehicles in the vehicular micro cloud, the coordination system may divide the vehicular micro cloud into two subgroups. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> includes an example divided communication graph and is described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some embodiments, the coordination system additionally considers communication latency requirements when dividing the communication graph into subgraphs. For example, the coordination system may assign vehicles to a same subgroup that exchange latency crucial data by implementing stringent latency requirements to the edges of the communication graph.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The coordination system may transmit instructions to the vehicles in the vehicular micro cloud to form the subgroups. For example, where the coordination system is part of a server, the server transmits the instructions to all the vehicles in the vehicular micro cloud. Where the coordination system is part of an ego vehicle, the ego vehicle transmits the instructions to the other vehicles in the vehicular micro cloud. The instructions may include assigning a corresponding vehicle to one of the subgroups and a corresponding wireless channel or corresponding wireless communication technology that is used for communication within the subgroup. For example, the coordination system may assign a first subgroup to channel A and a second subgroup to channel B. The vehicles within subgroup A can communicate directly with other vehicles within subgroup A, but if a vehicle from subgroup A tries to communicate with a vehicle form subgroup B, the communication goes through the coordination system, which forwards the communication to the vehicle in subgroup B. In instances where a server performs the forwarding of the communication, the process may be referred to as a vehicle to cloud to vehicle communication (V2C2V). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> includes an example of a communication that is transmitted from a first subgroup to a second subgroup and is described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The coordination system continues to receive network communications from the vehicles after the subgroups are formed. In some embodiments, the coordination system further divides the subgroups based on the network statistics. For example, the coordination system updates the communication graph based on more recent network statistics and determines that an amount of communications between a first subgroup and a second vehicle in a second subgroup meet a threshold communication value. Responsive to meeting the threshold communication value, the coordination system reassigns corresponding vehicles in the subgroups.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In another example, if communications between a first vehicle in a first subgroup and a second vehicle in a second subgroup meet a threshold communication value, the coordination system reassigns corresponding vehicles in the subgroups. In yet another example, if a wireless channel associated with a first subgroup becomes saturated, the coordination system divides the first subgroup into a third subgroup and a fourth subgroup (as opposed to a second subgroup, which already exists in this example).</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">As described herein, dividing the vehicular micro cloud into subgroups is proposed to correct for degradation of V2V communications between vehicles in the vehicular micro cloud. Furthermore, updating the subgroups responsive to updated network statistics ensures that the subgroups continue to correct for degradation of V2V communications.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Embodiments of the coordination system are now described.

For example, each of the ego vehicle <b>123</b> and the remote vehicle <b>124</b> are vehicular micro cloud members because they are connected endpoints that are members of the vehicular micro cloud <b>194</b> that can access and use the unused computing resources (e.g., their unused processing power, unused data storage, unused sensor capabilities, unused bandwidth, etc.) of the other vehicular micro cloud members using wireless communications that are transmitted via the network <b>105</b> and these wireless communicates are not required to be relayed through a cloud server.

In some embodiments, endpoints must satisfy a threshold of unused computing resources in order to join the vehicular micro cloud <b>194</b>.

Lane-level accuracy means that the GPS measurements are sufficiently accurate to describe which lane of a roadway that the ego vehicle <b>123</b> is traveling (e.g., the geographic position described by the GPS measurement is accurate to within 1.5 meters of the actual position of the ego vehicle <b>123</b> in the real-world).

One example of a V2X standard is the DSRC standard. Other standards governing V2X communications are possible. The DSRC standard requires that GPS data be precise enough to infer if two vehicles (one of which is, for example, the ego vehicle <b>123</b>) are located in adjacent lanes of travel on a roadway.

Thus, in this example, there are four vehicles in the vehicular micro cloud (A, B, C, and D) and eight edges. Each edge is associated with a weight, which indicates the amount of network traffic transmitted between the corresponding pair of micro cloud members. In this example, the average amount of data transferred between vehicles A and B, and vehicles C and D, and accordingly, the edges between those vertices is 1 MB/s. The average amount of data transferred between vehicles A and D, A and C, B and C, and B and D, and accordingly, the edges between those vertices is 0.1 MB/s.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">The coordination system <b>199</b> minimizes cellular communication overhead and communication latency by generating subgroups that minimize data traffic across the subgroups.
