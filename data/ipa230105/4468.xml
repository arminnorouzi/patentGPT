For instance, automated setup may be utilized to increase efficiency in computing device setup and/or management. In some examples, automated setup may utilize instructions (e.g., scripts, policies, templates, etc.) to provision new computing devices and/or computing devices in a base state. In some examples, automated setup may be utilized to reduce setup errors as they occur. In some examples, automated setup may provide a high degree of control over computing device setup (for a management server and/or information technology (IT) administrator, for instance).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Automated setup can become unwieldy when dealing with computing devices that operate with disparate environments, infrastructure, and/or in different states. For instance, some computing devices may have deviated from a base state, may have unique setup details, and/or may have different settings due to user variation. In some cases, an automated setup action may trigger further setup actions and/or may create side effects.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some examples of the techniques described herein may generate a message when an action (e.g., instruction, policy, template, etc.) will generate a condition (e.g., setup change, side effect, behavior, etc.) that will trigger another action. In some examples, conditions (e.g., setup changes, side effects, behaviors, etc.) may be identified and/or cataloged against a database of actions and triggers. In some examples, this information may be utilized to predict single and multi-stage actions, including the identification of cyclical actions.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An electronic device is a device that includes electronic circuitry (e.g., integrated circuitry, etc.). A computing device is an electronic device that includes a processor and/or logic circuitry. Examples of computing devices may include desktop computers, laptop computers, tablet devices, smartphones, televisions, game consoles, smart speakers, voice assistants, etc. A computing device may utilize processor(s) and/or logic circuitry to perform an operation or operations. In some examples, computing devices may execute instructions stored in memory to perform the operation(s). Instructions may be code and/or programming that specifies functionality or operation of the circuitry. In some examples, instructions may be stored in non-volatile memory (e.g., Read-Only Memory (ROM), Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM), Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM), flash memory, etc.).</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some examples, a computing device may be linked to another electronic device or devices using a wired and/or wireless link. For example, a computing device may include a communication interface for linking to an electronic device (e.g., switch, router, server, and/or computer, etc.). Examples of wired communication interfaces may include an Ethernet interface, Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface, fiber interface, Lightning&#xae; interface, etc. In some examples, a computing device may include a wireless communication interface to send and/or receive wireless (e.g., radio frequency (RF)) signals. Examples of wireless communication interfaces may include an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 (Wi-Fi) interface, Bluetooth&#xae; interface cellular (e.g., 3G, Long-Term Evolution (LTE), 4G, 5G, etc.) interface, etc.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A link between electronic devices may be a direct link (e.g., without an intervening device) or an indirect link (e.g., with an intervening device or devices). For instance, a link may be established between electronic devices over a network using a modem(s), router(s), switch(es), hub(s), and/or repeater(s), etc.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Throughout the drawings, similar reference numbers may designate similar or identical elements. When an element is referred to without a reference number, this may refer to the element generally, with and/or without limitation to any particular drawing or figure. In some examples, the drawings are not to scale and/or the size of some parts may be exaggerated to more clearly illustrate the example shown. Moreover, the drawings provide examples in accordance with the description. However, the description is not limited to the examples provided in the drawings.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating an example of a method <b>100</b> for management action prediction. The method <b>100</b> and/or a method <b>100</b> element or elements may be performed by an apparatus (e.g., computing device, server, etc.). For example, the method <b>100</b> may be performed by the apparatus <b>302</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The apparatus may monitor <b>102</b> device management actions. A device management action is the execution of an instruction or instructions (e.g., policy, template, etc.) to modify a device (e.g., remote device, client device, endpoint device, etc.). For instance, the apparatus may execute a device management action to cause a modification of an operating system (OS) (e.g., OS updates, version, etc.), installed application(s), and/or setting(s) (e.g., network setting(s), security setting(s), etc.) of a device (or devices).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some examples, the device may be a remote device. A remote device is a device that is separate from the apparatus. In some examples, a remote device may be linked to the apparatus via a communication network or networks. Examples of a remote device may include a computing device, electronic device, smartphone, tablet device, desktop computer, laptop computer, server, game console, client device, endpoint device, end user device, etc. In some examples, a remote device may be a client device. For instance, the apparatus may be a server (e.g., cloud device, back-end device, server-side device, etc.) and/or the remote device may be a client device. In some examples, a remote device or client device may not be a back-end device, server-side device, or cloud device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some examples, the apparatus may communicate with an agent on a device (e.g., remote device, client device, endpoint device, end-user device, etc.) to perform the management action and/or to modify the device. An agent is an application or program that performs an operation on a device for another device or program and/or in coordination with another device or program. For instance, a device may have an agent installed. The agent may perform an operation on the device in response to the management action from the apparatus. For instance, the agent may receive a message in accordance with the management action to modify an OS, application(s), and/or setting(s) on device. For instance, the agent may install an application, remove an application, change a registry value, install a driver, change network settings, and/or perform another operation indicated by the management action.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some examples, the apparatus may monitor <b>102</b> device management actions by detecting and/or storing when a management action occurs. For instance, the apparatus may record management actions in a data structure (e.g., database, table, etc.).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A trigger is data indicating a condition, behavior, change, and/or notification that causes a device management action to occur. In some examples, the apparatus may track and/or store triggers associated with the device management actions. In some examples, the triggers may include a condition that satisfies a logic expression. Examples of triggers may include a registry change, application installation, setting change, OS update, and/or a notification thereof. For instance, when a device (e.g., remote device, client device, etc.) is modified, the agent may send a notification to the apparatus indicating the change to the device. The apparatus may evaluate the change using a logic expression (e.g., logical Boolean expression). If the logic expression is satisfied, the apparatus may trigger a device management action. Data indicating the change that caused the device management action may be stored as a trigger.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some examples, the method <b>100</b> may include receiving a change notification from a remote device (e.g., client device, endpoint device, etc.). For example, an agent on the remote device may detect a change. Examples of changes may include a registry change, application installation, application removal, setting change, etc. The agent on the remote device may send a change notification indicating the change to the apparatus. In some examples, the apparatus may determine that the change notification triggered a first device management action. For example, the apparatus may detect that the first management action (of the monitored device management actions) was executed in response to the change notification. In some examples, the apparatus may detect that a logic expression was satisfied by the change notification to trigger execution of the first device management action. In some examples, storing the triggers may include storing a first trigger corresponding to the first device management action in response to determining that the change notification triggered the first device management action. For instance, the apparatus may store the first trigger as data representing the change indication, a condition indicated by the change notification, and/or a behavior indicated by the change notification.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The apparatus may predict <b>106</b> whether a proposed operation will trigger a device management action based on the triggers and the device management actions. A proposed operation is an operation to modify a device (e.g., remote device, client device, client-side device, endpoint device, etc.). For example, a proposed operation may be an operation that may be potentially performed by the apparatus. In some examples, a proposed operation may be an operation that is received (e.g., input by a user, sent from another device, etc.). In some examples, a proposed operation may be a device management action that has not been executed.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some examples, predicting <b>106</b> whether a proposed operation will trigger a device management action may include determining whether the proposed operation will cause a logic expression to be satisfied. For instance, the apparatus may evaluate a logic expression or expressions using a condition (e.g., change, behavior, etc.) that would be caused if the proposed operation were executed. If the condition satisfies the logic expression, The apparatus may determine that the proposed operation will trigger a device management action if the proposed operation would cause a condition that would satisfy a logic expression. A prediction that a proposed operation will trigger a device management action may mean that there is potential to trigger the device management action according to the prediction. For instance, a device management action may or may not actually occur after a prediction that a proposed operation will trigger the device management action. In some examples, the prediction that a proposed operation will trigger a device management action may mean that if the proposed operation is executed, that a device management action may be planned on being provided.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some examples, predicting <b>106</b> whether a proposed operation will trigger a device management action may include determining whether the proposed operation is associated with a trigger. For instance, the apparatus may determine whether the proposed operation corresponds to a trigger that caused a device management action. For example, the apparatus may determine whether the proposed operation is a trigger and/or would result in a trigger. In some examples, the apparatus may utilize the proposed operation to attempt to look up a corresponding trigger or triggers in a data structure (in a case that the proposed operation is a trigger or includes a function that is a trigger, for instance). The apparatus may determine that the proposed operation will trigger a device management action in a case that a corresponding trigger is found.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some examples, the apparatus (or another device) may train a machine learning model based on the device management actions and the stored triggers. Some examples of the techniques described herein may utilize machine learning. Machine learning is a technique where a machine learning model is trained to perform a task based on a set of examples (e.g., data). Examples of machine learning may include support vector machine (SVM), clustering (e.g., k-nearest neighbor), and artificial neural networks. In some examples, training a machine learning model may include determining weights corresponding to structures of the machine learning model. In some examples, artificial neural networks may be a kind of machine learning model that may be structured with nodes, layers, connections, or a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Examples of neural networks may include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (e.g., CNN, deconvolutional neural network, inception module, residual neural network, etc.) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (e.g., RNN, multi-layer RNN, bi-directional RNN, fused RNN, clockwork RNN, etc.). Different neural network depths may be utilized in accordance with some examples of the techniques described herein.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some examples, the machine learning model(s) may be trained with a set of training data. The set of training data may include device management actions and triggers. For instance, a machine learning model may be trained to classify whether device management actions will cause a trigger. For instance, triggers may be utilized as classes and/or as a ground truth. The machine learning model may be trained to classify device management actions as causing a trigger or triggers and/or may be trained to infer whether device management actions may cause a trigger or triggers. In some examples, predicting <b>106</b> whether the proposed operation will trigger a device management action may be based on the machine learning model. After training, for instance, the machine learning model may classify the proposed operation as corresponding to a trigger or not and/or may infer whether the proposed operation may cause a trigger.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some examples, the method <b>100</b> may include predicting whether the proposed operation will trigger a second device management action. For instance, trigger prediction may be performed recursively. If it is predicted that a proposed operation will trigger a device management action, the apparatus may predict whether the device management action will trigger a second device management action. Recursive prediction may be performed for a quantity of iterations and/or for an amount of time. Recursive prediction may be performed to determine whether a proposed operation will cause a cascade or loop of device management actions. For instance, a proposed operation may be installing an application on a device. Installing the application on the device may trigger the installation of Microsoft&#xae; .NET 4.5. Installing Microsoft .NET 4.5 may trigger installing Microsoft .NET 5 (and an update, for instance). However, the application may not be compatible with .NET 5, which may trigger installation of .NET 4.5 and so on. Recursive prediction may determine that installing the application may cause a loop of device management actions.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The apparatus may generate <b>108</b> a message in response to predicting that the proposed operation will trigger the device management action. Examples of a message include an image, text, an email, an alert, and/or an audio signal, etc., indicating that the proposed operation will trigger a device management action (and/or will trigger a series or loop of device management actions). The apparatus may present the message to a user. For instance, the apparatus may display the message, and/or may send the message to a user (e.g., IT administrator), etc., to notify the user that the proposed operation will trigger a device management action.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some examples, the method <b>100</b> may include preventing the device management action. For example, the apparatus may not execute the proposed operation, may terminate the proposed operation, may modify the proposed operation to avoid causing the trigger, may disable (e.g., nullify) a trigger that would be caused by executing the proposed operation, may skip a trigger that would be caused by executing the proposed operation, and/or may skip a device management action triggered based on the proposed operation. In some examples, the apparatus may perform the proposed operation and may skip performance of any previously performed device management action triggered by the proposed operation. For instance, the apparatus may skip performing any device management action that had been monitored and/or recorded and that would be triggered by performing the proposed operation. Skipping a device management action may include skipping execution of device management action instructions. Skipping a trigger may include skipping execution of trigger instructions. Disabling (e.g., nullifying) a trigger may include blocking the execution of trigger instructions.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some examples, the method <b>100</b> may include determining whether to perform the proposed operation after presenting the message. For instance, the apparatus may present a query to a user (e.g., IT administrator) whether to proceed with the proposed operation that would trigger a device management action. The apparatus may receive an input indicating whether to proceed. For instance, the apparatus may receive an input from a keyboard, touchscreen, mouse, microphone, controller, etc., indicating whether to proceed with the proposed operation. If the input indicates proceeding with the proposed operation, the apparatus may perform the proposed operation. If the input indicates to not proceed with the proposed operation, the apparatus may not perform the proposed operation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some examples, an operation or operations described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> may be performed for multiple proposed operations. For instance, the apparatus may predict whether multiple proposed operations would trigger a device management action or actions and so on.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some examples, the apparatus may provide a management environment. A management environment is a program or application executed on a computing device (e.g., apparatus and/or management server, etc.) to manage a device or devices. For instance, a management environment may operate on a computing device (e.g., networked device, cloud device, etc.) that is associated with (e.g., linked to) a device or devices. Some of the techniques described herein may be provided by the management environment on the apparatus. In some examples, the management environment may enable predicting whether a proposed operation will trigger a device management operation. In some examples, the management environment may be provided (e.g., hosted) by an apparatus (e.g., apparatus <b>302</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some examples, the management environment may provide a structure (e.g., graph structure, map, etc.) that represents devices in the management domain. In some examples, the management environment may provide a representation of the structure in a user interface (UI). For instance, the UI may depict devices in the management domain as images (e.g., icons). In some examples, the UI may depict (and/or may be utilized to access and/or modify) a message in response to predicting that the proposed operation will trigger a device management action. In some examples, the UI may depict a control (e.g., button, checkbox, text, radio button, etc.) that enables receiving input indicating whether to proceed with a proposed operation. In some examples, operation(s), function(s), and/or element(s) of the method <b>100</b> may be omitted and/or combined.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating an example of a method <b>200</b> for management action prediction. The method <b>200</b> and/or a method <b>200</b> element or elements may be performed by an apparatus (e.g., electronic device, computing device, server, etc.). For example, the method <b>200</b> may be performed by the apparatus <b>302</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

In some examples, determining <b>202</b> whether the proposed operation will trigger a device management action may be performed as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, the apparatus may determine whether the proposed operation will cause a condition that satisfies a logic expression to trigger the device management action and/or may utilize a machine learning model to infer whether the proposed operation will cause a trigger.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a case that the proposed operation will not trigger a device management action, the apparatus may perform <b>208</b> the proposed operation. For instance, the apparatus may execute the proposed operation and/or may send instructions to an agent on the device to modify the device in accordance with the proposed operation. In some examples, operation may end <b>210</b> after performing the proposed operation. In examples, operation may return to determining <b>202</b> whether performing a next proposed operation will trigger a device management action.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a case that the proposed operation will trigger a device management action, the apparatus may generate <b>204</b> a message indicating the device management action. In some examples, generating <b>204</b> the message may be performed as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.
