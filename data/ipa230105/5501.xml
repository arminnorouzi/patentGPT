description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In general, in order to keep read/write heads from landing on one or more discs in a hard disc drive (HDD) when, for example, power is removed from the HDD, and to prevent the heads from colliding with outer edges of the discs during load and unload operations, a head-support ramp is provided adjacent to an outer diameter (OD) of the disc or discs. In current HDDs, a number of heads is equal to a number of disc surfaces, and the heads are rotated for positioning over their corresponding disc surfaces. There is typically no up/down movement of the heads in such HDDs. However, in an &#x201c;elevator&#x201d; drive, for example, the number of heads employed is less than the number of disc surfaces, and a head stack assembly (HSA) including the fewer number of heads is moved up/down to enable a single head to read from multiple disc surfaces. The up/down movement is possible when the HSA is rotated such that the heads are away from the discs and are supported on a ramp. Conventional ramps are a single unit with an edge of the ramp over the OD of the discs. This ramp design prevents up/down movement of the ramp along with the HSA because the edge of the ramp over the OD may collide with the discs during up/down movement of the ramp.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">To address this above-noted problem, some embodiments of the disclosure employ a split ramp including a first ramp portion adjacent to the OD of the discs and a vertically moveable ramp portion that is adjacent to the first ramp portion. To enable up/down movement of the HSA, the HSA is first rotated away from the discs and away from the first ramp (if any), and positioned such that the heads are supported on a moveable ramp portion.

Brake assembly <b>158</b> is used to maintain actuator arm <b>122</b> in a desired z direction position. In an exemplary embodiment, brake assembly <b>158</b> is located within the HSA <b>138</b>A&#x2032; so that the actuator arm <b>122</b> and brake assembly <b>158</b> move in unison vertically along guide post <b>156</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the brake assembly <b>158</b> generally includes a first clamp arm <b>522</b> generally located at one end of a base portion <b>521</b>, while the second clamp arm <b>523</b> is located at the opposite end of the base portion <b>521</b>. The first clamp arm <b>522</b> and the second clamp arm <b>523</b> extend from the base portion <b>521</b> in the same direction, such that they define an opening <b>524</b> between the first and second clamp arms <b>522</b>, <b>523</b>. When the brake assembly <b>158</b> is mounted on the vertical guide post <b>156</b>, the vertical guide post <b>156</b> resides within in the opening <b>524</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The base portion <b>521</b> include a recess <b>525</b> within which is disposed an actuator element <b>526</b> configured to move the arms <b>522</b>, <b>523</b> when activated. Reference herein to an actuator element may include any type of device capable of moving arms <b>522</b>, <b>523</b>. For sake of simplicity, the remainder of this Detailed Description will refer to a brake actuator element as a piezoelectric element, which is one type of suitable actuator element that changes in size when activated to thereby move arms <b>522</b>, <b>523</b>. However, it should be appreciated that many other types of actuator elements are also suitable, such as magnetic or shape memory alloys or bimetallics. The piezoelectric element <b>526</b> may be sized such that it has approximately the same length as the recesses <b>525</b> when in a non-activated state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). In this manner, when the piezoelectric element <b>526</b> is activated to expand in size, such as expansion in the length direction shown by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the piezoelectric element <b>526</b> pushes against the base portion <b>521</b> at the ends of the recess <b>525</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The movement of the piezoelectric element <b>526</b> against the ends of the recess <b>525</b> as described above allows for the terminal ends of the first and second clamp arms <b>522</b>, <b>523</b> to move closer together. In some embodiments, such movement of the terminal ends of the clamp arms <b>522</b>, <b>523</b> in response to the expansion of the piezoelectric elements is based on the clamp arms <b>522</b>, <b>523</b> being connected with the base portion <b>521</b> at flex points or hinges <b>127</b><i>a</i>, <b>127</b><i>b</i>. When the vertical guide post <b>156</b> is disposed in the opening <b>524</b>, this movement together of terminal ends of clamp arms <b>522</b>, <b>523</b> results in a clamping force being exerted against the vertical guide post <b>156</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. As discussed in greater detail below, this clamping force allows for the brake assembly <b>158</b> to lock in place at any z position along the length of the vertical guide post <b>156</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the piezoelectric element <b>526</b> is in a non-activated (e.g., non-expanded) state. The piezoelectric element <b>526</b> resides against the base portion <b>521</b> at the ends of the recess <b>525</b> but does not push against the ends of the recess <b>525</b>. As shown in the inset of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the terminal end of the clamp arm <b>522</b> is spaced apart from the vertical guide post <b>156</b> so as to not physically contact the vertical guide post <b>156</b>. The overall dimensions of the clamp arms <b>522</b>, <b>523</b> are designed such that the terminal ends of the first clamp arm <b>522</b> and the second clamp arm <b>523</b> do not push, contact or reside against the vertical guide post <b>156</b> when the vertical guide post <b>156</b> is disposed in the opening <b>524</b> and the piezoelectric element <b>526</b> is not activated. The clamp arms <b>522</b>, <b>523</b> are connected to the base portion <b>521</b> via flex points <b>127</b><i>a</i>, <b>127</b><i>b</i>. The clamp arms <b>522</b>, <b>523</b> are capable of bending/pivoting at the flex points <b>127</b><i>a</i>, <b>127</b><i>b </i>without breaking off from the base portion <b>521</b>. The flex points <b>127</b><i>a</i>, <b>127</b><i>b </i>may be designed such that when no force is applied to the clamp arms <b>522</b>, <b>523</b>, they remain in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, for example, not touching or pushing against vertical guide post <b>156</b>. The flex points <b>127</b><i>a</i>, <b>127</b><i>b </i>can therefore be considered to be biased towards the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates how the clamp arms <b>522</b>, <b>523</b> move when piezoelectric element <b>526</b> is activated and expands. More specifically, when the piezoelectric element <b>526</b> expands, it pushes against the base portion <b>521</b> at the ends of the recess <b>525</b>. This outward movement of the base portion <b>521</b> causes the arms <b>522</b>, <b>523</b> to effectively pivot inwardly at the flex points <b>127</b><i>a</i>, <b>127</b><i>b</i>, such that the terminal ends of the arms <b>522</b>, <b>523</b> come closer together and push against the vertical guide post <b>156</b> as shown in the inset of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. So long as the piezoelectric element <b>526</b> is activated, the arms <b>522</b>, <b>523</b> remain pivoted inwardly and continue to exert clamping force on the vertical guide post <b>156</b>. When the brake assembly <b>158</b> is stationary, this clamping force allows the brake assembly <b>158</b> to maintain an associated actuator arm <b>122</b> at a desired z position along vertical guide post <b>156</b>. When the piezoelectric element <b>526</b> is deactivated, causing it to reduce in size and no longer push outwardly on the base portion <b>521</b>, the bias of the flex points <b>127</b><i>a</i>, <b>127</b><i>b </i>results in the arms reverting back to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, thereby removing the clamping force from the vertical guide post <b>156</b>. Thus, the brake assembly <b>158</b>, which is fixed to actuator arm <b>122</b>, is free to move up and down the vertical guide post <b>156</b> as the elevator <b>140</b> moves the actuator arm <b>122</b> in the z direction.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> illustrate an embodiment where the brake assembly <b>158</b> includes flex points <b>127</b><i>a</i>, <b>127</b><i>b </i>for purposes of allowing the terminal ends of the clamp arms <b>522</b>, <b>523</b> to move together and exert a clamping force against the vertical guide post <b>156</b>, it should be appreciated that other mechanisms for clamp arm movement to exert clamping force can also be used, such as springs, for example. In such an embodiment, the arms may move towards and away from the base portion, parallel to each other, without pivoting. In an embodiment where springs are used, the set of clamp arms may be designed and dimensioned such that the clamp arms exert a clamping force against the vertical guide post when the piezoelectric element is deactivated. When the piezoelectric element is activated, it expands in a similar fashion to the expansion described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. However, in this embodiment, the expansion of the piezoelectric element pushes the clamp arms away from the base portion. As the clamp arms are pushed away from the base portion, the terminal ends of the clamp arms disengage from the vertical guide post and thereby remove the clamping force from the vertical guide post. When the piezoelectric element is deactivated such that it reduces in size, the arms are pulled back towards the base portion via the springs. The springs recoil sufficiently to bring the clamp arms back towards the base portion and reapply clamping force to the vertical guide post.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref> generally illustrate an embodiment in which one piezoelectric element per pair of clamp arms is used. However, it should be appreciated that more than one piezoelectric element per pair of clamp arms can also be used in order to increase the range and type of clamp possible. Furthermore, when multiple piezoelectric elements are incorporated into a pair of clamp arms, the multiple piezoelectric elements may be identical in terms of their rate and type of expansion, or may be different types of piezoelectric elements such that each piezoelectric element provides a different type or degree of movement.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, brake assembly <b>158</b> can be used with any elevator <b>140</b> mechanism that moves an actuator arm up and down a guide post or shaft.

The clamp assemblies <b>520</b>, <b>530</b> are movable on guide post <b>156</b> or stack block <b>400</b> between or along cylindrical sliders <b>532</b>, columns <b>406</b>, or posts that include bearings, more example.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">With two clamp assemblies <b>520</b>, <b>530</b>, an inch-worm type of movement of the brake crawler <b>158</b>A is provided up or down the shaft <b>156</b> or stack block <b>400</b>. Regardless of the specific manner in which the clamp arms move (e.g., via flex points or via spring attachments), various combinations of piezoelectric elements can be used in the brake crawler <b>158</b>A to achieve different effects. In some embodiments, the piezoelectric elements in the first and second set of clamp arms are similar or identical with respect to their rate of expansion when activated such that both sets of clamp arms <b>520</b>, <b>530</b> exert similar or identical clamping forces on the shaft <b>156</b> or stack block <b>400</b>. In other embodiments, one of the two piezoelectric elements <b>526</b> is designed to expand more than the other, such that the clamp arms associated with the piezoelectric element that expands more exerts more force on the shaft <b>156</b> or stack block <b>400</b> when the piezoelectric element is activated than the other clamp arms. Such a configuration may be useful where one set of clamp arms is desired to be the primary braking/locking mechanism when it is desired to hold the associated arm assembly in place along the length of the shaft <b>156</b> or stack block <b>400</b>. In such configurations, the other set of clamp arms may serve only a supplemental or secondary braking/locking function, or may not be used for braking/locking at all. However, regardless of the difference in clamping force exerted based on the different piezoelectric elements used, both sets of clamping arms should be designed to apply some clamping force against the shaft in order to carry out the inch-worm movement of the brake crawler <b>158</b>A up and down the shaft <b>156</b> or stack block <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, which is a simplified side view of the brake crawler <b>158</b>A, the first clamp arm assembly <b>520</b> and the second clamp arm assembly <b>530</b> are aligned essentially parallel to one another such that the terminal ends of the clamp arms <b>522</b>, <b>523</b> are close together.

Additionally, the one or more piezoelectric elements located between the first set of clamp arms and the second set of clamp arms may be configured to allow for various separation distances between the first and second set of clamp arms. In some embodiments, the amount of expansion or contraction of the piezoelectric element <b>540</b> positioned between the first and second set of clamp arms is controllable to allow for various intermediate spacings between the first and second set of clamp arms, rather than just allowing for full expansion and full contraction, which would only permit for two terminal distances between the first and second set of clamp arms.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The ability of each of the first and second sets of clamp arms <b>520</b>, <b>530</b> of the brake crawler <b>158</b>A to independently exert and release a clamp force on the shaft <b>156</b> or stack block <b>400</b>, and the ability to increase and decrease the distance between the terminal ends of the clamp arms of first clamp arm assembly <b>520</b> and the second clamp arm assembly <b>530</b>, allow the brake crawler <b>158</b>A to move up and down the shaft <b>156</b> or stack block <b>400</b> using an inch-worm sequence of movements.

In other words, the actuator arm <b>122</b> may be movably attached to the rails <b>230</b> so that the actuator arm <b>122</b> moves linearly and, therefore, the at least one head <b>102</b> also moves linearly relative to the recording medium <b>104</b>, along radius <b>218</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, head support ramp <b>136</b> is a rotary ramp in which ramp edge <b>137</b> can be pivoted about axis <b>150</b> on and off disc <b>104</b>.

By restricting motion of the actuator arm <b>122</b> to x-y plane movement only parallel to rail axis <b>235</b>, and by restricting motion of the actuator arm <b>122</b> to z plane movement only normal to the x-y motion, this arrangement stabilizes the actuator arm <b>122</b> even while allowing it to reach any desired position on the recording media.

The linear motor <b>250</b> may include any suitable type of motor that moves the actuator arm <b>122</b> linearly along the rails <b>230</b>.

For example, the permanent alternating magnet may alternate polarities along a length of the permanent alternating magnet. The vertical guide <b>256</b> may include two or more dynamic magnets (e.g., electromagnets) that interact with the permanent alternating magnet. For example, the device <b>100</b>C may send a signal to the dynamic magnets to change polarity (such as to switch on and off) so that the dynamic magnets on the vertical guide <b>256</b> move along the permanent alternating magnet extending along and between rails <b>230</b> due to attractive and repellant forces formed therebetween.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In another case in which the linear motor <b>250</b> includes a piezoelectric inchworm motor, a crawler similar to that described above with respect to brake crawler <b>158</b>A can be attached to vertical guide <b>256</b>, to move horizontally along one or more of the rails <b>230</b>, or to move horizontally along a drive base or shaft extending parallel to the rails <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In yet another case, the linear motor <b>250</b> includes a linear voice coil motor having a permanent alternating magnet fixed to a drive base extending parallel to the rails <b>230</b>.

For example, the device <b>100</b>C may send a signal to the voice coil to change polarity such that the voice coil moves along the permanent alternating magnet due to attractive and repellant forces formed therebetween. Furthermore, the voice coil may encircle the permanent alternating magnet. In another embodiment, the permanent alternating magnet and the voice coil may be in a different arrangement than described.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Whatever mechanism is used in linear motor <b>250</b>, its motion moves brackets <b>225</b>, <b>226</b> along rails <b>230</b>.

For the latter, an optical encoder provides positional feedback for adjusting a vertical position of elevator <b>140</b>. Fine positioning of elevator <b>140</b> may be carried out in a manner described further below.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>, the position of load beam <b>120</b> relative to base-deck <b>144</b>, which is dependent on the position of the HSA <b>138</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) relative to the base-deck <b>144</b>, is denoted by reference numeral <b>147</b>. The z-height <b>152</b> is the distance between load beam <b>120</b> and the surface of disc <b>104</b>. Actuator arm <b>122</b> is connected to load beam <b>120</b> and has a lift tab <b>157</b> at its distal/head end <b>142</b>. A gimbal <b>159</b> is coupled to actuator arm <b>122</b>, and head <b>102</b> is coupled to gimbal <b>159</b>. During operation, head <b>102</b> flies close to the disc surface (such as by an air bearing created by the high speed rotation of the disc <b>104</b>) at a fly height (FH) <b>160</b>. Head <b>102</b> may include transducer elements <b>162</b> (e.g., reader(s)/writer(s)) to read data from and/or write data to disc surfaces. Head <b>102</b> may also include heaters or other fine positioning systems <b>164</b> to cause the transducer element(s) to protrude closer to the disc surface, thereby providing a desired head-media spacing (HMS) for the transducer(s) to suitably carry out read/write operations. Head <b>102</b> may also include one or more sensors <b>166</b> (such as a temperature coefficient of resistance sensor). Feedback signals obtained from different elements of head <b>102</b> and/or actuator <b>110</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) are obtained by feedback circuitry <b>168</b> and provided to elevator <b>140</b>, which may responsively move HSA <b>138</b> to control z-height <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Certain HDD designs have had failure modes related to head resonance and modulation fail modes that have been traced back to drive-level z-height <b>152</b> being off-target. Fail modes that may be impacted by a deviation from nominal z-height include head resonance and head modulation. A shift in z-height <b>152</b> directly affects pitch static attitude and preload <b>170</b> (gimbal vertical stiffness multiplied by z-height change) of the head. These changes directly affect pitch torque <b>172</b> and vertical forces experienced by each head <b>102</b> while flying above the disc <b>104</b>. Alterations in the pitch torque <b>172</b> and the vertical force experienced by each head <b>102</b> may lead to either/both head resonance or/and change in fly attitude.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">A second problem related to z-height <b>152</b> variability in the HDD is the loss of OD disc recording real estate owing to HGA lift tab <b>157</b> contact with the load/unload ramp <b>136</b>. Early contact of lift tab with the ramp <b>136</b> will limit the extent of useable OD tracks (for recording). If the z-height <b>152</b> can be adjusted, then lift tab contact to the ramp <b>136</b> can occur more towards the OD <b>109</b> and higher on the ramp <b>136</b>, adding more recording tracks, and ultimately increasing drive capacity.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Direct measurements of z-height <b>152</b> in certain HDD designs has revealed z-height shifts in drive assembly. These z-height shifts may be exacerbated due to variation in media lot thicknesses. It should be noted that other factors such as HSA tilt and/or disc tilt, the presence of burrs or other debris that effectively shift the HSA up, for example, may also contribute to the z-height being off target. In general, variance of dimensions of drive components such as discs and spacers as well as HSA installation may contribute to z-height shifts. The ability to control z-height within the HDD, and after assembly, adds margin against modulation and resonance failure modes, accommodates for fly height sensitivity to environmental changes, and increases drive capacity by allowing access to more OD tracks.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Embodiments of the disclosure utilize any of the aforementioned head spacing concepts to actuate the HSA <b>138</b> to adjust the individual z-height <b>152</b> of a read/write operation with feedback from, for example, field adjust fly height (FaFH) algorithms. In one embodiment, positioning of the HSA may be carried out as follows:</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">(1) With the heads <b>102</b> off disc <b>104</b> (lift tab <b>157</b> rests on ramp <b>136</b>), the elevator <b>140</b> for HSA <b>138</b> and ramp <b>136</b> may employ optical encoder feedback or any other suitable feedback to arrive at the desired vertical position; this gets the HSA <b>138</b> to the desired height <b>147</b> of the load beam <b>120</b> relative to the base-deck <b>144</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">(2) Next, the heads <b>102</b> are loaded onto the disc(s) <b>104</b>. The elevator <b>140</b> is finely positioned to adjust z-height <b>152</b> based on at least one of three different feedback data/signals: a) &#x201c;head heater power to contact&#x201d; (for example, heater actuation until contact with the disc <b>104</b> is detected), b) reader-based feedback, or c) detected resonance.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">&#x201c;Head heater power to contact&#x201d; involves incrementally applying power to a heater positioned within the head and using the thermal expansion of head materials to decrease head clearance to the disc until contact is made. The power is typically incremented from zero. However, an initial value other than zero may also be used. An initial power step applied to the heater may be relatively large (for example, 30 milliwatts (mW)) because, in most designs, contact will not result with the application of the relatively large initial power step. After the application of the initial power step, the power applied to the heater is subsequently incremented in smaller steps (for example, 0.5 mW) until contact is detected. Any suitable method for head-disc contact detection may be employed. For example, acoustic emission signals or servo signals may be utilized for contact detection. When acoustic emission is employed for contact detection, an acoustic emission sensor in the head or coupled to the head may be utilized to determine changes in fundamental and/or harmonic frequencies that are indicative of head-disc contact. Also, servo signals read by the head may be employed to detect, for example, head position changes that are a consequence of head-disc contact. Change in power to contact indicates a change in clearance.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Reader-based feedback algorithms may employ the Wallace spacing equation; this uses a written triple harmonic magnetic pattern and readback amplitude signal to calculate changes in HMS. Resonance can be detected through measured servo frequency response function or, in some cases, head-media spacing modulation measured by a head temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) sensor signal that is dependent on spacing between the sensor and the media. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>, the feedback signal(s)/data are generated and/or obtained by circuitry <b>168</b>, and provided to elevator <b>140</b>, which carries out the fine positioning of the HSA <b>138</b> to adjust the z-height <b>152</b> based at least in part on the received feedback signal(s)/data.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">During operations, active spacing of the head may be continuously monitored (by circuitry <b>168</b>) for changes relative to the clearance set during drive calibration (such as certification in the factory, following manufacture), or it can be checked at set time intervals, or upon detection of a change in environment (such as pressure, humidity, or temperature, for example). For these monitoring applications, using reader (Wallace spacing) feedback may be suitable, as it will indicate if there are spacing changes relative to the HMS used during drive calibration in the factory.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In some embodiments, the z-height for the active head <b>102</b> in the drive (such as the head <b>102</b> performing the current read/write operation) is tuned. Stated another way, the HSA <b>138</b> position can be adjusted for each individual head-disc interface according to which interface is being written or read. Alternatively, there could be a predetermined elevator position for up-facing heads, and a different predetermined position for down-facing heads. This would add some latency to data access owing to the time required to shift the elevator position; there may be some use cases where this latency would be allowable owing to data buffers (such as use cases where data is streaming or used for surveillance, for example).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Similar head adjustments could be made, with the aforementioned FH, resonance, or power-to-contact feedback, using other head actuation schemes using for example, but not limited to, head heater(s) or other mechanical actuators co-located at the head. It is also noted that the feedback may not be limited to reader feedback, and could utilize, for example, TCR sensor <b>166</b> feedback. TCR sensors are based on the principle of resistance change due to temperature change. Temperature changes as a function of spacing or FH owing to pressure changes in the air proximal to the exposed sensor. As indicated above, other forms of feedback on head-disc contact or feedback on the change in head-disc gap include acoustic emission, as detected by an acoustic emission sensor, or cross track position change, measured by the reader, that is the consequence of head-disc contact. Also, as indicated above, elevator <b>140</b> may linearly move the HSA <b>138</b> along the shaft <b>156</b> to adjust a distance between the load beam <b>120</b> and the surface of the data storage disc <b>104</b> in response to receiving a feedback signal indicative of close proximity, or contact, between the lift tab <b>157</b> and the front edge <b>137</b> of the ramp <b>136</b> when the head <b>102</b> approaches the OD <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref> is a diagrammatic illustration that shows a side view of a data storage device <b>100</b> that employs a coarse positioning system and multiple fine positioning systems for HSA <b>138</b> including HGAs <b>201</b>A and <b>201</b>B on upper load beam <b>120</b><i>a </i>and lower load beam <b>120</b><i>b</i>, respectively.
