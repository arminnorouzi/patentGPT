The orthographic projection area P<b>2</b> of the area connecting the second light-emitting function portion <b>25</b> and the second electrode <b>23</b> on the substrate <b>3</b> is equal to the orthographic projection area P<b>1</b> of the area connecting the first light-emitting function portion <b>15</b> and the first electrode <b>13</b> on the substrate <b>3</b>.

Among them, the first encapsulation layer <b>18</b> is made of common inorganic materials such as SiNx and/or SiOx that can isolate water and oxygen. The second encapsulation layer <b>19</b> adopts an organic encapsulation material that can isolate water and oxygen. The third encapsulation layer <b>20</b> uses common inorganic materials such as SiNx and/or SiOx that can isolate water and oxygen.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A reflection compensation parameter of the second pixel <b>2</b> is defined as a ratio D<b>2</b>/P<b>2</b> of the D<b>2</b> to the P<b>2</b>. The reflection compensation parameter D<b>2</b>/P<b>2</b> is used to characterize a reflection ability of the second electrode <b>23</b> in the second pixel <b>2</b> to the light emitted by the second light-emitting function part <b>25</b>. Since D<b>2</b> in the present embodiment is greater than D<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> is equal to P<b>1</b>, the reflection compensation parameter D<b>1</b>/P<b>1</b> of the first pixel <b>1</b> is less than the reflection compensation parameter D<b>2</b>/P<b>2</b> of the second pixel <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the present embodiment, the display area S is divided into a first display area S<b>1</b> located in a central area and a second display area S<b>2</b> located in an edge area. The second display area S<b>2</b> is an area within 30 mm from the edge of the first display area S<b>1</b>. That is, a distance from a side of the second display area S<b>2</b> away from the first display area S<b>1</b> to the first display area is less than or equal to 30 mm.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a brightness attenuation curve when pixels in the display area are set to different reflection compensation parameters. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a horizontal direction represents a viewing angle of human eyes viewing a measured display area, and a vertical direction represents a brightness attenuation percentage of the measured display area. Specifically, it can be seen that when the measured display area reflection compensation parameter D/P is greater than 1.4, the brightness attenuation of the measured display area under a large viewing angle is alleviated, and an attenuation speed is significantly slower than a rate of brightness decay when the ratio of the reflection compensation parameter is less than 1.4. This is because when the human eyes look at the central area of the display area, a viewing angle of the edge area is larger than viewing angle of the central area. For human eyes, a brightness of the central area attenuates at a small angle, while a brightness of the edge area attenuates at a large angle. At this time, if the reflection compensation parameter D/P of the central area and the edge area are set to be different, and the reflection compensation parameter D/P of the central area is set to be less than the reflection compensation parameter D/P of the edge area, then the large-angle brightness attenuation in the edge area will be alleviated, and a brightness difference between the two areas will be leveled so as to improve sensing experiences.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The reflection compensation parameter of the first pixel <b>1</b> arranged on the first display area S<b>1</b> in the central area of the display area S ranges from 1 to 1.4. The reflection compensation parameter of the second pixel <b>2</b> arranged on the second display area S<b>2</b> in the area surrounding the display area S ranges from 1.4 and 2. Therefore, it is ensured that the brightness attenuation of the edge area of the display area S is slower than the brightness attenuation of the central area of the display area S, thereby improving the visual brightness difference between the edge area and the central area of the display area S due to the difference in viewing angle.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the present embodiment, by increasing the area of the second electrode <b>23</b>, the light reflection effect of the second electrode <b>23</b> is greater than that of the first electrode <b>13</b>, and the reflection compensation parameter D<b>1</b>/P<b>1</b> of the first pixel <b>1</b> is less than the reflection compensation parameter D<b>2</b>/P<b>2</b> of the second pixel <b>2</b>. Therefore, an intensity of the light emitted by the first pixel <b>1</b> is weaker than an intensity of the light emitted by the second pixel <b>2</b>, so that the brightness attenuation of the first display area S<b>1</b> where the first pixel <b>1</b> is located decays faster than the brightness attenuation of the second display area S<b>2</b> where the second pixel <b>2</b> is located. Through the above design, it can be ensured that the brightness attenuation of the second display area S<b>2</b> located at the edge of the display area S is less than that of the first display area S<b>1</b> located at the central area of the display area S, thereby improving the visual brightness difference due to the viewing angle difference between the edge area and the central area of the display area S of the display panel, and resulting in more uniform visual brightness of the display panel.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">It can be understood that, in other specific embodiments of the present application, the reflection compensation parameter D<b>2</b>/P<b>2</b> of the second pixel <b>2</b> can also be increased by reducing the opening area of the second opening <b>142</b>. Specifically, the reflection compensation parameter D<b>2</b>/P<b>2</b> of the second pixel <b>2</b> can be increased by reducing the orthographic projection area P<b>2</b> of the area connecting the second light-emitting function part <b>25</b> and the second electrode <b>23</b> on the substrate <b>3</b>, so that the reflection compensation parameter D<b>2</b>/P<b>2</b> of the second pixel <b>2</b> is greater than the reflection compensation parameter D<b>1</b>/P<b>1</b> of the first pixel <b>1</b>. As an opening area of the second opening <b>142</b> is reduced, the area connecting the second light-emitting function part <b>25</b> and the second electrode <b>23</b> is also reduced relative to the second electrode. The light emitted by the second light-emitting function portion <b>25</b> arranged on the inclined side wall of the second opening <b>142</b> can also be effectively reflected by the second electrode <b>23</b>, so that the brightness of the second display area S<b>2</b> where the second pixel <b>2</b> is located is attenuated more slowly than the brightness of the first display area S<b>1</b> where the first pixel <b>1</b> is located. Therefore, it can also be ensured that the brightness attenuation of the second display area S<b>2</b> located at the edge of the display area S is less than that of the first display area S<b>1</b> located at the central area of the display area S, and the visual brightness difference differences in the display area S edge area and the central area of the display panel are improved due to the difference in viewing angle so that makes the visual brightness of the display panel more uniform.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the embodiment, the first electrode <b>13</b> and the second electrode <b>23</b> are anodes.

As a result, in the direction from the center of the display area S to the edge of the display area S, the attenuation of the visual brightness of the pixels gradually decreases, so that the visual brightness of the display panel is more uniform. Specifically, the first display area S<b>1</b> is close to the central area of the display panel, and the second display area S<b>2</b> is away from the central area of the display panel.
