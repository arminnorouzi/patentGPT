The complex, unknown, and variable unstructured environment proposes high requirements on the obstacle crossing ability of robots, while the urgency of the task requires that the robot should have the ability to move quickly.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At present, common robot mobile mechanisms are divided into a wheel type, a leg type, a composite type and the like. The wheel type robot mobile mechanism has fast speed, but poor terrain adaptability, while the leg type robot mobile mechanism has good maneuverability, but slower speed. As a combination of the leg type robot and a wheel type platform, the wheel-leg type vehicle has both the speedability of the wheel type and the high maneuverability of the leg type, and is a novel composite platform having an extensive application prospect and a research value.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An existing robot with the wheel-legged vehicle structure is usually slow in speed, the characteristic of high maneuverability of the wheel type robot is not fully reflected, resulting in that the robot in a high-speed state, when facing the impact of bumpy road, is hard to keep stable and prone to rolling over and overturning.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An objective of the present disclosure is to provide a wheel-leg mechanism and a wheel-legged vehicle comprising the wheel-leg mechanism to solve the problems in the prior art. When facing impact of bumpy road, the wheel-legged vehicle provided by the present disclosure in a high-speed state can be kept stable and is free of rollover or overturn; and the braking performance of the vehicle can be effectively improved by adopting composite braking of electric braking and mechanical braking.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To achieve the objective, the present disclosure provides the technical solutions:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A wheel-leg mechanism provided by the present disclosure comprises a thigh, wherein an upper end of the thigh is movably arranged in a mounting seat for a thigh motor, the upper end of the thigh is in transmission connection with a thigh motor, and the thigh motor is fixedly provided on one side of the mounting seat for a thigh motor; a shank motor is provided on a. side, away from the thigh motor, of the thigh, a suspension shock absorption system is connected to the shank motor, the shank motor is in transmission connection with a shank by a synchronous belt, the shank is movably connected to a tail end of the thigh, a wheel is movably mounted at the tail end of the shank, and the wheel is in transmission connection with a hub motor; and a braking system is provided on the wheel.

The controller comprises a stepping motor, the stepping motor is fixedly arranged on the vehicle body through a motor seat, a rocker arm is radially connected to an output shaft of the stepping motor, and the rocker arm is connected to the brake caliper through the brake cable. As the brake disc and the wheel are in synchronous rotation, the purpose of mechanically braking the wheel can be achieved through the cooperation of the brake caliper and the brake disc and by limiting the rotation of the brake disc. Through the cooperation of the mechanical braking and the electric braking of the hub motor, the double-braking effect of mechanical braking and motor braking is achieved, and the wheel braking capacity is greatly improved. Moreover, the reverse rotation energy of the electric braking can be recovered to greatly improve the vehicle efficiency.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the wheel-leg mechanism comprises the mounting seat for a thigh motor fixedly connected to the vehicle body, the thigh motor is fixedly mounted at one side of the mounting seat for a thigh motor, the thigh motor is movably mounted at one side of the vehicle body and is in transmission connection with the thigh motor; the thigh motor is in transmission connection with the upper end part of the thigh movably arranged in the mounting seat for a thigh motor, the suspension shock absorption system is arranged in the upper end of the thigh, the shank motor is arranged at the outside of the thigh, the shank motor is in transmission connection with the shank by the synchronous belt, the shank is movably connected to the tail end of the thigh, the wheel is movably mounted at the tail end of the shank, and the wheel is in transmission connection with the hub motor; the braking system is provided at the wheel; the mounting seat for a thigh motor and the upper end part of the thigh are both provided with a plurality of first oblong holes provided in an axial direction; a telescopic part is arranged at the lower part of an electromagnetic pin, and a tail end of the telescopic part is able to sequentially penetrate through the first oblong holes at the mounting seat for a thigh motor and the upper end part of the thigh and then abuts against a torsional spring supporting seat of the suspension shock absorption system. Therefore, a transmission relation between the thigh and the outside of the suspension shock absorption system and the vehicle body can be controlled through stretching and retracting of the telescopic part of the electromagnetic pin. When the telescopic part of the electromagnetic pin moves downwards, the thigh, the outside of the suspension shock absorption system and the vehicle body are in fixed connection, at the moment, the vehicle is in the wheel type motion; the suspension shock absorption system can play a role to achieve shock absorption of the vehicle body. When the telescopic part of the electromagnetic pin moves upwards, the vehicle body, the thigh and the suspension shock absorption system are in free motion relation, at the moment, the vehicle is in leg type motion, and the suspension shock absorption system is driven by the shank motor, and thus the suspension shock absorption system does not work and does not interfere with the leg type motion process.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The electromagnetic pin is fixedly arranged on the vehicle body and is in signal connection with a control system of the vehicle body.

By means of the structure of the U-shaped mounting groove structure, the end part of the shank motor and the driven synchronous pulley are able to rotate in a space of the groove. When the vehicle body is in leg type motion, the thigh and the shank operate stably without interference. As the structure of the thigh and the shank is similar to a skeleton connecting structure of the human leg, the thigh is not limited to apply the U-shaped mounting groove, other structures similar to semi-circular grooves, square grooves and the like can also be applied, as long as the connection of the thigh and the shank can be achieved and the normal operation of the thigh and the shank cannot be hindered. The specific structure at the tail end of the thigh is not limited.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The shank motor drives the driving synchronous pulley to rotate, the driving synchronous pulley drives the driven synchronous pulley to rotate by means of the synchronous belt, and then the driven synchronous pulley mounted at the upper end portion of the shank through the fixed pin is able to drive the shank to rotate around the tail end of the thigh, thus achieving the leg type motion of the vehicle body.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the connecting shaft is sleeved with a spacer ring, and the spacer ring is located between the transition sleeve and the inner wall of the U-shaped mounting groove. By means of a structure of the spacer ring, the transition sleeve can be positioned on the connecting shaft to prevent the transition sleeve from sliding around to collide with the inner wall of the U-shaped mounting groove, thus avoiding the interference among the driven synchronous pulley on the transition sleeve, the side wall of pulley groove at the upper end of the shank and the U-shaped mounting groove at the lower end of the thigh. Therefore, the thigh and the shank can operate more flexibly during leg type motion.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the fixed end of the hub motor is mounted on an inner side of the shank by a bolt; a rotating part of the hub motor is connected to a hub motor connecting flange by a bolt, and a wheel connecting shaft is fixedly connected to the hub motor connecting flange.
