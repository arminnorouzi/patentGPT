The unit cell of the fuel cell stack includes an anode electrode and a cathode electrode, which are arranged on each side of an electrolyte, and a separator between these electrodes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The separator has a fuel gas flow path and an oxidant gas flow path that are respectively in contact with the anode electrode and the cathode electrode. A pair of end plates are installed at both ends of the fuel cell stack, and the end plates hold the fuel cell stack by tightening the fuel cell stack from a stacking direction of the unit cells.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, the fuel cell is provided with a gas manifold to supply fuel and oxidant to the fuel gas flow path and oxidant gas flow path of the separator. A method in which the gas manifold is attached outside the fuel cell stack is called an external manifold method. In an external manifold fuel cell, the gas manifold is fixed to the end plate.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the gas manifold is fixed to the end plate, an elastic sealing member is sandwiched between the fuel cell stack and the gas manifold and between the end plate and the gas manifold. In the fuel cell, such a sealing member prevents gas inside the fuel cell stack and gas manifold from leaking to the outside of the fuel cell stack and gas manifold.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a fuel cell, a gas manifold may deform in a direction away from a fuel cell stack, such as by swelling around a center of the gas manifold due to flow of gas or cooling water through the fuel cell during fuel cell operation. In this case, the deformation of the gas manifold may cause a sealing member to peel off from any of the fuel cell stack, end plate, and gas manifold, which may reduce gas sealing performance of the sealing member.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In recent years, the fuel cell has been increasing in capacity, and the fuel cell tends to become larger according thereto. As a result, an amount of deformation of the gas manifold also increases, and the sealing member tends to peel off from the gas manifold and other parts. As a result, the gas sealing performance of the sealing member becomes difficult to ensure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To prevent deterioration of the gas sealing performance of the sealing member, the deformation of the gas manifold should be prevented, and it is important that the gas manifold has sufficient mechanical strength. Therefore, measures such as the following may be considered.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0000">(1) The gas manifold should be made of a material that is resistant to elastic deformation.<br/>(2) The gas manifold should be a thick-plate structure.<br/>(3) The gas manifold should have a structure where ribs are installed on a back thereof.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0010">However, when trying to provide sufficient mechanical strength to the gas manifold, the gas manifold itself becomes expensive in (1) and (2) above, and the manufacturing cost increases in (3) above, leading to higher costs. Therefore, in a conventional fuel cell, it has been desired to prevent the deterioration of the gas sealing performance of the sealing member and at the same time, reduce the cost. Especially in recent years, as the fuel cell has become larger in capacity, costs have also tended to increase, making it imperative to reduce costs.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0011">An object of the present invention is to provide a fuel cell in which the gas sealing performance of the sealing member can be ensured without depending on the mechanical strength of the gas manifold, preventing deterioration of the gas sealing performance and reducing cost.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a side view of the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is an A-A sectional view of the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an enlarged exploded perspective view of a substantial part of the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a side view illustrating a state before tightening a gas manifold fixing band of the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a B-B sectional view illustrating a state before tightening the gas manifold fixing band of the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view of a second embodiment.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is a side view of the second embodiment.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> is a C-C sectional view of the second embodiment.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view of a third embodiment.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> is a side view of the third embodiment.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> is an E-E sectional view of the third embodiment.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a perspective view of a fourth embodiment.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a perspective view of a fuel cell where a steel band is installed.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> is a side view of the fuel cell where the steel band is installed.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> is an F-F sectional view of the fuel cell where the steel band is installed.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a partial sectional view of a fuel cell stack.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0030">A fuel cell of the embodiment, which includes: a fuel cell stack that is constituted by stacking a plurality of unit cells formed by an anode electrode and a cathode electrode arranged on each side of an electrolyte, and a separator arranged in contact with each of the anode electrode and the cathode electrode and having a fuel gas flow path and an oxidant gas flow path;

When the steel band <b>11</b> in a thin plate is installed directly on an outer periphery of a gas manifold and tightened with a steel band-tightening part <b>11</b><i>a</i>, the tightening causes a sealing member to crush, the steel band <b>11</b> slides over the gas manifold, and a bent portion of the steel band that was in contact with a corner of the gas manifold also moves and is stretched, forming a new bent portion at a place that is newly in contact with the corner of the gas manifold.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">However, when a thickness of the steel band <b>11</b> is not sufficiently thin, the gas manifold will be pulled by the bent portion of the steel band <b>11</b> as the steel band <b>11</b> moves and moves horizontally against a contact surface with the sealing member, or a uniform compressive load is not applied to a sealing surface. When the thickness of the steel band <b>11</b> is thin, sufficient tightening force cannot be added due to low tensile strength, or the band is used under high tensile stress, resulting in increased sleep deformation, and the tightening force tends to decrease over time.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">In contrast, the first embodiment has the action and effect described above.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0047" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> illustrate a constitution of a fuel cell according to a second embodiment.
