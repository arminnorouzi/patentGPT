The invention also relates to a domestic appliance provided with such a gas burner.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A domestic gas burner of the type stated in the preamble is known from for instance American patent publication US 399948. In this known burner a gas-air mixture is formed in the inlet device by supplying gaseous fuel and ambient air, which mixture is carried to the burner housing. The ambient air which ends up in the gas-air mixture via the inlet device is also referred to as primary air, and usually produces a sub-stoichiometric mixture. This gas-air mixture can escape via the flame ports and be brought to combustion outside the flame ports. The gas-air mixture which combusts outside the flame ports on the basis of the primary air, also referred to as the primary combustion, comprises combustible residual gases which will combust while being supplied with ambient air. This is also referred to as secondary combustion. This ambient air is also referred to as secondary air. The fuel will here preferably combust completely, and the heat produced thereby can be relinquished to a surface for heating, for instance a bottom of a pan or kettle. The hottest part of the flame is the part in which the primary combustion takes place. In order to achieve an optimal heat transfer from the flame to the pan bottom it is important for the pan bottom to lie close to the hottest part of the flame, the part where the primary combustion takes place. The secondary combustion should not be impeded here.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A flame of a gas burner has a flame length. The flame length is determined by the outflow speed of the gas-air mixture and the flame speed. The outflow speed is determined by the gas feed to the burner. The more gas is supplied, the more primary air is also drawn in, and the outflow speed of the gas-air mixture from the flame ports will increase. The flame speed is determined by the gas composition, the temperature of the gas-air mixture and the availability of primary and secondary air. When the flame speed is sufficiently high relative to the outflow speed, the flame length will be short, wherein the gas-air mixture will combust close to the flame ports. When there is a great supply of gas, the outflow speed increases, whereby the flame length increases. The flame speed can also decrease due to the relatively high proportion of gas in the gas-air mixture, whereby the flame length increases still further. In the case of a further increasing gas feed there is a risk of the flame being blown off the burner, thereby cooling down and being extinguishing. In this situation the flame speed is too low relative to the outflow speed. The heat transfer can be optimized by adjusting the flame length to the distance to the surface for heating.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The secondary combustion of residual gases takes place in a zone relative to the flame ports which lies outside the zone of the primary combustion. The necessary inflow of secondary air is in this case limited by the distance between flame ports and a surface for heating, for instance a pan bottom. The known burner is relatively sensitive thereto. If the inflow of secondary air is insufficient for bringing the gas-air mixture to complete combustion, undesired residual gases can furthermore even escape.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Because the inflow of secondary air must be sufficient to obtain complete secondary combustion, a relatively large distance between gas burner and surface for heating is opted for in prior art gas burners. Due to this relatively great distance, the heat transfer from flame to the surface for heating is sub-optimal. These drawbacks occur particularly in the case of concentric rings of flame ports which lie in a common plane, wherein particularly the inner flame ports can have a secondary air feed which is insufficient to be able to ensure an optimal heat transfer to the pan bottom.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to obtain a stable combustion in the case of a variation in gas feed, flame stabilization is applied in prior art gas burners, wherein hot combustion gases are fed back, for instance with a baffle, to the flame ports, whereby the temperature of the outflowing gas-air mixture is increased. This increases the flame speed and achieves that the flame burns close to the flame ports in a determined gas feed range. In prior art gas burners the heat necessary for flame stabilization however causes undesired heating of the burner housing, and is not beneficial to the efficiency of the gas burner.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention has for its object, among others, to provide a device in which one or more of these drawbacks are obviated.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to achieve the intended object a gas burner of the type stated in the preamble has the feature according to the invention that the inlet device comprises at least one auxiliary gas port which opens into or toward a wall of the inlet device in or close to a path of the ambient air, that the at least one auxiliary gas port is coupled to auxiliary gas means which are able and configured to generate and maintain together with the gas flow a forced auxiliary gas flow, and that the at least one auxiliary gas port feeds the auxiliary gas flow over the wall of the inlet device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A particular embodiment of the gas burner has the feature here according to the invention that the gas intake comprises the air inlet which allows an inflow of ambient air to the gas flow, that the at least one auxiliary gas port opens into or toward the channel wall of the fuel channel, and that the at least one auxiliary gas port is able and configured to carry the auxiliary gas flow over the channel wall of the fuel channel to the outlet during operation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The fuel flow, which is fed from the gas feed to the entrance in the gas intake, entrains a flow of primary ambient air which is thus sucked into the inlet device. The invention is here based on the insight that the downstream-directed flow of the auxiliary gas over the wall of the fuel channel creates an underpressure upstream, which enhances this suction and thereby the magnitude of the inflow of ambient air. This provides for a gas-air mixture with a higher proportion of primary air, whereby the combustion of the gas-air mixture at the flame ports will take place at a higher flame speed, and thus closer to the flame ports, wherein the need for secondary air is lower. The higher flame speed further reduces the chance of the flame being blown off and finally being extinguished. This results in a lesser or eliminated need for flame stabilization.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Owing to a more complete combustion, an omission of undesired combustion gases can also be limited to a minimum, or even be zero. Because the combustion of the gas-air mixture takes place closer to the flame ports and there is a lesser need for secondary air, a smaller distance to a surface for heating, for instance a pan bottom, can be opted for, whereby a more optimal heat transfer takes place between the flame and this surface. The improved heat transfer thereby results not only in a higher efficiency but, owing to the improved combustion and lesser need for secondary air, stricter environmental requirements can also be met with a gas burner according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is suspected that the auxiliary gas flow, directed toward the outlet, along the wall of the inlet device produces a drag effect upstream, which thereby has a suctioning effect on the primary ambient air. This effect is enhanced further in a preferred embodiment of the gas burner according to the invention, which is characterized in that a Coand&#x103; surface, over which the auxiliary gas flow is received, is provided adjacently of the at least one auxiliary gas port.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the context of the present application a Coand&#x103; surface it is understood to mean at least a surface curved transversely of the flow direction and having a sufficiently low, yet significant radius for the auxiliary gas flow, given the flow speed thereof, to stick thereto and to follow the curvature. The curvature is preferably also preceded by a step or shoulder in the auxiliary gas flow. This forces the auxiliary gas flow in the outside bend to a higher flow speed, whereby an underpressure results here, which is responsible in the gas burner according to this embodiment for an additional suctioning effect on the primary ambient air. The Coand&#x103; effect and a surface qualifying therefor is described further in a paper by Imants Reba in Scientific American, Vol. 214, June 1966, pages 84-92, the content of which should be deemed as cited and included herein.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A further particular embodiment of the gas burner according to the invention has the feature that the auxiliary gas port is intended and configured to feed the auxiliary gas flow at an increased speed, at least at the same or a higher speed than the speed of the fuel/air mixture, at least during operation. Feeding the auxiliary gas to the wall of the fuel channel at increased speed enhances the suctioning effect of ambient air, or primary air, at the gas intake.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">An embodiment of the gas burner according to the invention has the feature that the inlet device comprises the auxiliary gas port downstream of the gas intake. The supply of the gaseous fuel and primary ambient air on one side and the auxiliary gas flow on the other are in that case independent of each other and separated.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">An embodiment of the gas burner according to the invention has the feature that the fuel channel comprises the auxiliary gas port in the wall of the fuel channel.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An embodiment of the gas burner according to the invention has the feature that the auxiliary gas port comprises an inlet gap which opens into the fuel channel and extends over at least a part of a periphery of the wall of the fuel channel, particularly co-axially over at least substantially a whole periphery of the wall of the fuel channel.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">An embodiment of the gas burner according to the invention has the feature that the fuel channel widens downstream of the auxiliary gas port. The widening provides for expansion of the auxiliary gas flowing over the wall of the fuel channel to the outlet.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An embodiment of the gas burner according to the invention has the feature that the auxiliary gas port comprises an auxiliary gas channel bounded by a first wall, which wall has a curved surface directed toward the fuel channel. This provides for the creation of a Coand&#x103; effect on the auxiliary gas along the wall of the fuel channel which flows out during operation.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">An embodiment of the gas burner according to the invention has the feature that the auxiliary gas channel is bounded by a second wall, which second wall has a surface which runs substantially parallel to the first wall of the auxiliary gas channel. This provides for an enhancement of the Coand&#x103; effect of the first wall of the auxiliary gas channel with the curved surface directed toward the fuel channel.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">An embodiment of the gas burner according to the invention has the feature that the auxiliary gas port can be coupled to auxiliary gas means, which auxiliary gas means comprise gas displacing means. This provides for supply of auxiliary gas. The gas displacing means can start a forced flow of the auxiliary gas and/or place the auxiliary gas under pressure. An embodiment of the gas burner according to the invention has the feature that the gas displacing means comprise at least one of a fan, a propeller, an impeller and a compressor, and particularly comprise a fan or a compressor.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">An embodiment of the gas burner according to the invention has the feature that the inlet device comprises Venturi means. The Venturi means can be accommodated in the fuel channel and provide for an improved suction of ambient air when a gas flow is injected into the gas intake of the inlet device during operation.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">An embodiment of the gas burner according to the invention has the feature that the auxiliary gas comprises ambient air. The auxiliary gas hereby contributes to the necessary supply of primary air for the gas burner. Furthermore, no separate gas feed is necessary for the supply of the ambient air, nor is supply of a particular gas necessary.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The object of the invention is also achieved in a domestic appliance, particularly a cooking device, characterized in that at least one gas burner according to the invention as described above is provided therein. The increased output of the gas burner and decreased dependence on secondary air enable a greater variety of burner heads which can be situated on the burner housing for the purpose of accommodating the flame ports, such as flat burner heads and burner heads which are able to follow a bottom profile of a pan, such as for instance a curved bottom profile of a wok.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A particular embodiment of the domestic appliance has the feature according to the invention that it comprises at least a first gas burner and a second gas burner according to the invention, that the first gas burner and the second burner comprise respective auxiliary gas ports, and that the respective auxiliary gas ports of the first gas burner and the second gas burner are coupled to shared auxiliary gas means, which auxiliary gas means comprise gas displacing means. By thus selecting the auxiliary gas means for at least two gas burners collectively it is possible to achieve a significant cost saving and greater simplicity of production for a cooking device.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The invention will be further elucidated hereinbelow with reference to an exemplary embodiment and an accompanying drawing.

Downstream of gas intake <b>104</b> the inlet device comprises a fuel channel <b>108</b> which is laterally bounded inside inlet device <b>107</b> by a channel wall <b>105</b>. Fuel channel <b>108</b> connects entrance <b>117</b> to an outlet <b>116</b> of the inlet device.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, gas intake <b>104</b> narrows in downstream direction, i.e. toward fuel channel <b>108</b>. The narrowed outer end of gas intake <b>104</b> thereby forms at the transition to fuel channel <b>108</b> a constriction, which widens thereafter. Owing to this constriction and subsequent widening a Venturi effect is obtained when the gas flow <b>102</b> is injected from gas feed <b>101</b> into the entrance <b>117</b> of gas intake <b>104</b>. This Venturi effect creates an underpressure in gas intake <b>104</b>, whereby primary ambient air is drawn into inlet device <b>107</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Owing to this Venturi action, the fast-flowing gas flow <b>102</b> thus entertains a part ambient air <b>103</b>, also referred to as primary air, so that a gas-air mixture <b>106</b> is carried via fuel channel <b>108</b> to the outlet <b>116</b> of inlet device <b>107</b>. Outlet <b>116</b> is connected to a burner housing <b>110</b> of gas burner <b>100</b>. The gas-air mixture <b>106</b> is thus carried via outlet <b>116</b> of the inlet device into a hollow burner chamber <b>111</b> of burner housing <b>110</b>, where a further homogenization of the gas-air mixture occurs.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Burner housing <b>110</b> comprises at the position of burner chamber <b>111</b> a set of flame ports <b>113</b> from which the gas-air mixture can escape from burner chamber <b>111</b>. Beyond flame ports <b>113</b> the gas-air mixture can combust after ignition for the purpose of forming flames <b>114</b>. The part of burner housing <b>110</b> with the flame ports <b>113</b> is also referred to as the burner head. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> this burner head <b>112</b> is shown on the upper side of burner housing <b>110</b>, above burner chamber <b>111</b>, and with the flame ports <b>113</b> therein.

Partly due to the imposed outflow speed of the gas-air mixture via flame ports <b>113</b>, the gas-air mixture will thereby not ignite until outside flame ports <b>113</b>. The previously supplied primary air <b>103</b> in the gas-air mixture now provides for an initial incomplete primary combustion in a first zone outside flame ports <b>113</b>. Residual gases of the primary combustion are further brought to secondary combustion in a second zone while being supplied with secondary air <b>115</b>. This second zone lies further removed from the flame ports than the first zone in which the primary combustion occurred. The secondary combustion of residual gases in the second zone is complete owing to this entry of secondary ambient air <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a gas burner <b>200</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the invention.

Auxiliary gas port <b>202</b> is coupled to auxiliary gas means <b>203</b> which generate and maintain a forced gas flow <b>209</b> during operation. This auxiliary gas flow <b>209</b> flows here via auxiliary gas port <b>202</b> over the wall <b>105</b> of fuel channel <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Auxiliary gas port <b>202</b> is here formed by a co-axial gap which extends over a periphery of the wall <b>105</b> of fuel channel <b>108</b> and which is upstream in open communication with an air chamber <b>208</b>.

Upstream of auxiliary gas port <b>202</b> the channel wall <b>105</b> takes a double-walled form and thus comprises a cavity <b>201</b> which serves as feed channel for the auxiliary gas. Via this feed channel <b>201</b> the auxiliary gas <b>205</b> is supplied by the auxiliary gas means <b>203</b> and forced to the auxiliary gas port <b>202</b>. The flush orientation of the auxiliary gas port <b>202</b> ensures that this forced auxiliary gas flow <b>209</b> is fed along the wall <b>105</b> of fuel channel <b>108</b>, in the direction toward outlet <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">This auxiliary gas flow <b>209</b> &#x2018;sticks&#x2019; to wall <b>105</b> here and creates a drag effect, with the result that an increased underpressure, i.e. a lower pressure, is thereby created in the part <b>105</b><i>a </i>of channel <b>108</b> lying upstream. This in turn provides for an increase in the suctioning effect for primary ambient air <b>103</b> at the entrance <b>117</b> of the inlet device, whereby the inflow of primary ambient air <b>103</b> is enhanced. The subsequently enriched gas-air mixture <b>206</b> still maintains a sub-stoichiometric composition, but thus obtains a higher ambient air content than if no auxiliary gas flow <b>209</b> were generated. The combustion in the flames <b>114</b> outside flame ports <b>113</b> hereby becomes less dependent on the secondary ambient air <b>115</b>. The outflow speed in flame ports <b>113</b> moreover becomes higher due to the increased overall gas flow <b>206</b> of the gas-air mixture. In combination with a higher flame speed, this results in a combined action which prevents the flames from being blown off.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Any gas is per se suitable for the auxiliary gas flow <b>209</b> to increase the underpressure in inlet <b>104</b> thereby. Ambient air is however preferably also applied for this purpose, since this is immediately available from the surrounding area and moreover makes an additional contribution to the proportion of air in the gas-air mixture. For this purpose the auxiliary gas means <b>203</b> comprise gas displacing means <b>204</b>, such as a fan, propeller, impeller or compressor, whereby ambient air <b>205</b> is drawn in from the surrounding area in forced manner and is supplied to the auxiliary gas port <b>202</b>. A power source for the gas displacing means can be of electrical nature, for instance an electric motor which is powered by a battery or a local power grid, but gas flow <b>102</b> can also serve as drive of a propeller or impeller, which is coupled directly to the gas displacing means, for instance via a shared rotation shaft or a transmission, or which drives a dynamo which powers a battery for the gas displacing means.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Alternative exemplary embodiments of the gas burner according to the invention will be further elucidated hereinbelow with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>. The relevant auxiliary gas port is here always coupled to gas displacing means of auxiliary gas means in the same way, so that the auxiliary gas port will feed a forced auxiliary gas flow of ambient air, as is also the case in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For the sake of clarity of the figures these auxiliary gas means are however not further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a gas burner <b>300</b> according to a second embodiment of invention. The construction is largely the same as that of the first example and comprises a supply channel <b>301</b> for the auxiliary gas, in this case once again ambient air, which debouches into an auxiliary gas port <b>302</b> close to an inner wall <b>105</b> of inlet device <b>107</b>. Adjacently of auxiliary gas port <b>302</b> the inner wall <b>105</b> comprises a curvature <b>307</b> which provides a Coand&#x103; surface over which the forced auxiliary gas flow <b>309</b> is carried when it leaves auxiliary gas port <b>302</b>. This curved surface then transposes smoothly into the inner wall <b>105</b> of fuel channel <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The convex, curved Coand&#x103; surface <b>307</b> which connects to the auxiliary gas port <b>302</b> produces a so-called Coand&#x103; effect for the auxiliary gas <b>309</b> flowing from the auxiliary gas port <b>302</b>. The auxiliary gas flow <b>309</b> &#x2018;sticks&#x2019; to this surface <b>307</b> so that the auxiliary gas flow <b>302</b> follows the curvature thereof. The radius of the curved surface here forces the outflowing gas to a greater flow speed, whereby a pressure decrease occurs at the position of curvature <b>307</b>. This pressure decrease provides for an increased suctioning effect for the primary ambient air <b>103</b>, whereby the proportion of ambient air in gas flow <b>206</b> is further increased. The radius of the curved surface and the dimensions and position of the auxiliary gas port are chosen in accordance with the intensity of the auxiliary gas flow, such that this effect is optimally manifested. For a closer examination of this Coand&#x103; effect reference is made to a paper by Imants Reba in Scientific American, Vol. 214, June 1966, pages 84-92.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a variant of the gas burner of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, wherein the auxiliary gas port <b>402</b> not only connects to a wall part <b>407</b> of inlet device <b>107</b> with curved Coand&#x103; surface; but also has an opposite wall <b>403</b> with a curvature which follows substantially the curvature of Coand&#x103; wall <b>407</b>.
