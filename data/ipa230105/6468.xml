More specifically, the present invention is related to the wireless powering of devices with a power harvester.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As processor capabilities have expanded and power requirements have decreased there has been an ongoing explosion of devices that operate completely independent of wires or power cords. These &#x201c;untethered&#x201d; devices range from cell phones, and wireless keyboards to building sensors and active RFID tags.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Engineers and designers of these untethered devices continue to have to deal with the limitations of portable power sources, primarily batteries as the key design parameter. While performance of processors and portable devices have been doubling every 18-24 months driven by Moore's law, battery technology in terms of capacity has only been growing at measly 6% per year. Even with power conscious designs and the latest in battery technology, many devices do not provide the lifetime cost and maintenance requirements for applications that require a large number of untethered devices such as logistics, and building automation. Today's devices that need two-way communication require scheduled maintenance every three to 18 months to replace or recharge the device's power source (typically a battery). One-way devices simply broadcasting their status (one-way) such as automated utility meter readers have a better battery life, typically requiring replacement within 10 years. For both device types, scheduled power-source maintenance is costly and disruptive to the entire system that a device is intended to monitor and/or control. Unscheduled maintenance trips are even more costly and disruptive. On a macro level, the relatively high cost associated with the internal battery also reduces the practical, or economically viable, number of devices that can be deployed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The ideal solution to the power problem for untethered devices is a device or system that can collect and harness sufficient energy from the external environment. The harnessed energy would then either directly power an untethered device or augment a battery or other storage component. Directly powering an untethered device enables the device to be constructed without the need for a battery. Augmenting a storage component could be along two lines: 1) increasing the overall life of the device or 2) by providing more power to the device to increase the functionality of the device. The other parameters for an ideal solution is that the harnessing device could be used in a wide range of environments including harsh and sealed environments (e.g. nuclear reactors), would be inexpensive to produce, would be safe for humans, and would have a minimal effect on the basic size, weight and other physical characteristics of the untethered device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention pertains to an apparatus for an application. The apparatus comprises a core device preferably having an integrated circuit for the application. The apparatus comprises a power harvester (preferably a radio frequency (RF) energy harvester) connected to the core device to power the core device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention pertains to an apparatus for an application. The apparatus comprises a core device preferably having an integrated circuit for the application. The apparatus comprises means for receiving energy wirelessly and providing power from the energy to the core device to power the integrated circuit of the core device. The receiving means is connected to the core device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention pertains to a method for an application. The method comprises the steps of converting RF energy into usable energy. There is the step of preferably powering an integrated circuit of the core device with the usable energy.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This invention pertains to a technique that uses radio frequency (RF) energy as a source of energy to directly power a device or augment a power storage component in a device. The present invention meets the requirements described in the previous &#x201c;Background of the Invention&#x201d; section.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Traditional RF receiving devices have focused on maximizing selectivity of the frequency to isolate and to be coherent without interference from other sources. In contrast, while the present invention operates at a specific frequency or range of frequencies, the device accepts any interference to supplement the output power of the device. Also, the research related to power harvesting that uses RF energy as a source has primarily focused on devices in close proximity of the source (inductive or near-field energy). In most cases, prior research assumed a dedicated or directed source of RF to power the device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention should not be confused with power transfer by inductive coupling, which requires the device to be relatively close to the power transmission source. The RFID Handbook by the author Klaus Finkenzeller defines the inductive coupling region as distance between the transmitter and receiver of less than 0.16 times lambda where lambda is the wavelength of the RF wave. The invention can be implemented in the near field (sometimes referred to as inductive) region as well as the far-field region. The far-field region is distances greater than 0.16 times lambda.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is an object of this invention to provide a method and apparatus to</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">1. remotely energize an untethered device without using direct wiring</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">2. power or augment the life of the power storage component so it matches the life of the device and, ultimately, powers the off-grid device with or without the use of batteries</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">3. allow untethered devices to be virtually maintenance free</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">4. provide augmentation for other energy harvesting technologies (solar, piezoelectric, etc.)</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">5. provide backup power to tethered devices</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is a further object of this invention to directly power a device or augment a power storage component in a device in conjunction with other power harvesting technologies and storage elements.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">With this method and apparatus a device's power storage components do not require replacement, thus enabling the device to be permanently placed off-grid, where it may be physically impractical, costly, or dangerous (due to a harsh environment) to provide maintenance.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">For devices on-grid (tethered) or with reliable power sources, RF power

The antenna can be shared or standalone with respect to an antenna used for the device's wireless communication. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>54</b>-<b>56</b></figref> show a device that has an antenna A for use by the RF power harvester <b>20</b> and an antenna B used for wireless one-way or two-way communication. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>57</b>-<b>59</b></figref> show a device where the antenna is shared by both a device's communication module (within the core device <b>22</b> components) and the RF power harvester <b>20</b>.

The first type of energy exists as ambient RF energy. This type of RF surrounds us in our day-to-day lives and is usually generated to carry one way or two-way combinations of voice, video and data communications. The sources that the antenna can harvest from include, but are not limited to, medium-frequency AM radio broadcast, very-high-frequency (VHF) FM radio broadcast and television broadcast, ultra-high-frequency (UHF) broadcast, cellular base stations, wireless data access points, super-high-frequency (SHF) frequencies, and the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands. These sources cover transmission frequencies from 300 kHz to 30 GHz.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">The second type of energy available is directed RF energy.

It could be possible to use a rechargeable battery that obtains its charge from the primary supply when in operation. However, if the primary supply is lost for a time greater than the life of the rechargeable battery, the specification of uninterrupted power is not met.

(e.g., temperature sensors apply to Industrial and Building Automation and Appliances).</p><p id="p-0190" num="0230">To retrofit or redesign the devices listed, it is possible to implement the described systems in numerous ways. It may be advantageous to leave the device design as-is including the existing power supply. As an example, a device may use non-rechargeable batteries to operate. The device will most likely have a protection circuit to prevent damage if the batteries are installed incorrectly. The protection mechanism is commonly a diode inline with the positive terminal of the battery. In this case, the RF power harvester <b>20</b> with or without the alternative power source <b>24</b> could be inserted, with an antenna, into the device. The power generated by the RF power harvester <b>20</b> (and the alternative power source <b>24</b>, if applicable) could be connected to the device after the protection mechanism described to avoid potential charging of a non-rechargeable battery.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0231">Another way to configure the device's power system is to replace the non-rechargeable batteries with rechargeable batteries. In this instance, the output from the RF power harvester <b>20</b> (and alternative power source <b>24</b>) could be connected to either side of the protections device. If the connection is before the protection mechanism, the RF power harvester <b>20</b> (and the alternative power source <b>24</b>, if applicable) will recharge the battery and supply power to the device. If the connection is after the protection mechanism, the RF power harvester <b>20</b> (and the alternative power source <b>24</b>, if applicable) will supply power to the device and the battery will supply any extra power needed that could not be supplied by the RF power harvester <b>20</b> (and the alternative power source <b>24</b>, if applicable). It should be noted that the protection device in this case is not needed for proper operation. Its only function would be to protect the batteries from being installed incorrectly. An antenna could be contained inside or placed on the outside of the device.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0232">Another configuration of the device's power system is to remove the existing batteries and install the RF power harvester <b>20</b> (and the alternative power source <b>24</b>) in the enclosure provided for the batteries. An antenna could be contained inside or placed on the outside of the device.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0233">Yet another method of configuring the device's power system would be to reduce the number of batteries and replace them with the RF power harvester <b>20</b> (and the alternative power source <b>24</b>). In this case, the output from the system would be connected to the batteries in series or parallel depending on the original battery configuration. An antenna could be contained inside or placed on the outside of the device.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0234">An additional option, would be to completely redesign the product and integrate the required circuitry and storage components into the device. This method is probably the most advantageous because it can fully take advantage of the benefits offered by the RF power harvester <b>20</b> (and the alternative power source <b>24</b>). An antenna could be contained inside or placed on the outside of the device.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0235">If the RF power harvester <b>20</b> (and the alternative power source <b>24</b>) is used as a backup to the primary power supply, a switch could be implemented into the system in order to switch the RF power harvester <b>20</b> (and the alternative power source <b>24</b>) on when the primary source is lost. In this case, an antenna could be contained inside or placed on the outside of the device.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0236">To show the flexibility of RF energy harvesting, several products were retrofitted to include an RF power harvester <b>20</b> (energy harvesting circuitry). These products include a wireless keyboard, a wall clock, and a desk calculator.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0237">The wireless keyboard is an example of recharging and augmenting a battery to supply power to a device. This system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The output from the regulation circuitry recharges the battery and supplies power to the keyboard. The battery is also used to supply power to the keyboard. The keyboard also includes a separate antenna for receiving power and for data communications. The antenna configuration can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0238">The wall clock is an example of a direct powering system. The wall clock was retrofitted to include an RF power harvester <b>20</b> and the internal AA battery was removed. This system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The wall clock did not need regulation, but did require a capacitor for storage to supply the pulse of power to move the second hand.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0239">The calculator is an example of using RF energy harvesting with another energy harvesting technology. The calculator had an internal 1.5V coin cell battery and a small solar panel. The internal battery was removed, however, the solar panel was left intact. This system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b></figref>. In this system, the calculator can receive power from both the solar panel and the RF power harvester <b>20</b> to eliminate the need for a battery.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0240">As an additional example, an RF power harvester <b>20</b> (energy harvesting circuit) similar to the ones shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,615,074 (FIGS. 8, 9, 12a, 12b, 13, 14), was connected in series with a 0.5V solar cell. Individually, the solar cell was able to provide 0.480V to a 10 kilo-ohm resistor, which was being used to simulate the core device <b>22</b> components. This corresponds to 23 microwatts. The RF power harvesting circuit by itself was able to provide 2.093V across the 10 kilo-ohm resistor when being supplied by 1 milliwatt of RF power. This corresponds to 438 microwatts. The two circuit outputs were then combined in series by connecting the output from the RF energy harvesting circuit to the ground of the solar cell. The output of the solar cell was then connected to the resistor. The other end of the resistor was connected to the ground of the RF energy harvesting circuit. The voltage across the resistor with the circuits connected as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>63</b></figref> was 2.445V. This corresponds to 598 microwatts.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0241">As can be seen, the combination of the two technologies produces a result higher than the addition of the individual powers. From this, it can be determined that the two technologies can cooperate in a way that produces favorable results.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0242">In the example given, the solar cell produces current to supply the load and helps to bias the RF rectifying diodes, which allows the RF energy harvesting circuit to operate a higher efficiency. The solar cell also changes the impedance seen by the RF energy harvesting circuit, which produces a beneficial result. To be more specific, when examining the power output of the individual circuit (solar and RF power harvesting), the sum of the power captured by the individual circuits was 23 &#x3bc;W+438 &#x3bc;W=461 &#x3bc;W. However, when the two circuits are combined and are allowed to work in conjunction with one another, the output power becomes 598 &#x3bc;W. This result shows that combining the two power-harvesting technologies produces a 30 percent increase in the output power for this example. This same technique can be applied to multiple energy harvesting technologies to produce even greater output power. The equations for this example are shown below.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0243">Individual Circuits</p><p id="p-0204" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P</i><sub>1</sub><i>=P</i><sub>1</sub><i>+P</i><sub>2</sub><i>+ . . . +P</i><sub>N </sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0205" num="0244">Combined Circuits</p><p id="p-0206" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P</i><sub>C</sub><i>&#x3e;P</i><sub>I</sub><i>=P</i><sub>1</sub><i>+P</i><sub>2</sub><i>+ . . . +P</i><sub>N </sub><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?><ul id="ul0029" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0029-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0030" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0030-0001" num="0245">where P<sub>I </sub>is the sum of the individual output powers        <ul id="ul0031" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0031-0001" num="0246">P<sub>C </sub>is the output of the combined circuit</li>            <li id="ul0031-0002" num="0247">P<sub>1 </sub>is the output power from the first power harvesting technology</li>            <li id="ul0031-0003" num="0248">P<sub>2 </sub>is the output power from the second power harvesting technology</li>            <li id="ul0031-0004" num="0249">P<sub>N </sub>is the output power from the N<sup>th </sup>power harvesting technology</li>            <li id="ul0031-0005" num="0250">N is the number of power harvesting technologies or circuits.</li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0207" num="0251">As can be seen by the previous examples, RF energy harvesting can be used alone or in conjunction with alternative power sources to power a wide range of devices.
