In some applications, the completion equipment may comprise alternate path systems which facilitate gravel packing of the annulus between the completion equipment and the surrounding wellbore wall. The gravel packing is used to establish a gravel pack sufficient to filter out particulates from the well fluid as it flows from the reservoir, into the wellbore, and into the completion equipment for production to a desired collection location. Installation of the gravel pack may occur along a number of well zones which are isolated via packers positioned along the completion equipment at a desired spacing.

However, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the system and/or methodology may be practiced without these details and that numerous variations or modifications from the described embodiments may be possible.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The disclosure herein generally involves a system and methodology which facilitate improved actuation and use of packers. According to an embodiment, a packer or packers may be disposed along completion equipment of a well string to provide seals along a borehole, e.g. a wellbore, at desired locations. The packers are constructed as swellable packers which have a mixed element swellable section to enable the desired swelling and sealing when exposed to different types of fluids.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, each packer may comprise a packer frame and a plurality of swellable elements formed of materials which swell in different types of fluids. The plurality of swellable elements may comprise two swellable elements or a greater number of swellable elements. By way of example, the mixed swellable elements may comprise a first swellable element mounted on the packer frame and swellable in a first type of fluid. In this example, a second swellable element also may be mounted on the packer frame at a position proximate the first swellable element and swellable in a second type of fluid which is different from the first type of fluid. For example, the first swellable element may swell in the presence of water while the second swellable element swells in the presence of oil. However, the swellable elements may be selected to undergo the desired swelling and sealing along the wellbore when exposed to other types of fluids. Additionally, a portion of an alternate path system may extend through the swellable elements to facilitate a gravel packing operation.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The individual packers may be constructed in a variety of sizes and configurations depending on the parameters of a given application. By way of example, the swellable elements may be placed adjacent to each other to form the desired mixed element structure and then molded and bonded over shunt tubes of an alternate path system. The mixed element structure provides a user flexibility with respect to use of a variety of fluids, e.g. hydrocarbon or water-based fluids, to achieve the desired swelling in a single shunted packer. Swelling of a single element when reacting with the corresponding fluid is sufficient to swell the packer to the maximum outside diameter so as to form sufficient contact and sealing against the surrounding borehole wall, thus providing the desired mechanical integrity and pressure barrier along the borehole, e.g. wellbore. Depending on the application, the packer may be used to form a seal against casing, against an open hole wall, or against another type of surrounding borehole wall.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The sequence and arrangement of the swellable elements, e.g. two or more swellable elements, may vary and can be selected according to the type of well and the type of naturally occurring or pumped down fluids available in a given operation. In some operations, naturally occurring fluids may be used to provide the desired swelling of the swellable element or elements. In other operations, however, selected fluids may be circulated downhole and into contact with the swellable elements to achieve the desired swelling of at least one of the swellable elements. Additionally, the swellable elements may be formed from suitable elastomers or other swellable materials. The swellable elements may be solid and continuous body type elements; solid and continuous incised body type elements; incised or segmented body type elements; or other suitable constructions.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">When fully swelled, the outside diameter of an individual swellable element is able to act as a mechanical barrier for diverting fluid and gravel pack slurry through, for example, shunt tubes. The individual swelled element also can serve as a pressure barrier to provide zonal isolation between adjacent well zones along the wellbore to prevent unwanted communication and co-mingling of fluids between zones. In some applications, gravel packing may be performed through alternate path systems, e.g. through shunt tubes, after swelling of the desired swellable packers. In other applications, however, the gravel packing operation may be performed first while leaving the desired swellable packers to swell to their target outside diameters once exposed to certain fluids following the gravel packing operation.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an example of a well string <b>20</b> is illustrated as deployed in a borehole <b>22</b>, e.g. a wellbore. In this example, the well string <b>20</b> comprises a completion system <b>24</b> disposed downhole in borehole <b>22</b> for use in gravel packing operations, production operations, and/or other well related operations. The completion system <b>24</b> may comprise a variety of downhole components, including production tubing <b>26</b>, an alternate path system <b>28</b> deployed along the production tubing <b>26</b>, and a plurality of swellable packers <b>30</b> spaced along the production tubing <b>26</b>. It should be noted the completion system <b>24</b> may comprise a wide variety of additional or other components to facilitate the desired downhole operations. For example, the completion system <b>24</b> may comprise screens, filters, inflow control devices, shrouds, sensors, and various other types of components. Many of these components are selected and arranged to facilitate production of a desired well fluid, e.g. oil and/or gas, from a surrounding formation <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The production tubing <b>26</b> may be formed from a plurality of base pipe joints <b>34</b> connected by suitable couplers <b>36</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>). The alternate path system <b>28</b> may be routed along the production tubing <b>26</b> and through the swellable packers <b>30</b> so as to ensure uniform gravel packing in the well zones disposed along the wellbore <b>22</b>. As illustrated, various gravel packing techniques may be used to establish a gravel pack <b>38</b> disposed in an annulus <b>40</b> between the completion system <b>24</b> and a surrounding wall <b>42</b> forming wellbore <b>22</b>. Depending on the well application, the surrounding wall <b>42</b> may be, for example, the interior of well casing or the open wellbore wall formed during drilling of the wellbore.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the swellable packers <b>30</b> are illustrated as swelled to their enlarged, target outside diameter. In this swelled state, each swellable packer <b>30</b> establishes a firm, sealing engagement with the surrounding wellbore wall <b>42</b> so as to create a desired mechanical and/or pressure barrier between well zones/regions along the wellbore <b>22</b>, e.g. along annulus <b>40</b>. As described in greater detail below, the swellable packers <b>30</b> may comprise mixed elements which individually expand in the presence of a predetermined fluid to provide the desired engagement with the surrounding wellbore wall <b>42</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, three swellable packers <b>30</b> are illustrated however the completion system <b>24</b> may comprise various numbers of swellable packers <b>30</b>, including a single swellable packer <b>30</b>, two swellable packers <b>30</b>, or three or more swellable packers <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an example of one of the swellable packers <b>30</b> is illustrated. In this example, the swellable packer <b>30</b> comprises a packer frame <b>44</b> disposed about the production tubing <b>26</b>. The packer frame <b>44</b> may have a variety of configurations for supporting a mixed swellable element system <b>46</b>. According to the embodiment illustrated, the packer frame <b>44</b> comprises end rings <b>48</b> having openings <b>50</b> to receive the alternate path system <b>28</b> therethrough. For example, the alternate path system <b>28</b> may comprise shunt tubes <b>52</b> for carrying gravel slurry to desired gravel packing regions along the wellbore <b>22</b>. The shunt tube or tubes <b>52</b> may be routed through the openings <b>50</b> of end rings <b>48</b> along the exterior of production tubing <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">By way of example, the mixed swellable element system <b>46</b> may comprise a plurality of swellable elements <b>54</b> which are located longitudinally between the end rings <b>48</b> and over the shunt tubes <b>52</b>. In some embodiments, the swellable elements <b>54</b> are swellable elastomeric elements which may be wrapped around the shunt tubes <b>52</b> and the production tubing <b>26</b> and then cured and bonded in place. However, a variety of mounting techniques may be used for mounting the swellable elements <b>54</b> at the desired position relative to packer frame <b>44</b>. The swellable elements <b>54</b> are unique elements that may be positioned proximate to each other, e.g. contiguous with each other between the end rings <b>48</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The specific material of individual swellable elements <b>54</b> is selected to uniquely respond based on its exposure to a specific fluid or fluids. The combination of different individual swellable elements <b>54</b> in a single packer <b>30</b> enables swelling in response to exposure to different fluids. For example, an individual swellable element (or elements) <b>54</b> may swell in the presence of water while another individual swellable element (or elements) <b>54</b> of the same swellable packer <b>30</b> swells in the presence of a different fluid such as oil.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be noted that swelling in the presence of water is intended to mean swelling in the presence of water-based fluids and such fluids may include constituents other than simply water. For example, the water may include salts, acids, minerals, other treatment chemicals, or other constituents that do not prevent water induced swelling of the corresponding swellable element(s) <b>54</b>. Similarly, swelling in the presence of oil is intended to mean swelling in the presence of oil-based fluids and such fluids may include constituents other than simply oil. For example, the oil may include gases and other constituents that do not prevent oil induced swelling of the corresponding swellable element(s) <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The number of swellable elements <b>54</b> in a given packer <b>30</b> may vary. For purposes of explanation, the packer <b>30</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> comprises two swellable elements <b>54</b> positioned adjacent each other between end rings <b>48</b> of packer frame <b>44</b>. The two swellable elements <b>54</b> comprise a first swellable element <b>56</b> which swells in the presence of a first fluid, e.g. water, and a second swellable element <b>58</b> which swells in the presence of a second fluid, e.g. oil. Accordingly, the second swellable element <b>58</b> swells in the presence of a different type of fluid than the fluid which causes swelling of the first swellable element <b>56</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">However, the swelling of either of the swellable elements <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> is sufficient to create a seal with the surrounding wellbore wall <b>42</b> which has the desired mechanical and pressure integrity. As a result, each swellable packer <b>30</b> ensures creation of the desired barrier in the presence of different types of fluids and thus enhances the reliability of completion system <b>24</b> during a given operation.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the example illustrated, the unique fluids are in the form of water and oil for causing swelling of swellable elements <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, respectively. However, the materials used to form the different swellable elements <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> may be selected to respond to a variety of different types of fluid. In some embodiments, individual swellable elements <b>54</b> may be selected to swell in response to various treatment chemicals pumped downhole to facilitate, for example, a gravel packing operation and/or production operation.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Many types of materials are swellable in the presence of water and may be used to form swellable element <b>56</b> in at least some downhole applications. Examples of such materials include elastomeric materials such as tetrafluoroethylene/propylene copolymer (TFE/P), vinyl acetate/acrylate copolymer, carboxymethylcellulose type polymer, isobutylene/maleic anhydride copolymer, and a variety of other elastomeric materials which may be selected according to the parameters of a given well application. Other examples may include various composite materials or non-elastomeric materials such as swelling clay material.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Similarly, there are many types of materials which are swellable in the presence of oil and may be used to form swellable element <b>58</b> in at least some downhole applications. Examples of such materials include chlorinated butyl rubber, polyurethane rubber, butyl rubber, various silicone rubbers, and a variety of other oil-swellable rubbers, sulfonated polyethylene, ethylene/propylene/diene terpolymer, and a variety of other materials. Additionally, various combinations of these materials and other composite and/or non-elastomeric materials may sufficiently swell in the presence of oil and have sufficient sealing and structural characteristics to form swellable element <b>58</b>. Various materials which swell when placed in contact with other types of fluids also may be used in the construction of swellable element <b>56</b> and/or swellable element <b>58</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the arrangement of first and second swellable elements <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> may be reversed or otherwise changed. Some embodiments may utilize additional materials which respond to additional types of unique fluids. Furthermore, some embodiments may utilize greater numbers of the swellable elements <b>54</b> to ensure the desired contact and sealing with the surrounding wall <b>42</b>. In the examples illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, each swellable element <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> has sufficient length to establish the desired seal with the desired mechanical and pressure integrity along annulus <b>40</b>. In some environments, the longitudinal length of each swellable element <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> may be 5 feet or more.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an operational example is illustrated via a flow chart. In this example, the well application involves use of alternate path system <b>28</b> to establish a gravel pack along completion system <b>26</b> deployed in wellbore <b>22</b>. Initially, the number of zones or sections of the wellbore <b>22</b> and the fluid types that will be encountered or utilized in the operation may be determined. This enables selection of the number of swell packers <b>30</b> and the types of swell elements <b>54</b> to be utilized. Because each swell packer <b>30</b> employs a mixture of the swell elements <b>54</b>, the successful swelling/expansion of the swell packers <b>30</b> can be assured even when there is less specific knowledge with respect to the fluids that will be entering wellbore <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As illustrated, the completion system <b>26</b> is initially assembled with the desired components which may include a variety of bottom hole assemblies, alternate path system <b>28</b>, and the desired number of swellable packers <b>30</b>, as indicated by block <b>60</b>. The packers <b>30</b> are constructed with the appropriate swellable elements <b>54</b> and internal shunt tubes <b>52</b>. The completion system <b>26</b> is then deployed downhole into wellbore <b>22</b> via a workstring, as indicated by block <b>62</b>. Subsequently, a suitable space out procedure may be implemented to help set the completion system <b>26</b> at a target depth in the wellbore <b>22</b>, as indicated by block <b>64</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Once the completion system <b>26</b> is properly positioned, pre-gravel pack preparations may be performed, as indicated by block <b>66</b>. This allows the gravel pack treatment/installation to be performed to establish the desired gravel pack <b>38</b>, as indicated by block <b>68</b>. In some applications, an optional filter cake breaker may be pumped downhole to remove filter cake, as indicated by block <b>70</b>. At this stage, the workstring may be released and pulled out of hole, as indicated by block <b>72</b>. The completion system <b>26</b> with the shunted swellable packers <b>30</b> remains downhole to allow exposure of the swellable elements <b>54</b> to fluids which will cause one or more of the swellable elements <b>54</b> to swell and expand into sealing contact with the surrounding wellbore wall <b>42</b>, as indicated by block <b>74</b>. Because individual swellable elements <b>54</b> uniquely respond to different fluids, e.g. oil or water, at least one of the swellable elements <b>54</b> is assured of expanding into the desired sealing contact.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, another operational example is illustrated via a flow chart. In this example, the well application again involves use of alternate path system <b>28</b> to establish a gravel pack along completion system <b>26</b> deployed in wellbore <b>22</b>. Initially, the number of zones or sections of the wellbore <b>22</b> are determined and the types of swelling fluid to be circulated and displaced into the well (or encountered in the well) for a given operation also may be determined. This determination enables selection of the number of swell packers <b>30</b> and the types of swell elements <b>54</b> to be utilized. Because each swell packer <b>30</b> utilizes a mixture of the swell elements <b>54</b>, the successful swelling/expansion of the swell packers <b>30</b> can be assured even when there are different types of fluids that may be used to cause the desired swelling.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As illustrated, the completion system <b>26</b> is initially assembled with the desired components which may include a variety of bottom hole assemblies, alternate path system <b>28</b>, and the desired number of swellable packers <b>30</b>, as indicated by block <b>76</b>.

The completion system <b>26</b> is then deployed downhole into wellbore <b>22</b> via a workstring, as indicated by block <b>78</b>. Subsequently, a suitable space out procedure may be implemented to help set the completion system <b>26</b> at a target depth in the wellbore <b>22</b>, as indicated by block <b>80</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Once the completion system <b>26</b> is properly positioned, at least one of the appropriate swelling fluids may be pumped or otherwise delivered downhole to, for example, spot swell the desired swellable packers <b>30</b>, as indicated by block <b>82</b>. Sufficient time is provided to enable sufficient swelling of the packer elements <b>54</b> so as to achieve the desired mechanical barrier and/or pressure isolation function of the subject swellable packers <b>30</b>. Subsequently, pre-gravel pack preparations may be performed, as indicated by block <b>84</b>. This allows the gravel pack treatment/installation to be performed to establish the desired gravel pack <b>38</b>, as indicated by block <b>86</b>. In some applications, an optional filter cake breaker may be pumped downhole to remove filter cake, as indicated by block <b>88</b>. At this stage, the workstring may be released and pulled out of hole, as indicated by block <b>90</b>. The completion system <b>26</b> with the shunted swellable packers <b>30</b> remains downhole to facilitate subsequent production operations.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Depending on the parameters of a given operation and the environment in which such operation is conducted, the number of swellable packers <b>30</b> utilized along the wellbore/borehole <b>22</b> may vary substantially. Additionally, the number and arrangement of swellable elements <b>54</b> on each packer <b>30</b> may vary and may be selected to swell in the presence of a variety of dissimilar fluids. The type of packer frame <b>44</b> and the techniques for mounting both the alternate path components as well as the swellable elements <b>54</b> about the packer frame <b>44</b> may vary. In some embodiments, the swellable elements <b>54</b> may be connected or otherwise placed in contact with each other. In other embodiments, however, the swellable elements <b>54</b> may be uniquely positioned along each individual swellable packer <b>30</b>. Similarly, the completion system <b>26</b> may have a wide range of configurations and components to help achieve desired gravel packing operations, production operations, and/or other downhole operations.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Although a few embodiments of the disclosure have been described in detail above, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible without materially departing from the teachings of this disclosure.
