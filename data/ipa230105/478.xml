There are many soft tissue surgical procedures, such as about the shoulder or hip, that require such an open or mini-open technique, as opposed to an arthroscopic technique. These open or mini-open procedures require expensive resources, including but not limited to additional staff surgeons and assistants to hold the various retraction and/or surgical instruments.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Unfortunately, such additional staff is costly and can provide inconsistent medical support (e.g., holding tissues in one or more retracted positions). Accordingly, there is a need for an effective and efficient retractor holding device to overcome the drawbacks associated with prior art retractor holders and techniques.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It should be noted that this Background is not intended to be an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter nor be viewed as limiting the claimed subject matter to implementations that solve any or all of the disadvantages or problems presented above.

The method includes inserting a first annular hub of a left support frame arm into a first bore of a support body. The first bore extends transversely through the support body from a first side of the support body to a second side of the support body opposite the first side. The method includes fixing the left support frame arm in a desired orientation with respect to the support body by disposing a first retaining pin of a first spring-biased locking mechanism of the support body down into the first bore such that the first retaining pin is received into one of a first annular series of detents disposed in the first annular hub of the left support frame arm. The method includes inserting a second annular hub of a right support frame arm into a second bore of the support body. The second bore extends transversely through the support body from the second side to the first side. The method includes fixing the right support frame arm in a desired orientation with respect to the support body by disposing a second retaining pin of a second spring-biased locking mechanism of the support body down into the second bore such that the second retaining pin is received into one of a second annular series of detents disposed in the second annular hub of the right support frame arm.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some other embodiments, a method of manufacturing a retractor holding frame is provided.

The teachings disclosure may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to any specific structure or function presented throughout this disclosure. Rather, these aspects are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those skilled in the art. Based on the teachings herein one skilled in the art should appreciate that the scope of the disclosure is intended to cover any aspect of the novel systems, apparatuses, and methods disclosed herein, whether implemented independently of or combined with any other aspect of the disclosure. For example, a system or an apparatus may be implemented, or a method may be practiced using any one or more of the aspects set forth herein. In addition, the scope of the disclosure is intended to cover such a system, apparatus or method which is practiced using other structure, functionality, or structure and functionality in addition to or other than the various aspects of the disclosure set forth herein. It should be understood that any aspect disclosed herein may be set forth in one or more elements of a claim. Although some benefits and advantages of the preferred aspects are mentioned, the scope of the disclosure is not intended to be limited to particular benefits, uses, or objectives. The detailed description and drawings are merely illustrative of the disclosure rather than limiting, the scope of the disclosure being defined by the appended claims and equivalents thereof.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">With respect to the use of plural vs. singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or application. The various singular/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">When describing an absolute value of a characteristic or property of a thing or act described herein, the terms &#x201c;substantial,&#x201d; &#x201c;substantially,&#x201d; &#x201c;essentially,&#x201d; &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; and/or other terms or phrases of degree may be used without the specific recitation of a numerical range. When applied to a characteristic or property of a thing or act described herein, these terms refer to a range of the characteristic or property that is consistent with providing a desired function associated with that characteristic or property.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In those cases where a single numerical value is given for a characteristic or property, it is intended to be interpreted as at least covering deviations of that value within one significant digit of the numerical value given.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">If a numerical value or range of numerical values is provided to define a characteristic or property of a thing or act described herein, whether or not the value or range is qualified with a term of degree, a specific method of measuring the characteristic or property may be defined herein as well. In the event no specific method of measuring the characteristic or property is defined herein, and there are different generally accepted methods of measurement for the characteristic or property, then the measurement method should be interpreted as the method of measurement that would most likely be adopted by one of ordinary skill in the art given the description and context of the characteristic or property. In the further event there is more than one method of measurement that is equally likely to be adopted by one of ordinary skill in the art to measure the characteristic or property, the value or range of values should be interpreted as being met regardless of which method of measurement is chosen.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">It will be understood by those within the art that terms used herein, and especially in the appended claims (e.g., bodies of the appended claims) are intended as &#x201c;open&#x201d; terms unless specifically indicated otherwise (e.g., the term &#x201c;including&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;including but not limited to,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;having&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;having at least,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;includes&#x201d; should be interpreted as &#x201c;includes but is not limited to,&#x201d; etc.).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; or &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and indefinite articles such as &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; (e.g., &#x201c;a&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;an&#x201d; should typically be interpreted to mean &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; or &#x201c;one or more&#x201d;); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of &#x201c;two recitations,&#x201d; without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In those instances where a convention analogous to &#x201c;at least one of A, B, and C&#x201d; is used, such a construction would include systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together without C, A and C together without B, B and C together without A, as well as A, B, and C together. It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase &#x201c;A or B&#x201d; will be understood to include A without B, B without A, as well as A and B together.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Various modifications to the implementations described in this disclosure can be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and generic principles defined herein can be applied to other implementations without departing from the spirit or scope of this disclosure. Thus, the disclosure is not intended to be limited to the implementations shown herein but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the claims, the principles and the novel features disclosed herein. The word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used exclusively herein to mean &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any implementation described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Certain features that are described in this specification in the context of separate implementations also can be implemented in combination in a single implementation. Conversely, various features that are described in the context of a single implementation also can be implemented in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable sub-combination. Moreover, although features can be described above as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination can be directed to a sub-combination or variation of a sub-combination.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Any methods disclosed herein comprise one or more steps or actions for achieving the described method. The method steps and/or actions may be interchanged with one another without departing from the scope of the claims. In other words, unless a specific order of steps or actions is specified, the order and/or use of specific steps and/or actions may be modified without departing from the scope of the claims.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Disclosure of Several Example Embodiments</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present disclosure describes a retractor holding frame <b>10</b> attached or attachable to the side of a surgical table with an adjustable support arm.
