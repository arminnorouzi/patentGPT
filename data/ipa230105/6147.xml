In particular, from the viewpoint of environmental and energy problems, photoelectric conversion elements (solar cells) utilizing sunlight that is an inexhaustible clean energy attract attention.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Since general silicon solar cells utilize ultra-high purity silicon and are manufactured by &#x201c;dry process&#x201d; such as epitaxial crystal growth under high vacuum, it is not possible to expect a large cost reduction. Therefore, a solar cell manufactured by a &#x201c;wet process&#x201d; such as a coating process is expected as a low-cost next generation solar cell.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A quantum dot solar cell is a next-generation solar cell that can be manufactured by the &#x201c;wet process&#x201d;. The quantum dot is an inorganic nanoparticle having a particle size of about 20 nm or less and a crystal structure, and exhibits physical properties different from those of bulk bodies due to the expression of quantum size effect. For example, it is known that the band gap energy increases (shortening of the absorption wavelength) as the particle size of quantum dots decreases, and lead sulfide (PbS) quantum dots having a particle size of about 3 nm and a band gap energy of about 1.2 eV have been reported for use in quantum dot solar cells (ACS Nano 2014, 8, 614-622). A quantum dot solar cell, typical examples thereof including PbS or PbSe quantum dot, can attain photoelectric conversion in a near-infrared light region (800 to 2500 nm). However, the band gap energy thereof is small so that the solar cell cannot gain a high voltage to be low in conversion efficiency.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a perovskite solar cell as the most promising candidate for the next generation solar cell, which has been recently reported to show a rapid increase in photoelectric conversion efficiency. This perovskite solar cell is provided with a photoelectric conversion element using a perovskite compound (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>) composed of a cation (such as methyl ammonium) and a halogenated metal salt (such as lead iodide) for the light absorption layer (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 6050-6051). The perovskite solar cell can attain photoelectric conversion in a visible light region (400 to 800 nm) and shows a relatively high conversion efficiency. However, the perovskite solar cell cannot utilize a near-infrared light region to be insufficient in effective utilization of sunlight.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In recent years, A quantum dot solar cell has been reported which make use of PbS quantum dots surface-treated with a perovskite compound (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>) in a light absorption layer (Nano Lett. 2015, 15, 7539-7543). However, the perovskite compound is small in quantity so that the compound hardly contributes to power generation. Thus, the solar cell is insufficient in conversion efficiency.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, there has been proposed a light absorption layer for forming a photoelectric conversion element and a solar cell which can attain photoelectric conversion in both a visible light region and a near-infrared light region and which are high in conversion efficiency, the light absorption layer containing a perovskite compound and a quantum dot containing a Cl element (WO 2018/163325).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, there has been proposed a light absorption layer for forming a photoelectric conversion element and a solar cell which can attain photoelectric conversion in both a visible light region and a near-infrared light region and which are high in conversion efficiency, the light absorption layer containing a perovskite compound and a quantum dot containing a halogen element and an organic ligand, wherein a molar ratio of the organic ligand to a metal element constituting the quantum dot is 0.01 or more and 0.4 or less (WO 2018/163327).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of a solar cell using a light absorption layer containing a perovskite compound and a quantum dot, it is necessary to improve the quantum yield. Examples of the method for improving the quantum yield include a method of filling the light absorption layer with quantum dot at a high density. However, when the content of the quantum dot in the light absorption layer is increased, a large number of voids are generated in the light absorption layer accordingly, or the coverage of the light absorption layer is reduced, resulting in a problem that the quantum yield is reduced.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention relates to a light absorption layer for forming a photoelectric conversion element and a solar cell excellent in photoelectric conversion efficiency, and a photoelectric conversion element and a solar cell having the light absorption layer. The present invention also relates to a method for manufacturing a light absorption layer having few voids.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present inventor has found that a light absorption layer comprising a perovskite compound and a quantum dot containing an aliphatic amino acid has few voids, and the photoelectric conversion efficiency of a solar cell is improved by using the light absorption layer.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">That is, the present invention is related to a light absorption layer comprising a perovskite compound, and a quantum dot containing an aliphatic amino acid.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, the present invention is related to a dispersion comprising:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">a perovskite compound or a precursor thereof; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">a quantum dot containing an aliphatic amino acid.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Moreover, the present invention is related to a method for manufacturing a light absorption layer in which a quantum dot containing an aliphatic amino acid is dispersed in a matrix of a perovskite compound, the method comprising following steps 1, 2, and 3:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">(step 1) a step of exchanging the organic ligand of the quantum dot containing the organic ligand with an aliphatic amino acid to obtain a quantum dot solid containing an aliphatic amino acid as a ligand;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">(step 2) a step of mixing the quantum dot solid obtained in step 1 with a solution or a mixed liquid containing one or more types of substances selected from a perovskite compound and a precursor thereof to obtain a dispersion; and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">(step 3) a step of obtaining a light absorption layer from the dispersion obtained in step 2.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The use of the perovskite compound and the quantum dot containing an aliphatic amino acid as a material for forming the light absorption layer makes it possible to absorb light in a wide wavelength region including not only light in a short wavelength region, which can be absorbed by the perovskite compound, but also light in a long wavelength region such as a near-infrared light region, which can be absorbed by the quantum dot. This makes is possible to obtain a photoelectric conversion element having a photoelectric conversion function in a wide wavelength region.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition, as compared with the case of using the conventional quantum dot, when the quantum dot containing an aliphatic amino acid is used, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the light absorption layer (composite film) containing the perovskite compound and the quantum dot is improved. The reason thereof is not clear, but is presumed as follows.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">An amino group as a polar group present on a surface of the quantum dot interacts with a polar solvent (for example, N,N-dimethylformamide) in a dispersion for manufacturing a light absorption layer. This interaction improves compatibility between the quantum dot and the polar solvent and prevents aggregation of the quantum dots due to electrostatic repulsion between the amino groups, thereby improving the dispersibility of the quantum dot in the dispersion. As a result, a light absorption layer having few voids, and further a light absorption layer having fewer voids, high crystallinity of the perovskite compound (large crystallite diameter), and high coverage can be obtained. Thus, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the light absorption layer is improved.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Therefore, when the light absorption layer of the present invention is used, a photoelectric conversion element and a solar cell excellent in photoelectric conversion efficiency can be obtained.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view showing an example of the structure of a photoelectric conversion element of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional SEM image of a light absorption layer prepared in Example 2.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional SEM image of a light absorption layer prepared in Comparative Example 1.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic view illustrating a solid in which a quantum dot and a perovskite compound are combined in the light absorption layer prepared in Example 2.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic view illustrating a solid in which a quantum dot and a perovskite compound are combined and voids in the solid in the light absorption layer prepared in Comparative Example 1.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">&#x3c;Light Absorption Layer&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The light absorption layer of the present invention includes, as a light absorption agent, a perovskite compound, and a quantum dot containing an aliphatic amino acid.

The intermediate band is formed, for example, by regularly arranging quantum dots in a matrix of the perovskite compound at a high density. When the intermediate band is present in the band gap of the perovskite compound, for example, two-step photon absorption occurs in which an electron photoexcited from the valence band of the perovskite compound to the intermediate band is further photoexcited from the intermediate band to the conduction band of the perovskite compound.
