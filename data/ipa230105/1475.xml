id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A chiral structure refers to a structure having an asymmetrical form which does not have mirror image symmetry. In a chiral structure, as an electric dipole and a magnetic dipole, generated by incident electromagnetic waves, interact with each other in the same direction, degeneracy of right polarization and left polarization may be broken. Thus, a chiral structure may have different refractive indices for right polarized light and left polarized light. Accordingly, when linear polarized light is incident to a chiral material, optical activity in which a polarized state rotates may appear. A chiral structure may be used in a variety of fields of optical materials and catalysts using such optical activity properties.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading
