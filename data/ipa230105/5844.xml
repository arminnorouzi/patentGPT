2021-109982, filed on Jul. 1, 2021, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a semiconductor device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the related art, there is disclosed an example of a semiconductor device including a first lead including a first pad having a pad main surface, a semiconductor element mounted on the pad main surface, and a sealing resin that is in contact with the pad main surface and covers the semiconductor element. The semiconductor element is conductively bonded to the first pad via a bonding layer. The semiconductor device further includes a second lead including a second pad and a wire (first bonding wire) conductively bonded to the semiconductor element and the second pad. The second pad and the wire are covered with the sealing resin. As a result, in the semiconductor device, the semiconductor element and members related to a conduction path of the semiconductor element are protected from external factors by the sealing resin.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the manufacture of the semiconductor device disclosed in the related art, in a case where the semiconductor element is bonded to the first pad via the bonding layer, when the bonding layer melted by reflow becomes excessively wet and spreads, a position deviation of the semiconductor element with respect to the pad main surface becomes relatively large. In this case, when the wire is conductively bonded to the semiconductor element in the manufacture of the semiconductor device, a length of the wire may become excessive. Further, the melted bonding layer may overcome the first pad to reach the second pad. In this case, a short-circuit occurs between the first lead and the second lead. Therefore, it is required to suppress excessive wetting and spreading of the bonding layer.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some embodiments of the present disclosure provide a semiconductor device capable of suppressing excessive wetting and spreading of a bonding layer interposed between a support member and a semiconductor element.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one embodiment of the present disclosure, there is provided a semiconductor device including: a support member including a main surface facing a thickness direction; a

that protrudes from the main surface, and wherein the first protrusion surrounds the semiconductor element when viewed in the thickness direction.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other features and

The conductive member <b>40</b> is conductively bonded to the second main surface <b>211</b> of the terminal <b>20</b> via the second bonding layer <b>49</b>. A portion of the second main surface <b>211</b> to which the second bonding layer <b>49</b> is in contact is surrounded by the plurality of grooves <b>23</b> recessed from the second main surface <b>211</b>. As a result, when the sealing resin <b>50</b> comes into contact with the second main surface <b>211</b>, the sealing resin <b>50</b> exhibits an anchoring effect on the terminal <b>20</b>. For this reason, the adhesion between the terminal <b>20</b> and the sealing resin <b>50</b> is improved, and the shear stress generated at the interface between the second main surface <b>211</b> and the sealing resin <b>50</b> is less likely to reach the second bonding layer <b>49</b>.

As a result, it is possible to increase efficiency of heat conduction in the direction orthogonal to the thickness direction z while improving the heat conductivity of the pad portion <b>11</b>.
