Great strides have been made in understanding the cytogenetic changes and genetic mutations associated with AML. New therapeutic strategies are being tested, but the survival of AML patients remains poor. Even with full adoption of the currently available mutation-specific therapies, only a minority of AML patients can benefit. There is thus a need for new therapeutic strategies.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Drugs that are currently used to treat AML kill cancer cells efficiently in vitro, except when bone marrow stroma is present. It was therefore hypothesized that an ex vivo system mimicking the tissue microenvironment would be required to define distinctive, genotype-independent vulnerabilities of malignant cells. The metabolism of cancer cells and their normal tissue counterparts is distinct. Within the heterogeneous populations of some cancers, stem-like cells associated with treatment resistance may also have different metabolic dependencies. These are not readily identified by genotypic or transcriptomic analyses and may offer promising and largely unmined therapeutic possibilities.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The main treatment for most types of AML is chemotherapy. This might be followed by a stem cell transplant, high dose chemotherapy or targeted therapy upon relapse.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Chemotherapy treatment of AML is usually divided into 2 phases: &#x2018;induction&#x2019; and &#x2018;consolidation&#x2019;. Induction is short and intensive, typically lasting about a week, and has the goal to clear the blood of leukemia cells and to reduce the number of blasts in the bone marrow to normal. After confirmation of a remission status, consolidation is given in cycles after the patient has recovered from induction and is meant to kill the residual leukemia cells. Conventional AML chemotherapy is based on intensive use of cytarabine or other nucleoside analogs in combination with anthracyclines such as daunorubicin, idarubicin or doxorubicin. Although chemotherapy regimens will induce complete remission in the majority of patients, relapse rates are very high. Relapsed AML is generally lethal with few opportunities for cure. Preventing relapse is therefore a key challenge in the treatment of AML.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patients who fail the chemotherapy induction typically receive matched sibling or alternative donor hematopoietic cell transplantation, high dose chemotherapy or targeted therapy for patients with defined mutations or CD33-positive AML. Given their specificity, only a minority of AML patients can benefit from these targeted therapies, and the problem of therapy resistance and disease relapse remains.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It has been surprisingly found that AML cells (e.g., leukemic stem cells) but not normal blood cells (e.g., granulocyte-monocyte progenitors) are susceptible to Aldh3a2 inhibition and that such inhibition in combination with induction of ferroptosis is lethal to cancer cells without inducing cell death of non-cancerous cells.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some aspects of the disclosure are related to a method of inducing cell death of cancer cells in a population of cells comprising contacting the population of cells with an effective amount of a first agent inhibiting Aldh3a2 activity or expression and an effective amount of a second agent inducing ferroptosis. In some embodiments, the method also inhibits the growth of the cancer cells. In some embodiments, the method does not induce or does not substantially induce cell death of non-cancer cells. In some embodiments, the uncontacted cancer cells exhibit increased redox stress or excessive production of reactive oxygen species. In some embodiments, the cancer cells are leukemia cells. In some embodiments, the cancer cells are AML cells. In some embodiments, the cancer cells are human cancer cells.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the first agent is a polypeptide, nucleic acid, or small molecule. In some embodiments, the first agent is a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibiting Aldh3a2 expression. In some embodiments, the second agent is a polypeptide, nucleic acid, or small molecule. In some embodiments, the second agent is a glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibitor. In some embodiments, the GPX4 inhibitor is erastin, RSL3, ML162, or DPI10. In some embodiments, the method is performed in vivo, in vitro, or ex vivo. In some embodiments, the first agent and second agent are contacted with the population of cells simultaneously or sequentially.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Some aspects of the disclosure are related to an anti-cancer composition, comprising a first agent which inhibits Aldh3a2 activity or expression, and a second agent which induces ferroptosis. In some embodiments, the first agent is a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibiting Aldh3a2 expression. In some embodiments, the second agent is a polypeptide, nucleic acid, or small molecule. In some embodiments, the second agent is a glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibitor. In some embodiments, the GPX4 inhibitor is erastin, RSL3, ML162, or DPI10. In certain aspects, the composition is formulated for administration by a mode selected from the group consisting of: topically, by injection, by intravenous injection, by inhalation, continuous release by depot or pump, and a combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Some aspects of the disclosure are related to a method of treating cancer in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a first agent inhibiting Aldh3a2 activity or expression and a chemotherapeutic regimen. In some embodiments, the chemotherapeutic regimen is an induction chemotherapy treatment regimen to the subject.

Aldh3a2 is distinctive in its substrates and its predicted structure from other ALDH family members. Aldehydes are by-products of increased oxidative phosphorylation and nucleotide synthesis in cancer and generated from lipid peroxides underlying the non-caspase dependent form of cell death, ferroptosis. Leukemic cell dependence on Aldh3a2 was seen across multiple mouse and human myeloid leukemias and reduction in Aldh3a2 expression improved survival in murine AML models. Aldh3a2 inhibition was synthetically lethal with glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4) inhibition, a known trigger of ferroptosis that by itself minimally affects AML cells. Thus, disclosed herein are therapeutic anti-cancer strategies for inhibiting Aldh3a2 to exploit the distinctive metabolic state of malignant cells.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Aldh3a2 (NCBI Gene ID 224; MIM: 609523) is an aldehyde dehydrogenase 3 family member. Aldehyde dehydrogenase isozymes are thought to play a major role in the detoxification of aldehydes generated by alcohol metabolism and lipid peroxidation. This gene product catalyzes the oxidation of long-chain aliphatic aldehydes to fatty acid.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Methods of Inducing Cell Death of Cancer Cells</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Some aspects of the disclosure are related to a method of inducing cell death of cancer cells in a population of cells comprising contacting the population of cells with an effective amount of a first agent inhibiting Aldh3a2 activity or expression and an effective amount of a second agent inducing ferroptosis. In some embodiments, the method also inhibits the growth of the cancer cells. In some embodiments, the method does not induce or does not substantially induce cell death of non-cancer cells. In some embodiments, the uncontacted cancer cells exhibit increased redox stress or excessive production of reactive oxygen species. In some embodiments, the cancer cells are leukemia cells. In some embodiments, the cancer cells are AML cells. In some embodiments, the cancer cells are human cancer cells. In some specific embodiments, the method is used to treat cancer (e.g., leukemia) in a patient by administration of the first and second agent to the patient. In some embodiments, both the first and second agents are small molecules. In some embodiments, the first agent is a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibiting Aldh3a2 expression (e.g., Aldh3a2-sh-1 and/or Aldh3a2-sh-2) and the second agent is a GPX4 inhibitor selected from erastin, RSL3, ML162, and DPI10.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">AML is a genetically heterogeneous disease of blood stem and myeloid progenitor cells, characterized by the accumulation of malignant blasts in the bone marrow that severely impairs normal blood formation. In spite of the heterogeneous nature of AML, the various subtypes seem to share some common pathways leading to leukemogenesis, and the hierarchical nature of the disease is generally well established (Lane, et al., Blood 1150-1157 (2009)). AML is one of the best characterized malignancies from a genetic viewpoint. Numerous genetic transformation events leading to leukemia have been characterized (Marcucci, et al., J.

A nucleic acid often comprises standard nucleotides typically found in naturally occurring DNA or RNA (which can include modifications such as methylated nucleobases), joined by phosphodiester bonds. In some embodiments a nucleic acid may comprise one or more non-standard nucleotides, which may be naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring (i.e., artificial; not found in nature) in various embodiments and/or may contain a modified sugar or modified backbone linkage. Nucleic acid modifications (e.g., base, sugar, and/or backbone modifications), non-standard nucleotides or nucleosides, etc., such as those known in the art as being useful in the context of RNA interference (RNAi), aptamer, CRISPR technology, polypeptide production, reprogramming, or antisense-based molecules for research or therapeutic purposes may be incorporated in various embodiments. Such modifications may, for example, increase stability (e.g., by reducing sensitivity to cleavage by nucleases), decrease clearance in vivo, increase cell uptake, or confer other properties that improve the translation, potency, efficacy, specificity, or otherwise render the nucleic acid more suitable for an intended use. Various non-limiting examples of nucleic acid modifications are described in, e.g., Deleavey G F, et al., Chemical modification of siRNA. Curr. Protoc.

Different modifications may be used in the two strands of a double-stranded nucleic acid. A nucleic acid may be modified uniformly or on only a portion thereof and/or may contain multiple different modifications. Where the length of a nucleic acid or nucleic acid region is given in terms of a number of nucleotides (nt) it should be understood that the number refers to the number of nucleotides in a single-stranded nucleic acid or in each strand of a double-stranded nucleic acid unless otherwise indicated.

RISC may incorporate a short nucleic acid strand (e.g., about 16-about 30 nucleotides (nt) in length) that pairs with and directs or &#x201c;guides&#x201d; sequence-specific degradation or translational repression of RNA (e.g., mRNA) to which the strand has complementarity. The short nucleic acid strand may be referred to as a &#x201c;guide strand&#x201d; or &#x201c;antisense strand&#x201d;. An RNA strand to which the guide strand has complementarity may be referred to as a &#x201c;target RNA&#x201d;. A guide strand may initially become associated with RISC components (in a complex sometimes termed the RISC loading complex) as part of a short double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), e.g., a short interfering RNA (siRNA). The other strand of the short dsRNA may be referred to as a &#x201c;passenger strand&#x201d; or &#x201c;sense strand&#x201d;. The complementarity of the structure formed by hybridization of a target RNA and the guide strand may be such that the strand can (i) guide cleavage of the target RNA in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and/or (ii) cause translational repression of the target RNA. Reduction of expression due to RNAi may be essentially complete (e.g., the amount of a gene product is reduced to background levels) or may be less than complete in various embodiments. For example, mRNA and/or protein level may be reduced by 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or more, in various embodiments. As known in the art, the complementarity between the guide strand and a target RNA need not be perfect (100%) but need only be sufficient to result in inhibition of gene expression. For example, in some embodiments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more nucleotides of a guide strand may not be matched to a target RNA. &#x201c;Not matched&#x201d; or &#x201c;unmatched&#x201d; refers to a nucleotide that is mismatched (not complementary to the nucleotide located opposite it in a duplex, i.e., wherein Watson-Crick base pairing does not take place) or forms at least part of a bulge. Examples of mismatches include, without limitation, an A opposite a G or A, a C opposite an A or C, a U opposite a C or U, a G opposite a G. A bulge refers to a sequence of one or more nucleotides in a strand within a generally duplex region that are not located opposite to nucleotide(s) in the other strand. &#x201c;Partly complementary&#x201d; refers to less than perfect complementarity. In some embodiments a guide strand has at least about 80%, 85%, or 90%, e.g., at least about 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence complementarity to a target RNA over a continuous stretch of at least about 15 nt, e.g., between 15 nt and 30 nt, between 17 nt and 29 nt, between 18 nt and 25 nt, between 19 nt and 23 nt, of the target RNA. In some embodiments at least the seed region of a guide strand (the nucleotides in positions 2-7 or 2-8 of the guide strand) is perfectly complementary to a target RNA. In some embodiments, a guide strand and a target RNA sequence may form a duplex that contains no more than 1, 2, 3, or 4 mismatched or bulging nucleotides over a continuous stretch of at least 10 nt, e.g., between 10-30 nt. In some embodiments a guide strand and a target RNA sequence may form a duplex that contains no more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 mismatched or bulging nucleotides over a continuous stretch of at least 12 nt, e.g., between 10-30 nt. In some embodiments, a guide strand and a target RNA sequence may form a duplex that contains no more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 mismatched or bulging nts over a continuous stretch of at least 15 nt, e.g., between 10-30 nt. In some embodiments, a guide strand and a target RNA sequence may form a duplex that contains no mismatched or bulging nucleotides over a continuous stretch of at least 10 nt, e.g., between 10-30 nt. In some embodiments, between 10-30 nt is 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30 nt.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As used herein, the term &#x201c;RNAi agent&#x201d; encompasses nucleic acids that can be used to achieve RNAi in eukaryotic cells. Short interfering RNA (siRNA), short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and microRNA (miRNA) are examples of RNAi agents. siRNAs typically comprise two separate nucleic acid strands that are hybridized to each other to form a structure that contains a double stranded (duplex) portion at least 15 nt in length, e.g., about 15-about 30 nt long, e.g., between 17-27 nt long, e.g., between 18-25 nt long, e.g., between 19-23 nt long, e.g., 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30 nucleotides. In some embodiments the strands of an siRNA are perfectly complementary to each other within the duplex portion. In some embodiments the duplex portion may contain one or more unmatched nucleotides, e.g., one or more mismatched (non-complementary) nucleotide pairs or bulged nucleotides. In some embodiments either or both strands of an siRNA may contain up to about 1, 2, 3, or 4 unmatched nucleotides within the duplex portion. In some embodiments a strand may have a length of between 15-35 nt, e.g., between 17-29 nt, e.g., 19-25 nt, e.g., 21-23 nt. Strands may be equal in length or may have different lengths in various embodiments. In some embodiments, strands may differ by 1-10 nt in length. A strand may have a 5&#x2032; phosphate group and/or a 3&#x2032; hydroxyl (&#x2014;OH) group. Either or both strands of an siRNA may comprise a 3&#x2032; overhang of, e.g., about 1-10 nt (e.g., 1-5 nt, e.g., 2 nt). Overhangs may be the same length or different in lengths in various embodiments. In some embodiments an overhang may comprise or consist of deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, or modified nucleotides or modified ribonucleotides such as 2&#x2032;-O-methylated nucleotides, or 2&#x2032;-O-methyl-uridine. An overhang may be perfectly complementary, partly complementary, or not complementary to a target RNA in a hybrid formed by the guide strand and the target RNA in various embodiments.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">shRNAs are nucleic acid molecules that comprise a stem-loop structure and a length typically between about 40-150 nt, e.g., about 50-100 nt, e.g., about 60-80 nt. A &#x201c;stem-loop structure&#x201d; (also referred to as a &#x201c;hairpin&#x201d; structure) refers to a nucleic acid having a secondary structure that includes a region of nucleotides which are known or predicted to form a double strand (stem portion; duplex) that is linked on one side by a region of (usually) predominantly single-stranded nucleotides (loop portion). Such structures are well known in the art and the term is used consistently with its meaning in the art. A guide strand sequence may be positioned in either arm of the stem, i.e., 5&#x2032; with respect to the loop or 3&#x2032; with respect to the loop in various embodiments. As is known in the art, the stem structure does not require exact base-pairing (perfect complementarity). Thus, the stem may include one or more unmatched residues or the base-pairing may be exact, i.e., it may not include any mismatches or bulges. In some embodiments the stem is between 15-30 nt, e.g., between 17-29 nt, e.g., between 19-25 nt. In some embodiments the stem is between 15-19 nt. In some embodiments the stem is between 19-30 nt. The primary sequence and number of nucleotides within the loop may vary. Examples of loop sequences include, e.g., UGGU; ACUCGAGA; UUCAAGAGA. In some embodiments a loop sequence found in a naturally occurring miRNA precursor molecule (e.g., a pre-miRNA) may be used. In some embodiments a loop sequence may be absent (in which case the termini of the duplex portion may be directly linked). In some embodiments a loop sequence may be at least partly self-complementary. In some embodiments the loop is between 1 and 20 nt in length, e.g., 1-15 nt, e.g., 4-9 nt. The shRNA structure may comprise a 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; overhang. As known in the art, an shRNA may undergo intracellular processing, e.g., by the ribonuclease (RNase) III family enzyme known as Dicer, to remove the loop and generate an siRNA.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Mature endogenous miRNAs are short (typically 18-24 nt, e.g., about 22 nt), single-stranded RNAs that are generated by intracellular processing from larger, endogenously encoded precursor RNA molecules termed miRNA precursors (see, e.g., Bartel, D., Cell. 116(2):281-97 (2004); Bartel D P. Cell. 136(2):215-33 (2009); Winter, J., et al., Nature Cell Biology 11: 228-234 (2009). Artificial miRNA may be designed to take advantage of the endogenous RNAi pathway in order to silence a target RNA of interest. The sequence of such artificial miRNA may be selected so that one or more bulges is present when the artificial miRNA is hybridized to its target sequence, mimicking the structure of naturally occurring miRNA:mRNA hybrids.

An RNAi vector may comprise a template that, when transcribed, yields transcripts that may form a siRNA (e.g., as two separate strands that hybridize to each other), shRNA, or miRNA precursor (e.g., pri-miRNA or pre-mRNA).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">An RNAi agent may be produced in any of a variety of ways in various embodiments. For example, nucleic acid strands may be chemically synthesized (e.g., using standard nucleic acid synthesis techniques) or may be produced in cells or using an in vitro transcription system.

The term &#x201c;pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier&#x201d;, as used herein, means one or more compatible solid or liquid vehicles, fillers, diluents, or encapsulating substances which are suitable for administration to a human or non-human animal. In preferred embodiments, a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier is a non-toxic material that does not interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredients. The term &#x201c;compatible&#x201d;, as used herein, means that the components of the pharmaceutical compositions are capable of being comingled with an agent, and with each other, in a manner such that there is no interaction which would substantially reduce the pharmaceutical efficacy of the pharmaceutical composition under ordinary use situations. Pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers should be of sufficiently high purity and sufficiently low toxicity to render them suitable for administration to the human or non-human animal being treated.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Some examples of substances which can serve as pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers are pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; phosphate buffer solutions; sugars such as lactose, glucose, and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ethylcellulose, cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; stearic acid; magnesium stearate; calcium sulfate; vegetable oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and oil of theobrama; polyols such as propylene glycol, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, and polyethylene glycol; sugar; alginic acid; cocoa butter (suppository base); emulsifiers, such as the Tweens; as well as other non-toxic compatible substances used in pharmaceutical formulation. Wetting agents and lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate, as well as coloring agents, flavoring agents, excipients, tableting agents, stabilizers, antioxidants, and preservatives, can also be present. It will be appreciated that a pharmaceutical composition can contain multiple different pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">A pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier employed in conjunction with the compounds described herein is used at a concentration or amount sufficient to provide a practical size to dosage relationship. The pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, in total, may, for example, comprise from about 60% to about 99.99999% by weight of the pharmaceutical compositions, e.g., from about 80% to about 99.99%, e.g., from about 90% to about 99.95%, from about 95% to about 99.9%, or from about 98% to about 99%.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers suitable for the preparation of unit dosage forms for oral administration and topical application are well-known in the art. Their selection will depend on secondary considerations like taste, cost, and/or shelf stability, which are not critical for the purposes of the subject invention, and can be made without difficulty by a person skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions (including cosmetic preparations) can include diluents, fillers, salts, buffers, stabilizers, solubilizers and other materials which are well-known in the art. The choice of pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier to be used in conjunction with the compounds of the present invention is basically determined by the way the compound is to be administered. Such preparations may routinely contain salt, buffering agents, preservatives, compatible carriers, and optionally other therapeutic agents. When used in medicine, the salts should be pharmaceutically acceptable, but non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts may conveniently be used to prepare pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof in certain embodiments. Such pharmacologically and pharmaceutically-acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, those prepared from the following acids: hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, maleic, acetic, salicylic, citric, formic, malonic, succinic, and the like. Also, pharmaceutically-acceptable salts can be prepared as alkaline metal or alkaline earth salts, such as sodium, potassium or calcium salts. It will also be understood that a compound can be provided as a pharmaceutically acceptable pro-drug, or an active metabolite can be used. Furthermore, it will be appreciated that agents may be modified, e.g., with targeting moieties, moieties that increase their uptake, biological half-life (e.g., pegylation), etc.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The agents may be administered in pharmaceutically acceptable solutions, which may routinely contain pharmaceutically acceptable concentrations of salt, buffering agents, preservatives, compatible carriers, adjuvants, and optionally other therapeutic ingredients.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The agents may be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, liquid or gaseous forms such as tablets, capsules, powders, granules, ointments, solutions, depositories, inhalants and injections, and usual ways for oral, parenteral or surgical administration.

Other compositions include suspensions in aqueous liquids or non-aqueous liquids such as a syrup, elixir or an emulsion.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">For oral administration, compositions can be formulated readily by combining the active agent(s) with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the agents to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a subject to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained as solid excipient, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as the cross linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate.

In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. Microspheres formulated for oral administration may also be used. Such microspheres have been well defined in the art. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration. For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The compounds, when it is desirable to deliver them systemically, may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Preparations for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. Examples of non-aqueous solvents are propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Aqueous carriers include water, alcoholic/aqueous solutions, emulsions or suspensions, including saline and buffered media. Parenteral vehicles include sodium chloride solution, Ringer's dextrose, dextrose and sodium chloride, lactated Ringer's, or fixed oils.

Preservatives and other additives may also be present such as, for example, antimicrobials, anti-oxidants, chelating agents, and inert gases and the like. Lower doses will result from other forms of administration, such as intravenous administration. In the event that a response in a subject is insufficient at the initial doses applied, higher doses (or effectively higher doses by a different, more localized delivery route) may be employed to the extent that patient tolerance permits. Multiple doses per day are contemplated to achieve appropriate systemic levels of compounds.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In certain embodiments, the vehicle is a biocompatible microparticle or implant that is suitable for implantation into the mammalian recipient. Exemplary bioerodible implants that are useful in accordance with this method are described in PCT International Application Publication No. WO 95/24929, entitled &#x201c;Polymeric Gene Delivery System&#x201d;, which reports on a biodegradable polymeric matrix for containing a biological macromolecule. The polymeric matrix may be used to achieve sustained release of the agent in a subject. In some embodiments, an agent described herein may be encapsulated or dispersed within a biocompatible, preferably biodegradable polymeric matrix. The polymeric matrix may be in the form of a microparticle such as a microsphere (wherein the agent is dispersed throughout a solid polymeric matrix) or a microcapsule (wherein the agent is stored in the core of a polymeric shell). Other forms of polymeric matrix for containing the agent include films, coatings, gels, implants, and stents. The size and composition of the polymeric matrix device is selected to result in favorable release kinetics in the tissue into which the matrix device is implanted. The size of the polymeric matrix device further is selected according to the method of delivery which is to be used, typically injection into a tissue or administration of a suspension by aerosol into the nasal and/or pulmonary areas. The polymeric matrix composition can be selected to have both favorable degradation rates and also to be formed of a material which is bioadhesive, to further increase the effectiveness of transfer when the device is administered to a vascular, pulmonary, or other surface. The matrix composition also can be selected not to degrade, but rather, to release by diffusion over an extended period of time.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Both non-biodegradable and biodegradable polymeric matrices can be used to deliver the agents of the invention to the subject. Biodegradable matrices are preferred. Such polymers may be natural or synthetic polymers. Synthetic polymers are preferred. The polymer is selected based on the period of time over which release is desired, generally in the order of a few hours to a year or longer. Typically, release over a period ranging from between a few hours and three to twelve months is most desirable. The polymer optionally is in the form of a hydrogel that can absorb up to about 90% of its weight in water and further, optionally is cross-linked with multivalent ions or other polymers.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In general, the agents may be delivered using the bioerodible implant by way of diffusion, or more preferably, by degradation of the polymeric matrix.

The agent is identified as an inhibitor of Aldh3a2 expression if the agent reduces the level of Aldh3a2 mRNA or protein as compared to a reference level (e.g., a control cell).</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In some embodiments, an inducer of ferroptosis is identified by contacting a cell with a test agent and measuring the level of ferroptosis. The agent is identified as an inducer of ferroptosis if the agent increases the level of ferroptosis as compared to a reference level (e.g., a control cell).</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In some embodiments, the methods of screening test agents described herein further comprise contacting the identified Aldh3a2 inhibitor or ferroptosis inducer with a test cell and measuring proliferation and/or survival of the contacted test cell as compared to a control cell not contacted with the identified inhibitor.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In some embodiments a method of screening one or more test agents to identify an inhibitor of Aldh3a2 expression or activity or a ferroptosis inducer comprises a high-throughput transport assay (e.g., in vitro transport assay). In some aspects an artificial membrane (e.g., a liposome) may be utilized. In other aspects a bacterial system may be utilized (e.g., Gram-negative bacteria such as <i>E. coli </i>or Gram-positive bacteria such as <i>B. subtilis </i>or <i>Lactococcus lactis</i>). In some embodiments, Aldh3a2 may be reconstituted into a liposome and one or more test agents are applied to Aldh3a2. In some embodiments bacterial <i>Lactococcus lactis </i>cells are grown to express Aldh3a2 and the cells are contacted with one or more test agents.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In certain embodiments of any method described herein, the survival or proliferation of cells, e.g., test cells and/or control cells, is determined by an assay selected from: a cell counting assay, a replication labeling assay, a cell membrane integrity assay, a cellular ATP-based viability assay, a mitochondrial reductase activity assay, a caspase activity assay, an Annexin V staining assay, a DNA content assay, a DNA degradation assay, and a nuclear fragmentation assay. Exemplary assays include BrdU, EdU, or H3-Thymidine incorporation assays; DNA content assays using a nucleic acid dye, such as Hoechst Dye, DAPI, actinomycin D, 7-aminoactinomycin D or propidium iodide; cellular metabolism assays such as AlamarBlue, MTT, XTT, and CellTitre Glo; nuclear fragmentation assays; cytoplasmic histone associated DNA fragmentation assay; PARP cleavage assay; TUNEL staining; and Annexin staining. In some embodiments, gene expression analysis (e.g., microarray, cDNA array, quantitative RT-PCR, RNAse protection assay, RNA-Seq) may be used to measure the expression of genes whose products mediate or are correlated with cell cycle, cell survival (or cell death, e.g., apoptosis), and/or cell proliferation, as an indication of the effect of an agent on cell viability or proliferation. Alternately or additionally, expression of proteins encoded by such genes may be measured. In other embodiments, the activity of a gene, such as those disclosed herein, can be assayed in a compound screen. In some embodiments, cells are modified to comprise an expression vector that includes a regulatory region of a gene whose products mediate or are correlated with cell cycle, cell survival (or cell death), and/or cell proliferation operably linked to a sequence that encodes a reporter gene product (e.g., a luciferase enzyme), wherein expression of the reporter gene is correlated with transcriptional activity of the gene. In such embodiments, assessment of reporter gene expression (e.g., luciferase activity) provides an indirect method for assessing cell survival or proliferation. Those of ordinary skill in the art are aware of genes whose products mediate or are correlated with cell cycle, cell survival (or cell death), and/or cell proliferation.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In some embodiments the activity of an agent (e.g., a test agent) can be tested by contacting test cells and control cells that are in a co-culture. Co-cultures enable selective evaluation of the properties (e.g., survival or proliferation) of two or more populations of cells (e.g., test and control cells) in contact with an agent in a common growth chamber. Typically, each population of cells grown in co-culture will have an identifying characteristic that is detectable and distinct from an identifying characteristic of the other population(s) of cells in the co-culture. In some embodiments, the identifying characteristic comprises a level of expression of a fluorescent protein or other reporter protein or a protein expressed at the cell surface that could be detected using an antibody. Numerous fluorescent proteins are known in the art and may be used. Such proteins include, e.g., green, blue, yellow, red, orange, and cyan fluorescent proteins (FP). In some embodiments, test cells and control cells express different, distinguishable FPs, e.g., a red FP and a green FP, or other pairs of FPs that have different emission spectra. Other reporter proteins include, e.g., enzymes such as luciferase, beta-galactosidase, alkaline phosphatase, etc. However, other identifying characteristics known in the art may be suitable, provided that the identifying characteristic enables measurement (e.g., by FACS or other suitable assay method) of the level of survival or proliferation of each of the two or more populations of cells in the co-culture. A cell can be modified to have an identifying characteristic using methods known in the art, e.g., by introducing into the cell a nucleic acid construct encoding an FP (or other detectable protein) operably linked to a promoter. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid construct that encodes an RNAi agent that reduces expression of Aldh3a2 and a nucleic acid construct that encodes a FP or other detectable protein are incorporated into the same vector.

In some embodiments two or more cell populations are pooled to form a larger population.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In some embodiments, each of one or more test cells is contacted with a different concentration of, and/or for a different duration with, a test agent than at least one other test cell; and/or each of the one or more control cells is contacted with a different concentration of, and/or for a different duration with, the test agent than at least one other control cell.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In some embodiments, a high throughput screen (HTS) is performed. A high throughput screen can utilize cell-free or cell-based assays. High throughput screens often involve testing large numbers of compounds with high efficiency, e.g., in parallel. For example, tens or hundreds of thousands of compounds can be routinely screened in short periods of time, e.g., hours to days. Often such screening is performed in multiwell plates containing, at least 96 wells or other vessels in which multiple physically separated cavities or depressions are present in a substrate. High throughput screens often involve use of automation, e.g., for liquid handling, imaging, data acquisition and processing, etc. Certain general principles and techniques that may be applied in embodiments of a HTS of the present invention are described in Macarr&#xf3;n R &#x26; Hertzberg R P. Design and implementation of high-throughput screening assays. Methods Mol Biol., 565:1-32, 2009 and/or An W F &#x26; Tolliday N J., Introduction: cell-based assays for high-throughput screening.

Janzen (2002) and High-Throughput Screening in Drug Discovery (Methods and Principles in Medicinal Chemistry) (2006) by Jorg H&#xfc;ser.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The term &#x201c;hit&#x201d; generally refers to an agent that achieves an effect of interest in a screen or assay, e.g., an agent that has at least a predetermined level of modulating effect on cell survival, cell proliferation, gene expression, protein activity, or other parameter of interest being measured in the screen or assay. Test agents that are identified as hits in a screen may be selected for further testing, development, or modification. In some embodiments a test agent is retested using the same assay or different assays. Additional amounts of the test agent may be synthesized or otherwise obtained, if desired. Physical testing or computational approaches can be used to determine or predict one or more physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic properties of compounds identified in a screen. For example, solubility, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) parameters can be experimentally determined or predicted. Such information can be used, e.g., to select hits for further testing, development, or modification. For example, small molecules having characteristics typical of &#x201c;drug-like&#x201d; molecules can be selected and/or small molecules having one or more unfavorable characteristics can be avoided or modified to reduce or eliminate such unfavorable characteristic(s).</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Additional compounds, e.g., analogs, that have a desired activity can be identified or designed based on compounds identified in a screen. In some embodiments structures of hit compounds are examined to identify a pharmacophore, which can be used to design additional compounds. An additional compound may, for example, have one or more altered, e.g., improved, physicochemical, pharmacokinetic (e.g., absorption, distribution, metabolism and/or excretion) and/or pharmacodynamic properties as compared with an initial hit or may have approximately the same properties but a different structure. For example, a compound may have higher affinity for the molecular target of interest, lower affinity for a non-target molecule, greater solubility (e.g., increased aqueous solubility), increased stability, increased bioavailability, oral bioavailability, and/or reduced side effect(s), modified onset of therapeutic action and/or duration of effect. An improved property is generally a property that renders a compound more readily usable or more useful for one or more intended uses. Improvement can be accomplished through empirical modification of the hit structure (e.g., synthesizing compounds with related structures and testing them in cell-free or cell-based assays or in non-human animals) and/or using computational approaches. Such modification can make use of established principles of medicinal chemistry to predictably alter one or more properties. An analog that has one or more improved properties may be identified and used in a composition or method described herein. In some embodiments a molecular target of a hit compound is identified or known. In some embodiments, additional compounds that act on the same molecular target may be identified empirically (e.g., through screening a compound library) or designed.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Data or results from testing an agent or performing a screen may be stored or electronically transmitted. Such information may be stored on a tangible medium, which may be a computer-readable medium, paper, etc. In some embodiments a method of identifying or testing an agent comprises storing and/or electronically transmitting information indicating that a test agent has one or more propert(ies) of interest or indicating that a test agent is a &#x201c;hit&#x201d; in a particular screen, or indicating the particular result achieved using a test agent. A list of hits from a screen may be generated and stored or transmitted. Hits may be ranked or divided into two or more groups based on activity, structural similarity, or other characteristics.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Once a candidate agent is identified, additional agents, e.g., analogs, may be generated based on it. An additional agent, may, for example, have increased cell uptake, increased potency, increased stability, greater solubility, or any improved property. In some embodiments a labeled form of the agent is generated. The labeled agent may be used, e.g., to directly measure binding of an agent to a molecular target in a cell. In some embodiments, a molecular target of an agent identified as described herein may be identified. An agent may be used as an affinity reagent to isolate a molecular target. An assay to identify the molecular target, e.g., using methods such as mass spectrometry, may be performed. Once a molecular target is identified, one or more additional screens maybe performed to identify agents that act specifically on that target.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Any of a wide variety of agents may be used as a test agent in various embodiments. For example, a test agent may be a small molecule, polypeptide, peptide, amino acid, nucleic acid, oligonucleotide, lipid, carbohydrate, or hybrid molecule. In some embodiments a nucleic acid used as a test agent comprises a siRNA, shRNA, antisense oligonucleotide, aptamer, or random oligonucleotide. In some embodiments a test agent is cell permeable or provided in a form or with an appropriate carrier or vector to allow it to enter cells.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Agents can be obtained from natural sources or produced synthetically. Agents may be at least partially pure or may be present in extracts or other types of mixtures. Extracts or fractions thereof can be produced from, e.g., plants, animals, microorganisms, marine organisms, fermentation broths (e.g., soil, bacterial or fungal fermentation broths), etc. In some embodiments, a compound collection (&#x201c;library&#x201d;) is tested. A compound library may comprise natural products and/or compounds generated using non-directed or directed synthetic organic chemistry. In some embodiments a library is a small molecule library, peptide library, peptoid library, cDNA library, oligonucleotide library, or display library (e.g., a phage display library). In some embodiments a library comprises agents of two or more of the foregoing types. In some embodiments oligonucleotides in an oligonucleotide library comprise siRNAs, shRNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, aptamers, or random oligonucleotides.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">A library may comprise, e.g., between 100 and 500,000 compounds, or more. In some embodiments a library comprises at least 10,000, at least 50,000, at least 100,000, or at least 250,000 compounds. In some embodiments compounds of a compound library are arrayed in multiwell plates. They may be dissolved in a solvent (e.g., DMSO) or provided in dry form, e.g., as a powder or solid. Collections of synthetic, semi-synthetic, and/or naturally occurring compounds may be tested. Compound libraries can comprise structurally related, structurally diverse, or structurally unrelated compounds. Compounds may be artificial (having a structure invented by man and not found in nature) or naturally occurring. In some embodiments compounds that have been identified as &#x201c;hits&#x201d; or &#x201c;leads&#x201d; in a drug discovery program and/or analogs thereof. In some embodiments a library may be focused (e.g., composed primarily of compounds having the same core structure, derived from the same precursor, or having at least one biochemical activity in common). Compound libraries are available from a number of commercial vendors such as Tocris BioScience, Nanosyn, BioFocus, and from government entities such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH). In some embodiments a test agent is not an agent that is found in a cell culture medium known or used in the art, e.g., for culturing vertebrate, e.g., mammalian cells, e.g., an agent provided for purposes of culturing the cells. In some embodiments, if the agent is one that is found in a cell culture medium known or used in the art, the agent may be used at a different, e.g., higher, concentration when used as a test agent in a method or composition described herein.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">One skilled in the art readily appreciates that the present invention is well adapted to carry out the objects and obtain the ends and advantages mentioned, as well as those inherent therein.

MLL-AF9 mouse AML cells and their non-malignant counterpart (normal granulocyte-monocyte progenitors; N-GMPs) were transduced with shRNAs targeting 162 metabolic enzymes and co-cultured with bone marrow-derived stromal cells to approximate the niche influence on metabolism observed in vivo. Candidate metabolic vulnerabilities were selected based on the criteria that a minimum of 3 independent shRNA constructs targeting the same gene reduced cell number in AML cells but not GMPs.

Aldh3a2, an enzyme responsible for detoxification of fatty aldehydes and generation of C16-18 fatty acids, was identified as a specific metabolic vulnerability of leukemic stem and progenitor cells.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0172">Fatty aldehydes accumulate in cells as a result of alcohol metabolism, pyrimidine and purine synthesis, amino acid metabolism and lipid peroxidation. Aldehydes are highly reactive compounds that can damage, DNA, proteins and lipids. Aldh3a2 is a metabolic enzyme responsible for detoxification of fatty aldehyde, especially those with a medium to long carbon chain (primary substrates are thought to be fatty aldehydes of 16 or 18 carbon length), resulting in the generation of C16-18 fatty acids.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0173">It is shown here that Aldh3a2 is critical in protecting leukemic stem and progenitor cells from ferroptotic cell death. Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic, iron-dependent form of cell death that is driven by excessive lipid peroxidation. Because AML and leukemic stem cells have higher iron requirements and oxidative metabolism than normal cells, they are more vulnerable to ferroptosis induction. In accordance, it was observed that loss of Aldh3a2 increases oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation in AML cells, leading to ferroptotic cell death. In contrast, it was found that normal murine stem and progenitor cells are tolerant of the loss of Aldh3a2. In addition to exhibiting a normal oxidative metabolism, non-cancer GMPs express lower levels of Aldh3a2 than AML cells. Thus, loss of Aldh3a2 in normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells likely does not reach the critical threshold of oxidative damage required for ferroptosis induction.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0174">Increasing oxidative stress by inhibiting the glutathione peroxidase Gpx4 further augments the damaging, death-inducing effects of Aldh3a2 depletion. While both Aldh3a2 and Gpx4 depletion can be rescued by ferrostatin, they have distinctive functions acting respectively on aldehydes and peroxides. Since aldehydes and peroxides can contribute to formation of the other, it is reasonable to view Aldh3a2 and Gpx4 as serving in parallel, detoxifying oxidative or peroxidative products that result from an increased or disregulated metabolic activity in malignancy. In AML, inhibition of Gpx4 alone had limited ability to enhance cell death. Yet, when inhibiting both Aldh3a2 and GPX4, a synthesis of effect is evident with superadditive increased cell killing, an oxidative product synthetic lethality.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0175">Further distinguishing Aldh3a2 from Gpx4 is its participation in fatty acid synthesis. By contributing to the de novo generation of long chain fatty acids, Aldh3a2 can contribute to both the replenishment of damaged fatty acids and limiting the damage of existing fatty acids through its enzymatic activity. In contrast, Gpx4 acts only on peroxide damaged lipids. These distinctions may contribute to the greater potency of Aldh3a2 compared with Gpx4 inhibition on AML.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0176">Therapeutic index is a critical feature in considering a target for drug development and it was found that normal murine stem and progenitor cells are tolerant of the loss of Aldh3a2. The enzyme is expressed in N-GMPs though at a lower level than L-GMPs, potentially accounting for leukemia's greater dependency on it. A greater dependency is also anticipated in AML given the well established upregulation of oxidative metabolism in AML and leukemic stem cells. Targeting Aldh3a2 may provide a distinctive means of selectively killing malignant over normal hematopoietic cells, particularly primitive L-GMPs, and merits consideration in therapeutic development.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0177">Depletion of Aldh3a2 has been thought to result in cell death by causing an increase in toxic C16-C18 aldehydes and alcohols and incomplete lipid metabolism in the inherited pediatric Sj&#xf6;gren-Larsson Syndrome. Sj&#xf6;gren-Larsson Syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by ichthyosis, neurodevelopmental delay and photophobia. Genetic carriers are not affected and the disease in homozygotes generally does not progress beyond childhood. These features suggest that targeting Aldh3a2 may be tolerated in extra-hematopoietic tissues at least for intervals that would be anticipated in anti-leukemic therapy.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0178">The target (Aldh3a2) has been identified and validated through genetic approaches in mouse and human AML cell lines, both in vitro and in mouse models in vivo.

A rapid screening assay may be developed that would allow identification of patients that will most likely respond to an Aldh3a2 inhibitor therapy prior to enrollment.

In preclinical mouse models of AML, it was found that synergistic elimination of AML cells by combining Aldh3a2 deletion with a standard chemotherapy regimen. Combination with targeted therapies may also be explored. The kinase inhibitor Sorafenib, which is effective in inducing remission in AML patients that carry the Flt3 mutation, is reported to induce ferroptosis. Using mouse models that carry the Flt3-ITD mutation, the potential of combining Aldh3a2 inhibition with Sorafenib may be explored.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0181">Preliminary studies highlight the potential of targeting Aldh3a2 for AML therapy, either alone or in specific combinations. While Aldh3a2 is dispensable for normal HSCs and GMPs by the in vivo knock-out studies, other members of the ALDH family play important roles in normal hematopoiesis. An inhibitor specific to Aldh3a2 would thus be ideal with regards to therapeutic development. High-throughput screening (HTS) may be performed to identify small molecule inhibitors of Aldh3a2, and validate and optimize hits with the goal of developing a potent and selective inhibitor of Aldh3a2 that can be carried to further (pre)clinical testing.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0182">There is currently no approved therapy for cancer targeting Aldh3a2 or inducing lipid peroxidation in other ways. Targeting GPX4 is being explored preclinically for cancer therapy, but results indicate that this is not a viable target in AML. It is proposed here that targeting Aldh3a2 will have broader effects than the targeting of GPX4 in AML and in cancer in general, with possible synergism through combined inhibition of Aldh3a2 and GPX4.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0183">In summary, Aldh3a2 depletion results in an iron-dependent oxidative cell death of leukemia cells while sparing normal hematopoiesis.
