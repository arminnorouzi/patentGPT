In addition, the invention relates to an active wheel suspension for a land vehicle, having at least one system for determining a displacement velocity signal with respect to a vertical displacement of a sprung mass of the land vehicle. Further, the invention relates to a method for determining a displacement velocity signal for controlling an active wheel suspension of a land vehicle by open-loop and/or closed-loop control, a vertical acceleration of a sprung mass of the land vehicle being sensed, and an acceleration signal corresponding to the vertical acceleration being generated and supplied to a Kalman filter.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">For the performance of an active wheel suspension of a land vehicle, it is helpful to determine a high-quality displacement velocity signal with respect to a vertical displacement of a sprung mass of the land vehicle and to use it to control the active wheel suspension by open-loop and/or closed-loop control. This allows actuators of the active wheel suspension to be controlled with greater accuracy. The generation of accurate velocity signals relating to motions of the sprung mass of a land vehicle, in particular a vertical displacement velocity signal, a roll angle velocity signal and a pitch angle velocity signal, makes it possible to generate more accurate control-force and torque requirements, for example so-called skyhook force requirements, based on such a velocity signal as an input signal. If a reference body velocity signal from which control force requirements are generated is not accurate, the control force requirements will not be accurate either, resulting in a degradation of the achievable ride comfort.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A high-quality displacement velocity signal also enables accurate generation of a damping force requirement. In addition, such a displacement velocity signal makes it possible to improve the accuracy of skyhook force requirements and torque requirements, which is aimed solely at controlling body movements and improving passenger comfort.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The displacement velocity of the sprung mass of a land vehicle cannot usually be measured directly, as there is no sensor for the displacement velocity. Therefore, the displacement velocity is conventionally determined, for example, by performing a mathematical integration over time of an acceleration signal, sensed by an acceleration sensor, to a vertical acceleration of the sprung mass. This approach must be combined with high-pass filtering in order to remove the drift introduced by the integration process. One problem with high-pass filtering, however, is that it alters the waveform of the displacement velocity signal, or severely distorts the displacement velocity signal, because low-frequency components are removed. If, for example, a skyhook closed-loop control is used to control an active wheel suspension by closed-loop control, the ride comfort is not optimized because the displacement velocity signal that is essential for this deviates significantly from the real displacement velocity of the sprung mass. Consequently, the conventional generation of a displacement velocity signal by high-pass filtering of the acceleration measurement signal of the acceleration sensor by integration over time does not in itself enable satisfactory generation of the displacement velocity signal.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A Kalman filter may outperform a simple Butterworth filter, but only if at least two measurement signals are supplied to the Kalman filter. Since usually only one measurement signal is available in the form of the vertical acceleration measurement signal, another measurement signal is required to make a Kalman filter usable instead of simple integration and high-pass filtering. For this purpose, an approach with a Kalman filter is proposed, for example, in JP 2010 195 323 A, in which a mathematical vehicle model represents an additional observation source in addition to an acceleration measurement signal. The disadvantage of this approach, however, is the associated high computational load that is required for the resulting Kalman filter.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Based on the discussion above, it may be desirable to enhance the performance of an active wheel suspension of a land vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF SOME EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A system for determining a displacement velocity signal for controlling an active wheel suspension of a land vehicle by open-loop and/or closed-loop control includes at least one Kalman filter, and at least one acceleration sensor arranged on a sprung mass of the land vehicle to sense a vertical acceleration of the sprung mass and to generate a corresponding acceleration signal supplied to the Kalman filter.

Indeed, the examples described and pictured herein should not be construed as being limiting as to the scope, applicability or configuration of the present disclosure. Rather, these example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. Furthermore, as used herein, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is to be interpreted as a logical operator that results in true whenever one or more of its operands are true. As used herein, operable coupling should be understood to relate to direct or indirect connection that, in either case, enables functional interconnection of components that are operably coupled to each other. It should be noted that the features and measures presented individually in the following description can be combined in any technically feasible manner, giving rise to further embodiments of the invention. The description additionally characterizes and specifies aspects of some example embodiments, particularly in conjunction with the figures.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">As noted above, example embodiments may provide a system according to which a Kalman filter includes a mathematical motion model of the sprung mass of a vehicle, the states of which are vertical acceleration of the sprung mass, a vertical displacement velocity of the sprung mass and a vertical displacement distance of the sprung mass, a displacement measurement signal having the value 0 being able to be supplied continuously to the Kalman filter for the purpose of determining the displacement velocity signal, and constant noise variance values of a measurement noise covariance matrix of the Kalman filter that are assigned to the displacement measurement signal being in each case set at one half of a maximum vertical displacement distance of the sprung mass.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">With the system according to example embodiments, a higher-quality displacement velocity signal is generated, in that the Kalman filter is operated, inter alia, with a simple mathematical motion model of the sprung mass of the land vehicle instead of with a complicated mathematical vehicle model. Moreover, in addition to the acceleration measurement signal, the Kalman filter is supplied with the displacement measurement signal equal to 0, which is not a real measurement signal, since no displacement measurement takes place, but is continuously kept at the constant value 0 without displacement measurement. Further, the constant noise variance values of a measurement noise covariance matrix of the Kalman filter that are assigned to the displacement measurement signal are in each case set at one half of a maximum vertical displacement distance of the sprung mass. These high noise variance values mean that the exact vertical position of the sprung mass is not known, but oscillates around the position assigned to the displacement measurement value 0, the latter position (0-position) being assumed to be the observed, or measured, position. The Kalman filter used according to example embodiments, or the mathematical model included in example embodiments, is thus very small and therefore not computationally intensive, such that the displacement velocity signal comes very close to the real displacement velocity of the sprung mass, this resulting in a significantly better ride comfort, for example, when the classic skyhook closed-loop control is used. Moreover, the Kalman filter can be realized relatively easily.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The system according to an example embodiment can be used to enhance the performance of an active wheel suspension, for example for controlling a continuously controlled damping (CCD), an active suspension and/or an actively controlled stabilizer of the active wheel suspension by open-loop and/or closed-loop control. The system according to example embodiments can be used in a land vehicle, for example in a commercial vehicle, a passenger car, a motorcycle, or in a train. Alternatively, the system according to example embodiments can also be used for closed-loop motion control in a robot.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The mathematical motion model of the sprung mass may be defined as follows:</p><p id="p-0017" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <msub>    <mi>X</mi>    <mi>k</mi>   </msub>   <mo>=</mo>   <mrow>    <mrow>     <mo>[</mo>     <mtable>      <mtr>       <mtd>        <msub>         <mi>s</mi>         <mi>k</mi>        </msub>       </mtd>      </mtr>      <mtr>       <mtd>        <msub>         <mi>v</mi>         <mi>k</mi>        </msub>       </mtd>      </mtr>      <mtr>       <mtd>        <msub>         <mi>a</mi>         <mi>k</mi>        </msub>       </mtd>      </mtr>     </mtable>     <mo>]</mo>    </mrow>    <mo>=</mo>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <mrow>       <mo>[</mo>       <mtable>        <mtr>         <mtd>          <mn>1</mn>         </mtd>         <mtd>          <mi>T</mi>         </mtd>         <mtd>          <mn>0</mn>         </mtd>        </mtr>        <mtr>         <mtd>          <mn>0</mn>         </mtd>         <mtd>          <mn>1</mn>         </mtd>         <mtd>          <mi>T</mi>         </mtd>        </mtr>        <mtr>         <mtd>          <mn>0</mn>         </mtd>         <mtd>          <mn>0</mn>         </mtd>         <mtd>          <mn>1</mn>         </mtd>        </mtr>       </mtable>       <mo>]</mo>      </mrow>      <mo>&#xb7;</mo>      <mrow>       <mo>[</mo>       <mtable>        <mtr>         <mtd>          <msub>           <mi>s</mi>           <mrow>            <mi>k</mi>            <mo>-</mo>            <mn>1</mn>           </mrow>          </msub>         </mtd>        </mtr>        <mtr>         <mtd>          <msub>           <mi>v</mi>           <mrow>            <mi>k</mi>            <mo>-</mo>            <mn>1</mn>           </mrow>          </msub>         </mtd>        </mtr>        <mtr>         <mtd>          <msub>           <mi>a</mi>           <mrow>            <mi>k</mi>            <mo>-</mo>            <mn>1</mn>           </mrow>          </msub>         </mtd>        </mtr>       </mtable>       <mo>]</mo>      </mrow>     </mrow>     <mo>+</mo>     <mrow>      <mrow>       <mo>[</mo>       <mtable>        <mtr>         <mtd>          <mn>0</mn>         </mtd>        </mtr>        <mtr>         <mtd>          <mn>0</mn>         </mtd>        </mtr>        <mtr>         <mtd>          <mn>1</mn>         </mtd>        </mtr>       </mtable>       <mo>]</mo>      </mrow>      <mo>&#xb7;</mo>      <msub>       <mi>W</mi>       <mrow>        <mi>k</mi>        <mo>-</mo>        <mn>1</mn>       </mrow>      </msub>     </mrow>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mrow>  <mo>,</mo> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">where X<sub>k </sub>is a state vector of an estimated motion state of the sprung mass relating to the state measurement k with the estimated states s<sub>k</sub>, v<sub>k </sub>and a<sub>k</sub>, and where s<sub>k </sub>is a vertical displacement distance of the sprung mass, v<sub>k </sub>is a vertical displacement velocity of the sprung mass, and a<sub>k </sub>is a vertical acceleration of the sprung mass.
