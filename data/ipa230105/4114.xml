The transmission protrusion <b>36</b>E is formed so as to penetrate through the cutaway portion of the C-shaped rib <b>36</b>D, in the axial direction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the transmission protrusion <b>36</b>E protrudes radially inward from the inner circumferential surface of the follower gear <b>36</b>, and has a generally rectangular shape, when viewed in the axial direction. The transmission protrusion <b>36</b>E is narrower in width, than the cutaway portion of the C-shaped rib <b>36</b>D. In addition, the transmission protrusion <b>36</b>E includes a relief hole <b>36</b>F, to prevent formation of a sink mark during the molding process.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">To attach the follower gear <b>36</b> to the end portion of the heat roller main body <b>33</b>, the transmission protrusion <b>36</b>E (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) formed on the follower gear <b>36</b> is brought to the position of the cutaway portion <b>33</b>A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) formed in the heat roller main body <b>33</b>. Then the follower gear <b>36</b> is moved to the inner side from the outer side in the axial direction, with the inner circumferential surface of the follower gear <b>36</b> fitted to the outer circumferential surface of the end portion of the heat roller main body <b>33</b>, until the end face of the heat roller main body <b>33</b> is abutted against the flange portion of the follower gear <b>36</b>. At this point, the attachment is completed.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken orthogonally to the axial direction, showing the state where the follower gear <b>36</b> has been attached to the end portion of the heat roller main body <b>33</b>. When the follower gear <b>36</b> is attached, a ring-shaped portion of the end portion of the heat roller main body <b>33</b>, except the pair of protruding plate portions <b>33</b>B and <b>33</b>C, is interposed between the inner circumferential surface of the follower gear <b>36</b> and the outer circumferential surface of the C-shaped rib <b>36</b>D, and the transmission protrusion <b>36</b>E of the follower gear <b>36</b> is inserted between the pair of protruding plate portions <b>33</b>B and <b>33</b>C.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the follower gear <b>36</b> is rotationally driven by the driver gear in a predetermined direction (e.g., clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>) about the axial line, the end face of the transmission protrusion <b>36</b>E on the front side in the rotation direction is abutted against the protruding plate portion <b>33</b>B. Because of the protruding plate portion <b>33</b>B being pushed by the transmission protrusion <b>36</b>E, the heat roller main body <b>33</b> rotates in the same direction as the follower gear <b>36</b>. In this embodiment, an abnormal noise suppression structure is adopted, to prevent generation of an abnormal noise originating from the advanced rotation of the heat roller main body <b>33</b>, when the follower gear <b>36</b> is made to rotate.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">To be more detailed, in the abnormal noise suppression structure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, a clearance kl in the roller rotation direction, between the protruding plate portion <b>33</b>B and an end portion <b>36</b>G of the C-shaped rib <b>36</b>D opposed to the protruding plate portion <b>33</b>B, is narrower than a clearance k<b>2</b> in the roller rotation direction between the transmission protrusion <b>36</b>E and the other protruding plate portion <b>33</b>C, when the transmission protrusion <b>36</b>E is abutted against the protruding plate portion <b>33</b>B.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Now, the existing fixing device referred to earlier has such a simple structure that the protruding portion (transmission protrusion) formed on the follower gear is inserted in the cutaway portion formed in the heat roller main body. Accordingly, for example, the end face of the cutaway portion may be knocked forward by the transmission protrusion, which may lead to decline in motive power transmission performance.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">To avoid the mentioned drawback, the pair of protruding plate portions may be formed on the heat roller main body, so as to protrude radially inward from the respective edges of the cutaway portion extending in the axial direction, so that the transmission protrusion is abutted against the lateral face of the protruding plate portion, when the follower gear is made to rotate. Such a configuration is expected to improve the motive power transmission performance.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken orthogonally to the axial direction, showing a follower gear <b>102</b> attached to a heat roller main body <b>101</b> on which a pair of protruding plate portions <b>101</b>A are formed. It is preferable to make the clearance between the pair of protruding plate portions <b>101</b>A wider than the width of a transmission protrusion <b>102</b>A of the follower gear <b>102</b>, in consideration of thermal expansion. However, when the follower gear <b>102</b> has momentaneously stopped, for example owing to backlash between the follower gear <b>102</b> and the driver gear, the heat roller main body <b>101</b> rotates in advance, and the protruding plate portion <b>101</b>A on the front side in the rotation direction collides with the end face of the transmission protrusion <b>102</b>A, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>. Such collision takes place each time the follower gear stops, and therefore an abnormal noise arising from the collision is periodically generated with the rotation of the follower gear.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">With the configuration according to the foregoing embodiment, in contrast, even though the heat roller main body <b>33</b> rotates in advance, when the follower gear <b>36</b> has momentaneously stopped, for example owing to backlash between the follower gear <b>36</b> and the driver gear <b>35</b> (only shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), the protruding plate portion <b>33</b>B is abutted against the end portion of the C-shaped rib <b>36</b>D, thereby preventing the other protruding plate portion <b>33</b>C from colliding with the end face of the transmission protrusion <b>36</b>E, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>. Therefore, generation of the abnormal noise, arising from the collision between the other protruding plate portion <b>33</b>C and the transmission protrusion <b>36</b>E, can be suppressed. As result, generation of the abnormal noise originating from the advanced rotation of the heat roller main body <b>33</b> can be suppressed, without compromising the motive power transmission performance of the follower gear <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although a slight noise is generated when the protruding plate portion <b>33</b>B is abutted against the end portion of the C-shaped rib <b>36</b>D, the clearance kl between the protruding plate portion <b>33</b>B and the end portion of the C-shaped rib <b>36</b>D is narrower than the clearance k<b>2</b> between the transmission protrusion <b>36</b>E and the other protruding plate portion <b>33</b>C, and therefore the collision energy is smaller, and the generated noise is negligibly small. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>, the end portion of the C-shaped rib <b>36</b>D may be formed in a slightly pointed shape, so that the protruding plate portion <b>33</b>B makes a linear contact or point contact, to reduce the collision noise between the protruding plate portion <b>33</b>B and the end portion of the C-shaped rib <b>36</b>D. Forming thus the end portion of the C-shaped rib <b>36</b>D in the pointed shape reduces the contact area in the case of collision, thereby assuring that the collision noise is suppressed.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Further, the C-shaped rib <b>36</b>D not only serves to prevent the advanced rotation of the heat roller main body <b>33</b>, but also serves as a reinforcing rib for the follower gear <b>36</b>, in the foregoing embodiment. Such a configuration eliminates the need to additionally provide a reinforcing rib, thereby making the follower gear <b>36</b> smaller in size and lighter in weight.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Variation</heading><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Although the end portion <b>36</b>G of the C-shaped rib <b>36</b>D is utilized as the abutment portion in the foregoing embodiment, the disclosure is not limited to such embodiment.
