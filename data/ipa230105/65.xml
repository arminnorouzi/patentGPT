No. 16/589,168, filed Oct. 1, 2019.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is related to the field of rodent control and, more particularly, to a &#x201c;chip-clip&#x201d; style snap trap for rodents.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Snap traps like the wooden VICTOR&#xae; brand mouse trap have been used effectively to capture mice for decades. More recently, molded plastic snap traps in various styles and sizes have become commercially available. These molded plastic snap traps include the &#x201c;chip-clip&#x201d; style trap that has upper and lower jaws that come together in a locking position at a trapping end to grip a mouse, the jaws being placed in the set position by squeezing the opposite ends of the jaws together to open the trapping end in an action like that of a clothespin or &#x201c;chip lip&#x201d; commonly used to temporarily close the open end of a bag of chips when the jaws are released to return the trapping end to the locking or closed position.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Due to the spring bias that must be overcome when pressing the setting ends of the jaws of a rodent snap trap together, chip-clip style snap traps can be difficult to set without finger slippage. In addition, chip-clip style snap traps may be triggered when the rodent is not properly positioned relative to the jaws, increasing the number of rodent escapes.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A further problem can arise in connection with snap traps that are pre-baited with a quantity of bait covered by a seal or cap for freshness. These traps can inadvertently be placed in a set position by the user without first removing the seal or bait cap, resulting in decreased rodent interaction with the trap. In addition, re-baiting some pre-baited traps is complicated by difficulty accessing the bait cup or the potential loss of the bait cup in those designs where the bait cup is fully removed to add bait. Finally, many chip-clip style snap traps are complex in structure, making them difficult and/or expensive to manufacture and assemble.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, a need exists for a chip-clip style snap trap that overcomes the foregoing problems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the foregoing, the present invention is directed to a chip-clip style snap trap for rodents. The snap trap includes a base and a pivoting lid that together form a pair of jaws at a trapping end of the trap, the jaws coming together to clamp on the rodent when the trap is triggered. The trap is set by squeezing the base and lid together at the gripping end of the trap opposite the jaws, with the lid being biased toward the closed position by a spring or the like.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To give the user good traction when setting the trap, the gripping end includes tactile elements, preferably configured as bumps and/or chevron-style gripping surfaces on both the base and the lid. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;front&#x201d; and &#x201c;forward&#x201d; are used with reference to the trapping end of the trap while &#x201c;rear&#x201d; and &#x201c;rearward&#x201d; refer to the setting or gripping end of the trap.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A setting and trigger assembly includes a trigger hood and lever arm that are each pivotally mounted to the base and work together to set the trap as will be further described hereinafter. A pre-baited bait cup is positioned under the trigger hood and, when configured for sale, the cup is covered by a bait cap for freshness. When the bait cap is in place, the trap cannot be set, thereby preventing the problem of inadvertent setting and placement of the trap for use without having first removed the bait cap. In addition, according to a preferred embodiment the bait cap includes a tail that protrudes from the front of the trap to draw attention to the cap and facilitate removal thereof.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The pre-baited bait cup is preferably formed integrally with a bait door that is pivotally coupled to the bottom of the base, with the base including an opening through which the bait cup projects upwardly when the door is closed. When opened, the bait door swings downwardly, away from the bottom of the base while remaining hingedly connected thereto, to enable the bait cup to be refilled and then can be pivoted upwardly so that the bait cup protrudes through the opening and is positioned directly underneath the trigger hood. The free end of the door is secured in the closed position against a recessed surface on the underside of the base, preferably with a snap fit connection.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The base is provided with two substantially mirror-image side walls that extend longitudinally from the front to the rear of the base. The height of the side walls is greater near the forward end of the base, with the upper edges of the side walls sloping upwardly from a front edge of the trap and then downwardly to form a peak positioned on either side of the bait cup. The height of the side walls and the positioning of the peaks, as well as the configuration of the trigger hood positioned over the bait cup, serve to properly orient the rodent for capture as the rodent can only access the bait from the front of the trap and must be sufficiently committed inside the trap, thereby producing optimal positioning between the upper and lower jaws upon trap activation.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The lid preferably has a curved upper surface joined with side walls that follow the sloped contour of the base side walls to create a hooked profile in which the height of the lid side walls at a point in vertical alignment with the peak is approximately 25% that of the height of the base side walls at the peak. The height of the lid side walls increases rearwardly to follow the downward slope of the base side walls rearwardly of the peak forming a sloped contour. The alignment of the side wall contours between the lid and the base create a streamlined and low profile trap while yet gaining the improved rodent orienting function of the base side wall height on either side of the bait cup.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The trap is also readily assembled with the lid and the base snapping together without the need for any tools, metal pins or fasteners. The snapped connections also act as the pivots for the back and forth rotation of the lid on the base, simplifying the design and making the trap safe, cost effective to produce, and easy to use.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a chip-clip style snap trap that includes a base and a pivoting lid that together form a pair of jaws at a trapping end of the trap, the jaws coming together to clamp on the rodent when the trap is triggered, the trap being set by squeezing the base and lid together at the gripping end of the trap opposite the jaws, both the base and lid including gripping surfaces that prevent finger slippage and enable the trap to be set with one hand.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another object of the present invention is to provide a chip-clip style snap trap in accordance with the preceding object in which the trap includes a setting and trigger assembly having a latch mechanism which engages a trigger mechanism to retain the upper jaw in a raised position spaced from the lower jaw when the trap is set by squeezing the setting end of the lid toward the base rearward end and to release the upper jaw to return under spring bias to a lowered position in abutment with the lower jaw when actuated by a rodent, the trap including an interference member associated with the trigger mechanism that prevents the latch mechanism from engaging the trigger mechanism until the interference mechanism has been moved away from the trigger mechanism.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a chip-clip style snap trap in accordance with the preceding object in which the trigger mechanism includes a trigger hood mounted on the base and positioned over a bait cup, the bait cup preferably being pre-baited and closed with a cap prior to use for bait freshness, the bait cap being configured to act as an interference member to prevent the trap from being set until the cap is removed.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a chip-clip style snap trap in accordance with the preceding object in which the bait cap includes a tail that protrudes from the front end of the trap to draw attention to the cap and assist in removal thereof.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A further object of the present invention is to provide a chip-clip style snap trap in accordance with at least one of the preceding objects that includes a pivoting bait door formed integrally with the bait cup and permanently mounted to the bottom of the base by a pivoting connection, the pivotal movement of the bait door providing ease of access to the bait cup for re-baiting while ensuring that no trap parts are lost either in use or while re-baiting.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">A still further object of the present invention is to provide a chip-clip style snap trap in accordance with at least one of the preceding objects in which the base has high side walls having upper edges that slope upwardly from the front edge of the trap and then progress downwardly to form a peak positioned on either side of the bait cup, the side walls serving to properly orient the rodent prior to triggering, thereby increasing trap efficacy and reducing false triggers.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another object of the present invention is to provide a chip-clip style snap trap in accordance with the preceding object in which the ratio between the height of the base side walls at their peak and the height of the lid side walls at a point vertically aligned with the peak is approximately 4:1.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a chip-clip style snap trap in accordance with at least one of the two immediately preceding objects in which the base side walls at their peak are taller than and aligned near the front wall of the trigger hood.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A further object of the present invention is to provide a chip-clip style snap trap in accordance with at least one of the preceding objects in which the base and lid snap together without the need for tools, pins or fasteners, making the trap easy to assemble and cost effective to produce.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Still yet a further object of the present invention is to provide a chip-clip style snap trap that is economical to manufacture and use, and robust and effective in operation.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">These together with other objects and advantages which will become subsequently apparent reside in the details of construction and operation as more fully hereinafter described and claimed, reference being had to the accompanying drawings forming a part hereof, wherein like numerals refer to like parts throughout.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of

It is not intended that the invention be limited in its scope to the details of construction and arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. Also, in describing the preferred embodiments, specific terminology will be resorted to for the sake of clarity. It is to be understood that each specific term includes all technical equivalents which operate in a similar manner to accomplish a similar purpose.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in the assembled views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref> and the exploded view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the present invention is directed to a chip-clip style snap trap for rodents. The snap trap, generally designated by reference numeral <b>10</b>, includes a base <b>12</b> and a top or lid <b>14</b> which form an aligned pair of clamping jaws. The base <b>12</b> includes a horizontal platform <b>16</b> with two matching vertically extending side walls <b>18</b> joined by an upwardly directed front wall <b>20</b> at the forward end of the base <b>12</b>. The upwardly directed front wall <b>20</b> forms a lower jaw, generally designated by reference numeral <b>22</b>, having an upper edge <b>24</b>. When configured as a mouse trap, the base is preferably between about 3.5&#x2033; and about 4.5&#x2033; in length, and most preferably about 4&#x2033; in length, as measured along the longitudinal axis L (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). However, the snap trap <b>10</b> according to the present invention can also be sized with larger dimensions and configured as a rat trap.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Therefore, while specific dimensional description herein is directed to the mouse trap embodiment, it is to be understood that comparable structural features are also applicable to and incorporated within the rat trap version with like function and operational effectiveness.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The lid <b>14</b> is pivotally mounted to the base <b>12</b> on an attachment structure generally designated by reference numeral <b>26</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) that is positioned between the front end generally designated by reference numeral <b>28</b> of the base and a rear end generally designated by reference numeral <b>30</b> of the base. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the underside of the lid, generally designated by reference numeral <b>15</b>, is provided with attachment tabs <b>27</b> that are secured with a snap fit within the apertures <b>25</b> of attachment structure <b>26</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>12</b></figref>) to pivotally secure the lid to the base.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The forward end of the lid <b>14</b> forms an upper jaw generally designated by reference numeral <b>32</b>. A lower edge <b>34</b> of the upper jaw <b>32</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) is complementary in shape with the upper edge <b>24</b> of the lower jaw <b>22</b> so that the upper and lower jaws meet together to form the front or trapping end <b>28</b> of the snap trap <b>10</b>. The lid is biased, such as by a coil spring <b>36</b>, to a closed position in which the lower edge <b>34</b> of the upper jaw <b>32</b> and the upper edge <b>24</b> of the lower jaw <b>22</b> are held in abutment when the trap is tripped and empty as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">At the rear or gripping end <b>30</b> of the trap, the lid includes a setting platform <b>40</b> that is pressed toward the rearward end of the base platform <b>16</b>, with the lid <b>14</b> pivoting on the attachment structure <b>26</b>, to separate the jaws and, with the aid of a setting and trigger assembly generally designated by reference numeral <b>25</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), place the trap in a set position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>9</b></figref>. An aperture <b>42</b> with a catch surface <b>44</b> is formed near the rear edge of the setting platform <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the base platform <b>16</b> includes a trigger mechanism mounting structure <b>50</b> and a latch mechanism mounting structure <b>52</b> for pivotally securing a trigger mechanism generally designated by reference numeral <b>54</b> and a latch mechanism generally designated by reference numeral <b>56</b>, respectively, to the base platform <b>16</b>. The aperture <b>42</b>, catch surface <b>44</b>, trigger mechanism <b>54</b> and latch mechanism <b>56</b> together constitute the setting and trigger assembly <b>25</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition, the base platform <b>16</b> includes an opening <b>58</b> to receive a bait cup <b>60</b> formed on a bait door <b>70</b>. As configured for sale, the bait cup is positioned in opening <b>58</b>, pre-baited with a quantity of bait and sealed with a bait cap, generally designated by reference numeral <b>62</b>, for freshness. The bait cap <b>62</b> includes a cover <b>63</b> and a tab or tail <b>64</b> that preferably projects from the front of the trap, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>10</b>-<b>12</b></figref>, to both remind the user of the presence of the bait cap and to assist in removal of the cap prior to setting of the trap <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to the present invention, the rear part of the bait cap <b>62</b> acts, in conjunction with the pivotally mounted trigger mechanism <b>54</b> and latch mechanism <b>56</b>, as an interference member, generally designated by reference numeral <b>61</b>, to prevent the trap from being set until the bait cap <b>62</b> has been removed as will be further discussed hereinafter. The bait cap <b>62</b> is preferably made of a different color than the trap to further prompt the user to remove the cap prior to attempting use of the trap.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The trigger mechanism <b>54</b> is embodied as a trigger hood <b>55</b> having a substantially planar upper wall <b>72</b> and a front wall <b>74</b>, and two opposed side walls <b>76</b> that are substantially perpendicular to the upper wall <b>72</b> to form the hood structure. An arm <b>78</b>, integrally formed with the hood <b>55</b>, extends downwardly from the underside of the upper wall <b>72</b> adjacent the rear end thereof and includes a rearwardly directed ledge <b>80</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>12</b></figref>). The rear end of the trigger hood <b>55</b> is pivotally mounted on the trigger mechanism mounting structure <b>50</b> to enable the front end of the hood having the front wall <b>74</b> to be lifted up from a lowered position by pivoting the hood <b>55</b> on the trigger mechanism mounting structure <b>50</b>. The front wall <b>74</b> of the trigger hood <b>55</b> includes a cutout <b>82</b>, preferably semicircular in shape, that provides an access opening to the underside of the hood even when the front wall <b>74</b> of the hood is in the lowered position, best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. When in the lowered position, the hood side walls <b>76</b> and the front wall <b>74</b> are adjacent to, or rest upon, an upper surface <b>84</b> of the base platform <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The latch mechanism <b>56</b> includes an elongated lever arm <b>57</b> having a mounting end generally designated by reference numeral <b>86</b> with a catch <b>88</b> and a trigger end <b>90</b>. The mounting end <b>86</b> is pivotally coupled to the latch mechanism mounting structure <b>52</b> which is positioned at the rear end <b>30</b> of the base. The catch <b>88</b> is located at the rear end of the lever arm <b>57</b>. The trigger end <b>90</b> is positioned on the front end of the lever arm <b>57</b> and engages with the rearwardly directed ledge <b>80</b> on the hood arm <b>78</b> to place the trap in the set position when the setting platform <b>40</b> of the lid <b>14</b> is pressed downwardly toward the base platform <b>16</b> after the bait cap <b>62</b> has been removed.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">More particularly, to set the trap the bait cap <b>62</b> is removed by lifting upwardly on the tail <b>64</b> to raise the cover <b>63</b> and then pulling the cap forwardly and off the bait cup <b>60</b>. The setting platform <b>40</b> is then squeezed toward the base platform <b>16</b> so that the catch <b>88</b> passes through the aperture <b>42</b> in the setting platform <b>40</b> to bring an upper surface <b>87</b> of the mounting end <b>86</b>, located forwardly of the catch <b>88</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>), into contact with a lower surface <b>41</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>) of the setting platform <b>40</b>. This contact pushes the mounting end <b>86</b> of the lever arm <b>57</b> down which raises the trigger end <b>90</b>. As the trigger end <b>90</b> is lifted, it pushes on the rear of the trigger hood <b>55</b>, causing it to pivot on the mounting structure <b>50</b>, which lifts the front wall <b>74</b> of the trigger hood slightly to allow the trigger end <b>90</b> to pass over the rearwardly directed ledge <b>80</b> while, at the same time, the catch <b>88</b> engages with the catch surface <b>44</b> on the lid. Once the trigger end <b>90</b> of the lever arm <b>57</b> has moved past the ledge <b>80</b>, the front of the trigger hood drops back to the lowered position. As squeezing pressure on the setting platform is released, the trigger end <b>90</b> is captured by, or rests upon, the top of the ledge <b>80</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, with the catch <b>88</b> in engagement with the catch surface <b>44</b> on the lid (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>9</b></figref>) to hold the trap in the set position.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">When the bait cap <b>62</b> is in place, the foregoing sequence is prevented due to engagement between the interference member <b>61</b> of the bait cap cover <b>63</b> and the trigger mechanism <b>54</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>12</b></figref>, the interference member <b>61</b> on the bait cap cover <b>63</b> engages the bottom edge <b>79</b> of the depending arm <b>78</b> to prevent the trigger hood from pivoting sufficiently to enable the trigger end <b>90</b> of the lever arm <b>57</b> to clear the ledge <b>80</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. As a result, the trigger end cannot be secured on the ledge <b>80</b> and the catch <b>88</b> is not caught upon the catch surface <b>44</b>, preventing the trap from being placed in the set position with the bait cap in place over the bait cup.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In addition to the interference member <b>61</b> shown herein, it is also anticipated that the rodent trap <b>10</b> according to the present invention could be provided with an alternate structure configured to prevent the trap from being set. Such an interference member, as would be mounted similarly within the trap, can provide a safety feature to prevent a child from setting the trap and, particularly in the case of a rat trap with its greater closing force, being placed at risk of injury should the trap be accidentally tripped while being handled.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The two matching side walls <b>18</b> of the base <b>12</b> extend longitudinally from the upwardly directed front wall <b>20</b> to the rearward end <b>30</b> of the base. The height of the base side walls <b>18</b> is greater near the forward end of the base, with upper edges <b>92</b> of the side walls <b>18</b> sloping upwardly and then downwardly to form a peak <b>94</b> positioned on either side of the bait cup <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">More specifically, it is preferred that an imaginary straight line drawn between the apexes <b>93</b> of the peaks <b>94</b> of the two opposed side walls <b>18</b> would intersect with, or be just slightly rearward of, a front edge of the bait cup. In this way, the side walls <b>18</b> serve to properly orient the rodent for capture.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Particularly, the rodent can only access the bait by stepping over the front wall <b>20</b>, which brings the rodent into longitudinal alignment with the longitudinal axis L of the trap for optimal positioning between the upper and lower jaws <b>32</b>, <b>22</b> upon trap activation.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the lid has a curved upper surface <b>96</b> joined with lid side walls <b>98</b> that follow the sloped contour of the base side walls <b>18</b> to create a hooked profile (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>8</b></figref>). The height of the lid side walls <b>98</b> at a point in vertical alignment with the apex <b>93</b> of the peaks <b>94</b> is approximately 25% that of the height of the base side walls <b>18</b> at the peak apex <b>93</b>. Hence, as shown representatively in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the ratio between the height of the base side walls HB at their peak apex <b>93</b> and the height of the lid side walls HL at a point vertically aligned with the peak apex is between about 5:1 and 3:1, and preferably is approximately 4:1.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition, the base side walls at their peak are taller than, and are aligned near, the front wall <b>74</b> of the trigger hood <b>54</b>. This proximally aligned relationship between the front or trip portion of the trigger hood and the apex <b>93</b> on the base side walls further enhances the rodent orienting function of the side walls at the point of trap activation.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The height of the lid side walls increases rearwardly to follow the downward slope of the upper edges <b>92</b> of the base side walls rearwardly of the peak. With the complementary slopes of the lid and base side walls, the trap maintains a low profile, having a trapping end height in the mouse trap version of less than 2.5&#x2033; when set, while yet gaining the improved rodent orienting function of the base side wall height on either side of the bait cup.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Trap activation occurs as follows. The rodent enters the front of the trap between the separated jaws <b>22</b>, <b>32</b> and is drawn to the cutout <b>82</b> in the front wall <b>74</b> of the trigger hood <b>55</b> by the smell of the bait in the bait cup <b>60</b>. Since the bait is covered by the hood, the rodent attempts to reach the bait by lifting upwardly on the front of the trigger hood, causing it to pivot. This upward pivoting movement releases the trigger end <b>90</b> of the lever arm <b>57</b> from the ledge <b>80</b> on the back of the hood and allows the catch <b>88</b> to disengage from the catch surface <b>44</b> on the lid <b>14</b>, freeing the upper and lower jaws to snap together under the tension of spring <b>36</b> to capture and hold the rodent.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the bait cup <b>60</b> is formed on a bait door <b>70</b> that is pivotally coupled to the bottom of the base platform <b>16</b> on hinges <b>100</b>. To provide clearance for the door <b>70</b> and hinges <b>100</b>, the door is mounted in a recessed wall area <b>105</b> to the bottom <b>17</b> of the base platform <b>16</b>. To open, the bait door <b>70</b> swings downwardly, away from the bottom <b>17</b> of the base platform <b>16</b>, to enable the bait cup to be exposed for refilling and then can be pivoted upwardly so that the bait cup <b>60</b> protrudes through the opening <b>58</b> and is positioned directly underneath the hood <b>55</b> of the trigger mechanism <b>54</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). The free end <b>102</b> of the door <b>70</b> is preferably secured against the recessed wall area <b>105</b> with a snap fit connection <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The trap according to the present invention is also easy to assemble due to the snap fit coupling of the lid <b>14</b> to the attachment structure <b>26</b> on the base <b>12</b>. As noted earlier herein, the tabs <b>27</b> on the underside <b>15</b> of the lid are received within the apertures <b>25</b> formed by the base attachment structure <b>26</b>. Once snapped into place, the lid is secured to the base while being pivotal thereon between the set and tripped positions. With this easy mounting configuration, the trap can be readily assembled without pins or fasteners and without the use of tools.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Accordingly, the snap trap according to the present invention is easy to grip and set without finger slippage. The height of the base side walls on either side of the bait cup aligns the rodent properly to reduce the number of rodent escapes. Further, the trap cannot be set without first removing the interference member, herein embodied as the cap on the bait cup, thus preventing the inadvertent placement of a set trap in which the bait is still sealed. In addition, the hinged bait door facilitates re-baiting while keeping the bait cup connected to the trap base.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Finally, as previously stated herein, the snap trap according to the present invention can be sized for use with mice or, alternatively, may be constructed with larger dimensions and configured as a rat trap. Whether sized and configured for mice or rats, the rodent traps have comparable structural features as have been described herein and operate with like function and operational effectiveness.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The foregoing descriptions and drawings should be considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. The invention may be configured in a variety of shapes and sizes and is not limited by the dimensions of the preferred embodiment. Numerous applications of the present invention will readily occur to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Therefore, it is not desired to limit the invention to the specific examples disclosed or the exact construction and operation shown and described. Rather, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
