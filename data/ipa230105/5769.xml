One such process condition is the exposure to process gases. To promote the uniformity of this exposure, a semiconductor substrate processing apparatus may rotate the substrate support defining an outer support surface for supporting a substrate or a substrate carrier during processing so as to average out non-uniformities in process gas flows that contact the substrates.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another process condition is the temperature of the substrates. To obtain uniform processing results across the substrates, each of the substrates thereof may preferably be heated substantially uniformly to a common temperature by a heater disposed proximate a side wall of the process chamber and/or proximate a top wall of the process chamber. The within-substrate temperature uniformity may also be enhanced by the rotation mechanism.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The rotation may be accomplished by the substrate support being connected to a base assembly through a bearing that facilitates rotation of the substrate support. The bearing may be sensitive to heat which may cause malfunction of the bearing.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form. These concepts are described in further detail in the detailed description of example embodiments of the disclosure below. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an objective to provide for a semiconductor substrate processing apparatus with a bearing for rotationally supporting the substrate support whereby the risk of malfunction of the bearing is reduced.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To this end, a first aspect of the invention is directed to a semiconductor substrate processing apparatus. The semiconductor substrate processing apparatus may comprise: a reaction chamber; a heater to heat the reaction chamber; and a substrate support assembly. The substrate support assembly may comprise: a substrate support defining an outer support surface for supporting a substrate or a substrate carrier in the reaction chamber; and a base assembly including a door for sealing the reaction chamber of the apparatus. The substrate support may be connected to the base assembly through a bearing that facilitates rotation of the substrate support relative to the base assembly around a rotation axis. The substrate support assembly may be provided with a temperature sensor constructed and arranged to measure the temperature of the bearing.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The apparatus according to the invention may feature a substrate support assembly, including a rotatable substrate. The substrate support, and any substrates supported thereon (either directly or through the intermediation of a substrate carrier), may be rotated around the rotation axis of the substrate support and relative to a heater. Such rotation averages out the effects of non-uniformities in the (heat profile of) the heater, and promotes the within-substrate temperature uniformity of the supported substrates. The apparatus may be applied in a variety of semiconductor processing devices, including in particular vertical thermal batch furnaces and a single substrate processing apparatus comprising a rotatable substrate support.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other features and advantages of the invention will be more fully understood from the following detailed description of certain embodiments of the invention, taken together with the accompanying drawings, which are meant to illustrate and not to limit the invention.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It will be appreciated that elements in the figures are illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale.

In general, semiconductor substrate processing apparatus may, for instance, be of a single or double tube type and include a generally bell jar-shaped reaction chamber <b>1</b>. The reaction chamber <b>1</b> may have a generally tubular, for example circular or polygonal, cross-sectional shape. As regards the manufacturing material, the reaction chamber <b>1</b> may be made of quartz, silicon carbide, silicon or another suitable heat resistant material. The reaction chamber <b>1</b> may define a reaction space <b>25</b> in which substrates can be processed, e.g. be subjected to thermal annealing, etching or deposition treatments.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The reaction chamber <b>1</b> may be encircled by a heater <b>2</b> for heating substrates W received in the reaction space <b>25</b>, such as an electrically resistive heating coil powered by an electrical power supply (not shown). The heater <b>2</b> may be secured to a thermally insulating sleeve that surrounds the reaction chamber <b>1</b>. The apparatus may be provided with a liner <b>6</b> (for a double tube type apparatus).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A temperature measurement system <b>22</b> may be mounted on a flange <b>30</b> and extending along an outer surface of the cylindrical wall of the liner <b>6</b> towards the top end of the liner <b>6</b> to measure a temperature. The temperature measurement system <b>22</b> may comprise a beam with a plurality of temperature sensors provided along the length of the beam to measure the temperature at different heights along the liner <b>2</b>. Since the temperature measurement system <b>22</b> is positioned outside the liner <b>6</b> deposition may not reach the temperature measurement system <b>22</b>. This may be beneficial because the deposition may disturb the temperature measurement.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further the temperature measurement system <b>22</b> may comprise quartz and therefore have a different expansion coefficient than the deposited material causing a risk of particles and breaking of the temperature measurement system <b>22</b>. The liner <b>6</b> may be provided with a radially inwardly extending bulge to accommodate the temperature measurement system. At its lower, open end the reaction chamber <b>1</b> may be supported on a flange <b>30</b> that defines an opening via which a substrate carrier <b>7</b> may enter and/or exit the reaction chamber <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The substrate carrier <b>7</b> may be mounted on an outer support surface <b>5</b> of a substrate support <b>3</b> or pedestal of a substrate support assembly <b>4</b>. The substrate carrier <b>7</b> may include a plurality of vertically spaced apart slots for holding semiconductor substrates (wafer) W in the reaction chamber <b>2</b>. The substrate support assembly <b>4</b> may further comprise a base assembly <b>44</b> including a door <b>9</b> for sealing the reaction chamber <b>1</b> of the apparatus, the substrate support <b>3</b> being connected to the base assembly <b>44</b> through a bearing <b>11</b> that facilitates rotation of the substrate support <b>3</b> relative to the base assembly <b>44</b> around a rotation axis L. The reaction chamber <b>1</b> may extend along the same rotation axis L.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The substrate support assembly <b>4</b> may be provided with a temperature sensor <b>13</b> constructed and arranged to measure the temperature of the bearing <b>11</b>. The temperature sensor <b>13</b> may be a resistance temperature sensor. The resistance temperature sensor may be positioned partially around and against the bearing <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The bearing <b>11</b> may be a roller bearing comprising circular and coaxial races. The bearing <b>11</b> may be lubricated with grease. The grease may be running out of the bearing <b>11</b> when it gets overheated. Without grease the bearing may not be functioning very well and or very long. Also the bearing <b>11</b> may comprise elastic or rubber components that may be sensitive to overheating. Overheating of the bearing <b>11</b> therefore should be circumvented.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> the temperature sensor <b>13</b> may be operably connected to an alarm system <b>19</b>. The alarm system <b>19</b> may comprise a processor <b>21</b> and a memory <b>23</b>. The memory <b>23</b> may be constructed and arranged to store an overheating temperature. The processor <b>21</b> may compare the temperature of the temperature sensor <b>13</b> with the overheating temperature stored in the memory <b>23</b> to signal an alarm when the temperature indicated by the temperature sensor <b>13</b> is higher than the stored overheating temperature.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Signaling an alarm may be done with sound or visual signals. A sound alarm <b>24</b> may therefore be operationally connected to the processor <b>21</b>. This may allow the user of the apparatus to take measures to circumvent overheating or to plan maintenance on the apparatus. For example the bearing <b>11</b> may need to be replaced or lubricated after overheating.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">One could also store a heat load over time on the bearing <b>11</b> in the memory <b>23</b> and use that for predicting maintenance on the bearing <b>11</b>. For example, the heat load over time stored in the memory <b>23</b> could be compared to a reference heat load. Artificial intelligence could be used to predict the reference heat load. For example, by connecting multiple apparatus and use malfunction incidences of the bearing <b>11</b> to determine the reference heat load at malfunction to predict maintenance.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The substrate support <b>3</b> may be supported on a downwardly protruding drive shaft <b>15</b> that extends through a passage in the door <b>9</b>.
