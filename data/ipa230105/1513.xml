The control system determines and controls based on the difference between the measured and desired, nominal, conductance.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The process of metal additive manufacturing is a technique in which a heat source, for instance a laser, is used to melt metal wire into a metal deposit. It can thus be described as a metal printer. Other terms used for the technology are namely, laser metal deposition, and directed energy deposition. Since this technique can offer the production of products with complex geometries with a high throughput with minimal wastage of expensive raw material, it is advantageous in many industries, for instance in the aerospace industry.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, the principle of this process can be described as a high-power laser creating a pool of molten metal on a workpiece or substrate, into which the wire is fed. The high temperature of the weld pool and the laser radiation heats up the wire and causes it to melt. The wire feeder is, together with the laser optics, attached to a processing tool which is moved along a deposition path by an industrial robot. This causes the molten wire to solidify along this deposition path, forming beads. These beads are placed side-by-side and layer-upon-layer, forming 3D structures upon the substrate using suitable robot movements. This process however is highly sensitive to disturbances and exhibits non-linear behaviour in terms of deposit geometries and input parameters. Positioning of the tool relative to the substrate and the wire feed rate is essential in maintaining a stable deposition process. If the distance between the tool and the workpiece is adequate, a continuous transition of material from the solid wire into the weld pool will occur. If the distance is too large, a neck will form in the material transfer, which is essentially a weak link. In case the distance increases further, this neck may become disrupted, in which case the wire will be molten independently of the substrate. A droplet will build up at the wire tip, before it eventually grows too large to be sustained by surface tension and falls down onto the substrate. This droplet transfer will give an uneven surface, poorly suited for further deposition. If the distance is too small, the wire will protrude through the weld pool into the solid substrate, which is referred to as &#x201c;stubbing&#x201d;. This will cause the wire to rapidly oscillate from side to side, scraping onto the unmolten part of the substrate, causing lack-of-fusion defects in the deposited material. Disturbances in distance may be caused by process variations due to deposit geometry, temperature accumulation or poor planning of deposition paths.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, additional output parameters in a deposition process may cause disturbances in the process, leading to a reduced process stability or performance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In either case, it is essential to have good control on the distance of the wire tip and the weld pool on the substrate. In this regard, GB2551163A discloses a laser metal deposition with wire apparatus and associated process with a laser configured to melt a wire, a nozzle configured to extrude the wire, a DC current source configured to supply current through the extruded wire into a substrate; and a wheatstone bridge, wherein the resistance between the nozzle and the substrate forms one resistance Rx of the wheatstone bridge, and wherein the remainder of the wheatstone bridge is supplied by an AC voltage source isolated from the DC current source by capacitors C and/or a band-pass filter F. The apparatus enables the combination of thermoelectric resistance heating and the in-situ measurement of the resistance of the nozzle to weld-pool to substrate to determine the distance between the tool and substrate surface.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Hagqvist, P et al, <i>Resistance based iterative learning control of additive manufacturing with wire</i>. Mechatronics. 31 (2015) 116-123 describes an iterative, feed-forward, control process and system for an additive manufacturing process. The feed-forward control process uses measured resistance data which is gathered during deposition of a single layer, after deposition of a layer, and prior to deposition of a subsequent layer the measured resistance data is filtered and fed to a resistance-to-distance regression model. The system is purely feed-forward of distance and cannot be used for feedback control during deposition of a layer. According to the system of Hagqvist, 2015, measured resistance data is less suitable for feedback control due, at least in part, to the noisy resistance signal which results in either actuation errors or necessitates low-pass filtering and hence increased time lag, or poor high frequency response of the control loop.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Hagqvist, P et al, <i>Resistance measurements for control of laser metal wire deposition</i>. Optics and Lasers in Engineering. 54 (2014) 62-67 describes a method for controlling laser metal wire deposition on-line (during deposition of a single layer), based on a resistance model for determining distance of the tip from the workpiece based on the resistance. As opposed to Hagqvist (2015), the Hagqvist (2014) feedback system is a feedback controller, however, filtering of the resistance signal is mandatory, increasing the necessary processing requirements for the system, and the controller, as it is based only on determining distance from the wire tip to the workpiece, only controls this distance and other process parameters remain uncontrollable.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The relation between resistance and distance is rather complex, and depends on many parameters such as the position of the wire tip, the temperature, the area etc. Additionally, there is often a high demand on both speed and accuracy to fulfil the requirements put on the manufacturing. Furthermore, there are additional parameters in a process besides distance which may affect process stability and performance. Therefore, there is a need for a better control of the manufacturing process.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, the present invention preferably seeks to mitigate, alleviate or eliminate one or more of the above-identified deficiencies in the art and disadvantages singly or in any combination and solves at least the above mentioned problems by providing a control system for regulating an additive manufacturing process of an additive manufacturing apparatus, the apparatus configured to add metal to a substrate by means of metal deposition.

The control system <b>500</b> maintains system performance by maintaining a nominal conductance. The additive manufacturing apparatus controllable via the control system <b>500</b> is configured to add metal to a substrate <b>30</b> by means of metal deposition. The apparatus comprises a nozzle <b>10</b> for output of the metal strip <b>20</b>, a heat source <b>300</b> configured to melt the metal strip <b>20</b> via provision of heat <b>301</b>, an electrical power source <b>400</b> configured to supply current via the metal strip <b>20</b> to the substrate <b>30</b>. The control system <b>500</b> maintains process stability via: determining the electrical conductance between the metal strip <b>20</b> and the substrate <b>30</b>, determining the difference between the determined conductance and a desired, nominal electrical conductance, adjusting an output process parameter such that the nominal electrical conductance is maintained. The apparatus is preferably a laser metal wire deposition (LMD-w) apparatus. The output parameter is at least one of: the substrate <b>30</b> to nozzle <b>10</b> distance, the speed of the nozzle <b>10</b> movement relative the substrate <b>30</b>, the amount of supplied current, the heat <b>301</b> provided by the heat source <b>300</b>, and/or the rate of output of the metal strip <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The inventors have identified that general process stability has a linear relation to conductance. General process stability as used herein refers to the general performance, and robustness of the additive manufacturing process. A stable process is a process which avoids the molten wire forming distal the substrate <b>30</b>, that is, melting elsewhere than the weld pool <b>35</b> and potentially causing a catastrophic process failure as the nozzle <b>10</b> becomes filled with molten metal; &#x201c;stubbing&#x201d; as described previously; overheating of the substrate <b>30</b>; and other determinantal process conditions.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The linear relationship between general process stability and conductance enables the use of a relatively simple controller. For example, a traditional Proportional, Integral, Derivative (P, PI, or PID) feedback controller may be used to control an additive manufacturing process via the control system <b>500</b>. The conductance based control system <b>500</b> need not be based exclusively on a P, PI, or PID control system. For example, the control system <b>500</b> may use one or several alternative control techniques to implement conductance based control. For example, bang-bang control may be used to control an output parameter, or several parameters. Bang-bang control may be especially suitable for controlling the heat <b>301</b> provided by the heat source. For example, the heat <b>301</b> provided by the heat source may be controlled by turning the heat source <b>300</b> on/off to adjust the heat provided. The control system <b>500</b> may be based on sliding mode control. The control system <b>500</b> may combine several known control techniques to control several output parameters. The control system <b>500</b> may control each of the output parameters with a different control technique. Whilst different specific control implementations have been described, the control system <b>500</b> as described herein is a conductance feedback control system <b>500</b> which can control an additive manufacturing process during deposition of a layer to maintain a nominal conductance.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The control system <b>500</b> is an online feedback system where measurement of conductance, determining the difference between the measured conductance, and the desired, nominal, conductance occurs at a high rate. The high rate is dependent on the specific implementing device(s) used within the system but may range from several times per second, to several hundred times per second, or higher.
