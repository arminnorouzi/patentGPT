treating, stabilizing, or lessening the severity or progression liver disease, in particular, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">NASH (sometimes called steatonecrosis) is diagnosed most often in patients between 40 and 60 years but can occur in all age groups. Many affected patients have obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (or glucose intolerance), dyslipidemia, and/or metabolic syndrome. Histologically, NASH is indistinguishable from alcoholic hepatitis. Thus to diagnosis NASH, underlying alcohol use must be ruled out. Differentiating simple steatosis from NASH can be difficult, and elevated liver enzymes are not a sensitive predictor for identifying NASH. The presence of metabolic syndrome (obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and glucose intolerance) increases the likelihood that a patient has NASH rather than simple steatosis. Pathogenesis is poorly understood but seems to be linked to insulin resistance (e.g., as in obesity or metabolic syndrome). Most patients are asymptomatic. Although noninvasive diagnostic tests are usually sufficient, liver biopsy remains the gold standard. Treatment includes elimination of causes and risk factors; new therapies are rapidly emerging but still in the clinical trial phase.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Lifestyle modification and associated weight loss can improve NASH but are not always sufficient and sustained results are difficult to obtain. Hence, there is an urgent need for pharmacological treatment.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Cancer Osaka thyroid (COT) protein is a serine/threonine kinase that is a member of the MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) family.

In addition to a poor diet, NAFLD has several other known causes. For example, NAFLD can be caused by certain medications, such as amiodarone, antiviral drugs (e.g., nucleoside analogues), aspirin (rarely as part of Reye's syndrome in children), corticosteroids, methotrexate, tamoxifen, or tetracycline. NAFLD is associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome (obesity, combined hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus (type II) and high blood pressure). NAFLD is considered to cover a spectrum of disease activity, and begins as fatty accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis). NAFLD has also been linked to the consumption of soft drinks through the presence of high fructose corn syrup which may cause increased deposition of fat in the abdomen, although the consumption of sucrose shows a similar effect (likely due to its breakdown into fructose). Genetics has also been known to play a role, as two genetic mutations for this susceptibility have been identified. If left untreated, NAFLD can develop into non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is the most extreme form of NAFLD, a state in which steatosis is combined with inflammation and fibrosis.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">As shown herein, COT (or TPL2) inhibition reduces fibrosis in a choline-deficient high-fat diet (CDHFD) animal models.

Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles may include, for example, inert solid diluents and fillers, diluents, including sterile aqueous solution and various organic solvents, permeation enhancers, solubilizers and adjuvants. Such compositions are prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art. See, e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mace Publishing Co., Philadelphia, Pa. 17th Ed. (1985); and Modern Pharmaceutics, Marcel Dekker, Inc. 3rd Ed. (G. S. Banker &#x26; C. T. Rhodes, Eds.).</p><p id="p-0299" num="0239">As used herein, &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&#x201d; or &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable excipient&#x201d; includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0240">The pharmaceutical compositions may be administered in either single or multiple doses. The pharmaceutical composition may be administered by various methods including, for example, rectal, buccal, intranasal and transdermal routes. In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition may be administered by intra-arterial injection, intravenously, intraperitoneally, parenterally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, orally, topically, or as an inhalant.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0241">One mode for administration is parenteral, for example, by injection. The forms in which the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be incorporated for administration by injection include, for example, aqueous or oil suspensions, or emulsions, with sesame oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs, mannitol, dextrose, or a sterile aqueous solution, and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0242">Oral administration may be another route for administration of the compounds described herein. Administration may be via, for example, capsule or enteric coated tablets. In making the pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one compound described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, tautomer, stereoisomer, mixture of stereoisomers, prodrug, or deuterated analog thereof, the active ingredient is usually diluted by an excipient and/or enclosed within such a carrier that can be in the form of a capsule, sachet, paper or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be in the form of a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0243">Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, sterile water, syrup, and methyl cellulose.

Controlled release drug delivery systems for oral administration include osmotic pump systems and dissolutional systems containing polymer-coated reservoirs or drug-polymer matrix formulations. Examples of controlled release systems are given in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,845,770; 4,326,525; 4,902,514; and 5,616,345. Another formulation for use in the methods disclosed herein employ transdermal delivery devices (&#x201c;patches&#x201d;). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of the compounds described herein in controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,023,252, 4,992,445 and 5,001,139. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0245">For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient may be mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, tautomer, stereoisomer, mixture of stereoisomers, prodrug, or deuterated analog thereof. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, the active ingredient may be dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0246">The tablets or pills of the compounds described herein may be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action, or to protect from the acid conditions of the stomach. For example, the tablet or pill can include an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer that serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0247">Compositions for inhalation or insufflation may include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described herein. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. In other embodiments, compositions in pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases.

Liver hydroxyproline (OH&#x2014;P) content was calculated from liver tissue samples. Briefly, cryo-powdered liver tissue was weighed and lysed in diH<sub>2</sub>O using a bead-based TissueLyzer II homogenizer (Qiagen). Homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 10000&#xd7;g at 4&#xb0; C. for 10 min and protein concentrations were determined using a commercially-available bicinchoninic acid (BCA) colorimetric protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. #: 23225). Protein was hydrolyzed and incubated at 110&#xb0; C. overnight. Hydrolysates were brought to RT and centrifuged at 13000&#xd7;g for 5 min. A 7-point standard curve of OH&#x2014;P was performed in duplicate for each assay. Hydrolysates and standards were added to separate wells of a 96-well plate and placed under vacuum at RT for &#x2dc;5 h until completely desiccated. Chloramine T solution was added to each well and incubated at RT for 20 min on agitation. Then, Ehrlich's Reagent was added to each well and the plate was sealed and incubated at 65&#xb0; C. for 20 min. The plate was brought to RT and absorbance was read at 560 nm using a Molecular Devices' SpectraMax 190 plate reader. Relative optical densities (O.D.s) were background-corrected against blank samples and standard curves for the conversion of O.D.s to concentration were generated using the 4-parameter curve-fit method. Unknown sample concentrations were determined using SoftMax Pro5 software (Molecular Devices) and corrected for sample dilutions as appropriate.
