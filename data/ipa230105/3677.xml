Overview of Present Technology</heading><p id="p-0060" num="0050">First, an overview of the present technology will be described.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0051">There are device in which minute electrodes (reading electrodes) are arrayed side by side and potentials of solutions on the electrodes are electrochemically measured. Of the devices, there is a device (a potential measurement device) in which biological cells with which a culture solution is filled and which are put on minute electrodes and an action potential generated by the biological cells is measured.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0052">In particular, a potential measurement device in which electrodes, amplifiers, and AD converters, and the like are integrated in one chip using a CMOS integrated circuit technology and potentials are measured simultaneously at multiple points has attracted attention.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0053">When an action potential of cells is measured using the device (the potential measurement device), it is necessary to cultivate cells on electrodes on the front surface of a device chip and maintain an action thereof. On the other hand, to perform temperature measurement of a chip and control in a CMOS integrated circuit, a thermometer in which intersection points formed on a semiconductor (silicon (Si)) substrate are used is used.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0054">As described above, to cultivate cells and maintain an action thereof on a device chip (for example, on a wiring layer of a potential measurement device) measuring an action potential of the cells, it is necessary to keep a temperature of a cell (a culture solution) at a constant temperature (for example, 37&#xb1;0.5&#xb0; C.). On the other hand, on the device side, a chip temperature increases due to power consumption during an operation. Accordingly, by monitoring a chip temperature with a thermometer inside the chip and feeding back to an external cooling mechanism (for example, a Peltier element or the like), it is possible to perform control of the chip temperature. In this case, however, since a thermometer formed on a semiconductor substrate (a silicon substrate) and a chip surface (a chip surface facing cells) on which the cells are put are located at distant positions, an error may occur between a surrounding temperature of the cells and a temperature measured by the thermometer in some cases.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0055">An insulation film (an inter-layer film: for example, SiO, SiN, or the like) between a thermometer and a surface electrode has thermal resistance or thermal capacitance to some extent. Therefore, when temperature control is performed through feedback, it may be difficult to keep a temperature of the chip surface on which cells are put within a specified range in some cases due to occurrence of delay of an increase or decrease in temperature, overshooting, or undershooting.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0056">The present technology has been devised in view of the foregoing circumstances. According to the present technology, a potential measurement device includes a semiconductor substrate, a wiring layer on the semiconductor substrate, a first electrode (a temperature measurement dummy electrode) on the wiring layer, and a second electrode (a reading electrode) configured to detect an action potential of a cell on the wiring layer. A temperature measurement unit is formed on the semiconductor substrate. A plurality of wirings connected to a heat conduction unit and the second electrode are formed in the wiring layer. For example, the heat conduction unit and the first electrode may be connected and may be formed to extend from the first electrode to a region near the temperature measurement unit.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0057">According to the present technology, by forming the heat conduction unit, heat can be transported to the vicinity of the temperature measurement unit formed in the semiconductor substrate (a silicon substrate) (for example, an interface between the semiconductor substrate and the wiring layer). Thus, it is possible to measure a temperature of a chip surface on which a cell is put with high accuracy. Accordingly, in surface temperature control feedback of an increase in a chip temperature during an operation of a chip (the potential measurement device) or a change in an environmental temperature, it is possible to perform control of a small change with high accuracy and achieve stabilization of a cell action.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0058">Any material may be selected freely as long as a material of which the heat conduction unit is formed is a material that has low thermal resistance and/or high thermal conductivity. For example, a metal material may be used. A material of which the heat conduction unit is formed may be a material that has low thermal resistance and/or high thermal conductivity and has high electrical resistance (has insulation).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0059">Since the first electrode (the temperature measurement dummy electrode) and the second electrode (the reading electrode) are formed in substantially the same layer on the wiring layer (on the potential measurement device or the chip), it is preferable to form of the same material from the viewpoint of manufacturing applicability. However, the present technology is not limited thereto. A material of which the first electrode (the temperature measurement dummy electrode) is formed may differ from a material of which the second electrode (the reading electrode) is formed.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0060">Next, an overall exemplary configuration of the potential measurement device according to the present technology will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary configuration of a potential measurement device <b>200</b><i>e </i>according to the present technology.
