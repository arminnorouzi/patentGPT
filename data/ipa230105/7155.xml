Autonomous vehicles may need to take into account a variety of factors and make appropriate decisions based on those factors to safely and accurately reach an intended destination. For example, an autonomous vehicle may need to process and interpret visual information (e.g., information captured from a camera) and may also use information obtained from other sources (e.g., from a GPS device, a speed sensor, an accelerometer, a suspension sensor, etc.). At the same time, in order to navigate to a destination, an autonomous vehicle may also need to identify its location within a particular roadway (e.g., a specific lane within a multi-lane road), navigate alongside other vehicles, avoid obstacles and pedestrians, observe traffic signals and signs, and travel from on road to another road at appropriate intersections or interchanges. Harnessing and interpreting vast volumes of information collected by an autonomous vehicle as the vehicle travels to its destination poses a multitude of design challenges. The sheer quantity of data (e.g., captured image data, map data, GPS data, sensor data, etc.) that an autonomous vehicle may need to analyze, access, and/or store poses challenges that can in fact limit or even adversely affect autonomous navigation. Furthermore, if an autonomous vehicle relics on traditional mapping technology to navigate, the sheer volume of data needed to store and update the map poses daunting challenges.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments consistent with the present disclosure provide systems and methods for autonomous vehicle navigation.

Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings and the following description to refer to the same or similar parts. While several illustrative embodiments are described herein, modifications, adaptations and other implementations are possible. For example, substitutions, additions or modifications may be made to the components illustrated in the drawings, and the illustrative methods described herein may be modified by substituting, reordering, removing, or adding steps to the disclosed methods. Accordingly, the following detailed description is not limited to the disclosed embodiments and examples. Instead, the proper scope is defined by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Autonomous Vehicle Overview</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As used throughout this disclosure, the term &#x201c;autonomous vehicle&#x201d; refers to a vehicle capable of implementing at least one navigational change without driver input. A &#x201c;navigational change&#x201d; refers to a change in one or more of steering, braking, or acceleration of the vehicle. To be autonomous, a vehicle need not be fully automatic (e.g., fully operation without a driver or without driver input). Rather, an autonomous vehicle includes those that can operate under driver control during certain time periods and without driver control during other time periods. Autonomous vehicles may also include vehicles that control only some aspects of vehicle navigation, such as steering (e.g., to maintain a vehicle course between vehicle lane constraints), but may leave other aspects to the driver (e.g., braking). In some cases, autonomous vehicles may handle some or all aspects of braking, speed control, and/or steering of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As human drivers typically rely on visual cues and observations order to control a vehicle, transportation infrastructures are built accordingly, with lane markings, traffic signs, and traffic lights are all designed to provide visual information to drivers. In view of these design characteristics of transportation infrastructures, an autonomous vehicle may include a camera and a processing unit that analyzes visual information captured from the environment of the vehicle. The visual information may include, for example, components of the transportation infrastructure (e.g., lane markings, traffic signs, traffic lights, etc.) that are observable by drivers and other obstacles (e.g., other vehicles, pedestrians, debris, etc.). Additionally, an autonomous vehicle may also use stored information, such as information that provides a model of the vehicle's environment when navigating. For example, the vehicle may use GPS data, sensor data (e.g., from an accelerometer, a speed sensor, a suspension sensor, etc.), and/or other map data to provide information related to its environment while the vehicle is traveling, and the vehicle (as well as other vehicles) may use the information to localize itself on the model.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments in this disclosure, an autonomous vehicle may use information obtained while navigating (e.g., from a camera, GPS device, an accelerometer, a speed sensor, a suspension sensor, etc.). In other embodiments, an autonomous vehicle may use information obtained from past navigations by the vehicle (or by other vehicles) while navigating. In yet other embodiments, an autonomous vehicle may use a combination of information obtained while navigating and information obtained from past navigations. The following sections provide an overview of a system consistent with the disclosed embodiments, following by an overview of a forward-facing imaging system and methods consistent with the system. The sections that follow disclose systems and methods for constructing, using, and updating a sparse map for autonomous vehicle navigation.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">System Overview</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram representation of a system <b>100</b> consistent with the exemplary disclosed embodiments.

These processor designs each include multiple processing units with local memory and instruction sets. Such processors may include video inputs for receiving image data from multiple image sensors and may also include video out capabilities. In one example, the EyeQ2&#xae; uses 90 nm-micron technology operating at 332 Mhz.

Of course, any newer or future EyeQ processing devices may also be used together with the disclosed embodiments.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Any of the processing devices disclosed herein may be configured to perform certain functions. Configuring a processing device, such as any of the described EyeQ processors or other controller or microprocessor, to perform certain functions may include programming of computer executable instructions and making those instructions available to the processing device for execution during operation of the processing device. In some embodiments, configuring a processing device may include programming the processing device directly with architectural instructions. For example, processing devices such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), and the like may be configured using, for example, one or more hardware description languages (HDLs).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In other embodiments, configuring a processing device may include storing executable instructions on a memory that is accessible to the processing device during operation. For example, the processing device may access the memory to obtain and execute the stored instructions during operation. In either case, the processing device configured to perform the sensing, image analysis, and/or navigational functions disclosed herein represents a specialized hardware-based system in control of multiple hardware based components of a host vehicle.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts two separate processing devices included in processing unit <b>110</b>, more or fewer processing devices may be used. For example, in some embodiments, a single processing device may be used to accomplish the tasks of applications processor <b>180</b> and image processor <b>190</b>. In other embodiments, these tasks may be performed by more than two processing devices. Further, in some embodiments, system <b>100</b> may include one or more of processing unit <b>110</b> without including other components, such as image acquisition unit <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Processing unit <b>110</b> may comprise various types of devices.

Systems and methods of generating such a map are discussed below with references to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>19</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may each include any type of device suitable for capturing at least one image from an environment. Moreover, any number of image capture devices may be used to acquire images for input to the image processor. Some embodiments may include only a single image capture device, while other embodiments may include two, three, or even four or more image capture devices. Image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> will be further described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B-<b>2</b>E</figref>, below.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">System <b>100</b>, or various components thereof, may be incorporated into various different platforms. In some embodiments, system <b>100</b> may be included on a vehicle <b>200</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. For example, vehicle <b>200</b> may be equipped with a processing unit <b>110</b> and any of the other components of system <b>100</b>, as described above relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. While in some embodiments vehicle <b>200</b> may be equipped with only a single image capture device (e.g., camera), in other embodiments, such as those discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B-<b>2</b>E</figref>, multiple image capture devices may be used. For example, either of image capture devices <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> of vehicle <b>200</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, may be part of an ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) imaging set.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The image capture devices included on vehicle <b>200</b> as part of the image acquisition unit <b>120</b> may be positioned at any suitable location. In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>E and <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>, image capture device <b>122</b> may be located in the vicinity of the rearview mirror. This position may provide a line of sight similar to that of the driver of vehicle <b>200</b>, which may aid in determining what is and is not visible to the driver. Image capture device <b>122</b> may be positioned at any location near the rearview mirror, but placing image capture device <b>122</b> on the driver side of the mirror may further aid in obtaining images representative of the driver's field of view and/or line of sight.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Other locations for the image capture devices of image acquisition unit <b>120</b> may also be used. For example, image capture device <b>124</b> may be located on or in a bumper of vehicle <b>200</b>. Such a location may be especially suitable for image capture devices having a wide field of view. The line of sight of bumper-located image capture devices can be different from that of the driver and, therefore, the bumper image capture device and driver may not always see the same objects. The image capture devices (e.g., image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>) may also be located in other locations. For example, the image capture devices may be located on or in one or both of the side mirrors of vehicle <b>200</b>, on the roof of vehicle <b>200</b>, on the hood of vehicle <b>200</b>, on the trunk of vehicle <b>200</b>, on the sides of vehicle <b>200</b>, mounted on, positioned behind, or positioned in front of any of the windows of vehicle <b>200</b>, and mounted in or near light figures on the front and/or back of vehicle <b>200</b>, etc.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In addition to image capture devices, vehicle <b>200</b> may include various other components of system <b>100</b>.

Image capture device <b>122</b> may include an optical axis. In one instance, the image capture device <b>122</b> may include an Aptina M9V024 WVGA sensor with a global shutter. In other embodiments, image capture device <b>122</b> may provide a resolution of 1280&#xd7;960 pixels and may include a rolling shutter. Image capture device <b>122</b> may include various optical elements. In some embodiments one or more lenses may be included, for example, to provide a desired focal length and field of view for the image capture device. In some embodiments, image capture device <b>122</b> may be associated with a 6 mm lens or a 12 mm lens. In some embodiments, image capture device <b>122</b> may be configured to capture images having a desired field-of-view (FOV) <b>202</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>. For example, image capture device <b>122</b> may be configured to have a regular FOV, such as within a range of 40 degrees to 56 degrees, including a 46 degree FOV, 50 degree FOV, 52 degree FOV, or greater. Alternatively, image capture device <b>122</b> may be configured to have a narrow FOV in the range of 23 to 40 degrees, such as a 28 degree FOV or 36 degree FOV. In addition, image capture device <b>122</b> may be configured to have a wide FOV in the range of 100 to 180 degrees. In some embodiments, image capture device <b>122</b> may include a wide angle bumper camera or one with up to a 180 degree FOV. In some embodiments, image capture device <b>122</b> may be a 7.2 M pixel image capture device with an aspect ratio of about 2:1 (e.g., H&#xd7;V=3800&#xd7;1900 pixels) with about 100 degree horizontal FOV. Such an image capture device may be used in place of a three image capture device configuration. Due to significant lens distortion, the vertical FOV of such an image capture device may be significantly less than 50 degrees in implementations in which the image capture device uses a radially symmetric lens. For example, such a lens may not be radially symmetric which would allow for a vertical FOV greater than 50 degrees with 100 degree horizontal FOV.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The first image capture device <b>122</b> may acquire a plurality of first images relative to a scene associated with the vehicle <b>200</b>. Each of the plurality of first images may be acquired as a series of image scan lines, which may be captured using a rolling shutter. Each scan line may include a plurality of pixels.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The first image capture device <b>122</b> may have a scan rate associated with acquisition of each of the first series of image scan lines. The scan rate may refer to a rate at which an image sensor can acquire image data associated with each pixel included in a particular scan line.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may contain any suitable type and number of image sensors, including CCD sensors or CMOS sensors, for example. In one embodiment, a CMOS image sensor may be employed along with a rolling shutter, such that each pixel in a row is read one at a time, and scanning of the rows proceeds on a row-by-row basis until an entire image frame has been captured. In some embodiments, the rows may be captured sequentially from top to bottom relative to the frame.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, one or more of the image capture devices (e.g., image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>) disclosed herein may constitute a high resolution imager and may have a resolution greater than 5 M pixel, 7 M pixel, 10 M pixel, or greater.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The use of a rolling shutter may result in pixels in different rows being exposed and captured at different times, which may cause skew and other image artifacts in the captured image frame. On the other hand, when the image capture device <b>122</b> is configured to operate with a global or synchronous shutter, all of the pixels may be exposed for the same amount of time and during a common exposure period. As a result, the image data in a frame collected from a system employing a global shutter represents a snapshot of the entire FOV (such as FOV <b>202</b>) at a particular time. In contrast, in a rolling shutter application, each row in a frame is exposed and data is capture at different times. Thus, moving objects may appear distorted in an image capture device having a rolling shutter. This phenomenon will be described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The second image capture device <b>124</b> and the third image capturing device <b>126</b> may be any type of image capture device. Like the first image capture device <b>122</b>, each of image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> may include an optical axis. In one embodiment, each of image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> may include an Aptina M9V024 WVGA sensor with a global shutter.

Like image capture device <b>122</b>, image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> may be configured to include various lenses and optical elements. In some embodiments, lenses associated with image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> may provide FOVs (such as FOVs <b>204</b> and <b>206</b>) that are the same as, or narrower than, a FOV (such as FOV <b>202</b>) associated with image capture device <b>122</b>. For example, image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> may have FOVs of 40 degrees, 30 degrees, 26 degrees, 23 degrees, 20 degrees, or less.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> may acquire a plurality of second and third images relative to a scene associated with the vehicle <b>200</b>.

The relative positioning of the image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may be selected to aid in fusing together the information acquired from the image capture devices. For example, in some embodiments, a FOV (such as FOV <b>204</b>) associated with image capture device <b>124</b> may overlap partially or fully with a FOV (such as FOV <b>202</b>) associated with image capture device <b>122</b> and a FOV (such as FOV <b>206</b>) associated with image capture device <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may be located on vehicle <b>200</b> at any suitable relative heights. In one instance, there may be a height difference between the image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>, which may provide sufficient parallax information to enable stereo analysis. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the two image capture devices <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> are at different heights. There may also be a lateral displacement difference between image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>, giving additional parallax information for stereo analysis by processing unit <b>110</b>, for example. The difference in the lateral displacement may be denoted by d<sub>x</sub>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>C and <b>2</b>D</figref>. In some embodiments, fore or aft displacement (e.g., range displacement) may exist between image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>. For example, image capture device <b>122</b> may be located 0.5 to 2 meters or more behind image capture device <b>124</b> and/or image capture device <b>126</b>. This type of displacement may enable one of the image capture devices to cover potential blind spots of the other image capture device(s).</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Image capture devices <b>122</b> may have any suitable resolution capability (e.g., number of pixels associated with the image sensor), and the resolution of the image sensor(s) associated with the image capture device <b>122</b> may be higher, lower, or the same as the resolution of the image sensor(s) associated with image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>. In some embodiments, the image sensor(s) associated with image capture device <b>122</b> and/or image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> may have a resolution of 640&#xd7;480, 1024&#xd7;768, 1280&#xd7;960, or any other suitable resolution.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The frame rate (e.g., the rate at which an image capture device acquires a set of pixel data of one image frame before moving on to capture pixel data associated with the next image frame) may be controllable. The frame rate associated with image capture device <b>122</b> may be higher, lower, or the same as the frame rate associated with image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>. The frame rate associated with image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may depend on a variety of factors that may affect the timing of the frame rate. For example, one or more of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may include a selectable pixel delay period imposed before or after acquisition of image data associated with one or more pixels of an image sensor in image capture device <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and/or <b>126</b>. Generally, image data corresponding to each pixel may be acquired according to a clock rate for the device (e.g., one pixel per clock cycle). Additionally, in embodiments including a rolling shutter, one or more of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may include a selectable horizontal blanking period imposed before or after acquisition of image data associated with a row of pixels of an image sensor in image capture device <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and/or <b>126</b>. Further, one or more of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and/or <b>126</b> may include a selectable vertical blanking period imposed before or after acquisition of image data associated with an image frame of image capture device <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">These timing controls may enable synchronization of frame rates associated with image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>, even where the line scan rates of each are different. Additionally, as will be discussed in greater detail below, these selectable timing controls, among other factors (e.g., image sensor resolution, maximum line scan rates, etc.) may enable synchronization of image capture from an area where the FOV of image capture device <b>122</b> overlaps with one or more FOVs of image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>, even where the field of view of image capture device <b>122</b> is different from the FOVs of image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Frame rate timing in image capture device <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may depend on the resolution of the associated image sensors. For example, assuming similar line scan rates for both devices, if one device includes an image sensor having a resolution of 640&#xd7;480 and another device includes an image sensor with a resolution of 1280&#xd7;960, then more time will be required to acquire a frame of image data from the sensor having the higher resolution.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Another factor that may affect the timing of image data acquisition in image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> is the maximum line scan rate. For example, acquisition of a row of image data from an image sensor included in image capture device <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> will require some minimum amount of time. Assuming no pixel delay periods are added, this minimum amount of time for acquisition of a row of image data will be related to the maximum line scan rate for a particular device. Devices that offer higher maximum line scan rates have the potential to provide higher frame rates than devices with lower maximum line scan rates. In some embodiments, one or more of image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> may have a maximum line scan rate that is higher than a maximum line scan rate associated with image capture device <b>122</b>. In some embodiments, the maximum line scan rate of image capture device <b>124</b> and/or <b>126</b> may be 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, or 2 times or more than a maximum line scan rate of image capture device <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In another embodiment, image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may have the same maximum line scan rate, but image capture device <b>122</b> may be operated at a scan rate less than or equal to its maximum scan rate. The system may be configured such that one or more of image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> operate at a line scan rate that is equal to the line scan rate of image capture device <b>122</b>. In other instances, the system may be configured such that the line scan rate of image capture device <b>124</b> and/or image capture device <b>126</b> may be 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, or 2 times or more than the line scan rate of image capture device <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some embodiments, image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may be asymmetric.

The fields of view of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may include any desired area relative to an environment of vehicle <b>200</b>, for example. In some embodiments, one or more of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may be configured to acquire image data from an environment in front of vehicle <b>200</b>, behind vehicle <b>200</b>, to the sides of vehicle <b>200</b>, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Further, the focal length associated with each image capture device <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and/or <b>126</b> may be selectable (e.g., by inclusion of appropriate lenses etc.) such that each device acquires images of objects at a desired distance range relative to vehicle <b>200</b>. For example, in some embodiments image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may acquire images of close-up objects within a few meters from the vehicle. Image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may also be configured to acquire images of objects at ranges more distant from the vehicle (e.g., 25 m, 50 m, 100 m, 150 m, or more). Further, the focal lengths of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may be selected such that one image capture device (e.g., image capture device <b>122</b>) can acquire images of objects relatively close to the vehicle (e.g., within 10 m or within 20 m) while the other image capture devices (e.g., image capture devices <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>) can acquire images of more distant objects (e.g., greater than 20 m, 50 m, 100 m, ISO m, etc.) from vehicle <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">According to some embodiments, the FOV of one or more image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may have a wide angle.

For example, not all components are essential for the operation of system <b>100</b>. Further, any component may be located in any appropriate part of system <b>100</b> and the components may be rearranged into a variety of configurations while providing the functionality of the disclosed embodiments. Therefore, the foregoing configurations are examples and, regardless of the configurations discussed above, system <b>100</b> can provide a wide range of functionality to analyze the surroundings of vehicle <b>200</b> and navigate vehicle <b>200</b> in response to the analysis.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">As discussed below in further detail and consistent with various disclosed embodiments, system <b>100</b> may provide a variety of features related to autonomous driving and/or driver assist technology. For example, system <b>100</b> may analyze image data, position data (e.g., GPS location information), map data, speed data, and/or data from sensors included in vehicle <b>200</b>. System <b>100</b> may collect the data for analysis from, for example, image acquisition unit <b>120</b>, position sensor <b>130</b>, and other sensors. Further, system <b>100</b> may analyze the collected data to determine whether or not vehicle <b>200</b> should take a certain action, and then automatically take the determined action without human intervention. For example, when vehicle <b>200</b> navigates without human intervention, system <b>100</b> may automatically control the braking, acceleration, and/or steering of vehicle <b>200</b> (e.g., by sending control signals to one or more of throttling system <b>220</b>, braking system <b>230</b>, and steering system <b>240</b>). Further, system <b>100</b> may analyze the collected data and issue warnings and/or alerts to vehicle occupants based on the analysis of the collected data. Additional details regarding the various embodiments that are provided by system <b>100</b> are provided below.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Forward-Facing Multi-Imaging System</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">As discussed above, system <b>100</b> may provide drive assist functionality that uses a multi-camera system. The multi-camera system may use one or more cameras facing in the forward direction of a vehicle. In other embodiments, the multi-camera system may include one or more cameras facing to the side of a vehicle or to the rear of the vehicle. In one embodiment, for example, system <b>100</b> may use a two-camera imaging system, where a first camera and a second camera (e.g., image capture devices <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>) may be positioned at the front and/or the sides of a vehicle (e.g., vehicle <b>200</b>). The first camera may have a field of view that is greater than, less than, or partially overlapping with, the field of view of the second camera. In addition, the first camera may be connected to a first image processor to perform monocular image analysis of images provided by the first camera, and the second camera may be connected to a second image processor to perform monocular image analysis of images provided by the second camera. The outputs (e.g., processed information) of the first and second image processors may be combined. In some embodiments, the second image processor may receive images from both the first camera and second camera to perform stereo analysis. In another embodiment, system <b>100</b> may use a three-camera imaging system where each of the cameras has a different field of view. Such a system may, therefore, make decisions based on information derived from objects located at varying distances both forward and to the sides of the vehicle. References to monocular image analysis may refer to instances where image analysis is performed based on images captured from a single point of view (e.g., from a single camera). Stereo image analysis may refer to instances where image analysis is performed based on two or more images captured with one or more variations of an image capture parameter. For example, captured images suitable for performing stereo image analysis may include images captured: from two or more different positions, from different fields of view, using different focal lengths, along with parallax information, etc.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">For example, in one embodiment, system <b>100</b> may implement a three camera configuration using image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>. In such a configuration, image capture device <b>122</b> may provide a narrow field of view (e.g., 34 degrees, or other values selected from a range of about 20 to 45 degrees, etc.), image capture device <b>124</b> may provide a wide field of view (e.g., 150 degrees or other values selected from a range of about 100 to about 180 degrees), and image capture device <b>126</b> may provide an intermediate field of view (e.g., 46 degrees or other values selected from a range of about 35 to about 60 degrees). In some embodiments, image capture device <b>126</b> may act as a main or primary camera. Image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may be positioned behind rearview mirror <b>310</b> and positioned substantially side-by-side (e.g., 6 cm apart). Further, in some embodiments, as discussed above, one or more of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b> may be mounted behind glare shield <b>380</b> that is flush with the windshield of vehicle <b>200</b>. Such shielding may act to minimize the impact of any reflections from inside the car on image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In another embodiment, as discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B and <b>3</b>C</figref>, the wide field of view camera (e.g., image capture device <b>124</b> in the above example) may be mounted lower than the narrow and main field of view cameras (e.g., image devices <b>122</b> and <b>126</b> in the above example). This configuration may provide a free line of sight from the wide field of view camera. To reduce reflections, the cameras may be mounted close to the windshield of vehicle <b>200</b>, and may include polarizers on the cameras to damp reflected light.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">A three camera system may provide certain performance characteristics. For example, some embodiments may include an ability to validate the detection of objects by one camera based on detection results from another camera. In the three camera configuration discussed above, processing unit <b>110</b> may include, for example, three processing devices (e.g., three EyeQ series of processor chips, as discussed above), with each processing device dedicated to processing images captured by one or more of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, and <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In a three camera system, a first processing device may receive images from both the main camera and the narrow field of view camera, and perform vision processing of the narrow FOV camera to, for example, detect other vehicles, pedestrians, lane marks, traffic signs, traffic lights, and other road objects. Further, the first processing device may calculate a disparity of pixels between the images from the main camera and the narrow camera and create a 3D reconstruction of the environment of vehicle <b>200</b>. The first processing device may then combine the 3D reconstruction with 3D map data or with 3D information calculated based on information from another camera.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The second processing device may receive images from main camera and perform vision processing to detect other vehicles, pedestrians, lane marks, traffic signs, traffic lights, and other road objects. Additionally, the second processing device may calculate a camera displacement and, based on the displacement, calculate a disparity of pixels between successive images and create a 3D reconstruction of the scene (e.g., a structure from motion). The second processing device may send the structure from motion based 3D reconstruction to the first processing device to be combined with the stereo 3D images.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The third processing device may receive images from the wide FOV camera and process the images to detect vehicles, pedestrians, lane marks, traffic signs, traffic lights, and other road objects. The third processing device may further execute additional processing instructions to analyze images to identify objects moving in the image, such as vehicles changing lanes, pedestrians, etc.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some embodiments, having streams of image-based information captured and processed independently may provide an opportunity for providing redundancy in the system. Such redundancy may include, for example, using a first image capture device and the images processed from that device to validate and/or supplement information obtained by capturing and processing image information from at least a second image capture device.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In some embodiments, system <b>10</b> may use two image capture devices (e.g., image capture devices <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>) in providing navigation assistance for vehicle <b>200</b> and use a third image capture device (e.g., image capture device <b>126</b>) to provide redundancy and validate the analysis of data received from the other two image capture devices. For example, in such a configuration, image capture devices <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> may provide images for stereo analysis by system <b>100</b> for navigating vehicle <b>200</b>, while image capture device <b>126</b> may provide images for monocular analysis by system <b>100</b> to provide redundancy and validation of information obtained based on images captured from image capture device <b>122</b> and/or image capture device <b>124</b>. That is, image capture device <b>126</b> (and a corresponding processing device) may be considered to provide a redundant sub-system for providing a check on the analysis derived from image capture devices <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> (e.g., to provide an automatic emergency braking (AEB) system). Furthermore, in some embodiments, redundancy and validation of received data may be supplemented based on information received from one more sensors (e.g., radar, lidar, acoustic sensors, information received from one or more transceivers outside of a vehicle, etc.).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">One of skill in the art will recognize that the above camera configurations, camera placements, number of cameras, camera locations, etc., are examples only.

The predetermined patterns may be designed in such a way to achieve a high rate of &#x201c;false hits&#x201d; and a low rate of &#x201c;misses.&#x201d; For example, processing unit <b>110</b> may use a low threshold of similarity to predetermined patterns for identifying candidate objects as possible vehicles or pedestrians.

The Kalman filters may be based on a measurement of an object's scale, where the scale measurement is proportional to a time to collision (e.g., the amount of time for vehicle <b>200</b> to reach the object). Thus, by performing steps <b>540</b>-<b>546</b>, processing unit <b>110</b> may identify vehicles and pedestrians appearing within the set of captured images and derive information (e.g., position, speed, size) associated with the vehicles and pedestrians.

For example, the sparse map may provide sufficient information for navigation without requiring excessive data storage or data transfer rates. As discussed below in further detail, a vehicle (which may be an autonomous vehicle) may use the sparse map to navigate one or more roads. For example, in some embodiments, the sparse map may include data related to a road and potentially landmarks along the road that may be sufficient for vehicle navigation, but which also exhibit small data footprints. For example, the sparse data maps described in detail below may require significantly less storage space and data transfer bandwidth as compared with digital maps including detailed map information, such as image data collected along a road.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">For example, rather than storing detailed representations of a road segment, the sparse data map may store three-dimensional polynomial representations of preferred vehicle paths along a road. These paths may require very little data storage space. Further, in the described sparse data maps, landmarks may be identified and included in the sparse map road model to aid in navigation. These landmarks may be located at any spacing suitable for enabling vehicle navigation, but in some cases, such landmarks need not be identified and included in the model at high densities and short spacings. Rather, in some cases, navigation may be possible based on landmarks that are spaced apart by at least 50 meters, at least 100 meters, at least 500 meters, at least 1 kilometer, or at least 2 kilometers. As will be discussed in more detail in other sections, the sparse map may be generated based on data collected or measured by vehicles equipped with various sensors and devices, such as image capture devices, Global Positioning System sensors, motion sensors, etc., as the vehicles travel along roadways. In some cases, the sparse map may be generated based on data collected during multiple drives of one or more vehicles along a particular roadway.

For example, the disclosed systems and methods may distribute a sparse map for generating a road navigation model for an autonomous vehicle and may navigate an autonomous vehicle along a road segment using a sparse map and/or a generated road navigation model.

For example, rather than including detailed representations of a road, such as road edges, road curvature, images associated with road segments, or data detailing other physical features associated with a road segment, the disclosed embodiments of the sparse map may require relatively little storage space (and relatively little bandwidth when portions of the sparse map are transferred to a vehicle) but may still adequately provide for autonomous vehicle navigation. The small data footprint of the disclosed sparse maps, discussed in further detail below, may be achieved in some embodiments by storing representations of road-related elements that require small amounts of data but still enable autonomous navigation.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">For example, rather than storing detailed representations of various aspects of a road, the disclosed sparse maps may store polynomial representations of one or more trajectories that a vehicle may follow along the road. Thus, rather than storing (or having to transfer) details regarding the physical nature of the road to enable navigation along the road, using the disclosed sparse maps, a vehicle may be navigated along a particular road segment without, in some cases, having to interpret physical aspects of the road, but rather, by aligning its path of travel with a trajectory (e.g., a polynomial spline) along the particular road segment. In this way, the vehicle may be navigated based mainly upon the stored trajectory (e.g., a polynomial spline) that may require much less storage space than an approach involving storage of roadway images, road parameters, road layout, etc.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">In addition to the stored polynomial representations of trajectories along a road segment, the disclosed sparse maps may also include small data objects that may represent a road feature. In some embodiments, the small data objects may include digital signatures, which are derived from a digital image (or a digital signal) that was obtained by a sensor (e.g., a camera or other sensor, such as a suspension sensor) onboard a vehicle traveling along the road segment. The digital signature may have a reduced size relative to the signal that was acquired by the sensor. In some embodiments, the digital signature may be created to be compatible with a classifier function that is configured to detect and to identify the road feature from the signal that is acquired by the sensor, for example, during a subsequent drive. In some embodiments, a digital signature may be created such that the digital signature has a footprint that is as small as possible, while retaining the ability to correlate or match the road feature with the stored signature based on an image (or a digital signal generated by a sensor, if the stored signature is not based on an image and/or includes other data) of the road feature that is captured by a camera onboard a vehicle traveling along the same road segment at a subsequent time.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">In some embodiments, a size of the data objects may be further associated with a uniqueness of the road feature. For example, for a road feature that is detectable by a camera onboard a vehicle, and where the camera system onboard the vehicle is coupled to a classifier that is capable of distinguishing the image data corresponding to that road feature as being associated with a particular type of road feature, for example, a road sign, and where such a road sign is locally unique in that area (e.g., there is no identical road sign or road sign of the same type nearby), it may be sufficient to store data indicating the type of the road feature and its location.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">As will be discussed in further detail below, road features (e.g., landmarks along a road segment) may be stored as small data objects that may represent a road feature in relatively few bytes, while at the same time providing sufficient information for recognizing and using such a feature for navigation. In one example, a road sign may be identified as a recognized landmark on which navigation of a vehicle may be based. A representation of the road sign may be stored in the sparse map to include, e.g., a few bytes of data indicating a type of landmark (e.g., a stop sign) and a few bytes of data indicating a location of the landmark (e.g., coordinates). Navigating based on such data-light representations of the landmarks (e.g., using representations sufficient for locating, recognizing, and navigating based upon the landmarks) may provide a desired level of navigational functionality associated with sparse maps without significantly increasing the data overhead associated with the sparse maps. This lean representation of landmarks (and other road features) may take advantage of the sensors and processors included onboard such vehicles that are configured to detect, identify, and/or classify certain road features.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">When, for example, a sign or even a particular type of a sign is locally unique (e.g., when there is no other sign or no other sign of the same type) in a given area, the sparse map may use data indicating a type of a landmark (a sign or a specific type of sign), and during navigation (e.g., autonomous navigation) when a camera onboard an autonomous vehicle captures an image of the area including a sign (or of a specific type of sign), the processor may process the image, detect the sign (if indeed present in the image), classify the image as a sign (or as a specific type of sign), and correlate the location of the image with the location of the sign as stored in the sparse map.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">Road Feature Representation</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">In some embodiments, a sparse map may include at least one line representation of a road surface feature extending along a road segment and a plurality of landmarks associated with the road segment. In certain aspects, the sparse map may be generated via &#x201c;crowdsourcing,&#x201d; for example, through image analysis of a plurality of images acquired as one or more vehicles traverse the road segment.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">In addition to target trajectories and identified landmarks, a sparse may include information relating to various other road features. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> illustrates a representation of curves along a particular road segment that may be stored in a sparse map. In some embodiments, a single lane of a road may be modeled by a three-dimensional polynomial description of left and right sides of the road. Such polynomials representing left and right sides of a single lane are shown in FIG. RA. Regardless of how many lanes a road may have, the road may be represented using polynomials in a way similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>. For example, left and right sides of a multi-lane road may be represented by polynomials similar to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, and intermediate lane markings included on a multi-lane road (e.g., dashed markings representing lane boundaries, solid yellow lines representing boundaries between lanes traveling in different directions, etc.) may also be represented using polynomials such as those shown in FIG. BA.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, a lane <b>800</b> may be represented using polynomials (e.g., a first order, second order, third order, or any suitable order polynomials). For illustration, lane <b>800</b> is shown as a two-dimensional lane and the polynomials are shown as two-dimensional polynomials. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, lane <b>800</b> includes a left side <b>810</b> and a right side <b>820</b>. In some embodiments, more than one polynomial may be used to represent a location of each side of the road or lane boundary. For example, each of left side <b>810</b> and right side <b>820</b> may be represented by a plurality of polynomials of any suitable length. In some cases, the polynomials may have a length of about 100 m, although other lengths greater than or less than 100 m may also be used. Additionally, the polynomials can overlap with one another in order to facilitate seamless transitions in navigating based on subsequently encountered polynomials as a host vehicle travels along a roadway. For example, each of left side <b>810</b> and right side <b>820</b> may be represented by a plurality of third order polynomials separated into segments of about 100 meters in length (an example of the first predetermined range), and overlapping each other by about 50 meters. The polynomials representing the left side <b>810</b> and the right side <b>820</b> may or may not have the same order. For example, in some embodiments, some polynomials may be second order polynomials, some may be third order polynomials, and some may be fourth order polynomials.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, left side <b>810</b> of lane <b>800</b> is represented by two groups of third order polynomials. The first group includes polynomial segments <b>911</b>, <b>812</b>, and <b>813</b>. The second group includes polynomial segments <b>814</b>, <b>815</b>, and <b>816</b>. The two groups, while substantially parallel to each other, follow the locations of their respective sides of the road. Polynomial segments <b>811</b>, <b>812</b>, <b>813</b>, <b>814</b>, <b>815</b>, and <b>816</b> have a length of about 100 meters and overlap adjacent segments in the series by about 50 meters. As noted previously, however, polynomials of different lengths and different overlap amounts may also be used. For example, the polynomials may have lengths of 500 m, 1 km, or more, and the overlap amount may vary from 0 to 50 m, 50 m to 100 m, or greater than 100 m. Additionally, while FIG. <b>8</b>A is shown as representing polynomials extending in 2D space (e.g., on the surface of the paper), it is to be understood that these polynomials may represent curves extending in three dimensions (e.g., including a height component) to represent elevation changes in a road segment in addition to X-Y curvature. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, right side <b>820</b> of lane <b>800</b> is further represented by a first group having polynomial segments <b>821</b>, <b>822</b>, and <b>823</b> and a second group having polynomial segments <b>824</b>, <b>825</b>, and <b>826</b>.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">Returning to the target trajectories of a sparse map, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> shows a three-dimensional polynomial representing a target trajectory for a vehicle traveling along a particular road segment. The target trajectory represents not only the X-Y path that a host vehicle should travel along a particular road segment, but also the elevation change that the host vehicle will experience when traveling along the road segment. Thus, each target trajectory in a sparse map may be represented by one or more three-dimensional polynomials, like the three-dimensional polynomial <b>850</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>. A sparse map may include a plurality of trajectories (e.g., millions or billions or more to represent trajectories of vehicles along various road segments along roadways throughout the world). In some embodiments, each target trajectory may correspond to a spline connecting three-dimensional polynomial segments.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">Regarding the data footprint of polynomial curves stored in a sparse map, in some embodiments, each third degree polynomial may be represented by four parameters, each requiring four bytes of data. Suitable representations may be obtained with third degree polynomials requiring about 192 bytes of data for every 100 m. This may translate to approximately 200 kB per hour in data usage/transfer requirements for a host vehicle traveling approximately 100 km/hr.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">A sparse map may describe the lanes network using a combination of geometry descriptors and meta-data. The geometry may be described by polynomials or splines as described above. The meta-data may describe the number of lanes, special characteristics (such as a car pool lane), and possibly other sparse labels. The total footprint of such indicators may be negligible.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">Accordingly, a sparse map according to embodiments of the present disclosure may include at least one line representation of a road surface feature extending along the road segment, each line representation representing a path along the road segment substantially corresponding with the road surface feature. In some embodiments, as discussed above, the at least one line representation of the road surface feature may include a spline, a polynomial representation, or a curve. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the road surface feature may include at least one of a road edge or a lane marking. Moreover, as discussed below with respect to &#x201c;crowdsourcing,&#x201d; the road surface feature may be identified through image analysis of a plurality of images acquired as one or more vehicles traverse the road segment.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> shows polynomial representations of trajectories captured during a process of building or maintaining a sparse map.

In some embodiments, the polynomial representation of the target trajectory included in a sparse map may be an aggregation of two or more reconstructed trajectories of prior traversals of vehicles along the same road segment. In some embodiments, the polynomial representation of the target trajectory included in a sparse map may be an average of the two or more reconstructed trajectories of prior traversals of vehicles along the same road segment. Other mathematical operations may also be used to construct a target trajectory along a road path based on reconstructed trajectories collected from vehicles traversing along a road segment.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, a road segment <b>900</b> may be travelled by a number of vehicles <b>200</b> at different times. Each vehicle <b>200</b> may collect data relating to a path that the vehicle took along the road segment. The path traveled by a particular vehicle may be determined based on camera data, accelerometer information, speed sensor information, and/or GPS information, among other potential sources. Such data may be used to reconstruct trajectories of vehicles traveling along the road segment, and based on these reconstructed trajectories, a target trajectory (or multiple target trajectories) may be determined for the particular road segment. Such target trajectories may represent a preferred path of a host vehicle (e.g., guided by an autonomous navigation system) as the vehicle travels along the road segment.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, a first reconstructed trajectory <b>901</b> may be determined based on data received from a first vehicle traversing road segment <b>900</b> at a first time period (e.g., day 1), a second reconstructed trajectory <b>902</b> may be obtained from a second vehicle traversing road segment <b>900</b> at a second time period (e.g., day 2), and a third reconstructed trajectory <b>903</b> may be obtained from a third vehicle traversing road segment <b>900</b> at a third time period (e.g., day 3). Each trajectory <b>901</b>, <b>902</b>, and <b>903</b> may be represented by a polynomial, such as a three-dimensional polynomial. It should be noted that in some embodiments, any of the reconstructed trajectories may be assembled onboard the vehicles traversing road segment <b>900</b>.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">Additionally, or alternatively, such reconstructed trajectories may be determined on a server side based on information received from vehicles traversing road segment <b>900</b>. For example, in some embodiments, vehicles <b>200</b> may transmit data to one or more servers relating to their motion along road segment <b>900</b> (e.g., steering angle, heading, time, position, speed, sensed road geometry, and/or sensed landmarks, among things). The server may reconstruct trajectories for vehicles <b>200</b> based on the received data. The server may also generate a target trajectory for guiding navigation of autonomous vehicle that will travel along the same road segment <b>900</b> at a later time based on the first, second, and third trajectories <b>901</b>, <b>902</b>, and <b>903</b>. While a target trajectory may be associated with a single prior traversal of a road segment, in some embodiments, each target trajectory included in a sparse map may be determined based on two or more reconstructed trajectories of vehicles traversing the same road segment.

Road segment <b>930</b> may include a two-lane road, each lane being designated for a different direction of travel. Geographic region <b>911</b> may also include other road features, such as a stop line <b>932</b>, a stop sign <b>934</b>, a speed limit sign <b>936</b>, and a hazard sign <b>938</b>.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, a sparse map may include a local map <b>940</b> including a road model for assisting with autonomous navigation of vehicles within geographic region <b>911</b>. For example, local map <b>940</b> may include target trajectories for one or more lanes associated with road segments <b>920</b> and/or <b>930</b> within geographic region <b>911</b>. For example, local map <b>940</b> may include target trajectories <b>941</b> and/or <b>942</b> that an autonomous vehicle may access or rely upon when traversing lanes <b>922</b>. Similarly, local map <b>940</b> may include target trajectories <b>943</b> and/or <b>944</b> that an autonomous vehicle may access or rely upon when traversing lanes <b>924</b>. Further, local map <b>940</b> may include target trajectories <b>945</b> and/or <b>946</b> that an autonomous vehicle may access or rely upon when traversing road segment <b>930</b>. Target trajectory <b>947</b> represents a preferred path an autonomous vehicle should follow when transitioning from lanes <b>920</b> (and specifically, relative to target trajectory <b>941</b> associated with a right-most lane of lanes <b>920</b>) to road segment <b>930</b> (and specifically, relative to a target trajectory <b>945</b> associated with a first side of road segment <b>930</b>. Similarly, target trajectory <b>948</b> represents a preferred path an autonomous vehicle should follow when transitioning from road segment <b>930</b> (and specifically, relative to target trajectory <b>946</b>) to a portion of road segment <b>924</b> (and specifically, as shown, relative to a target trajectory <b>943</b> associated with a left lane of lanes <b>924</b>.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">A sparse map may also include representations of other road-related features associated with geographic region <b>911</b>. For example, a sparse map may also include representations of one or more landmarks identified in geographic region <b>911</b>. Such landmarks may include a first landmark <b>950</b> associated with stop line <b>932</b>, a second landmark <b>952</b> associated with stop sign <b>934</b>, a third landmark associated with speed limit sign <b>954</b>, and a fourth landmark <b>956</b> associated with hazard sign <b>938</b>. Such landmarks may be used, for example, to assist an autonomous vehicle in determining its current location relative to any of the shown target trajectories, such that the vehicle may adjust its heading to match a direction of the target trajectory at the determined location.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">In some embodiments, a sparse map may also include road signature profiles. Such road signature profiles may be associated with any discernible/measurable variation in at least one parameter associated with a road. For example, in some cases, such profiles may be associated with variations in road surface information such as variations in surface roughness of a particular road segment, variations in road width over a particular road segment, variations in distances between dashed lines painted along a particular road segment, variations in road curvature along a particular road segment, etc. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref> shows an example of a road signature profile <b>960</b>. While profile <b>960</b> may represent any of the parameters mentioned above, or others, in one example, profile <b>960</b> may represent a measure of road surface roughness, as obtained, for example, by monitoring one or more sensors providing outputs indicative of an amount of suspension displacement as a vehicle travels a particular road segment.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">Alternatively or concurrently, profile <b>960</b> may represent variation in road width, as determined based on image data obtained via a camera onboard a vehicle traveling a particular road segment. Such profiles may be useful, for example, in determining a particular location of an autonomous vehicle relative to a particular target trajectory. That is, as it traverses a road segment, an autonomous vehicle may measure a profile associated with one or more parameters associated with the road segment. If the measured profile can be correlated/matched with a predetermined profile that plots the parameter variation with respect to position along the road segment, then the measured and predetermined profiles may be used (e.g., by overlaying corresponding sections of the measured and predetermined profiles) in order to determine a current position along the road segment and, therefore, a current position relative to a target trajectory for the road segment.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">In some embodiments, a sparse map may include different trajectories based on different characteristics associated with a user of autonomous vehicles, environmental conditions, and/or other parameters relating to driving. For example, in some embodiments, different trajectories may be generated based on different user preferences and/or profiles. A sparse map including such different trajectories may be provided to different autonomous vehicles of different users. For example, some users may prefer to avoid toll roads, while others may prefer to take the shortest or fastest routes, regardless of whether there is a toll road on the route. The disclosed systems may generate different sparse maps with different trajectories based on such different user preferences or profiles. As another example, some users may prefer to travel in a fast moving lane, while others may prefer to maintain a position in the central lane at all times.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">Different trajectories may be generated and included in a sparse map based on different environmental conditions, such as day and night, snow, rain, fog, etc. Autonomous vehicles driving under different environmental conditions may be provided with a sparse map generated based on such different environmental conditions. In some embodiments, cameras provided on autonomous vehicles may detect the environmental conditions, and may provide such information back to a server that generates and provides sparse maps. For example, the server may generate or update an already generated a sparse map to include trajectories that may be more suitable or safer for autonomous driving under the detected environmental conditions. The update of a sparse map based on environmental conditions may be performed dynamically as the autonomous vehicles are traveling along roads.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">Other different parameters relating to driving may also be used as a basis for generating and providing different sparse maps to different autonomous vehicles. For example, when an autonomous vehicle is traveling at a high speed, turns may be tighter. Trajectories associated with specific lanes, rather than roads, may be included in a sparse map such that the autonomous vehicle may maintain within a specific lane as the vehicle follows a specific trajectory. When an image captured by a camera onboard the autonomous vehicle indicates that the vehicle has drifted outside of the lane (e.g., crossed the lane mark), an action may be triggered within the vehicle to bring the vehicle back to the designated lane according to the specific trajectory.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates an example autonomous vehicle road navigation model represented by a plurality of three dimensional splines <b>1001</b>, <b>1002</b>, and <b>1003</b>.

Each polynomial may be a first order polynomial, a second order polynomial, a third order polynomial, or a combination of any suitable polynomials having different orders. Each data point <b>1010</b> may be associated with the navigation information received from a plurality of vehicles. In some embodiments, each data point <b>1010</b> may be associated with data related to landmarks (e.g., size, location, and identification information of landmarks) and/or road signature profiles (e.g., road geometry, road roughness profile, road curvature profile, road width profile).

To account for errors in the location data <b>1110</b> and for differing locations of vehicles within the same lane (e.g., one vehicle may drive closer to the left of a lane than another), a remote server may generate a map skeleton <b>1120</b> using one or more statistical techniques to determine whether variations in the raw location data <b>1110</b> represent actual divergences or statistical errors. Each path within skeleton <b>1120</b> may be linked back to the raw data <b>1110</b> that formed the path. For example, the path between A and B within skeleton <b>1120</b> is linked to raw data <b>1110</b> from drives 2, 3, 4, and 5 but not from drive 1. Skeleton <b>1120</b> may not be detailed enough to be used to navigate a vehicle (e.g., because it combines drives from multiple lanes on the same road unlike the splines described above) but may provide useful topological information and may be used to define intersections.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">Dual Sensor Readout Channel Allowing for Frequency Detection</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">Autonomous vehicle (AV) and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) may detect and classify various different types of light sources in an environment in order to more effectively make driving decisions that keep passengers and surrounding road users and road infrastructure safe. As used herein, a light source refers to any object or device capable of emitting light. Such light sources may include, for example, street lights, traffic lights, lights associated with other vehicles (e.g., headlights, tail lights, running lights, fog lights, etc.), lights associated with buildings, and any other type of light or lamp that may be found in an environment of a vehicle. Light sources may include a variety of different types of lighting, such as halogen lamps, LEDs, lasers, or the like, and may be arranged in various configurations, such as matrix lights, pixel lights, adaptive lights, etc. The light emitted by the light sources may include light having a wavelength that is visible to humans. Alternatively or additionally, the light may be in wavelengths that are not visible, such as infrared or ultraviolet light.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">Detection of light sources in a vehicle environment may be enabled using any of a wide variety of sensors. In some cases, one or more cameras may be installed on a vehicle to acquire images representative of the environment around the vehicle. One or more processors may execute instructions to analyze the acquired images as a basis for detection of the light sources. For example, processing unit <b>110</b> may be configured to receive and analyze images captured by image acquisition unit <b>120</b>, as described above. The one or more processors may be configured to not only detect light sources in the vehicle environment, but also to determine other information associated with the detected light sources. For example, based on image analysis (including analysis of a single acquired image or analysis of a plurality of acquired images, such as a stream of acquired images), the one or more processors may determine information such as a type or classification associated with the detected light source, a frequency of flicker, a brightness or intensity level, a color, a size, a shape, an orientation relative to other light sources or infrastructure, or any other characteristic that may be associated with the detected light sources.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">In some cases, a camera (one of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, or <b>126</b>) onboard a vehicle may be configured to facilitate identification of certain types of light sources. For example, detected light sources may be characterized and/or identified based on whether the light sources flicker. Many light sources operating based on oscillating AC power may exhibit flickering at a characteristic frequency (e.g., 50 Hz, 60 Hz, etc.). The frequency of the flickering can be associated with the power source used or can be set according to a desired operating frequency. Such light sources may include traffic lights, building lights, street lights, etc. In other cases, however, detected light sources, such as lights associated with vehicles (headlights, tail lights, etc.) may be non-flickering, as they may draw DC power from one or more batteries associated with the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">An onboard camera may be configured with one or more characteristics that facilitate identification and characterization of light sources based on detected flicker. For example, a frame capture rate associated with the camera may be selected based on an expected flicker rate of certain light sources the system is likely to encounter in a vehicle environment. In some cases, an onboard camera may be configured to operate at a frame capture frequency (e.g., 18 Hz) that is different from oscillating (sinusoidal) light sources expected to be encountered (e.g., 50 Hz, 60 Hz, etc.). Further, the frame capture rate for an onboard camera may be selected such that it does not constitute a harmonic of the expected flicker frequencies of those light sources. Such a configuration may enable sampling, via the acquired images, of different and varying points along an oscillating cycle of a flickering light. That is, some images may be acquired at or near when a flickering light source achieves maximum brightness, other images may be acquired at or near when a flickering light source achieves minimum brightness, and still other images may be acquired at various points along the cycle as a flickering light source transitions from an off state to an on state or from an on state to an off state.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">Oscillating light sources may be identified based on analysis of acquired images by examining differences relative to detected light sources from image to image. For example, by taking advantage of the fact that the camera may operate at a frame capture frequency other than certain harmonics of the light flicker frequency (e.g., 1, &#xbd;, &#xbc;, &#x215b;, etc. or 2, &#x2153;, etc. for sinusoidally oscillating light sources) such that different light intensity values for the lights sources may be captured in two or more different acquired images, a system may detect flickering light source. Further, the system may determine the type of light source (e.g., traffic light, street light, etc.) by analyzing one or more characteristics of observed light flicker characteristics (e.g., flicker rate, light intensity patterns over a particular flicker cycle, etc.) across captured images. That is, the AV or ADAS system may identify light sources at least in part by recognizing light flicker across captured images and/or detecting certain aspects of the light flicker across captured images. Additionally, image sensor integration times may be selected to enhance detection of flicker and/or flicker characteristics. For example, the image sensor may operate using integration times short enough such that the image sensor can sample different phases of the light flicker cycle.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">While the frame capture rates described above may enable a system to automatically detect and analyze flickering light sources, these frame capture rates may not be suitable for other applications. For example, images that are captured at a frame rate suitable for analysis to detect and identify flickering light sources may not be suitable or desirable for use in human viewing applications (e.g., where a human may be presented with a stream of the captured images). In human viewing applications, such as heads up displays or any other type of video feed, the human viewer may not want to view representations of captured light sources that reveal their flickering nature or characteristics. In fact, in some cases, showing a human user representations of a light source that at some points in the video stream are &#x201c;on&#x201d; or bright and then at other times are &#x201c;off&#x201d; or dim may be distracting to the user or, worse, may hinder the human user in recognizing the light source or reacting to the light source appropriately. After all, a flicker frequency of 60 Hz is typically not discernable to the human viewer. Thus, ordinarily, human viewers are not accustomed to viewing or perceiving, for example, the flicker characteristics of traffic lights or street lamps. Making such flicker characteristics discernable to human viewers (e.g., in a heads up display reliant upon a camera with a frame capture rate designed to accentuate the flicker characteristics, as described above) can not only be distracting for the human viewer, but may also impact the human user's ability to properly recognize or react to certain light sources.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">One potential solution for providing captured images suitable for use in human viewer applications may include operating an image capture device with image sensor integration times long enough for a particular frame capture rate to smooth the effects of light flickering. That is, for a fame capture rate (e.g., 18 Hz) less than a light flickering rate (e.g., 60 Hz), the sensor integration time may be selected such that a significant portion of the flicker cycle is captured during the integration time (e.g., a complete cycle, &#xbe; of a cycle, etc.) This technique, however, would reduce the ability of AV or ADAS system to detect flickering light sources and/or identify characteristics of the flickering light sources. This technique would also reduce the system's ability to classify between flickering and non-flickering light sources when analyzing images. Accordingly, there is a need for a system capable of providing images suitable for detecting flickering in light sources along with images suitable for other applications in which detecting flickering is undesirable. For example, a system may be provided that can capture images that are suitable for both computer vision analysis and human viewing.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">To address these issues and provide video feeds more suitable for human viewing, a frame capture rate of an image capture device may be selected such that effects of light flicker are eliminated or reduced in the captured images. In some embodiments, an additional camera dedicated to capturing images for use in human viewer applications may be provided. Such a solution, however, would add additional expense, especially where a certain platform such as an AV or ADAS system already includes a camera for capturing images. Moreover, separate image acquisition devices for an AV or ADAS system versus human viewer systems may present other issues. For example, where it is desired to have alignment or correlation between the image capture devices of the human viewer system(s) and the AV or ADAS systems, additional expense and/or complexity would be introduced in developing solutions to ensure that the image capture devices are initially aligned and then remain aligned during use.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">Significant benefits in cost reduction and complexity reduction may be realized, for example, if human viewer systems could rely upon the same image capture device used by the AV/ADAS system. To provide image streams suitable for use by the AV/ADAS system (e.g., image streams that accentuate flickering light sources) and for use in human viewer applications (e.g., image streams that reduce or eliminate the effects of flickering light sources), the disclosed embodiments may be equipped with an ability to provide two streams of images. One image stream may be captured at a frame rate suitable for use in human viewer applications (e.g., 30 Hz, etc.), and the other image stream may be captured at a frame rate suitable for AV/ADAS systems (e.g., 18 Hz, etc.). In this way, using a single image capture device, the image stream provided to the AV/ADAS system may facilitate detection and analysis of flickering light sources by the AV/ADAS system. On the other hand, the image stream provided for use in human viewer applications may provide a human (e.g., a driver or passenger) with a view of the environment, for example, without discernable flickering of light sources captured in the images.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">Disclosed systems and methods may operate a camera with two image capture readout channels. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates an example system <b>1200</b> with two image capture readout channels, consistent with the disclosed embodiments. System <b>1200</b> may include a camera <b>1210</b> configured to capture images from an environment of a host vehicle. For example, camera <b>1210</b> may correspond to one of image capture devices <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, or <b>126</b>, described above. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, may provide image date through a first or primary channel <b>1222</b> and a second or secondary channel <b>1232</b>. Images received from camera <b>1210</b> through channel <b>1222</b> may be used to detect flickering and non-flickering light sources in an environment of the host vehicle, as described above. For example, channel <b>1222</b> may provide images to a light source detection component <b>1220</b>. Light source detection component <b>1220</b> may be any form of device or component associated with detection of light sources. In some embodiments, light source detection component <b>1220</b> may be a module containing instructions, which, when executed by a processor, cause the processor to detect flickering and non-flickering light sources in an environment of the host vehicle. For example, light source detection component <b>1220</b> may be a module or component of memory <b>140</b> or <b>150</b> described above. In some embodiments, light source detection component <b>1220</b> may include one or more dedicated processors. Alternatively, or additionally, light source detection component <b>1220</b> may utilize processing unit <b>110</b> or another processor of a host vehicle for detecting light sources. Channel <b>1222</b> may use an image capture frequency that differs from flicker frequencies associated with typical oscillating light sources. For example, images associated with channel <b>122</b> may be captured at a frame rate suitable for AV/ADAS systems (e.g., 18 Hz, etc.).</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">Images received from camera <b>1210</b> through channel <b>1223</b> may be used for showing on one or more human-viewable displays, such as display device <b>1230</b>. As used herein, a human-viewable display refers to any device capable of displaying one or more images to a human user. For example, a human-viewable display may include heads-up display, a dashboard display screen, console displays, foldable displays, or any other form of display device that may be viewed by a user. In some embodiments, the human-viewable display may be included on a device separate from the vehicle, such as a mobile phone or other mobile device, a computing device (e.g., a tablet, laptop, or desktop computer), or the like. In some embodiments, the images provided through channel <b>1232</b> may be displayed in real-time or near-real-time. Alternatively, or additionally, the images may be stored for display on the human-viewable display at a later time. Accordingly, while channels <b>1222</b> and <b>1232</b> are shown connecting directly to light source detection component <b>1220</b> and display device <b>1230</b>, one or more intermediate components not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> may be included. For example, the images may be preprocessed, stored in a storage device, or otherwise interacted with prior to analysis using light source detection component <b>1220</b> or display using display device <b>1230</b>.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">In some embodiments, the channel <b>1232</b> may be associated with a frame capture rate that ensures that a consistent illumination level is acquired at most or all of the captured images. For example, assuming a 60 Hz light source oscillation frequency, channel <b>1232</b> may capture images at a rate of about 60 Hz, 30 Hz, 15 Hz, or even 120 Hz, 20 Hz, etc. The primary channel and the secondary channel may both be supplied by the output of the same image capture device (e.g., camera <b>1210</b>). In other words, in order to provide the primary channel, the image capture device output may be sampled at about 18 Hz (or another frequency selected to accentuate the effects of a light source flickering at 60 Hz), while the secondary channel may be provided by sampling the output of the image capture device at 30 fps/30 Hz or any other frequency where the illumination level of the light source appears constant or nearly constant across the captured images. Accordingly, this dual channel readout system may provide an image stream (i.e., the secondary channel) suitable for output to a human viewable display, while also providing an image stream (i.e., the primary channel) that allows the system to detect flickering light sources and identify characteristics associated with the flickering light source.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating example image capture rates for a primary and secondary channel relative to a light source, consistent with the disclosed embodiments. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, a light source <b>1310</b> may be a flickering light source and may have an oscillating frequency indicated by waveform <b>1312</b>. In some embodiments, waveform <b>1312</b> may be a sinusoidal waveform, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. However, the present disclosure is not limited to any particular type of light source or waveform, and various other types of waveforms may equally be used. In some embodiments, waveform <b>1312</b> may correspond to an expected light-generation waveform. For example, flickering light sources may commonly operate at a particular frequency or range of frequencies. For example, in some embodiments a light source may typically operate at a frequency between about 45 Hz and about 65 Hz (e.g., at 60 Hz), however other suitable frequencies or ranges of frequencies may be used.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">As described above, channel <b>1232</b> may be associated with images captured for human viewing. Accordingly, images associated with channel <b>1232</b> may be captured at an interval i<sub>a </sub>suited for human viewing, as described above. For example, channel <b>1232</b> may operate at a frequency of 30 Hz. Interval i<sub>a </sub>(and thus the frequency of images captured for channel <b>1232</b>) may be selected to coincide with common amplitude levels or intensity levels of waveform <b>1312</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, each of the images capture points <b>1332</b> associated with channel <b>1232</b> may be associated with the same or similar amplitudes of waveform <b>1312</b> (and thus the same or similar light intensities of light source <b>1310</b>). Accordingly, when viewed by a human user, the intensity of light source <b>1310</b> may appear relatively constant. For example, the light intensity of a light source in an image may be within a certain percentage range of the light intensity of the light source in a previous image (e.g., plus or minus 20%, 50%, or any other suitable range). In some embodiments, the capture frequency of images associated with channel <b>1232</b> may be the same as the frequency of waveform <b>1312</b>. Alternatively, or additionally, the capture frequency may be a harmonic of the frequency of waveform <b>1312</b>, as described above. A harmonic may be any frequency in which common amplitude levels or intensity levels of waveform <b>1312</b> would be sampled, such as a positive integer multiple of the frequency of waveform <b>1312</b>. For example, if waveform <b>1312</b> has a frequency of 60 Hz, images for channel <b>1232</b> may be sampled at 30 Hz, 120 Hz or other harmonic frequencies. In some embodiments, an expected light generation waveform frequency may be specified in the system. For example, light sources may commonly have a frequency of 60 Hz and thus interval i<sub>a </sub>may be set based on this expected frequency. In some embodiments, the expected frequency configuration may be modified or adjusted as needed.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">As described above, channel <b>1222</b> may be associated with images captured for analysis by computer vision (AV or ADAS systems). Accordingly, images associated with channel <b>1222</b> may be captured at an interval i<sub>b </sub>suited for detecting flickering light sources, as described above. For example, channel <b>1222</b> may operate at a frequency of 18 Hz. Interval i<sub>b </sub>(and thus the frequency of images captured for channel <b>1222</b>) may be selected to coincide with different amplitude levels or intensity levels of waveform <b>1312</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, each of the image capture points <b>1322</b> associated with channel <b>1232</b> may be associated with the differing amplitudes of waveform <b>1312</b> (and thus differing intensities of light source <b>1310</b>). Accordingly, the differences in light intensities may be used to detect flickering light sources as described above. Accordingly, the capture frequency of images associated with channel <b>1222</b> may be a non-harmonic frequency of the frequency of waveform <b>1312</b>. A non-harmonic frequency may refer to any frequency that is not synchronized with the frequency of waveform <b>1312</b>.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">In some embodiments, channels <b>1222</b> and <b>1232</b> may be associated with different electrical pathways (e.g., wires, circuits, cables, etc.). Alternatively or additionally, channels <b>1222</b> and <b>1232</b> may share a common electrical property. For example, the disclosed systems and methods may capture a stream of images that include image frames captured at both the frequencies of channel <b>1222</b> and channel <b>1232</b> (e.g., at 30 Hz and 18 Hz). The images captured for the first channel (e.g., captured at 30 Hz) and the images captured for the second channel (e.g., captured at 18 Hz) may be interleaved. This technique is possible at the time (e.g., 15 ms) when the image sensor is not being used during capture of images at 30 Hz may be used to capture images sampled at 18 Hz. The use of 18 Hz and 30 Hz is one example. The disclosed systems and methods may use other suitable frequencies having a phase variation to detect light flicker and to provide images for human viewing. In some embodiments, the frequencies of channel <b>1222</b> and <b>1232</b> may be adjusted dynamically to improve detection light sources or a viewing experience for a user, respectively.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">In some embodiments, the system may automatically or, in response to a user command, turn off the dual sampling during daytime when light sources are not typically illuminated and/or distinguishable in images. Accordingly, in a daytime mode, the system may operate at 30 Hz without also including an 18 Hz channel.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">In some embodiments, the system may use integration times for images associated with channels <b>1222</b> and <b>1232</b> such that the images are suitable for their intended purpose. As used herein, an integration time refers to a length of time during which a sensing element of an image sensor device collects photons before transferring an accumulated charge for processing. In embodiments where an image capture device includes an electronic shutter, the integration time may correspond to the shutter time. Images captured using a shorter integration time may therefore have a lower saturation level compared to images captured using a longer integration time. Channel <b>1222</b> may be associated with an integration time short enough to enable detection of differences in illumination levels at different times during an oscillation cycle of a flickering light source. Channel <b>1232</b> may have the same integration time as channel <b>1222</b> or may use a different integration time. For example, channel <b>1232</b> may use a longer integration time to improve image characteristics for display on display device <b>1230</b>.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206">In some embodiments, the system may implement a variable exposure based on detected light. In other words, the integration times may be variable and may be adjusted dynamically by the system. For example, the system may increase or decrease the integration time of channel <b>1232</b> if the system can detect oscillations in light intensity in the images. Similarly, the system may adjust the integration time for channel <b>1222</b> to improve detection of oscillations in light sources. In some embodiments, the integration times (or frequencies) may be adjusted manually by a user, for example, through a user interface. In some embodiments, adjustment of the sensor integration time may be based on feedback received by the system. In some embodiments, the feedback may include a saturation level or other properties associated with a sensor of the camera. As another example, the feedback may be a detected property of a light source or other object in the environment of the vehicle. For example, the system may detect a light intensity level of a flickering or non-flickering light source and may adjust the integration time based on the detected light intensity. As another example, the system may detect an oscillation frequency of a flickering light source and may adjust the integration time based on the detected oscillation frequency.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">In some embodiments, the image sensor may operate two virtual channel readouts at the same time. Additionally, the system may include separate integration controls for each channel and adjustable gaps (e.g., frequencies) between capturing each image in an image stream. For example, channel <b>1232</b> may be associated with an integration time (e.g., 15 ms, etc.) such that sampling images for channel <b>1222</b> does not interfere with the integration time for channel <b>1232</b>, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">In some embodiments, the off-frequency channel (e.g., channel <b>1222</b>) may operate at a lower frequency than the channel used for displays (e.g., channel <b>1232</b>). The controller for camera <b>1210</b> may keep the secondary viewing channel at a constant frequency. In some cases, the system may adjust the start of the second channel to operate within a window of time that begins after the viewing image has started and before the integration time starts of the next viewing image. The control algorithm may adjust the sample frequency such that the off-frequency capture is maintained and may occasionally control the camera such that the off-frequency image is not placed within the window between human viewable images. In some embodiments, the disclosed systems and methods may pass these off-frequency images to an algorithm to classify the captured images by light level and oscillation.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">In some cases, if the light source has saturated within the off-frequency image or if a light source in the captured image(s) appears too dim, then it may not be possible to measure the oscillations. In these cases, the algorithm may instruct the system to change the integration time of the off-frequency image (e.g., the 18 Hz image stream) to accentuate the effects of light source flicker or to detect flickering light sources more easily. The camera control may then narrow the allowed time window between frames specifying when this off-frequency image may start. In this way, the disclosed system may provide dual image capture streams where each image capture stream may be associated with a different image capture rate and where the images captured for each image capture stream may be captured using selectable, variable exposure levels (either increasing or decreasing according to various types of feedback, such as detected brightness of a particular light source and whether oscillations may be detected and/or characterized).</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">In some embodiments, the viewing channel readout may maintain a constant frame rate and may capture images suitable for human viewable displays while the images of the secondary channel are interleaved within the available time window between the human viewable images. This two-channel output along with the control algorithm may determine the placement of the off-frequency images so that the captured image stream includes images for both AV and ADAS application as well as for human viewers (e.g., a driver or passenger) who want to view the images on a display. Additionally, in some cases, the light detection algorithm may analyze one or more human viewable images to improve its confidence level in detecting flickering lights as the system may capture the human viewable images at a longer integration time such that the captured images will have lower levels of flickering. For example, the disclosed systems and methods may adjust the exposure of the human viewable images without causing the image sensor to operate such that the system cannot detect a flickering light source.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">In some cases, an image capture event associated with the primary stream (e.g., the 30 Hz image stream) may be scheduled to occur at the same time as an image capture event associated with the secondary image capture stream (e.g., the 18 Hz image stream). In such cases, one of the image capture events (e.g., the 18 Hz image capture event) may be dropped, and the image capture via the other image capture event may be used for both streams.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates an example sequence of images that may be captured by camera <b>1210</b> for each of a primary and secondary channel, consistent with the disclosed embodiments. For example, channel <b>1232</b> may be associated with image capture points <b>1430</b>, <b>1432</b>, and <b>1434</b>, and channel <b>1222</b> may be associated with image capture points <b>1420</b>, <b>1422</b>, and <b>1424</b>. Image capture point <b>1430</b> may be scheduled to occur at the same time as image capture point <b>1420</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. Accordingly, camera <b>1210</b> may capture a single image <b>1410</b>, which may be used for both channel <b>1222</b> and <b>1232</b>. In some embodiments, if different image properties (e.g., based on integration time, etc.) are used for channels <b>1222</b> and <b>1232</b>, the image properties most suitable to both applications may be used. Various other methods for selecting which image type should control may be used, such as file sizes, power required to capture the image, whether a user is currently viewing display device <b>1230</b>, whether light sources are detected in the environment of the user, or the like.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">Similarly, in some cases, while the image capture events for the two image capture streams do not exactly overlap, they may be scheduled to occur within a time window associated with an image sensor integration time for either an image capture event of the primary stream of for an image capture event of the secondary stream. In such cases, the system may also drop one of the image capture events and use the other image capture event for both image capture streams. For example, image capture point <b>1432</b> and <b>1422</b> may be scheduled to occur within a specified time window of each other, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. Accordingly, a single image <b>1412</b> may be captured, similar to image <b>1410</b> as discussed above. In some embodiments, the time window may depend on an integration time of the scheduled images. For example, if the integration time scheduled for image capture point <b>1432</b> would interfere with image capture point <b>1422</b>, a single image <b>1412</b> may be captured. As discussed, above, various methods may be used for determining which image properties for image <b>1412</b> should be used. In addition to the examples provided above, the image scheduled to occur first may control or vice versa. Alternatively, one or both of the scheduled image capture events may be delayed or advanced such that the image capture events (and their corresponding image sensor integration times) no longer overlap. For example, image <b>1414</b> associated with image capture point <b>1434</b> may captured earlier, image <b>1416</b> associated with image capture point <b>1424</b> may be delayed, or both. Accordingly, an interference between image capture points <b>1434</b> and <b>1424</b> may be reduced or eliminated.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">In some embodiments, the disclosed systems may be configured to determine/measure a light level associated with a detected light source. For example, rather than a single image frame being captured at a prescribed frame capture rate (e.g., 30 Hz for the primary channel and/or 18 Hz for the secondary channel), more than one image frame may be captured at each image capture time of the prescribed frame rate. In other words, the system may capture of burst of images at a rate of, for example, 30 Hz. In some cases, each frame in the burst may be associated with a common image sensor integration time. In other cases, however, different image sensor integration times may be applied for two or more of the frames capture during the burst.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">In one example, each burst may include three captured frames (e.g., sub-exposures). Each of the three captured frames at a 30 Hz overall capture rate may be associated with a different integration time. For example, a first capture sub-exposure frame may have an integration time of 15 ms, a second may have an integration time of 1 ms, and a third may have an integration time of 0.1 ms. As the integration time is reduced, so may be the captured brightness of the light source. By detecting the brightness level of a particular light source in each captured sub-exposure and comparing the detected brightness level to the associated integration times, the actual light level of the light source may be determined. For example, the detected brightness levels may be scaled using 256 bits and then may be normalized in time to provide the actual light level of the detected light source.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">The sub-exposures included in an image capture burst may be useful beyond determining actual light level of a light source. For example, any of the burst sub-exposures may be used as a captured image provided to the primary image capture stream or to the secondary image capture stream. That is, in situations where an image capture event associated with the primary image capture stream would result in an image sensor integration time window overlapping with the integration time needed for an image capture event scheduled for the secondary image capture stream, then an earlier frame in the burst or a later frame in the burst may be used for the primary or secondary image capture stream to avoid the potential conflict.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a flowchart showing an example process <b>1500</b> for navigating a vehicle, consistent with the disclosed embodiments.

It is to be understood that throughout the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;processor&#x201d; is used as a shorthand for &#x201c;at least one processor.&#x201d; In other words, a processor may include one or more structures (e.g., circuitry) that perform logic operations whether such structures are collocated, connected, or disbursed.

For example, step <b>1510</b> may include receiving images captured using camera <b>1210</b> described above. Accordingly, the plurality of images may be received via a first channel and via a second channel, such as channels <b>1222</b> and <b>1232</b>, respectively. In some embodiments, the first channel and the second channel may be associated with different electrical pathways between the camera and the at least one processor. Alternatively or additionally, the first channel and the second channel share a common electrical pathway between the camera and at least one processor configured to perform process <b>1500</b>. For example, frame capture events associated with the first channel may be interleaved with frame capture events associated with the second channel. In some embodiments, the images received via the first channel may be captured by sampling a sensor associated with the camera during one or more time windows between image capture events associated with acquisition of the images received via the second channel, or vice versa. In some embodiments, the first channel and the second channel may be output channels of a sensor of the camera.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">As described above, the first channel may be associated with a first frame capture rate, and the second channel may be associated with a second frame capture rate different from the first frame capture rate.

For example, the first frame capture may have a frequency of 18 Hz and the second frame capture rate may have a frequency of 30 Hz, however, various other suitable frequencies may be used. In some embodiments, the first frame capture rate may have a frequency configured to coincide with different amplitude levels (or light intensity levels) of an expected light-generation waveform associated with at least one of the flickering light sources. For example, the first frame capture rate may be associated with interval i<sub>b</sub>, as discussed above. As one example, the expected light generation waveform has a frequency between about 45 Hz and about 65 Hz, however, other suitable ranges may be used depending on a type of light source being detected. For example, the first frame capture rate may have a frequency that is a non-harmonic of a frequency of an expected light-generation waveform associated with at least one of the flickering light sources.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">In some embodiments, the second frame capture rate may have a frequency configured to coincide with common amplitude levels (or light intensity levels) of an expected light-generation waveform associated with at least one of the flickering light sources.

Accordingly, the second frame capture rate may have a frequency that is a harmonic of a frequency of an expected light-generation waveform associated with at least one of the flickering light sources.

For example, at least a first image among the images received via the second channel (or the first channel) may be used both to provide the images for showing on the one or more human-viewable display and also for the detection of flickering and non-flickering light sources in the environment of the host vehicle.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">Consistent with the embodiments of the present disclosure, the plurality of images may be captured in a burst of images (e.g., with a predetermined time window). For example, the first frame capture rate may be associated with a burst capture rate such that each image capture event associated with the first frame capture rate includes an acquisition of a burst of images. Each of the burst of images is associated with a different image sensor integration time. This may enable light intensity measurements for flickering and non-flickering light sources, as described above.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">In step <b>1520</b>, process <b>1500</b> includes using images received via the first channel to detect flickering and non-flickering light sources in an environment of the host vehicle. For example, light source detection component <b>1220</b> may detect flickering and non-flickering light sources using images received via channel <b>1222</b>. As described above, the images received via the first channel may be used by at least one processor to detect AC-powered light sources and DC-powered light sources in the environment of the host vehicle. For example, AC-powered light sources may correspond to flickering light sources, whereas DC-powered light sources may be associated with non-flickering light sources.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">In some embodiments, a vehicle may be configured to navigate based on detection of a flickering light source or non-flickering light source. For example, this may include navigating based on a traffic light, a brake light, a warning light, a street light, an emergency vehicle light, or the like. Accordingly, process <b>1500</b> may further include determining at least one navigational action for the host vehicle in response to detection of at least one flickering light source or detection of at least one non-flickering light source. The at least one navigational action may include at least one of braking of the host vehicle, accelerating the host vehicle, or changing a heading direction of the host vehicle, or various other navigation actions that may be performed by a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">In step <b>1530</b>, process <b>1500</b> includes providing, based on images received via the second channel, images for showing on one or more human-viewable displays. For example, this may include displaying images received through channel <b>1232</b> on display device <b>1230</b>, as described above. The one or more human-viewable displays may include any device configured to display images to a user, as described above. In some embodiments, the one or more human-viewable displays may include a heads-up display associated with the host vehicle.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">In some embodiments, one or more properties of the images may be adjusted, for example, to improve detection of light sources, to improve viewability for a user, etc. Accordingly, process <b>1500</b> may further include adjusting an image sensor integration time of the camera to change integration times associated with acquisition of one or more of the images received via the first channel or the images received via the second channel. In some embodiments, the adjustment of the image sensor integration time is based on feedback. For example, the feedback may include a saturation level associated with a sensor of the camera. In some embodiments, the feedback may include a detected light intensity level of at least one of the flickering light sources or the non-flickering light sources in the environment of the host vehicle. As another example, the feedback may include a detected oscillation, frequency associated with at least one of the flickering light sources in the environment of the host vehicle.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">In some embodiments, one or more of the first and second channels may be enabled or disabled as needed. For example, it may be more difficult, or perhaps less important to detect flickering and non-flickering light sources during daylight hours. Accordingly, images for channel <b>1222</b> may be disabled. As another example, if a user is not actively viewing images on the one or more human viewable displays, images for channel <b>1232</b> may be disabled. Disabling one of the first and second channels may reduce the demand on camera <b>1210</b> and may allow for better image quality or image capture rates for the enabled channel. Accordingly, process <b>1500</b> may include selectively enable and disable receipt of images via the first channel or via the second channel. For example, receipt of images via the first channel or via the second channel is selectively enabled and disabled based on a level of detected ambient light (which may be detected based on the plurality of images, or via separate sensor), based on a time of day, based on a geographic location (e.g., where no light sources are positioned), based on a user input, or the like. In some embodiments, receipt of images via the first channel may be selectively enabled at night and selectively disabled during the day.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228">The foregoing description has been presented for purposes of illustration.
