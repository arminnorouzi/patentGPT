In some instances it may be desirable to replace a natural joint with a prosthetic joint. More common joints including, but not limited to the shoulder, knee, hip can be successfully replaced in an orthopedic surgical procedure. Sometimes the difficulty in adequately exposing the bone and tissue creates problems and errors in accurately implementing a desired surgical procedure. Moreover, it would be desirable to provide a method and system that accurately prepares the desired area for receipt of a desired implant while minimizing errors that may result from a surgeons tools guided only by hand and direct intraoperative vision.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently-named inventor, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A method of performing arthroplasty of an anatomical joint for receipt of an implant is disclosed. The method includes developing a preoperative plan, designing a patient specific guide based on the preoperative plan, obtaining the patient specific guide, placing the patient specific guide relative to the identified bone, fixing a pair of pins into the bone to establish an Alpha plane and executing the preoperative plan while referencing the Alpha plane. Developing the preoperative plan includes establishing a desired amount of remaining first bone based on a condition of the anatomical joint and a desired orientation of the implant. The patient specific guide includes a pair of bores defined therein and located in positions to accept a complementary pair of rigid pins. The bores are arranged at locations on the patient specific guide to orient the respective pins in a direction optimized for surgeon access to the first bone and to establish the Alpha plane. The preoperative plan includes known locations of the first bone relative to the Alpha plane.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to additional features, executing the preoperative plan includes coupling optical arrays to the pair of pins at a known distance from the first bone. A position of the cutting tool relative to the Alpha plane is correlated using the optical arrays. Desired portions of the first bone are removed with the cutting tool while referencing exclusively the Alpha plane to determine a position of the cutting tool based on the preoperative plan. In another arrangement, executing the preoperative plan includes connecting a cutting tool relative to at least one of the first and second pins. The cutting tool is moved relative to at least one of the first and second pins along the Alpha plane. Desired portions of the first bone are removed with the cutting tool while referencing exclusively the Alpha plane to determine a position of the cutting tool based on the preoperative plan.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In other features, removing desired portions of the first bone includes resecting the first bone in a pattern to match a geometry of an implant. The cutting tool can be motorized. Connecting the cutting tool can include clamping a portion of the cutting tool to at least one pin for translation of the cutting tool along the pin. Removing desired first portions of bone can include translating the cutting tool along the Alpha plane. First portions of the first bone can be reamed with the cutting tool at a first cutting angle based on the preoperative plan. An arm on the cutting tool can be articulated to establish a second cutting angle, distinct from the first cutting angle. The cutting tool can be further translated along the Alpha plane. Second portions of the first bone can be reamed with the cutting tool at a second cutting angle based on the preoperative plan.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to additional features, the cutting tool can communicate wirelessly with a computer having the preoperative plan. The computer can comprise one of a workstation, desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile phone, wearable accessory or garment. The cutting tool can comprise a reamer. The cutting tool can further comprise an end-cutting milling device. The first bone can be a glenoid and the implant can be a glenoid implant. The first bone can alternatively be a femur and the implant can be a femoral implant. The first bone can alternatively be a tibia and the implant can be a tibial implant. The first bone can alternatively be an acetabulum and the implant can be an acetabular implant.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A system for performing arthroplasty of an anatomical joint for receipt of an implant according to the present disclosure includes a patient specific guide, a computer and a cutting tool. The patient specific guide has a pair of bores defined therein and located in positions to accept a complementary pair of pins. The bores are arranged at locations on the patient specific guide to orient the respective pins in a direction optimized for surgeon access to the first bone and to establish an Alpha plane. The computer develops a preoperative plan that includes a desired bone cutting depth of a first bone and a desired amount of remaining first bone based on a condition of the anatomical joint. The preoperative plan includes known locations of the first bone relative to the Alpha plane. The computer designs the patient specific guide. The cutting tool executes the preoperative plan while referencing the Alpha plane.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In additional features, the system further includes a pair of optical arrays configured to be coupled to the respective pair of pins. A position of the cutting tool is correlated to the Alpha plane using the pair of optical arrays such that desired portions of the first bone are removed with the cutting tool while referencing the Alpha plane based on the preoperative plan. The tool can comprise a robotic cutting tool having a fixing portion, a cutting portion and an arm. The fixing portion can locate relative to at least one pin. The cutting portion can be configured to cut the first bone. The arm can be disposed between the fixing portion and the cutting portion.

end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The ultimate goal in placing orthopedic prostheses (joint replacements, etc.) is to insert them in a very precise orientation in order to best restore normal anatomy and to preserve bone. Proper orientation will maximize the longevity of the implant and provide the best outcome for the patient. There are many preoperative planning tools available to create a patient-specific operative plan. These plans typically work off a <b>3</b>-D model obtained from a CT scan or MRI of the body part targeted for surgery. The most challenging problem lies in the execution of these plans, especially in the hands of low volume surgeons. The present disclosure provides a novel method to establish a static reference plane, hereinafter &#x201c;Alpha plane&#x201d; using two parallel pins placed through a patient specific guide. The patient specific guide is designed based on a preoperative plan. Once the pins are located into bone at positions predetermined by the guide, the guide is removed. Surgical tools, including robotic assisted tools, reference this static Alpha plane during the procedure to precisely execute the preoperative plan. The geometry of each patient specific guide is designed and created specific to the patient's anatomy and determined bone preparation. The geometry is also specifically designed to direct placement of the pins (that establish the Alpha plane) in a location out of the way of the surgeons working area optimized for surgeon access and visibility to carry out bone resection. As will become appreciated from the following discussion, the system and methods disclosed herein provide a much simpler yet accurate way for accomplishing arthroplasty.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present disclosure pertains to a bone preparation system and related method utilizing a patient specific guide configured to match a section of bone. The instant application contemplates surgical procedures involving the shoulder, knee and hip discussed in sequence below. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the instant application may also be adaptable to other anatomical joints.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">With initial reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a system for performing arthroplasty of an anatomical joint for receipt of an implant is shown and generally identified at reference numeral <b>8</b>. The system <b>8</b> generally comprises a module, processor or computer <b>12</b>, a preoperative plan <b>14</b> and a patient specific guide <b>16</b>. The computer <b>12</b> uses code to develop a preoperative plan that includes a desired cutting depth of a first bone based on anatomical patient data <b>18</b> and surgeon input <b>20</b>. Anatomical patient data <b>18</b> can be obtained by any suitable method such as by a CT scan, MRI or other imagery of the anatomical joint. As will be described herein, the system <b>8</b> can further include one or more optical arrays <b>22</b> and surgical instruments or tools <b>24</b> that communicate with the computer <b>12</b> to identify a location of the tool <b>24</b> relative to the preoperative plan <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The instant teachings requires minimal instrumentation and steps to establish known positions of the patients' anatomy relative to the surgical bone preparation needed to be carried out. As explained herein, a reference plane, hereinafter &#x201c;Alpha plane&#x201d; <b>40</b> is established by the patient specific guide <b>16</b> that directs placement of two pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> into the appropriate bone along the reference plane <b>40</b>. The two rigid pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> can be referenced directly or indirectly during future surgical bone preparation by the surgical cutting tools <b>24</b> such as a robotic tool or hand held tool. A robotic tool can directly reference one or both pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the optical arrays <b>22</b> can be coupled (clipped or otherwise affixed) to the two pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. The location of a hand held tool <b>24</b> can then be determined based on its position relative to the optical arrays <b>22</b> fixed to the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. In either scenario, the location of the tools <b>24</b> is known relative to the Alpha plane <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As the location of the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> (and Alpha plane <b>40</b>) is known and determined by the preoperative plan <b>14</b>, no subsequent surface mapping is required. Further, no additional pins are needed to be inserted into the bone. A location of the tool <b>24</b> will be known based on its location relative to the Alpha plane <b>40</b> using the optical arrays <b>22</b>. As such, the location of the tool <b>24</b> can be correlated to the patient's anatomy using the preoperative plan <b>14</b> and known locations of the Alpha plane <b>40</b>. Explained differently, the two pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> define an invisible static plane (Alpha plane <b>40</b>) across the bone. The computer <b>12</b> will treat the two pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> as a reference plane <b>40</b> that matches up exactly with the preoperative plan <b>14</b>. The surgical procedure can then work off of the Alpha plane <b>40</b>. In this regard, the location of areas of bone categorized by the preoperative plan <b>14</b> for resection are known relative to the Alpha plane <b>40</b>. Similarly, locations of surgical tools <b>24</b> will be known relative to the Alpha plane <b>40</b>. As such, surgical bone preparation can be carried out with certainty and minimal preparation.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one example, a tool <b>24</b> having a cutting burr can be used to cut away areas of bone identified by the preoperative plan for resection. The tool <b>24</b> can include an optical array <b>28</b> that communicates to the computer <b>12</b> the position of the burr relative to the Alpha plane. As the preoperative plan includes anatomical information of the patients' anatomy relative to the Alpha plane, the position of the tool <b>24</b> is known relative to the patients' anatomy. Because the location of the tool <b>24</b> is known, the preoperative plan <b>14</b> will only allow the cutting burr to travel and cut into locations of the patients' anatomy identified for resection. Some instruments may allow for the cutting burr to retract to preclude unwanted cutting. Other tools may provide haptic feedback or other warnings to convey a position of the tool <b>24</b> to a surgeon.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>7</b>C</figref>, a method for performing shoulder arthroplasty according to one example of the present disclosure will be described. A preoperative plan is developed based on anatomical patient data and surgeon input. A patient specific guide <b>16</b>A is designed by the preoperative plan. The patient specific guide <b>16</b>A can then be manufactured based on the design. After obtaining standard surgical exposure of a glenoid <b>10</b>, the patient specific glenoid guide <b>16</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref>) will be placed engaging the base of the coracoid as well as the anterior glenoid <b>10</b>. The patient specific guide <b>16</b>A defines two cannulations or parallel bores <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> that receive and will allow the placement of two parallel pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> which will enter the anterior glenoid <b>10</b> at the base of the coracoid. As mentioned, the pins <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> are used in one example to define the Alpha plane <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) that will subsequently serve as a reference to the patients' anatomy. In a second example, the pins <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> can serve as a physical connection point where tools <b>24</b> can be coupled thereto for performing bone preparation to execute the patient specific plan. Both examples are discussed below.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">By using the pins <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> (and ultimately the Alpha plane <b>40</b>) as a reference, many laborious steps carried out in prior art examples can be avoided. Explained further, in some prior art procedures, registering a patients' anatomy requires extensive planning and steps such as locating multiple drill pins, and an elaborate sequence of surface mapping using optical arrays and a sensor probe. In this regard, prior art methods require drilling into bone (glenoid, femur, etc.) and positioning multiple optical arrays as part of a registration process. In one prior art process, pins are drilled into bone to establish an anatomical axis and the optical arrays are coupled to the pins. A probe is used to touch the surface of the identified bone in multiple locations to create a three-dimensional model of the bone on a computer.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">By way of example, during a conventional knee replacement surgery, a surgeon typically drills two pins into the femur and couples a femoral optical array to the pins. Similarly, a surgeon drills two additional pins into the tibia and fixes a tibial array to those pins. Next, the surgeon uses a sensor probe to carry out a registration process.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">During the registration process the surgeon touches the distal femur and proximal tibia with the sensor probe. In some implementations the computer will instruct the surgeon to touch specific landmarks. Furthermore, the tip of the sensor probe can be rubbed against the distal femur and proximal tibia to map the positions to the computer. The computer collects real time data points provided by the sensor probe. The locations that are read by the computer are used to build a three-dimensional model. This prior art method to build a three-dimensional model using elaborate registering and mapping is time consuming. Moreover, the joint is exposed for long periods of time while obtaining the data with the sensor probe.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref>, the patient specific glenoid guide <b>16</b>A will be further described. It will be appreciated that the geometry of the patient specific glenoid guide <b>16</b>A is merely exemplary and that the glenoid guide <b>16</b>A may take other shapes. The glenoid guide <b>16</b>A can further include a footing <b>34</b> that helps position the guide <b>16</b>A at the desired location on the glenoid <b>10</b>. One of the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> is located more distally to the other pin. The pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> are parallel to each other in the anterior glenoid vault. The purpose of the first pin <b>30</b> is to utilize the dense bone at the base of the coracoid. The coracoid base is a readily identifiable landmark during glenoid exposure. This stands true even in cases of severe glenoid deformity or coracoid transfers. This will allow for the two pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> to be rigidly placed establishing the Alpha plane <b>40</b>. The Alpha plane <b>40</b> will establish a reference plane for future procedures. In one example, a location of handheld surgical tools (such as a cutting tool <b>24</b>) is known based on its location relative to the Alpha plane <b>40</b>. In other examples, the Alpha plane <b>40</b> can serve as a working plane for a motorized cutting tool <b>44</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). After the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> have been advanced into the glenoid <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref>), the patient specific glenoid guide <b>16</b>A will be removed leaving the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> in the bone <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">With particular reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, additional features of the system <b>8</b> will be described. The pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> can have a threaded portion <b>46</b> and have laser etch marks <b>48</b> such as every <b>5</b>mm in order to determined depth into the glenoid vault. The depth can be pre-calculated by the preoperative plan <b>14</b>. A cutting tool <b>24</b>A includes a locking mechanism <b>60</b>. The threaded portions <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> can facilitate coupling of the locking mechanism <b>60</b> on the motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A. The motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A can have feet <b>64</b>, <b>66</b> that define two cannulated slots <b>64</b>A, <b>66</b>A that receive the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> extending from the glenoid <b>10</b>. The two cannulated slots <b>64</b>A, <b>66</b>A can define a distance apart that is satisfactory and uniform for use in all surgeries. In one exemplary method, the slots <b>64</b>A, <b>66</b>A defined in the feet <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> can be aligned for receipt of the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. The feet <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> can then be traversed along the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> until engaging the glenoid <b>10</b> such as at the base of the coracoid. The locking mechanism <b>60</b> can then be locked in place precluding the feet <b>64</b> and <b>66</b> from further movement. This will now be in place to carry out the preoperative reaming plan.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A can include a reamer <b>68</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A can include a main body <b>70</b> that supports the feet <b>64</b> and <b>66</b>. An articulating arm <b>72</b> extends from the main body <b>70</b> to the reamer <b>68</b>. The articulating arm <b>72</b> can articulate to change an angle of the reamer <b>68</b> relative to the Alpha plane <b>40</b> while carrying out the preoperative plan <b>14</b>. The reamer <b>68</b> can be provided in many shapes and sizes distinct from what is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In one example the reamer <b>68</b> is a standard circular reamer with aggressive cutting teeth allowing for an aggressive but precise cuts. For anatomic glenoids with no defect it will simply ream at a predetermined angle and approach the Alpha plane <b>40</b> defined by the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and stop based on the pre-operative plan. If there is an augment needed posteriorly the tool <b>24</b>A can articulate for a second pass and then ream again at the predetermined angle matching the augment of a wedged anatomic or reverse base plate configuration.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In another configuration, the motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A can comprise a milling device <b>69</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) that will be inserted into the glenoid <b>10</b> in the same way. The milling device <b>69</b> will also use the Alpha plane <b>40</b> defined by the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> as a reference to determine a position of the milling device <b>69</b> relative to the patients' anatomy to mill out the exact configuration to prepare a bone cavity <b>80</b> into the glenoid <b>10</b>. The bone cavity <b>80</b> can match the backside of a desired implant consistent the preoperative plan <b>14</b>. It is contemplated that the bone cavity <b>80</b> can be prepared to accommodate a center keel <b>82</b> of an implant <b>84</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>). In other examples, bone cavities can alternatively or additionally be prepared to accommodate peripheral pegs on the implant <b>84</b>, posterior augments or other geometries related to the implant.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A will network either directly or wirelessly to the computer <b>12</b>. The computer <b>12</b> will have the geometry of the patient specific guide <b>16</b> saved, either on a local hard drive or on an accessible network, and will mirror the surgeon's preoperative plan <b>14</b>. Once the desired cuts have been performed, the motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A can be removed along with the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. The implantation of a glenoid implant now proceeds through standard techniques.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Traditional methods may utilize a preoperative plan based on 3D, CT or MRI. The execution of the plan depends on precise placement of a pin in the neutral axis followed by the use of cannulated reamers. There can be challenges in placing that pin because of difficulty in obtaining adequate surgical exposure. Even in cases of accurate pin placement there can be inaccuracies in both depth and rotation of reaming.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The system and method according to the present teachings is different in that it establishes and utilizes the Alpha plane <b>40</b> as an intraoperative reference. In some prior art examples such as the prior art patient specific guide <b>90</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), the guide assists in establishing a neutral axis along a pin <b>92</b>. Once the location of the pin <b>92</b> has been established, the patient specific guide <b>90</b> can be removed. The pin <b>92</b> can then be referenced by various cannulated reamers to cut away the bone to create the cavity that matches a profile of the implant. In many instances, it can be difficult to provide adequate spacing from surrounding anatomy (humeral head, etc.) for such reamers to approach the bone along the pin <b>92</b> (neutral axis) making the process challenging in the prior art arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Many times the humeral head needs to be forced out of the way so as not to interfere with instrument approaches along the pin <b>92</b>. As explained, while the neutral axis can assist a surgeon in establishing a desired orientation of the implant, the guide <b>90</b> and pin <b>92</b> can obstruct a surgeon's preferred approach to the glenoid during resection of bone. The instant methods allow for improved accessibility for the surgeon to perform the necessary cuts on the glenoid.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The system and method of the instant application contemplates the use of the pins <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> in one example for registration with optical arrays. In another example, the pins <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> can be used for direct or indirect contact by a motorized (robotic) cutting tool. The system and method also differs from prior art examples that reference the neutral axis in that it uses the motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A to resect bone in a precise manner, not as measured by the amount resected, but measured by the amount of bone that will remain as it relates to the Alpha plane <b>40</b>. Traditional preoperative planning is the same in that a 3D CT is obtained in order to define the morphology and the abnormalities in the glenoid. Current technology will allow for the design of a guide that mates to the patient's glenoid and its irregularities. Traditionally the goal has been to attach a drill guide allowing for the placement of a pin down the neutral axis. The instant disclosure utilizes an easy and identifiable landmark for all surgeons, the base of the coracoid. Not only is this identifiable but it is an excellent source of bone for the primary pin. The second difference is to use two pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, not one, and to align the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> not along a neutral axis of the scapula, but use them to define the Alpha plane <b>40</b>. In this regard, instead of one pin along the neutral axis, there will be two pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> defining a plane posterior to the glenoid. This Alpha plane <b>40</b> will be entering the surgical field at an oblique angle correlating to the angle of the original incision at the deltopectoral interval.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> will allow for the entry of the motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A into a space large enough for preparation. It is anticipated that the space required for the motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A will be less than currently needed for traditional methods and therefore require less traumatic dissection and less difficulty obtaining glenoid exposure. The angle of the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and therefore the angle at which the motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A will enter will alleviate some of the struggles of having to bring all reaming instruments in along a neutral axis. In traditional exposure there are struggles with trying to work around the humeral head. The method according to the present teachings will allow for entry of the motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A into the glenohumeral joint at an angle that approaches that of the deltopectoral approach and will have less obstruction in difficult exposure cases. As can be appreciated, all the bone work occurs on the surface of the glenoid. The instant teachings provide a method that places the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> posterior and medial to the glenoid in a position that is out of the way of a surgeons approach to the glenoid surface. For comparison purposes, the prior art pin <b>92</b> defined along the neutral axis is shown in broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> along with the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> of the instant teachings. As shown, the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> are in a more advantageous orientation compared to the pin <b>92</b> that will allow for improved surgeon accessibility.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">With the Alpha plane <b>40</b> defined by the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, the motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A will be locked in place and will be able to execute the plan by referencing the Alpha plane <b>40</b> defined by those two pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. The motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A can track along at least one of the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> thereby maintaining reference to the Alpha plane <b>40</b>. In some examples, the surgeon can manually translate the motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A along at least one of the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> by hand. In other examples the motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A can be powered along at least one of the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> by an internal or external propulsion mechanism such as a motor. In still other examples, the motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A can move along at least one of the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> by combinations of manual (surgeon assisted) and automatic (motor powered) movements. This method will not only achieve the goal of planning for component optimization preoperatively, but it allows for precise execution of the preoperative plan <b>14</b> by the motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A. It will also be able to resect bone in any configuration, fitting the backside of any glenoid component, such as glenoid component <b>84</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>. The motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A can also take the form of a powered multi-plane reamer, a multi-plane saw, or a milling device. After initial cuts are made to match the back side of the prosthesis to be implanted, the slots or peg holes needed to match those on each prosthesis can be drilled by the milling bit <b>69</b> or by a drill press type tool exchanged onto the same track defined by the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, additional features will be described. The importance of the Alpha plane <b>40</b> is that software executed by a processor in the computer <b>12</b> can determine precise locations identified for bone resections measured from the Alpha plane <b>40</b>. The preoperative plan <b>14</b> will dictate the amount of bone that will be removed and will remain in the glenoid vault. Any tissue, including bone, cartilage, etc., between the reaming/milling device and that calculated to remain as measured off the Alpha plane <b>40</b>, will be resected via reaming/milling. The shape of the backside of the desired implant <b>84</b> (including extensions such as a keel <b>82</b>) will be exactly mirrored by that remaining in the glenoid vault. It will also be in the exact orientation and position dictated by the preoperative plan <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">An algorithm contained in the software and used by the computer <b>12</b> will measure the distance between the Alpha plane <b>40</b> medially and the desired amount of remaining bone as measured between the Alpha plane <b>40</b> and a desired resection depth &#x201c;B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, B<b>3</b>, B<b>4</b>, B<b>5</b>, B<b>6</b>, B<b>7</b>, B<b>8</b> etc.&#x201d; to accept the implant <b>84</b>. This distance, BETA, can be measured from the anterior to posterior in an infinite number of measurements in order to improve accuracy. This measurement will also be calculated on every axial CT or MRI cut. The compilation of these measurements will define a three-dimensional shape which will correlate exactly to the backside of the implant <b>84</b>. While a particular implant <b>84</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> it is appreciated that the present teaching can be used to prepare bone for receipt of any implant such as, but not limited to anatomic, reverse, or augmented components.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">By way of further description, the bone preparation tool <b>24</b>A of the present disclosure will replace tools that are now 100% manual and depend on the surgical technique of the surgeon and the visual ability to determine depth and rotation. Even in experienced hands this can lead to errors. The motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A will be locked in place and will execute the bone reaming based on predetermined measurements. These measurements will be pre-determined by the templating software and will be specific to each patient. The motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A will be able to interface with the computer <b>12</b> such as in the operating room that executes the software program containing the preoperative plan <b>14</b> to the patient having the specifications for the appropriate implant in the correct orientation. In some examples the motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A can interface wirelessly such as by Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. It is further contemplated that the preoperative plan <b>14</b> can be developed and/or communicated by a computer <b>12</b> comprising at least one of a workstation, desktop, laptop, tablet, mobile phone, wearable accessory or garment.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The motorized cutting tool <b>24</b>A can have a circular reamer which is the traditional method and is basically an aggressive rasp. It smooths the bone to a shape that will accept the implant. The implant shape is usually flat or slightly curved depending on its design. The reamer <b>68</b> can also articulate (by way of arm <b>72</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) therefore having the ability to ream in two different angles. This will create two flat surfaces <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>) that are at different angles and will be able to accept augmented glenoids that have these irregular shapes.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In another example, the cutting tool can include the bone milling device <b>69</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The bone milling device <b>69</b> can utilizes an end-cutting milling device that resects bone into the same configurations as described above. The bone milling device <b>69</b> will work in three dimensions and replicate the preoperative plan <b>14</b> in three-dimensions. The tool <b>24</b>A will pre-contour any shape into the bone <b>10</b> that is programmed and will match that of each individual glenoid component as determined by the preoperative planning software executed by the computer <b>12</b>. The bone mill <b>69</b> will have the ability to contour flat surfaces, and it will also be able to drill narrow cylinders matching the shape of the peripheral pegs, central keels, and any other designs of different glenoid components.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The design of the bone milling device <b>69</b> will be such that the working end will be narrow, and the internal mechanisms and technology that is used to interface with the software will reside in the handle. This will allow for a low-profile device entering in the direction of the deltopectoral surgical approach. It will minimize the need for excessive pressure on the humeral head during glenoid exposure. Glenoid exposure is the most difficult part of shoulder replacement surgery and so the tool <b>24</b>A will dramatically reduce the struggle in obtaining this exposure and executing the preoperative plan <b>14</b> for each patient.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As mentioned above, in other examples, the optical arrays <b>22</b> can be fixed to the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> at known locations a predetermined distance from the first bone. The optical arrays can then register their position in space to a computer <b>22</b> (or robot) where the exact positions of the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> is known. Once the exact position of the pins <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> has been established, a surgeon can then proceed with bone preparation while referencing the known locations of the pins <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> relative to the anatomy in space.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>11</b></figref>, the present teachings will be described in the context of knee replacement surgery. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> shows a prior art example of a patient specific guide (see femoral guide <b>120</b>A and tibial guide <b>120</b>B) for knee replacement surgery.
