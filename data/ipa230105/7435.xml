These alerts may inform the device users of various types of alerts including presidential alerts, alerts involving imminent threats to safety or life (e.g., fires, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, etc.), public safety alerts, and child abduction (e.g., AMBER) alerts. The alerts may be broadcast to device users according to standards based on requirements set forth by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Current WEA 2.0 and WEA 3.0 standards limit the alert text to 360 alphanumeric characters. The device user may be provided an interface to establish settings to enable or disable the presentation of certain types of WEA alerts, and to select a preferred language (e.g., English or Spanish).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The alert originator may choose to define the alert area(s) using geographical coordinates. In WEA 2.0 broadcasts, all mobile devices located within cells or cell sectors that touch or overlap with the alert area(s) present the alert to the device user, even if the mobile device itself is outside of the actual boundaries of the alert area(s). The geographical coordinates defining the alert boundaries are held up in the network in WEA 2.0 and are not communicated to the mobile devices. In networks updated to WEA 3.0, the alert broadcast includes both the alert message and the geographical coordinates defining one or more geometric shapes that describe the boundaries of the alert area(s). Current industry specifications limit the alert area to 10 geometric shapes (circle, polygon) with 1 to 100 total coordinates for all shapes. WEA 3.0 capable mobile devices may apply device-based geo-fencing to tighten the alert presentation to just those mobile devices located within the boundaries of the alert area(s) defined by the alert coordinates, taking into account a 0.1 mile overshoot. WEA 3.0 capable mobile devices are able to receive the coordinates defining the geometric shape of the alert area and compare their location against the alert area(s) to determine whether or not the device is within the alert area(s) and should present the alert. The alert is presented at the mobile device through tactile (vibration cadence), visual (display), and audible (alert tones) means.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">While effective, there is a need for providing additional information to mobile device users located near or in an alert area(s) that will assist in avoiding danger and enhancing safety. With various multimedia capabilities, many mobile devices present an opportunity to enhance the information and assistance provided to mobile device users pertaining to wireless emergency alerts. The embodiments of the present disclosure attempt to provide a technical solution to address these needs.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Summary</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments disclosed herein apply to systems and methods for intelligent processing and presentation of wireless emergency alerts at mobile devices whereby the mobile devices apply mobile device features, such as mapping functions, to provide mobile device users with additional safety information over existing systems. In one embodiment, a computer-implemented method of processing and presenting a wireless emergency alert at a mobile device is disclosed. The method may include receiving, at the mobile device, the wireless emergency alert over a wireless communication network. The wireless emergency alert may include an alert message and geographical coordinates defining one or more alert areas associated with the wireless emergency alert. The method may further include comparing, at the mobile device, a current location of the mobile device with the received coordinates to determine if the mobile device is within the alert area(s). If the mobile device is within the alert area(s), the method may further include applying a mapping application on the mobile device to construct a map of the alert area(s) based on the coordinates, and displaying the map indicating the current location of the mobile device with respect to the alert area(s) at a display interface of the mobile device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, the method may also include providing additional assistance, such as instructions for the shortest route to exit or avoid the alert area(s), or the safest route between the current location of the mobile device and a destination indicated by the user. The method may include providing instructions for staying out of the alert area(s) if the mobile device is within a predetermined distance (e.g., 0.1 mile) of an outer boundary of the alert area(s).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another embodiment, a system for processing and presenting a wireless emergency alert is disclosed. The system may include a wireless communication network, and a mobile device on the wireless communication network. The mobile device may include a processor, a memory, and a communication circuit. The processor may be configured according to computer-executable instructions for receiving, over the wireless communication network, coordinates defining one or more alert areas associated with the wireless emergency alert, wherein the alert area has a geometrical shape independent of a shape of cell sectors of the wireless communication network. The processor may be further configured according to computer-executable instructions for comparing a current location of the mobile device with the received coordinates to determine if the mobile device is within the alert area(s) or within a predetermined distance of the alert area(s) and, if the current location is within the alert area(s) or within a predetermined distance of the alert area(s), applying the coordinates to construct a map of the alert area(s), and displaying the map indicating the current location of the mobile device with respect to the alert area(s).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one aspect, the processor may be further configured according to computer-executable instructions for providing additional assistance, such as instructions for the shortest route to exit or avoid the alert area(s), or the safest route between the current location of the mobile device and a destination indicated by the user.

More specific details describing intelligent processing and presentation of the WEA at the mobile device level to provide added safety features to the mobile device user, such as mapping features, visuals, and directions to safety, will be provided below.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The system <b>10</b> may include a wireless communication network <b>12</b>, and mobile devices <b>14</b> within the wireless communication network <b>12</b>. The wireless communication network <b>12</b> may be a 4G LTE network <b>16</b>, a 5G network, or another type of wireless network. The mobile devices <b>14</b> may include smartphones, tablets, laptops, personal computers, or other wireless devices. The wireless emergency alert may be displayed as a visual (e.g., text) alert at a display interface of the device, or presented as an audible sound or verbal alert, or a tactile alert (vibration). In some arrangements, the alert may be presented at a display interface of a vehicle if the mobile device is connected to or in wireless communication with the vehicle. The mobile devices <b>14</b> may be WEA 3.0 capable, meaning that the devices <b>14</b> may be capable of both receiving geographical coordinates describing one or more alert areas associated with the wireless emergency alert, and applying device-based geo-fencing to compare their location against the alert area(s) and determine if the alert should be presented at the mobile device <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The WEA broadcast may originate from any authorized alert originator <b>18</b> such as the National Weather Service (NWS) or United States Geological Survey (USGS), or federal, state, or local agency. The alert may include a presidential alert, an alert regarding imminent threats to safety or life (e.g., fires, wildfires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, natural disasters, etc.), child abduction (e.g., AMBER) alerts, and public safety alerts, for example. The broadcast may be a WEA 3.0 broadcast and may include at least the alert message, which may be limited to a specific number of alphanumeric characters (e.g., 360 characters), and geographical coordinates defining one or more geometric shapes (e.g., circle or polygon) describing the geographical boundaries of one or more alert areas <b>20</b> associated with the wireless emergency alert. The alert area(s) <b>20</b> may be defined as any geometric shape including circular and polygonal shapes. In some embodiments, the geometric shape of the alert area(s) <b>20</b> may be limited to 10 geometric shapes with 1 to 100 total coordinates for all shapes, although this limit may vary depending on changing WEA regulations.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The WEA may be sent from the alert originator to the federal agency gateway <b>22</b> and to a commercial mobile service provider (CMSP) gateway <b>24</b> before entering the carrier's wireless communication network <b>12</b>. If the wireless communication network <b>12</b> is a 4G LTE network <b>16</b>, it may include, among other components and entities, a mobility management entity (MME) <b>26</b>, and a radio access network (RAN) <b>28</b> including radio base stations (eNodeBs) <b>30</b>. If the wireless communication network is a 5G network, the nomenclature of the network entities may vary somewhat, as will be understood by those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The WEA may be broadcast over the air via the radio base stations <b>30</b> to the mobile devices <b>14</b> in (full) cells <b>32</b> or selected cell sectors of cells <b>32</b> that touch or overlap with the alert area(s) <b>20</b>, depending on how the system <b>10</b> builds their broadcast area for the wireless emergency alert. In the simplified representation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the WEA may be broadcast to mobile devices <b>34</b> in selected sectors of cells A, C, D, E, F, and G, but not to mobile device <b>36</b> in cell B because cell B does not touch or overlap the alert area(s) <b>20</b>. In other embodiments, the WEA may be broadcast to all mobile devices <b>34</b> in (full) cells A, C, D, E, F, and G that touch or overlap with the alert area(s) <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each of the mobile devices <b>34</b> in cells A, C, D, E, F, and G (or selected cell sectors of cells A, C, D, E, F, and G) that receive the WEA broadcast may apply device-based geo-fencing to determine whether or not the respective mobile device <b>34</b> is within the alert area(s) <b>20</b> or within a predetermined distance (e.g., 0.1 mile) of an outer boundary of the alert area(s) <b>20</b> according to the geographical coordinates received in the broadcast. More specifically, each mobile device <b>34</b> may query its location using location features on the mobile device <b>34</b> such as, but not limited to, a global positioning system (GPS), Bluetooth beacons, and triangulation features. If the mobile device <b>34</b> is within the alert area(s) <b>20</b> or within a predetermined distance of the alert area(s) <b>20</b>, the mobile device <b>34</b> may present the alert, as explained more specifically below. In the exemplary representation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, mobile devices <b>34</b><i>a</i>-<b>34</b><i>d </i>would present the alert because they are located within the boundaries of the alert area(s) <b>20</b>, whereas mobile devices <b>34</b><i>e </i>and <b>34</b><i>f </i>would not present the alert because they are located outside of the boundaries of the alert area(s) <b>20</b>. In other arrangements, the mobile devices <b>34</b> in cells or in selected cell sectors of cells A, C, D, E, F, and G overlapping the alert area(s) <b>20</b> may default to presenting the wireless emergency alert even if the mobile devices <b>34</b> is outside of the alert area(s) <b>20</b>, such as when device based geo-fencing is bypassed to accelerate the dissemination of the alert, or when the location features on the mobile device <b>34</b> are turned off or functioning poorly.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an exemplary method for processing and presenting the WEA at a mobile device <b>14</b> is shown. Beginning at a block <b>40</b>, a receiver of the mobile device <b>14</b> may receive the WEA broadcast over the wireless communication network <b>12</b>. The WEA broadcast may at least include the alert message (e.g., an alert text of alphanumeric characters) and the geographical coordinates defining the alert area(s) <b>20</b> associated with the WEA. At a block <b>42</b>, the mobile device <b>14</b> may determine whether the WEA broadcast was previously received. If so, the WEA and the geographical coordinates may be discarded at a block <b>44</b> to avoid duplicate messages. If the WEA broadcast was not previously received, the WEA may be passed to a presentation processing system <b>46</b> of the device <b>14</b> (also see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">At a block <b>48</b>, the presentation processing system <b>46</b> may determine whether the broadcast complies with WEA user setting checks. For example, the mobile device user may have disabled or opted out of certain types of alerts. If the broadcast does not pass the user setting checks, then the alert will not be presented and will be stored for recall by the user if desired (block <b>50</b>). If the WEA broadcast passes the user setting checks, the presentation processing system <b>46</b> may determine if geographical coordinates were received in the broadcast (block <b>52</b>). If the coordinates were not received in the broadcast, the system <b>46</b> may default to presenting the alert and storing the alert according to a block <b>54</b>. If the coordinates were received, the system <b>46</b> may apply the coordinates to internally construct the alert area(s) <b>20</b>, and compare the current location of the mobile device with the received coordinates to determine if the mobile device is within the alert area(s) <b>20</b> or within a predetermined distance (e.g., 0.1 miles) of the alert area <b>20</b> (block <b>56</b>). If not within or near (within a predetermined distance of) the alert area(s) <b>20</b>, the alert is stored and not presented (block <b>58</b>). If the mobile device <b>14</b> is within the alert area(s) <b>20</b> or within the predetermined distance of the alert area(s) <b>20</b>, the wireless emergency alert may be presented and stored on the mobile device <b>14</b> (block <b>60</b>). The alert may be presented as a visual/text alert at the display interface, an audible sound alert, an audible verbal alert, or a tactile (vibration) alert. In other situations where the mobile device location cannot be determined, the system <b>46</b> may default to presenting the alert. Additionally, in some embodiments, the mobile device <b>14</b> may send a notification over the wireless communication network <b>12</b> to devices of user-selected contacts to notify the contacts that the mobile device user is in an alert area and may be in danger (block <b>62</b>).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">When the coordinates are received, the mobile device <b>14</b> may apply a mapping application or other mapping functions on the mobile device <b>14</b> to construct a map of the alert area(s) <b>20</b> based on the coordinates (block <b>64</b>), and determine or monitor the location of the mobile device <b>14</b> with respect to the alert area(s) <b>20</b> on the map (block <b>66</b>). The map may then be displayed at the display interface to show the alert area(s) <b>20</b> as well as the location of the mobile device <b>14</b> with respect to the alert area(s) <b>20</b> (block <b>68</b>).

Prior to WEA 3.0, the geographical coordinates of the alert area were held in the network and were not communicated to the mobile device. With the geographical coordinates being communicated to capable mobile devices in WEA 3.0 as of the end of 2019, the mobile devices apply device-based geo-fencing to refine the presentation of alerts to just those mobile devices within the alert boundaries, or within a predetermined distance of the alert boundaries. The present disclosure extends the alert information provided by WEA 3.0 capable mobile devices by interfacing with mapping functions or other applications on the mobile device to construct a map of the alert area(s) based on the received coordinates. The map may provide visuals indicating the location of the mobile device with respect to the alert area(s), and routes for getting away from the alert area(s) and to safety, either simply exiting the alert area(s) or moving toward a specified destination. Alerts and directions to safety may be provided as audible voice descriptions to assist the user in a hands-free manner, such as when the user is driving or in a hurry to get to safety. Furthermore, the location and mapping features on the mobile device may track the position of the mobile device with respect to the alert area(s) and provide visual or audible indications of when the user is approaching or moving away from the alert area(s). Thus, the present disclosure provides an improvement in WEA 3.0 technology at the mobile device level by enhancing mobile device intelligent processing and presentation of wireless emergency alerts to provide additional safety information to the mobile device user.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-20" num="01-20"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>20</b>.
