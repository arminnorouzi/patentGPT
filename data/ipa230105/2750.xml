In many industrial processes, the concentration of the pro- tein in the fermentation broth is so high that a significant part of the protein is found in form of crys- tals or solid precipitates at the end of the fermentation process.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO93/13125 discloses a process for producing protease where the protease is precipitated during fermentation by adding a precipitating agent to the production medium. It was found that precipitating protease during fermentation protects the protease against proteolysis.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">For many fermentation products it is desired that the microorganism used in fermentation is removed from the product. One of the first steps in the product recovery process is usually removal of the cellular biomass from the product, for example by filtration or centrifugation removing the sok id cellular biomass from the liquid comprising the desired product. This step is often called the pri- mary separation step where the microorganism is separated from the liquid fraction, and the liquid fraction can subsequently be processed with one or more downstream steps, such as ultrafiltration, stabilisation, spray drying, granulation which eventually will turn the desired product into the form and concentration that is intended for this particular product.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, if part of the desired product is present in solid form after the fermentation, suita- ble measures must be taken to solubilize the product before the biomass is removed from the liquid fraction comprising the product.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat.

It is not important for the present invention whether the desired fermentation product is in crystalline or amorphous form or even in a mixture of these forms, what is important is that a significant part of the desired product is in solid form and therefore can the primary separation step not readily be performed as a simple solid/liquid separation process. The primary separation step has the pur- pose of removing the cells and cell debris from the desired product.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The invention relates to a method of recovering a desired fermentation product from a fer- mentation broth, wherein the fermentation product is present in at least partially in insoluble form in the fermentation broth such as in crystalline or amorphous form; comprising:</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">a first separation step separating the fermentation broth in a first phase and a second phase, wherein the first phase comprising liquid from the fermentation broth and desired fermentation product in soluble form; and the second phase comprises the desired fermen- tation product in insoluble form, cells and/or cell debris; and</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">a solubilisation step, wherein the desired fermentation product in the second phase is solu- bilized.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments the invention relates to a method further comprising a second sepa- ration step separating the liquid phase comprising of the solubilized desired fermentation product from the solid biomass, optionally after mixing the solubilized first phase with part or all of the first phase from the first separation step.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The invention is based on the observation that fermentation broth appears to contain some components that are detrimental to the solubilisation process. Data seems to indicate that optimal conditions for high solubility for proteins such as enzymes, are conditions with high enzyme con- centration and low ion concentration. However, it should be understood that the invention is not lim- ited by any particular theory. It has been found beneficial if the solubilisation of the desired product can take place in the absence of at least part of the liquid part of the fermentation broth containing the majority of these disadvantageous components.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the invention fermentation is intended to mean the process where one or more microorganisms are grown in a fermenter in a fermentation medium comprising all component necessary for the growth of the one or more microorganisms producing a fermentation broth com- prising the one or more microorganisms, spent substrate components and one or more desired fermentation products. If the yield of the desired fermentation product is sufficient high, part of the fermentation product may precipitate forming crystals or amorphous precipitates in the fermentation broth. This is well known in the art and many fermentation processes, microorganisms, medium components have been disclosed in the art. The invention is not limited by the particular fermenta- tion process as long as the fermentation process provides a fermentation broth comprising a de- sired fermentation product at least partially in insoluble form in the fermentation broth such as in crystalline or amorphous form.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Methods for fermenting microorganism for producing a desired product where the desired product precipitates during the fermentation has been described in the art e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 6,316,240, WO 03/050274, WO 93/13125 and EP2125865 and any of these methods for fermenting the microor- ganisms can be used together with the methods of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The fermentation process may be any suitable fermentation process providing a fermenta- tion broth comprising a desired fermentation product at least partially in insoluble form, such as a batch fermentation, fed-batch or continuous fermentation.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present invention may be useful for any fermentation in industrial scale, e.g. for any fermentation having culture media of at least 50 liters, such as at least 500 liters, such as at least 5,000 liters, such as at least 50,000 liters.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The fermentation product may be any product produced by microorganisms accumulating in the fermentation broth. The fermentation product may be primary metabolites, secondary metabo- lites, proteins, vitamins, hormones and carbohydrates. The fermentation product is preferably se- lected among proteins, such as enzymes. The fermentation product may even be a mixture of two or more desired enzymes e.g. a mixture comprising all enzymes necessary to degrade cellulose into low molecular weight sugars, such as glucose and cellubiose.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment the fermentation product comprises an enzyme selected from the group of enzyme classes consisting of oxidoreductases (EC 1), transferases (EC 2), hydrolases (EC 3), lyases (EC 4), isomerases (EC 5), and ligases (EC 6).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another embodiment the enzyme is an enzyme with an activity selected from the group of enzyme activities consisting of aminopeptidase, amylase, amyloglucosidase, mannanase, carbohy- drase, carboxypeptidase, catalase, cellulase, chitinase, cutinase, cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase, deoxyribonuclease, esterase, galactosidase, beta-galactosidase, glucoamylase, glucose oxidase, glucosidase, haloperoxidase, hemicellulase, invertase, isomerase, laccase, ligase, lipase, lyase, mannosidase, oxidase, pectinase, peroxidase, phytase, phenoloxidase, polyphenoloxidase, prote- ase, ribonuclease, transferase, transglutaminase, lysozyme, muramidase or xylanase.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Preferably the fermentation product is a protease or an alpha-amylase.

Protein Science 6 (1997) 501-523. Serine pro- teases are a subgroup of proteases characterized by having a serine in the active site, which forms a covalent adduct with the substrate. The subtilases may be divided into 6 sub-divisions, i.e. the Subtilisin family, the Thermitase family, the Proteinase K family, the Lantibiotic peptidase family, the Kexin family and the Pyrolysin family.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Examples of subtilases are those derived from Bacillus such as Bacillus lentus, <i>B. al</i>- <i>kalophilus</i>, <i>B. subtilis</i>, <i>B. amyloliquefaciens</i>, <i>Bacillus pumilus </i>and <i>Bacillus gibsonii </i>described in; U.S. Pat.

More than 80% of the crystals and/or precipi- tate and/or desired product bound to cell mass/insolubles may be solubilized according to the present invention; preferably more than 85%; more preferably more than 90% and in particular more than 95% of the crystals and/or precipitate and/or desired product bound to cell mass/insolubles may be solubil- ized</p><p id="p-0092" num="0101">In another embodiment the solubilisation of the desired product in the second phase may be done by diluting the second phase with water or an aqueous solution and adjusting the pH to a high pH value, preferably to a pH value in the range of 9.5 to 13, such as the range of 10 to 13.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0102">In still another embodiment the solubilisation or the desired product in the second phase is done by adding a chemical enhancing solubilisation of the desired product. The chemical enhancing solubilisation is preferably a polyol such as a low molecular weight polyethylene glycol, and the C<sub>2 </sub>to C<sub>8 </sub>alcohols having at least two OH groups, preferably with only two OH groups; especially preferred is the polyols where two OH groups are present on adjacent carbon atoms in the chain and the C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>8 </sub>alcohol is aliphatic and have a straight carbon chain. Preferred polyols include ethylene glycol, propyl- ene glycol, mono-propylene glycol, glycerol, the low molecular weight (about 900 or less) polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0103">In some embodiment an extended residence time is inserted after all ingredients and ad- justments have been added in order to allow the dissolution of the desired product to take place. Like other chemical process the solubilisation of the desired product take time and a resident period may be beneficial to allow more product to dissolve. In principle the residence time may be extend- ed until all the desired product is dissolved, but often the soluble product is more susceptible to degradation e.g. by proteases from the fermentation broth compared with the precipitated product, so in practice the skilled person often will select a relative short residence time in order to get as much desired product in solution but avoiding too much degradation of the soluble product.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0104">The residence may typically be up to 12 hours, such as in the range of 0-500 minutes, pref- erably in the range of 15-300 minutes, more preferred in the range of 30-90 minutes.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0105">After the solubilisation step the desired product may be recovered using methods known in the art such as further separation steps removing cells and cell debris and other solids from the mixture, concentration, formulation, drying such as spray drying, granulation etc.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0106">In some applications the mixture is subjected to a lysis step after the solubilisation step such as treatment with a chemical lysing agents such as a cell wall degrading enzymes e.g. lysozyme. Preferred lysis methods include. adding lysozyme or hydrolysis enzymes to solubilise suspended material as cells or residual fermentation raw materials.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0107">The particular selected process will be determined by several different factors such as the intended use of the desired product, available equipment and the amount of cells and cell debris in the second phase.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0108">Second separation step</p><p id="p-0100" num="0109">In a preferred embodiment the method of the invention further comprises a second separa- tion step removing cells and cell debris from the mixture comprising the solubilized desired product.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0110">After the solubilisation step the mixture is subjected to the second separation step, which is basically a solid/liquid separation process removing solids, such as cells, cell debris and solids orig- inating from the substrate; from the liquid fraction comprising the solubilized desired product. The second separation may be performed using any such equipment and methods known in the art for solid/liquid separations, such as centrifuges, decanters, filtration etc.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0111">Depending on the selected separation technology used in the first separation step, it may be beneficial to add one or more Chemicals for assisting the separation before the separation. For ex- ample, one or more flocculants may be added before the first separation process as known in the art. The type and amount of the flocculants are selected based on the properties of the particular selected fermentation broth and will typically be determined using simple routing experimentation. This it known in the art and the selection of type and amount of one or more flocculants to facilitate the separation is completely within the skills of the skilled practitioner. In one preferred embod- iment, part or all of the first phase from the first separation is mixed with the mixture coming from the solubilisation step. In this way the two streams are combined and the desired product, both the part that was in solution in the fermentation broth and consequently contained in the first phase of the first separation step, and the part that was precipitated in the fermentation broth and conse- quently ended in the second phase of the first separation step, can be further purified and pro- cessed together in subsequent downstream operations.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0112">This is particular beneficial for fermentations where the first phase comprises a significant amount of the desired product is solution. By mixing the first phase with the solubilized second phase before or after the second separation step will allow the skilled person to recover all desired product, both the part present in solid form in the second phase and the part present in solution in the first phase, together in downstream processes.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0113">The mixing of the first phase of the first separation step and the stream from the solubilisa- tion step comprising the solubilized desired product can take place either before or after the second separation step. If the first separation is performed in a way where the first phase comprises a sig- nificant amount of cell and cell debris is it preferred to add the first phase to the solubilized second phase before the second separation step so all cells and cell debris can be removed in the second separation step. If the first separation step is performed in a way so the first phase comprises no or only very minor amounts of the cells and cell debris; e.g. less than 1% of the total amount; the first phase may be added to the solubilized second phase either before or after the second separation step.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0114">The skilled person will appreciate that the temperature may influence the process in various ways; the temperature may influence the solubilisation kinetics e.g. the solubilisation proceeds faster at a higher temperature; the temperature may also influence the stability of the desired prod- uct e.g. may the stability of a desired product decrease when the temperature rises. This means that for a given recovery process, the skilled person will have to optimize the temperature in order to obtain the best possible recovery process, and further it means that the temperature that is opti- mal for one fermentation product may not be optimal for another fermentation product. This is all known to the skilled person and can be done using typical routine experiments. The process of the invention is typically performed at a temperature in the range of 0-70&#xb0; C., e.g. in the range of 10- 50&#xb0; C., often in the range of 15-45&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0115">The method according to the invention has the benefit compared with prior art processes such as the method disclosed in EP 2 125 865 that the volume needed for solubilizing the desired product is significantly lower. Without wishing to be limited by any theory it is believed that this is because a substantial part of the salts present during fermentation where the precipitation took place has been removed with the first phase and is therefore absent during the solubilisation pro- cess. This has the benefit that the water consumption and /or chemicals enhancing solubilisation is significantly lower which has a number of significant additional benefits in industrial production scale operations, in addition to the cost of water and chemicals enhancing solubilisation; such as a reduced volume of waste water that need to be treated and further, the capacity costs for handling large volumes, equipment for downstream processing is reduced because the volumes that need to be treated are significantly lower.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0116">Further, the solubilisation of a precipitated product according to the invention may also pro- ceed faster that the solubilisation of the same product using a method according to prior art, giving the advantage of a higher throughput using the method according to the invention and consequent- ly a lower demand for holding capacity.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0117">Subsequent downstream operations</p><p id="p-0109" num="0118">The resulting desired product may be further isolated by methods known in the art. For ex- ample, the desired product may be recovered by conventional procedures including, but not limited to, further filtration, e.g., for removing any germs; ultra-filtration and micro-filtration, centrifugation, extraction, spray-drying, evaporation, precipitation or crystallization, hydrolysis (e.g. lysozyme or other) or other mechanical suspension degradation</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0110" num="0119">The invention may also be described by the following embodiments:</p><p id="p-0111" num="0120">Embodiment 1: A method for recovering a desired product from a fermentation broth, where the desired product is present in precipitated form in the fermentation broth, the method comprising the steps of:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0121">a) a first separation step separating the fermentation broth in a first phase and a second phase, wherein the first phase comprises supernatant, desired product in soluble form and optionally cells and cell debris, and the second phase comprises desired product in precipitated form, cells and cell debris; and</li>    <li id="ul0009-0002" num="0122">b) a solubilization step where the desired product in precipitated form in the second phase is solubilized.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0112" num="0123">Embodiment 2.
