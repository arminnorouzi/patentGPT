level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a dispersion comprising an inhalable immunosuppressive macrocyclic active ingredient in liposomally solubilized form in an aqueous carrier liquid. Specifically, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of dispersions comprising cyclosporine A in liposomally solubilized form. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of lyophilized pharmaceutical compositions comprising an inhalable immunosuppressive active ingredient as well as to lyophilized pharmaceutical compositions obtainable by such a process.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Cyclosporine (CsA or &#x2018;ciclosporin&#x2019; as used herein synonymously) is a cyclic oligopeptide with immunosuppressive and calcineurin inhibitory activity. It is characterised by a selective and reversible mechanism of immunosuppression by blocking the activation of T-lymphocytes by the production of certain cytokines which are involved in the regulation of these T-cells. This involves, in particular, the inhibition of the synthesis of interleukin-2 which, at the same time, suppresses the proliferation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes which are responsible, for example, for the rejection of extraneous tissues. Cyclosporine acts intracellularly by binding to the so-called cyclophilines or immunophilines which belong to the family of proteins which bind cyclosporine with high affinity. The complex of cyclosporine and cyclophilin subsequently blocks the serine-threonine-phosphatase-calcineurin. Its activity state in turn controls the activation of transcription factors such as NF-KappaB or NFATp/c which play a decisive role in the activation of various cytokine genes including interleukin-2. This results in the arrest of the immunocompetent lymphocytes during the G0 or G1 phase of the cellular cycle since the proteins which are essential for cell division such as interleukin-2 can no longer be produced. T-helper cells which increase the activity of cytotoxic T-cells which are responsible for rejection are the preferred site of attack for cyclosporine. Furthermore, cyclosporine inhibits the synthesis and release of further lymphokines which are responsible for the proliferation of mature cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and for other functions of the lymphocytes. The ability of cyclosporine to block interleukin-2 is critical for its clinical efficacy: Transplant recipients which tolerate their transplants well are characterised by a low production of interleukin-2. Patients with manifest rejection reactions, on the contrary, show no inhibition of interleukin-2 production.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The first and so far only cyclosporine which has been placed on the market (in the 1980s) is cyclosporine A (CsA). CsA is defined chemically as cyclo-[[(E)-(2S,3R,4R)-3-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-(methylamino)-6-octenoyl]-L-2-aminobutyryl-N-methylglycyl-N-methyl-L-leucyl-L-valyl-N-methyl-L-leucyl-L-alanyl-D-alanyl-N-methyl-L-leucyl-N-methyl-L- leucyl-N-methyl-L-valyl]. Its availability initiated a new era in transplant medicine because, with its help, the proportion of transplanted organs which remain functional in the long term, could be increased substantially. The first cyclosporine medicament (Sandimmun&#xae; of Sandoz) could already increase the success rate in kidney transplantations by a factor of about 2. A new oral preparation of cyclosporine (Neoral&#xae; of Sandoz, later Novartis) with higher and more reliable bioavailability allowed better dosing and further increase of the success rate since the 1990s. Despite some new developments of active agents, CsA is still a frequently used agent in transplantation medicine.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Today, lung transplantations can, in principle, also be carried out successfully if patients are treated with CsA. Since the introduction of this active agent in clinical therapy, the number of lung transplantations carried out worldwide has increased dramatically. This is true for both, the transplantation of a single lung as well as the transplantation of both lungs. Lung transplantations are normally contemplated in the case of patients with a final-staged lung disease where medicinal therapy has failed and life expectancy is short due to the disease. Transplantations of a single lung are indicated, for example, in the case of certain forms of emphysema and fibrosis, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Both lungs are transplanted in cases of cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis), primary pulmonary hypertension, emphysema with global insufficiency, frequent serious infections as well as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with complication by repeated infections. In the case of a successful lung transplantation, the patients' quality of life can be increased again to an almost normal level. However, contrary to heart, kidney and liver transplantations, the survival times after lung transplantations are still relatively short and amount to an average of only 5 years. This might be due, amongst other things, to the fact that the active agent cyclosporine cannot be effectively dosed with all patients due to systemic side effects such as renal dysfunction, increased serum levels of creatinine and urea, renal damage with structural changes, for example, interstitial fibrosis, increased serum levels of bilirubine and liver enzymes, hypertrichiosis, tremor, fatigue, headache, gingivitis hypertrophicans, gastrointestinal complains like anorexia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, gastritis, gastroenteritis, paraesthesia, stinging sensations in the hands and feet, arterial hypertension, increased blood fat levels, acne, rashes, allergic skin reactions, hyperglycaemia, anaemia, hyperuricaemia, gout, increasing body weight, oedemas, stomach ulcers, convulsions, menstrual disorders, hyperkalaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hot flushes, erythema, itching, muscular cramps, muscular pain, myopathy, etc.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, it would be desirable, if, for example, after a lung transplantation or in cases of certain other indications, CsA could be administered in a targeted and tissue specific fashion and so as to achieve only a low systemic bioavailability of the active agent in order to minimize the impact of the active agent in healthy tissue.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A suitable dosage form could also be used for the treatment and prevention of diseases such as asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, alveolitis and parenchymal lung diseases (see: Drugs for the treatment of respiratory diseases, edited by Domenico Spina, Clive p. Page et. al., Cambridge University Press, 2003, ISBN 0521773210). New therapeutic aspects also result for the topical treatment of possible autoimmune included diseases such as neurodermatitis, psoriasis, unspecific eczema, skin proliferations or mutations, and for the treatment after skin transplantations. An interesting area of application is in the field of ophthalmology, for example, for the treatment after corneal transplants, of keratoconjunctivitis or other infectious eye diseases which respond partly insufficiently to anti-inflammatory therapy, for example with steroids. It is also useful for the treatment of keratitis in animals, such as dogs.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Attempts have been made to administer cyclosporine locally, for example, in the form of oily eye drops at 1% and 2% (formulation according to the German codex of medicines using refined peanut oil as solubilizer) or as an aerosol. However, this approach normally fails, mainly due to the very low aqueous solubility of the active agent which renders efficient administration considerably difficult. Thus, in the case of pulmonary application, certain adjuvants for solubilization which may be used in the case of oral administration cannot be employed for lack of tolerability. For example, Sandimmun&#xae; Optoral capsules (Novartis) which contain cyclosporine A, comprise a microemulsion concentrate with ethanol, propylene glycol and significant amounts of surfactants and, therefore, constitute a formulation which, if inhaled, would cause serious toxic effects. Similarly, the Sandimmun&#xae; infusion solution concentrate (Novartis), which is available for infusion, is also not inhalable: The only adjuvants contained therein are ethanol and poly(oxyethylene)-40-castor oil. It can be used for infusion only because it is previously diluted with a 0.9% sodium chloride solution or a 5% glucose solution, at a ratio of 1:20 to 1:100. This results in large volumes which can be administered by infusion, but not by inhalation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">WO 2007/065588 A1 discloses liquid pharmaceutical compositions containing a therapeutically effective dose of a cyclosporin; an aqueous carrier liquid; a first solubilizing substance selected among the group of phospholipids; and a second solubilizing substance selected among the group of non-ionic surfactants. The disclosed composition is suitable for oral, parenteral, nasal, mucosal, topical, and particularly pulmonary application in the form of an aerosol.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">WO 2016/146645A1 discloses liposomal cyclosporine formulations that preferably comprise unilamellar liposomes. The liposomes preferably have an average diameter of at most about 100 nm measured as z-average using photon correlation spectroscopy and a polydispersity index of at most about 0.5 as measured by photon correlation spectroscopy.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The formulation can be presented as a solid formulation for reconstitution with an aqueous solvent immediately before inhalation. The solid formulation can be prepared by any method suitable for removing the solvent from a liquid formulation. Preferred examples of methods for preparing such solid formulation are freeze drying and spray drying. To protect the active ingredient during the drying process, it may be useful to incorporate lyoprotective and/or bulking agents, such as a sugar or a sugar alcohol, in particular sucrose, fructose, glucose, trehalose, mannitol, sorbitol, isomalt, or xylitol. Most notably, however, the sugar is added to the preformed formulation comprising the liposomal encapsulated CsA.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">With regard to the high potency of many macrocyclic immunosuppressive active ingredients, such as cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, sirolimus and/or everolimus, as well as in view of the potentially serious unwanted side effects that these potent compounds may have when not properly dosed, it is of great importance that the content of these active ingredients in pharmaceutical compositions comprising such macrocyclic immunosuppressive compounds can be precisely controlled in the manufacturing process. This is important to avoid potentially serious side effects as described above due to overdosing these compounds or to avoid lack of efficacy due to underdosing which might also lead to serious complications such as transplant rejection.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, it is of outmost importance that the content of the macrocyclic immunosuppressive active agent can de be determined and controlled in each step of the manufacturing process of a pharmaceutical composition comprising such active ingredients.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In this context, especially the very low solubility in aqueous solution of many macrocyclic immunosuppressive agents, especially of cyclosporin A and tacrolimus, is considered problematic. These compounds usually are prepared by fermentation and further purified by crystallization. The physical properties of these highly purified compounds, unfortunately, tend to change in the course of time, for example due to aggregation, agglutination or clumping processes on which larger particles are formed which may have a different, often less favorable dispersion or dissolution behavior. This, however, especially when material which has not been freshly prepared is used, may raise the risk for inaccurate concentrations of dispersed or dissolved active ingredients in the manufacturing process and in the final dosage form, accordingly.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions comprising an inhalable immunosuppressive active ingredient such as cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus or others which is, to a large extend, independent of the physical properties with which the macrocyclic immunosuppressive active ingredient is supplied and deployed.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further objects of the present invention will become apparent from the present disclosure including the examples and claims.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the first aspect, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of a dispersion comprising an inhalable immunosuppressive macrocyclic active ingredient in liposomally solubilized form in an aqueous carrier liquid, the process comprising the steps of<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0017">a) providing a mixture comprising        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0018">the inhalable immunosuppressive macrocyclic active ingredient;</li>            <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0019">a membrane-forming substance selected from the group of phospholipids;</li>            <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0020">a solubility-enhancing substance selected from the group of non-ionic surfactants;</li>            <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0021">optionally one or more excipients; and</li>            <li id="ul0003-0005" num="0022">the aqueous carrier liquid;</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0023">b) dispersing the mixture as provided in step a) to form an intermediate aqueous dispersion comprising the inhalable immunosuppressive macrocyclic active ingredient in the aqueous carrier liquid; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0024">c) homogenizing the intermediate aqueous dispersion as formed in step b) to form the dispersion comprising the inhalable immunosuppressive macrocyclic active ingredient in liposomally solubilized form.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0018" num="0025">In a second aspect, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a lyophilized pharmaceutical composition for reconstitution in an aqueous carrier liquid, the lyophilized pharmaceutical composition comprising an inhalable immunosuppressive macrocyclic active ingredient in liposomally solubilized form, wherein the process comprises the preparation of a dispersion comprising an inhalable immunosuppressive macrocyclic active ingredient in liposomally solubilized form in an aqueous carrier liquid according to the process of the first aspect of the invention; and further comprising the step of<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0026">d) removing the aqueous carrier liquid at least partially under lyophilization conditions to form the lyophilized pharmaceutical composition.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0019" num="0027">In a third aspect, the present invention provides a lyophilized pharmaceutical composition comprising an inhalable immunosuppressive macrocyclic active ingredient in liposomally solubilized form for reconstitution in an aqueous carrier liquid, wherein the composition is obtained or obtainable by a process according to the second aspect of the invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0028">In a fourth aspect, the present invention relates to the lyophilized pharmaceutical composition according to the third aspect of the invention for use as a medicament for pulmonary application.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0029">The terms &#x201c;consist of&#x201d;, &#x201c;consists of&#x201d; and &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; as used herein are so-called closed language meaning that only the mentioned components are present. The terms &#x201c;comprise&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; as used herein are so-called open language, meaning that one or more further components may or may not also be present.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0030">The term &#x201c;active pharmaceutical ingredient&#x201d; (also referred to as &#x201c;API&#x201d; throughout this document) refers to any type of pharmaceutically active compound or derivative that is useful in the prevention, diagnosis, stabilization, treatment, or&#x2014;generally speaking&#x2014;management of a condition, disorder or disease.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0031">The term &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; as used herein refers to a dose, concentration or strength which is useful for producing a desired pharmacological effect. In the context of the present invention, the term &#x201c;therapeutically effective&#x201d; also includes prophylactic activity. The therapeutic dose is to be defined depending on the individual case of application. Depending on the nature and severity of the disease, route of application as well as height and state of the patient, a therapeutic dose is to be determined in a way known to the skilled person.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0032">In the context of the present invention, a &#x201c;pharmaceutical composition&#x201d; is a preparation of at least one API and at least one adjuvant, which, in the simplest case, can be, for example, an aqueous liquid carrier such as water or saline.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0033">&#x2018;A&#x2019; or &#x2018;an&#x2019; does not exclude a plurality; i.e. the singular forms &#x2018;a&#x2019;, &#x2018;an&#x2019; and &#x2018;the&#x2019; should be understood as to include plural referents unless the context clearly indicates or requires otherwise. In other words, all references to singular characteristics or limitations of the present disclosure shall include the corresponding plural characteristic or limitation, and vice versa, unless explicitly specified otherwise or clearly implied to the contrary by the context in which the reference is made. The terms &#x2018;a&#x2019;, &#x2018;an&#x2019; and &#x2018;the&#x2019; hence have the same meaning as &#x2018;at least one&#x2019; or as &#x2018;one or more&#x2019; unless defined otherwise. For example, reference to &#x2018;an ingredient&#x2019; includes mixtures of ingredients, and the like.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0034">When used herein the term &#x2018;about&#x2019; or &#x2018;ca.&#x2019; will compensate for variability allowed for in the pharmaceutical industry and inherent in pharmaceutical products, such as differences in content due to manufacturing variation and/or time-induced product degradation. The term allows for any variation, which in the practice of pharmaceuticals would allow the product being evaluated to be considered bioequivalent in a mammal to the recited strength of a claimed product.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0035">&#x2018;Essentially&#x2019;, &#x2018;about&#x2019;, &#x2018;approximately&#x2019;, &#x2018;substantially&#x201d; and the like in connection with an attribute or value include the exact attribute or the precise value, as well as any attribute or value typically considered to fall within a normal range or variability accepted in the technical field concerned. For example, &#x2018;substantially free of water&#x201d; means that no water is deliberately included in a formulation, but does not exclude the presence of residual moisture.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0036">In the context of the present invention, a &#x201c;colloidal aqueous solution&#x201d; preferably means a solution without organic solvent consisting of mainly unilamellar liposomes having a mean diameter of at most 100 nm and/or a polydispersity index (PI) of not more than 0.50 in which the active agent is, at least predominantly, dissolved. Preferably, water, or more specifically saline is the only liquid solvent contained in the preparation. Furthermore, it is preferred that the preparation is an aqueous solution or an aqueous colloidal solution, i.e., a monophasic liquid system. Such a system is essentially free of dispersed particles having a greater than colloidal particle size. By convention, particles below about 1 &#x3bc;m are regarded as colloidal particles which do not constitute a separate phase and do not result in a physical phase boundary. Sometimes, particles in a size range just above 1 &#x3bc;m are also still considered colloidal.

An &#x2018;Inhalable immunosuppressive macrocyclic active ingredient&#x2019; as used in the context of the present invention is to be interpreted in a broad sense and comprises immunosuppressive macrocyclic active ingredients that can be administered to human or animal, preferably to a human or warm-blooded animal, specifically to a human, by inhalation, whereas during such inhalation the immunosuppressive macrocyclic active ingredient or API is transported to at least a part or portion of the respiratory system of said animal or human, specifically to the lungs of said animal or human.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0047">In the context of the present invention an immunosuppressive macrocyclic active ingredient may be, for example, cyclosporin A (hereinafter also referred to as &#x2018;CsA&#x2019;), tacrolimus, sirolimus and/or everolimus, specifically however, cyclosporin A and/or tacrolimus, more specifically cyclosporin A, wherein cyclosporine A is defined chemically as cyclo-[[(E)-(2S,3R,4R)-3-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-(methylamino)-6-octenoyl]-L-2-aminobutyryl-N-methylglycyl-N-methyl-L-leucyl-L-valyl-N-methyl-L-leucyl-L-alanyl-D-alanyl-N-methyl-L-leucyl-N-methyl-L-leucyl-N-methyl-L-valyl] (CAS number 59865-13-3) and is a cyclic peptide with immunosuppressive activity.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0048">In the context of the present invention, cyclosporin A may be used in any quality or of any origin that is suitable for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition. For example, cyclosporin A may be prepared by standard fermentation techniques and may, in specific embodiments, be used in any suitable form, such as in any particle size or powder form in the context of the process according to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0049">The process according to the present invention allows to prepare the inhalable immunosuppressive macrocyclic ingredient such as cyclosporine A, tacrolimus, sirolimus and/or everolimus or a mixture comprising one or more of these compounds, specifically cyclosporin A, in liposomally solubilized form. The term &#x201c;liposomally solubilized form&#x201d; as used herein means that the at least one inhalable immunosuppressive macrocyclic ingredient as described above, specifically CsA, is incorporated or intercalated in the liposome-forming structures to be formed by the other ingredients, specifically by the membrane-forming substance selected from the group of phospholipids and by a solubility-enhancing substance selected from the group of non-ionic surfactants as described in further detail below. The liposome-forming structures as referred to herein, however, may or may not have a continuous or closed bilayer membrane. In specific embodiments, the liposome-forming structures may at least be partly present in unilamellar form or, preferably, may predominantly be present in unilamellar form. The term &#x201c;unilamellar&#x201d; as used herein means that the corresponding liposome-forming structures only comprise a single layer formed by a single lipid bilayer membrane and not a plurality of lipid bilayer membranes in a layered arrangement.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0050">According to step a) of the process of to the present invention a mixture is provided comprising, as a first ingredient, the at least one inhalable immunosuppressive macrocyclic active ingredient as described above, specifically CsA.

Accordingly, in specific embodiments, the membrane-forming substance selected from the group of phospholipids is a mixture of natural phospholipids.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0053">Phospholipids are amphiphilic lipids which contain phosphorus. Known also as phosphatides, they play an important role in nature, especially as the double layer forming constituents of biological membranes and frequently used for pharmaceutical purposes are those phospholipids which are chemically derived from phosphatidic acid. The latter is a (usually doubly) acylated glycerol-3-phosphate in which the fatty acid residues may be of different lengths. The derivatives of phosphatidic acids are, for example, the phosphocholines or phosphatidylcholines, in which the phosphate group is additionally esterified with choline, as well as phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositols etc. Lecithins are natural mixtures of various phospholipids which usually contain a high proportion of phosphatidylcholines. Preferred phospholipids according to the invention are lecithins as well as pure or enriched phosphatidylcholines such as dimyristoylphospatidylcholine, di-palmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine and distearoylphosphatidylcholine.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0054">In further specific embodiments, the membrane-forming substance selected from the group of phospholipids to be provided in the mixture of step a) of the present invention is a lecithin containing unsaturated fatty acid residues. In yet further specific embodiments, the membrane-forming substance selected from the group of phospholipids is a lecithin selected from the group consisting of soybean lecithin, Lipoid 90, Lipoid S75, Lipoid S100, Phospholipon&#xae; G90, Phospholipon&#xae;100 or a comparable lecithin. In further specific embodiments, the membrane-forming substance selected from the group of phospholipids is selected from Lipoid S100, Lipoid S75, particularly Lipoid S100.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0055">The third ingredient of the mixture to be provided according to step a) of the process of the present invention is a solubility-enhancing substance selected from the group of non-ionic surfactants or a mixture of two or more different solubility-enhancing substances selected from the group of non-ionic surfactants. Non-ionic surfactants have&#x2014;as other surfactants&#x2014;at least one rather hydrophilic and at least one rather lipophilic molecular region. There are monomeric, low molecular weight non-ionic surfactants and non-ionic surfactants having an oligomeric or polymeric structure. Examples of suitable non-ionic surfactants suitable as solubility-enhancing substances according to be comprised by the mixture of step a) of the present invention comprise polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters such as, for example, polyoxyethylene sorbitan oleate, sorbitan fatty acid esters, poloxamers, vitamin E-TPGS (D-&#x3b1;-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate) and tyloxapol.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0056">In specific embodiments, the solubility-enhancing substance selected from the group of non-ionic surfactants may be selected from the group of polysorbates and vitamin E-TPGS, preferably is selected from the group of polysorbates. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the solubility-enhancing substance selected from the group of non-ionic surfactants is polysorbate 80.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0057">As an optional fourth ingredient, the mixture to be provided according to step a) of the process of the present invention may optionally comprise one or more excipients. Suitable excipients as referred to herein are known to the skilled person. For example, the mixture to be provided according to step a) of the present invention may optionally contain pH-correcting agents in order to adjust the pH, such as physiologically acceptable bases, acids or salts, optionally as buffer mixtures. In this context, the term &#x201c;physiologically acceptable&#x201d; does not mean that one of the excipients must be tolerable on its own and in undiluted form, which would not be the case, for example, for sodium hydroxide solution, but means that it must be tolerable at the concentration in which it is contained in the lyophilized pharmaceutical composition, especially after reconstitution.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0058">Suitable pH-correcting agents or buffers for adjusting the pH may be selected, inter alia, with regard to the intended route of application. Examples for potentially useful excipients of this group comprise sodium hydroxide solution, basic salts of sodium, calcium or magnesium such as, for example, citrates, phosphates, acetates, tartrates, lactates etc., amino acids, acidic salts such as hydrogen phosphates or dihydrogen phosphates, especially those of sodium, moreover, organic and inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, cromoglycinic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, lysine, methionine, acidic hydrogen phosphates of sodium or potassium etc.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0059">In further specific embodiments, the mixture to be provided according to process step a) of the present invention may comprise one or more further excipients which are selected from chelating agents, for example, disodium edetate dihydrate, calcium sodium EDTA, preferably disodium edetate dihydrate.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0060">Furthermore, the mixture to be provided according to step a) of the present invention may or may not contain as an excipient osmotically active adjuvants in order to adjust it to a desired osmolality after reconstitution, which is important in certain applications such as especially for inhalation, in order to achieve good tolerability. Such adjuvants are frequently referred to as &#x201c;isotonizing agents&#x201d; even if their addition does not necessarily result in an isotonic composition after reconstitution, but in an isotonicity close to physiological osmolality in order to achieve the best possible physiological tolerability.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0061">A particularly frequently used isotonizing agent is sodium chloride, but this is not suitable in every case. In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the mixture according to process step a) contains no sodium chloride, except, of course, natural ubiquitous sodium chloride amounts which may also be contained in water of pharmaceutical quality. In another embodiment, the mixture according to process step a) contains an essentially neutral salt as isotonizing agent which is not sodium chloride, but, for example, a sodium sulphate or sodium phosphate. It should be noted, however, that the isotonizing agent may also be comprised by the aqueous carrier liquid, for example in form of an aqueous solution of sodium chloride (saline). In this case, however, salts other than sodium salts may be also preferable. Thus, it is known that certain calcium and magnesium salts have a positive or supporting effect in the inhalation of active agent solutions, possibly because they themselves counteract the local irritations caused by the administration and because they have a bronchodilatory effect which is currently postulated in the clinical literature (for example Hughes et al., Lancet. 2003; 361 (9375): 2114-7) and/or because they inhibit the adhesion of germs to the proteoglycans of the mucosa of the respiratory tract so that the mucociliary clearance as the organism's natural defense against pathogens is supported indirectly (K. W. Tsang et al., Eur. Resp. 2003. 21, 932-938). Advantageous may be, for example, magnesium sulphate, which has excellent pulmonary tolerability and can be inhaled without concern, as well as calcium chloride (1-10 mmol).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0062">In further specific embodiments, suitable excipients that may be added to the mixture to be provided according to step a) of the present invention comprise saccharides or sugars, such as disaccharides as described in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0063">As a further ingredient, the mixture to be provided according to step a) of the present invention comprises an aqueous carrier liquid or aqueous liquid vehicle. The aqueous carrier liquid or vehicle may be water or an aqueous solution of pharmaceutically acceptable salts or isotonizing agents and preferably may be sterile.

For performing the dispersion according to step b), the mixture as prepared according to step a) as described above may be transferred to a vessel suitable for dispersing the mixture or, in alternative embodiments, the dispersing may be performed in the same vessel of apparatus as used in step a). Suitable vessels may be, for example, vessels made of a material suitable for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions such as suitable polymeric materials or preferably stainless steel.

The teeth may be arranged around the corresponding circumference of the rotor and/or the stator, respectively, usually in the form of rows of teeth. It should be noted that both, the rotor and/or the stator may have just one row of teeth or a multiplicity of rows of teeth which are then usually arranged in a concentric manner with regard to the main axis of rotation of the disperser. The mixture to be dispersed, due to the rotation of the rotor, usually is forced through the gaps between the teeth or rows of teeth of the rotor and/or the stator whereby a shear force is exerted on the mixture to be dispersed.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0080">In further specific embodiments, the dispersing according to step b) of the present invention may also be conducted using an inline disperser.
