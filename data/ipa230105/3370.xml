For example, illumination apparatus can illuminate the subjects to reduce the generation of dark shadows, as well as simulate natural light effects in natural conditions (such as day, noon, night, etc.), or simulate special scenes (such as lightning, fireworks, etc.). When a large-area shooting scene is involved, more illumination apparatuses are generally utilized for the purpose of producing light with stronger brightness. However, the utilization of the multiple apparatuses results in occupy of a large space, troublesome operation, and failure to achieve a desired effect, thus high-power illumination apparatuses are desired. High-power illumination apparatuses involve more light sources, such as LED light-emitting units, which means that high-power driving power circuits and complex control circuits are also required.

The first air inlets <b>80</b><i>a </i>are respectively arranged at two sides of the center region of the casing (the same shaded area as indicated by <b>80</b><i>d </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0082">In this embodiment, each first air inlet <b>80</b><i>a </i>is provided with a grid structure to prevent large particles of impurities from entering the casing <b>80</b> due to the drawing of the fan <b>40</b>. Alternatively, a grid structure may also be arranged along the length direction of the illumination apparatus at an outer side of the first air inlet <b>80</b><i>a</i>, in such condition, the arrangement of the grid structure at the outer side of the first air inlet <b>80</b><i>a </i>may also achieve the same purpose.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0083">It can be understood that, furthermore, since the convex portion has lateral sides which are formed during the stretching of the convex portion, the first air inlets <b>80</b><i>a </i>are further defined in the lateral sides, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, in which, the first air inlets <b>80</b><i>a </i>are defined in the lateral sides of the convex portion.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0084">It can be understood that, in other embodiments, the power source <b>90</b> can be arranged between the fin assembly <b>30</b> and the air outlets <b>80</b><i>b</i>. For example, as long as the width of the illumination apparatus permitted, the power source <b>90</b> can be installed within the space between the first thermal dissipation ends <b>30</b><i>c </i>and the air outlets <b>80</b><i>b</i>, or the power source <b>90</b> can be installed within the space between the second thermal dissipation ends <b>30</b><i>d </i>and the air outlets <b>80</b><i>b</i>. For example, an escape space is defined in the fin assembly <b>30</b> facing the air outlets <b>80</b><i>b</i>, and the power source <b>90</b> is accommodated in the escape space.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0085">In an embodiment, the casing <b>80</b> further defines therein second air inlets <b>80</b><i>c </i>passing through the casing wall. The second air inlets are arranged adjacent to the first air inlets <b>80</b><i>a</i>. The second air inlets and the circuit board <b>20</b> are arranged oppositely to each other in the direction of the first connection line and a negative pressure zone <b>80</b><i>c </i>is formed between the second air inlets and the circuit board <b>20</b>. The fan <b>40</b> is configured to draw air through the first air inlets <b>80</b><i>a </i>and evacuate the airflow in the negative pressure zone <b>80</b><i>c</i>, so that a negative pressure is formed in the negative pressure zone <b>80</b><i>c </i>and airflow outside the casing <b>80</b> is drawn through the second air inlets <b>80</b><i>a</i>. It can be understood that the second air inlets <b>80</b><i>c </i>may be arranged at the casing at two sides of the power source (adapter).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0086">In the space between the first air inlets <b>80</b><i>a </i>and the fan <b>40</b>, the airflow is drawn by the fan <b>40</b> to form suction airflow. The airflow in the space between the second air inlets and the circuit board <b>20</b> is continuously evacuated, and a negative pressure is generated above the circuit board <b>20</b>, such that the airflow outside the casing <b>80</b> can be continuously drawn to the negative pressure space via the second air inlets. The airflow enters the casing <b>80</b> under the action of negative pressure and passes through the circuit board <b>20</b>, which further solves the heat dissipation problem of the electrical components on the circuit board <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0087">In this embodiment, gaps are formed among the blades of the fan <b>40</b> and are configured to draw the air from the outside of the fan <b>40</b> into the inside of the fan <b>40</b> and to introduce the airflow inside the fan <b>40</b> out. In the embodiment of the present application, each fan has a central axis and a plurality of blades connected to the central axis. A plurality of blades are arranged in a spiral manner along an outer circumference of the central axis. The gap is formed between adjacent blades, and the gaps formed among the plurality of blades constitute an airflow guide channel configured for sucking and discharging the air. In this embodiment, bases on the blades are connected to the central axis, and tips of the blades extend and inclined towards directions away from the first air inlets <b>80</b><i>a</i>. In this way, the air drawn by the fan from the first air inlets <b>80</b><i>a </i>impinges on the heat dissipation fins in a manner of downward pressure blowing, and flows out along the air outlet paths between adjacent fins.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0088">In an embodiment, along the direction of the first connection, at least part of the fan <b>40</b> overlaps with at least part of the fin assembly <b>30</b>, so as to reduce the size of the whole apparatus along the direction of the first connection line, that is, the thickness dimension as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0089">In an embodiment, the fin assembly <b>30</b> defines therein a first accommodation cavity <b>30</b><i>e</i>.

The fan <b>40</b> and the fin assembly <b>30</b> at least partially overlap with each along the direction of the first connection line. It can be understood that the fan can be completely located in the first accommodation cavity <b>30</b><i>e </i>and flush with the second substrate <b>60</b>, so that the size of the fan <b>40</b> in the direction of the first connection line can completely overlap with the size of the fin assembly <b>30</b> in the direction of the first connection line, in which way, the overall size of the apparatus in the direction of the first connection line can be minimized to the greatest extend.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0090">In an embodiment, first notches <b>50</b><i>a </i>are defined at edges of the first substrate <b>50</b>, second notches <b>60</b><i>a </i>are defined at edges of the second substrate <b>60</b>, third notches are defined at the first thermal dissipation ends <b>30</b><i>c </i>or the second thermal dissipation ends <b>30</b><i>d</i>, and the first notches <b>50</b><i>a</i>, the second notches <b>60</b><i>a</i>, and the third notches <b>30</b><i>f </i>communicate along the direction of the first connection line. It can be understood that these notches may be completely aligned and flush with each other. It can also be understood that these notches may not be completely aligned with each other, but still form a complete communication channel, as long as wires can be placed therein. The illumination apparatus further comprises an electrical connector (not shown in the figures). The circuit board <b>20</b> and the light source assembly <b>10</b> are electrically connected through the electrical connector. The electrical connector is arranged within the space communicating the first notches <b>50</b><i>a</i>, the second notches <b>60</b><i>a</i>, and the third notches <b>30</b><i>f </i>Generally, the electrical connector may comprise: a first electrical connection adapter adapted to the light source assembly, a second electrical connection adapter adapted to the circuit board, and several wires in connection between the first electrical connection adapter and the second electrical connection adapter.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0091">In the illumination apparatus provided by the above embodiment, different ends of the fins in the fin assembly <b>30</b> are configured to realize different functions. Different ends of the fins are fully utilized to provide heat conduction paths for the light source assembly <b>10</b> and the circuit board <b>20</b>. Moreover, the power source <b>90</b> is configured in the air inlet path or the air outlet path, and corresponding heat conduction paths are particularly configured for the components requiring heat dissipation in the apparatus, such that the components requiring heat dissipation are provided with separate heat conduction paths. Since the components requiring heat dissipation in the apparatus are different in the heating powers as well as the heat quantity required to be dissipated per unit time, each component requiring heat dissipation has an independent heat conduction path. Each path can be correspondingly constructed according to the heating power of the corresponding components requiring heat dissipation. Each path can be fully utilized. The heat dissipation path has no margin, the heat dissipation area has no waste, the structure of the whole apparatus can be simplified, the lightweight can be realized, and the heat dissipation efficiency is synchronously improved, such that the series problems caused by the integration of the components requiring heat dissipation in the light source in the existing technology are avoided.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0092">The aforementioned embodiments are only preferred embodiments of the present application, and are not intended to limit the present application.
