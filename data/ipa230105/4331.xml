For example, the specific color is gold, silver, white, or transparent. Since some image forming apparatus <b>30</b> (particularly inkjet type) can use inks of different colors in addition to cyan, magenta, yellow, and black, the spot color may be different depending on the image forming apparatus <b>30</b>. Further, the specific color (spot color) can be a color that is not expressed with RGB by the application software. A coloring material such as toner or ink capable of printing a spot color is called a spot color material (or special color material). In the present embodiment, the color of the IR toner is the spot color.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Further, the term &#x201c;transparent&#x201d; refers to being invisible to light of a certain wavelength.

However, the connection therebetween is not necessarily constantly maintained, and a user can attach and detach the dedicated network. In addition to the USB cable, examples of the dedicated line include, a personal computer (PC) card, a peripheral component interconnect (PCI) bus, an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1394 bus, and a small computer system interface (SCSI).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In another example, the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> and the image forming apparatus <b>30</b>A are wirelessly connected to each other so as to communicate with each other. Examples of peer to peer wireless communication include Bluetooth&#xae; and wireless local area network (LAN).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The information processing apparatus <b>10</b> is communicably connected to the image forming apparatus <b>30</b>B via the network N. The network N is assumed to be a general-purpose network such as a LAN or the Internet. The LAN is, for example, a LAN in a facility such as an office where the image forming apparatus <b>30</b>B is installed. In another example, the network N further includes a virtual private network (VPN) and a wide area Ethernet&#xae;. The network N is configured as one or both of a wired network and a wireless network.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The information processing apparatus <b>10</b> executes various control programs, such as an operating system (OS) and the printer driver <b>11</b>, and application software, to provide functions corresponding to the application software. The information processing apparatus <b>10</b> is often called a computer. The control program is, for example, a program that is so-called a device driver (software prepared to enable the OS to control hardware and the like connected to a personal computer). An example of the device driver is the printer driver <b>11</b>. Specific examples of the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> include a PC, a smartphone, a tablet terminal, a personal digital assistant (PDA), and a wearable PC.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Other examples of the information processing apparatus <b>10</b> include an electronic whiteboard capable of mutual communication, an output device such as digital signage, a projector, and a videoconference terminal. In other words, any suitable apparatus is used as the information processing apparatus <b>10</b>, provided that the OS, control program, and application software operate on the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The image forming apparatus <b>30</b> forms an image such as characters (text) or FIGS. mainly with toner or ink on a recording medium. The image forming apparatus <b>30</b> according to the present embodiment is capable of printing cyan, magenta, and yellow image data with a toner or ink that is visible to the naked eye and is further capable of printing black image data with a spot color material (toner or ink). The toner or ink that is visible to the naked eye is hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;visible material&#x201d; The image forming apparatus <b>30</b> is capable of forming an image on one recording medium using both the visible material and the spot color material. Alternatively, the image forming apparatus <b>30</b> is also capable of forming an image using only one of the visible material and the spot color material.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Usable as the spot color material is a toner or ink that has absorbency in the wavelength range (around 850 nm) of infrared light including near-infrared light and has less absorbency in the wavelength range of visible light (about 400 to 700 nm). In other words, in the spot color material, the absorbency in the visible wavelength range is smaller than the absorbency in the infrared wavelength range. Such a spot color material is transparent (invisible) to visible light and legible when irradiated with infrared light. In other words, the spot color means transparent to visible light. When irradiated with infrared light, the spot color material absorbs infrared light and looks black. The colors cyan, magenta, and yellow are transparent to infrared light. On the other hand, there are two kinds of black materials (ordinary black toner). One kind of black material absorbs infrared light and the other kind of black material does not absorb infrared light. When a black image that absorbs infrared light is formed together with an image of the spot color material, both images look black, making it difficult to recognize a barcode or the like formed with the spot color material. In this case, it is not desirable to form the black image that absorbs infrared light and the spot color image on the same sheet. On the other hand, when a black image that does not absorb infrared light is formed together with the spot color image, only the spot color image looks black when irradiated with infrared light. Accordingly, a barcode or the like formed with the spot color material is recognizable. In the present embodiment, a description is given of the image forming apparatus <b>30</b> that performs printing without using black color. For this reason, black is expressed by superimposing cyan, magenta, and yellow. In another example, printing is performed using five colors of cyan, magenta, yellow, black that does not absorb infrared light, and spot color.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Since the spot color material can be used to print information used for determining the authenticity of an output product, the spot color material has the effect of inhibiting duplication of the output product. Since the security is improved, the spot color material can be said to be a consumer material for security.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another example, the spot color material is toner or ink having absorbency relative to ultraviolet light (UV) and a small absorbency relative to visible light. In still another example, an image is formed with material that is transparent in a normal state and is chemically changed and rendered visible by application of heat, laser, or chemicals, etc. In still another example, information that is difficult to be recognized with the naked is formed by an uneven surface.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Any suitable material to which toner or ink can adhere is used as the recording medium on which the image forming apparatus <b>30</b> performs printing. Specifically, the recording medium is a medium on which the toner or ink can temporarily adhere and then solidify or permeate. Specific examples of the recording medium include recording media such as paper, recording paper, film, and cloth; electronic components such as electronic boards and piezoelectric elements; and powder layers (particle layers), and any material to which the toner or ink adheres is included unless otherwise specified.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The above-mentioned &#x201c;material to which toner or ink can adhere&#x201d; includes any material, such as paper, thread, fiber, cloth, leather, metal, plastic, glass, wood, ceramics, or the like, provided that toner or ink can temporarily adhere.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The image forming apparatus <b>30</b> includes an electrophotographic printer, an inkjet printer that discharges liquid (droplets), and a printer that thermally transferring an ink ribbon. In another example, the image forming apparatus <b>30</b> is a multifunction peripheral. The &#x201c;multifunction&#x201d; of the multifunction peripheral means having a plurality of functions of, for example, image forming, facsimile transmission and reception, scanning of a document, and copying. The multifunction peripheral is sometimes called an MFP. In the present embodiment, the image forming apparatus <b>30</b> having the image forming function will suffice. The image forming apparatus <b>30</b> may also be called a printer.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The IR image management server <b>50</b> is an information processing system having one or more computers. Any suitable computer is used as the IR image management server <b>50</b>, provided that the computer creates a storage location of the IR toner image and the print position. For this reason, the IR image management server <b>50</b> does not have to be called as a server. In one example, the IR image management server <b>50</b> resides on the Internet. In another example, the IR image management server <b>50</b> resides in an on-premises environment. In one example, the IR image management server <b>50</b> supports cloud computing.

When the overprint is designated, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>C</figref>, the image forming apparatus <b>30</b> generates the plain image <b>81</b> of cyan without masking the black portion (without outlining).</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">When the overprint is not designated, the gap between the lower color (cyan in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>C</figref>) and the upper color (black in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>C</figref>) is sometimes noticeable. When the overprint is designated, there is a case that the two colors are undesirably mixed, and the color displayed by the application software is not reproduced in the output <b>171</b>. The spot color in this embodiment is transparent. Even though the presence or absence of overprint is set according to the document, the lower color (photograph, etc.) is outlined when overprint is not designated. On the other hand, since the spot color is transparent, the color is unlikely to change even when overprint is designated. Accordingly, in the present embodiment, with the overprint designation, the black plain image <b>82</b> assigned with the spot color is printed. Cyan, magenta, and yellow can be without the designation of overprint.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">As described above, the printing system <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment can perform printing using the IR toner with application software that handles general RGB image data.
