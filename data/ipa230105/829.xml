SM was first used in World War I and has been used in warfare as recently as the Iran-Iraq conflict of the late 1980s. Although SM is less of a threat in warfare as it once was, it still posses a threat to military and civilian personnel because of current concerns for its deployment in a terrorist attack.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Sulfur mustards are classic vesicating agents that mainly affect the skin, eyes, and respiratory system. Medical surveillance of individuals exposed to mustard gas in the early 1980's has documented a number of respiratory conditions including bronchiolitis obliterans, asthma, and lung fibrosis that can persist through out the victims' lifetime.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is currently no known antidote for SM poisoning. Upon exposure, the best recourse is decontamination and supportive treatment. Decontamination of the skin is relatively straight forward and beneficial, whereas internal exposure such a inhalation of sulfur mustards is much more difficult to treat.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It can be seen from the foregoing discussion that there is a need for developing agents that are capable of attenuating, preventing, and/or rescuing organ injury from the deleterious effects resulting from exposure to alkylating agents (e.g., inhalation damage), such as sulfur mustards. The invention addresses these and other needs in the art.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Provided herein are, inter alia, methods for rescuing or preventing organ injury following exposure to alkylating agents by using substituted porphyrins as the active agent or alkylating agent protectant, such as a mimetic of superoxide dismutase and/or catalase. The methodology of the invention may implemented as follows.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one aspect of the invention, a method of treating an injury associated with exposure to an alkylating agent in a subject includes administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of Formula</p><p id="p-0010" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="42.67mm" wi="61.98mm" file="US20230000830A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0011" num="0000">or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br/>R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, and R<sub>4 </sub>may each independently be &#x2014;H, &#x2014;CF<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;CO<sub>2</sub>R<sub>8</sub>,</p><p id="p-0012" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="142.66mm" wi="72.90mm" file="US20230000830A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0013" num="0000">Each R<sub>8</sub>, R<sub>6</sub>, R<sub>7</sub>, R<sub>8</sub>, R<sub>9</sub>, R<sub>10</sub>, R<sub>11</sub>, R<sub>12</sub>, R<sub>13</sub>, R<sub>14</sub>, R<sub>15</sub>, R<sub>16</sub>, R<sub>17</sub>, R<sub>18</sub>, R<sub>19</sub>, R<sub>20</sub>, R<sub>21</sub>, R<sub>22</sub>, R<sub>23</sub>, and R<sub>24 </sub>may be the same or different and may each independently be hydrogen, halogen, &#x2014;CN, &#x2014;CF<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;OH, &#x2014;NH<sub>2</sub>, &#x2014;COOH, &#x2014;COOR<sub>25</sub>, an unsubstituted or substituted alkyl, unsubstituted or substituted heteroalkyl, unsubstituted or substituted cycloalkyl, unsubstituted or substituted heterocycloalkyl, unsubstituted or substituted aryl, and an unsubstituted or substituted heteroaryl.

Specifically, the organ may be skin, lungs, nose, esophagus, trachea, or bronchi. The alkylating agent may be a sulfur mustard, chlorine gas, phosgene, and 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide. Specifically, the alkylating agent is a sulfur mustard. Exposure to the alkylating agent may produce mitochondrial dysfunction, which in turn may result in an increase in reactive oxygen species production or oxidative stress. In particular, exposure to the alkylating agent, relative to non-exposure to the alkylating agent causes an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, an increase in IgM levels, a decrease of glutathione levels, and an increase in myleperoxidase levels.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0010">The compound may be administered by inhalation administration, topical administration, intravenous administration, subcutaneous administration, intraperitonal administration, and intramuscular administration. The compound may be administered to the subject within about 0.5 hours to about 48 hours after exposure to the alkylating agent. More specifically, the compound may be administered to the subject within about 1 hour to about 10 hours after exposure to the alkylating agent.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0011">According to another aspect of the invention, a method of protecting a subject from the toxic effects associated with exposure to an alkylating agent includes administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of Formula</p><p id="p-0017" num="0000">R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, and R<sub>4 </sub>may each independently be &#x2014;H, &#x2014;CF<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;CO<sub>2</sub>R<sub>8</sub>,</p><p id="p-0018" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-C00003" he="141.99mm" wi="64.69mm" file="US20230000830A1-20230105-C00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0019" num="0000">Each R<sub>5</sub>, R<sub>6</sub>, R<sub>7</sub>, R<sub>8</sub>, R<sub>9</sub>, R<sub>10</sub>, R<sub>11</sub>, R<sub>12</sub>, R<sub>13</sub>, R<sub>14</sub>, R<sub>15</sub>, R<sub>16</sub>, R<sub>17</sub>, R<sub>18</sub>, R<sub>19</sub>, R<sub>20</sub>, R<sub>21</sub>, R<sub>22</sub>, R<sub>23</sub>, and R<sub>24 </sub>may be the same or different and may each independently be hydrogen, halogen, &#x2014;CN, &#x2014;CF<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;OH, &#x2014;NH<sub>2</sub>, &#x2014;COOH, &#x2014;COOR<sub>25</sub>, an unsubstituted or substituted alkyl, unsubstituted or substituted heteroalkyl, unsubstituted or substituted cycloalkyl, unsubstituted or substituted heterocycloalkyl, unsubstituted or substituted aryl, and an unsubstituted or substituted heteroaryl.

For example, alkylating agents typically contain alkyl groups that readily attach to other molecules thereby forming a covalent bond. This process may also be referred to as alkylation. Generally, alkylating agents can disrupt DNA function through different mechanisms, such as: (i) by alkylating DNA bases, thereby preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription, (ii) by mediating the formation of cross-bridges, bonds between atoms in the DNA strand, or (iii) by facilitating the mispairing of the nucleotides in the DNA strand thereby leading to mutations. Also, alkylating agents may initiate oxidative stress within the cells of the exposed organ system causing an overall decrease in intracellular glutathione (GSH) and increased DNA oxidation. Exposure to alkylating agents may cause blistering of the skin, damage to the eyes, and damage to the respiratory tract. Exposure to alkylating agents may also cause systemic toxic effects, such as nausea and vomiting, reduction in both leukocytes and erythrocytes, hemorrhagic tendencies, edema, depletion of glutathione, increased myleperoxidase (MPO), increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and increased IgM. Alkylating agents include, without limitation, the nitrogen mustards, including mechlorethamine hydrochloride, chlorambucil, busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and the sulfur mustards including chlorine gas, phosgene, and 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0045">&#x201c;Oxidation,&#x201d; as used herein, is a chemical reaction that transfers electrons from a substance to an oxidizing agent. Oxidation reactions may produce free radicals, which result in oxidative stress and may ultimately result in cell death.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0046">&#x201c;Reactive oxygen species,&#x201d; as used herein, generally refers to free radicals, reactive anions containing oxygen atoms, or molecules containing oxygen atoms that can either produce free radicals or are chemically activated by them. Reactive oxygen species may include, without limitation, superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, lipid peroxides, hydroxyl radicals, thiyl radicals, superoxide anion, organic hydroperoxide, RO. alkoxy and ROO. peroxy radicals, and hypochlorous acid. The main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo is aerobic respiration, although reactive oxygen species are also produced by peroxisomal b-oxidation of fatty acids, microsomal cytochrome P450 metabolism of xenobiotic compounds, stimulation of phagocytosis by pathogens or lipopolysacchrides, arginine metabolism, tissue specific enzymes. Accumulating oxidative damage may also affect the efficiency of mitochondria and further increase the rate of ROS production.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0047">&#x201c;Reactive nitrogen species,&#x201d; as used herein, generally refers to a family of biomolecules derived from nitric oxide (NO.) and may be produced in animals through the reaction of nitric oxide (NO.) with superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>) to form peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>&#x2212;</sup>). In general, reactive nitrogen species act together with reactive oxygen species to damage cells, resulting in nitrosative stress.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0048">&#x201c;Oxidative stress,&#x201d; as used herein, generally refers to cell damage caused by ROS. The primary damage to cells results from the ROS-induced alteration of macromolecules such as polyunsaturated fatty acids in membrane lipids, essential proteins and DNA. As described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,189,707, oxidative stress and ROS have been implicated in a number of disease states such as Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes mellitus, and aging.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0049">&#x201c;Antioxidant,&#x201d; as used herein, generally refers to molecules or compounds with the capability to attenuate or prevent the oxidation of other molecules. Antioxidants may remove free radicals generated from oxidation reaction and inhibit other oxidation reactions by becoming oxidized themselves. Antioxidants may include reducing agents such as thiols or polyphenols. Additionally, antioxidants may include, without limitation, glutathione, vitamin C, vitamin E, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, various other peroxidases, the substituted porphyrin compounds of the invention and any other molecule or compound that is capable of scavenging reactive oxygen species known in the art.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0050">&#x201c;Rescue,&#x201d; as used herein, is generally defined as counteracting, recovering, or conferring protection from the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species and other free radicals in a subject, organ, tissue, cell, or biomolecule.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0051">&#x201c;Organ,&#x201d; as used herein, generally refers to a tissue that performs a specific function or group of functions within an organism.

A biomarker is differentially present between different phenotypic statuses if the mean or median expression level of the biomarker in the different groups is calculated to be statistically significant. Common tests for statistical significance include, among others, t-test, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney and odds ratio. Biomarkers, alone or in combination, provide measures of relative risk that a subject belongs to one phenotypic status or another. As such, they are useful as markers for disease (diagnostics), therapeutic effectiveness of a drug (theranostics), and for drug toxicity.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0054">&#x201c;Subject,&#x201d; as used herein, includes individuals who require intervention or manipulation due to a exposure or potential exposure to an alkylating agent that can facilitate organ injury.

Typically, an alkyl (or alkylene) group will have from 1 to 24 carbon atoms, with those groups having 10 or fewer carbon atoms being preferred in the invention. A &#x201c;lower alkyl&#x201d; or &#x201c;lower alkylene&#x201d; is a shorter chain alkyl or alkylene group, generally having eight or fewer carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0060">The term &#x201c;heteroalkyl,&#x201d; by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or combinations thereof, consisting of at least one carbon atom and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, N, P, Si, and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized, and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) O, N, P, S, and Si may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which the alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to: &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;O&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;NH&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;N(CH<sub>3</sub>)&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;S&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>, &#x2014;S(O)&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;S(O)<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;CH&#x2550;CH&#x2014;O&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;Si(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH&#x2550;N&#x2014;OCH<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;CH&#x2550;CH&#x2014;N(CH<sub>3</sub>)&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;O&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>, &#x2014;O&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>, and &#x2014;CN.

For heteroalkylene groups, heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like). Still further, for alkylene and heteroalkylene linking groups, no orientation of the linking group is implied by the direction in which the formula of the linking group is written. For example, the formula &#x2014;C(O)<sub>2</sub>R&#x2032;&#x2014; represents both &#x2014;C(O)<sub>2</sub>R&#x2032;&#x2014; and &#x2014;R&#x2032;C(O)<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;. As described above, heteroalkyl groups, as used herein, include those groups that are attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom, such as &#x2014;C(O)R&#x2032;, &#x2014;C(O)NR&#x2032;, &#x2014;NR&#x2032;R&#x2033;, &#x2014;OR&#x2032;, &#x2014;SR&#x2032;, and/or &#x2014;SO<sub>2</sub>R&#x2032;. Where &#x201c;heteroalkyl&#x201d; is recited, followed by recitations of specific heteroalkyl groups, such as &#x2014;NR&#x2032;R&#x2033; or the like, it will be understood that the terms heteroalkyl and &#x2014;NR&#x2032;R&#x2033; are not redundant or mutually exclusive. Rather, the specific heteroalkyl groups are recited to add clarity. Thus, the term &#x201c;heteroalkyl&#x201d; should not be interpreted herein as excluding specific heteroalkyl groups, such as &#x2014;NR&#x2032;R&#x2033; or the like.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0062">The terms &#x201c;cycloalkyl&#x201d; and &#x201c;heterocycloalkyl,&#x201d; by themselves or in combination with other terms, mean, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of &#x201c;alkyl&#x201d; and &#x201c;heteroalkyl,&#x201d; respectively. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule.

Alkylating agents can disrupt DNA function by three mechanisms: (i) alkylating DNA bases, thereby preventing DNA synthesis and RNA transcription, (ii) mediating the formation of cross-bridges, bonds between atoms in the DNA strand, or (iii) facilitating the mis-pairing of the nucleotides in the DNA strand resulting in mutations in the DNA strand. Also, alkylating agents may initiate oxidative stress within the cells of the exposed organ system causing an overall decrease in intracellular glutathione (GSH) and increased DNA oxidation.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0114">Alkylating agents include, without limitation, the nitrogen mustards, such as mechlorethamine hydrochloride, chlorambucil, busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and the sulfur mustards such as chlorine gas, phosgene, and 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES). Exposure to alkylating agents may cause blistering of the skin, damage to the eyes, and damage to the respiratory tract. Exposure to alkylating agents may also cause systemic toxic effects, such as nausea and vomiting, hemorrhagic tendencies, edema, and a reduction in both leukocytes and erythrocytes.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0115">Sulfur mustard (2, 2&#x2032;-dichloro diethyl sulfide) is a known potent vessicating agent and inhalation results in apoptosis and necrosis of the airway epithelium, inflammation, edema, and pseudomembrane formation. 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES, half mustard) is a monofunctional analog of SM that can be utilized to elucidate the mechanisms of injury and as an initial screening of therapeutics. Both SM and CEES (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) are alkylating agents capable of binding macromolecules including proteins, DNA and lipids.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0116">Oxidative stress plays a significant role in SM/CEES mediated damage. For example, exposure to CEES causes an imbalance in production of ROS/RNS and antioxidant defenses in favor of the former. There are many factors that contribute to the increase in ROS following SM/CEES exposure. For example, exposure to SM/CEES facilitates the proliferation of inflammatory cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), which in turn produces oxidants, including superoxide and hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Furthermore, exposure to CEES also results mitochrondrial dysfunction which further drives increased ROS production, and ultimately, oxidative stress.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0117">As discussed above, following exposure to SM/CEES, there is irreparable damage to the respiratory tract such as apoptosis and necrosis of the airway epithelium. However, in certain embodiments of the invention, administration of the substituted porphyrins of the invention subsequent to alkylating agent exposure, have been shown to significantly improve the outcome.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0118">For example, administration of the substituted porphyrins of the invention following CEES exposure have been shown to rescue lung cells and airway cells from alkylating agent-induced toxicity, prevent alkylating agent-mediated ROS and dysfunction, and alkylating agent-induced oxidative stress. In further embodiments, the substituted porphyrins of the invention have been shown to reduce alkylating agent-induced cytotoxicity, reduce alkylating agent-induced increases of protein and IgM in the lung, reduce levels of RBCs and inflammatory cells in the lung, decrease tissue accumulation of PMN, and prevent alkylating agent-induced oxidative stress.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Biomarkers of Alkylating Agents</heading><p id="p-0138" num="0119">A specific embodiment of the invention is directed to biomarkers that are characteristic of alkylating agent exposure. The biomarkers of alkylating agent exposure may include ROS such as superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, lipid peroxides, hydroxyl radicals, thiyl radicals, superoxide anion, organic hydroperoxide, RO. alkoxy and ROO. peroxy radicals, and hypochlorous acid, reactive nitrogen compounds, and compounds indicative of oxidative stress, such a lipid peroxidation products.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0120">In a specific embodiment, biomarkers characteristic of exposure to the half mustard gas, CEES, include glutathione, myleperoxidase (MPO), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), IgM, 8-OHdG, 4-HNE, and increase in extracellular proteins which are associated with edema. Specifically, following CEES exposure, there is a depletion of glutathione, increased levels of myleperoxidase (MPO), increased levels of LDH, increased levels of IgM, increased levels in markers of oxidized DNA such as 8-oxo-2dG, and increased levels in markers of lipid oxidarion such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE). In certain aspects, the presence of increased LDH levels may be indicative of increased cytotoxicity, the presence of increased protein levels may be indicative of epithelial cell death, the presence of increased IgM levels may be indicative of increased vascular permeability, and the presence of MPO may be indicative of inflammatory response. Oxidative stress occurs when oxidant production exceeds antioxidant defense. Thus, one marker of oxidative damage is DNA oxidation, which can be measured by the formation of 80-HdG. Another marker of oxidative damage is the formation of lipid peroxidation products including 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE).</p><p id="p-0140" num="0121">In another embodiment of the invention, a biomarker profile following alkylating agent exposure may be used for determining therapeutic efficacy or toxicity of a compound. If the compound has a pharmaceutical impact on the subject, organ or cell following exposure to the alkylating agent, the phenotype (e.g., the pattern or profile) of the biomarkers changes towards a non-exposure profile. For example, glutathione is depleted following alkylating agent exposure and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is increased following alkylating agent exposure. Therefore, one can follow the course of the amounts of these biomarkers in the subject, organ, or cell during the course of treatment. Accordingly, this method involves measuring one or more biomarkers upon exposure to the alkylating agent. Methods for measuring the specific biomarkers are a matter of routine experimentation and are known by those of skill in the art and are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,189,707, which is expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Formulations</heading><p id="p-0141" num="0122">In another embodiment, the invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a low molecular weight substituted porphyrin compound of the invention or a low molecular weight substituted porphyrin in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient (e.g., carrier).

Cell viability was determined by measuring the fluorescence of calcein AM and was found to decrease in a dose-dependent manner from 80% with the 600 &#x3bc;M CEES to below 10% with 1000 &#x3bc;M CEES (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). 900 &#x3bc;M CEES was used as the optimal dose to carry out the cytoprotection studies because it provided enough cell injury (about 50%) for potential therapeutics to demonstrate efficacy and the most consistent cell injury response in the two cell systems. Because of observed increased resistance of SAE cells to CEES toxicity as seen with 16HBE cells, these exposures were prolonged to 48 h in the SAE cells to provide similar injury responses for comparison of antioxidant protective effects between cell systems.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Specific Example 2: Delayed Increase in Mitochondrial ROS and Dysfunction with CEES Exposure</heading><p id="p-0169" num="0149">As discussed above, mitochondria are a major source of cellular ROS production. Both SAE and 16HBE cells were exposed to 900 &#x3bc;M CEES for 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h, after which the cells were incubated with MitoSOX (MitoSOX is a mitochrondrially targeted ROS probe) and fluorescence was measured using flow cytometry. CEES exposure increased ROS levels that peaked at 12 h, and this time-dependent increase was seen in both SAE (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) and 16HBE (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>) cells. As a consequence, further exposure studies measuring markers of cellular stress were examined after 12 h of exposure.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0150">Next CEES was examined to determine whether CEES exposure was associated with any mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria need to maintain a membrane potential to actively make ATP. To examine this, measured Rho 123 fluorescence was measured, which is inversely correlated with mitochondrial membrane potential. Human lung 16HBE cells were exposed to CEES for 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h, after which the cells were incubated with Rho 123, and fluorescence was measured using flow cytometry. The results showed that CEES produced a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential by 4 h, which persisted for 24 h as evidenced by the increase in Rho 123 fluorescence (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>). Notably, there was a significant decrease in Rho 123 fluorescence at 48 h, which can be attributed to the cell death that would be expected to occur based on previous cell viability tests.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Specific Example 3: Metalloporphyrins Rescue Human Lung Cells from CEES-Induced Toxicity</heading><p id="p-0171" num="0151">Several structurally different metalloporphyrins (AEOL 10150, AEOL 10113, AEOL 10303, and MnTBAP) were screened in 16HBE cells for efficacy against CEES toxicity 1 h after the initial exposure (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>).

As discussed above, GSH is a major cellular antioxidant. So, the effect of CEES on total cellular GSH levels was determined as well as whether AEOL 10150 altered CEES-mediated changes in GSH levels. Human lung 16HBE cells were exposed for 12 h to CEES, and AEOL 10150 (50 &#x3bc;M) was added 1 h post-CEES treatment. AEOL 10150 alone did not alter intracellular GSH levels, whereas CEES caused a significant decrease in intracellular GSH levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> AEOL 10150 treatment prevented the CEES-induced decrease in GSH, further implicating an imbalance in redox status of the cells caused by CEES that was reversible by AEOL 10150.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0157">One consequence of oxidative stress is an increase in the oxidation of cellular macromolecules. A classic marker for DNA oxidation is the formation of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (80-HdG), which was determined 12 h after CEES exposure. CEES caused a significant increase in 80HdG levels in lung 16HBE cells as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>). Moreover, AEOL 10150 added 1 h post-CEES exposure decreased CEES-mediated DNA oxidation.

BAL in normal rats consists of macrophages and low levels of large proteins such as albumin.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, compared to EtOH+PBS or EtOH+AEOL 10150, protein levels in BAL were significantly increased as a result of 5% CEES+PBS (p&#x3c;0.001). Protein levels in the BAL were significantly decreased from CEES+PBS when animals were administered AEOL 10150 (p&#x3c;0.001). Although increased protein levels in BAL may not be a clear indicator of vascular permeability because it may also indicate lysis of damaged epithelium resulting from CEES exposure, the presence of very high molecular weight molecules such as IgM (900 kD) are clearly indicative of increased vascular permeability. Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> demonstrates that IgM levels in the BAL were significantly increased a result in CEES+PBS rats as compared to EtOH+PBS or EtOH+AEOL 10150 (p&#x3c;0.001).

This CEES-induced damage is ameliorated with AEOL 10150 treatment 18 hours after CEES exposure (p&#x3c;0.05). Levels of PMN or neutrophils in the BAL were significantly increased in the CEES+PBS rats as compared to EtOH+PBS or EtOH+10150 (p&#x3c;0.001).
