N<sub>Pn </sub>of at least one product P<b>1</b>, . . . Pn. Preferably, the industrial plant may produce a plurality of products or multiple product types according to quantity.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention additionally relates to a system for data processing, comprising means for carrying out such a method; a computer program, comprising commands which, when the program is executed by a computer, prompt said computer to carry out such a method and a computer-readable medium, comprising commands which, when executed by a computer, prompt said computer to carry out such a method.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The Invention moreover relates to a medium, for example a computer-readable storage medium or a data carrier signal.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For delivering customer orders on schedule, a sufficient availability of material and production capacity is of great importance. Due to the highly fluctuating customer requirements, which depend upon both time and quantity, overplanning may result in excess stock and underplanning may result in production standstills. This may lead to a loss of customer orders due to lacking the ability to supply, for example. For this reason, the supply chain aims for prediction accuracy which is as high as possible for future customer orders.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For corresponding predictions, it is possible to use expert systems, for example. In expert-based systems, as a general rule the customer representative or market expert is consulted and a prediction is provided on the basis of their assessment.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In today's industry 4.0 environment, there are frequent changes to customer behavior at short notice. The known systems, however, are unable to follow said customer behavior in a sufficiently rapid manner.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object underlying the present invention is to improve the prediction accuracy under the aforementioned conditions and, as a result, to optimize the manufacturing in an industrial plant, for example a manufacturing plant.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The object is achieved according to the invention by a method cited in the introduction in that<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">a model trained by means of machine learning is provided at a first point in time;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">the trained model is carried out at a second point in time which follows the first point in time t<b>1</b>, in order to generate a rolling forecast for a specifiable time interval, wherein the specifiable time interval begins after the second point in time and the rolling forecast predicts, for any given point in time within the time interval, a quantity of the at least one product to be produced at this point in time;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">the rolling forecast is further processed by means of a further model, in order to calculate a re-forecast on the basis of the rolling forecast.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0012">In one embodiment, at least one manufacturing parameter, for example quantity of material, grouping of staff etc. of the industrial plant can be adapted as a function of the calculated re-forecast.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0013">The further processing of the rolling forecast by means of the further model has the advantage that the trained model has to be trained less often. It has been ascertained that the trained models are too slow to deliver good predictions for customer behaviors which act in a highly dynamic manner. Retraining the model is time-consuming and in most cases does not take place more often than once per quarter. Predictions which have been achieved using a trained model that is trained using the low frequency described above could be improved.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0014">The further model, preferably a mathematically precise model which therefore can be carried out in a rapid manner&#x2014;here also referred to as &#x201c;post-processor&#x201d;&#x2014;takes into consideration the deviations of the rolling prediction calculated using the trained model from the observed reality and corrects the future forecast accordingly.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0015">Through the use of the post-processor, it is possible to improve the prediction accuracy. The post-processor is able to use the deviations from the past and simultaneously the already existing customer requirements for the future, in order to minimize the future deviations.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0016">In one embodiment, the post-processor (the further model) comprises multiple parameters, via which it is possible to set a deliberate overestimation or underestimation of the future orders, in particular those to be expected at short notice.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0017">In one embodiment, it may advantageously be provided that the first trained model is based on at least one neural network and/or on at least one decision tree and/or on at least one linear model.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">Moreover, it may be expedient if the further model is a preferably heuristic mathematical model and wherein, in order to calculate the re-forecast, actual values of the quantity to be produced and/or the actual number of orders and/or the actual orders on hand and/or at least one statistical variable calculated using at least one of the aforementioned values or at least one statistical parameter calculated using at least one of the aforementioned values is/are used.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019">Thus, both past values and future (predicted) values can be used for the re-forecast. It is possible to respond to changes at short notice in a more rapid manner and achieve a higher prediction accuracy as a result. This means that both short-term effects and medium-term trends can be identified.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">Furthermore, the object is achieved according to the invention by an aforementioned medium, for example a computer-readable storage medium or a data carrier signal, in that the medium comprises at least one calculated re-forecast described as above.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0019" num="0021">The invention, together with further advantages, is explained in further detail below by way of exemplary embodiments which are illustrated in the drawing, in which:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an industrial plant, which is designed to produce multiple products;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a flow diagram of a method, and</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a timeline for calculating a re-forecast.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0023" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically shows an industrial manufacturing plant FA, for example an automated or autonomous manufacturing plant.
