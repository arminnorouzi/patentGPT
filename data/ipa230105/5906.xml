The detection method includes the following operations.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Operation <b>1</b> includes that: the detection circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is provided, which is referred as a first detection circuit; and the first fuse <b>121</b> of the first detection circuit is blown, and a test current is input at the first test terminal <b>111</b> and the test current is input at the second test terminal <b>112</b>.

In addition, there are multiple modes of test currents corresponding to ESD current pulses, such as a component charge mode, a human body discharge mode, and a mechanical discharge mode. The component charge mode may include a chip-level component charge mode and a circuit board-level charge mode.

When the foregoing detection method is implemented, only the modes of the ESD current pulses corresponding to the first test current and the second test current are required to be identical, and the parameters of the first test current and the second test current are not required to be identical. In an actual circuit, when the first fuse <b>121</b> remains connected, as a connection relationship between the ESD protection device <b>13</b> and the transistor <b>14</b> varies, the ESD current input to the first test terminal <b>111</b> does not necessarily have same current component on the branches on which the transistor <b>14</b> and the ESD protection device <b>13</b> are positioned respectively. When the foregoing detection method is implemented, the value of the first test current and the value of the second test current may be set according to the connection relationship between the ESD protection device <b>13</b> and the transistor <b>14</b>, so that the corresponding current parameters approximate those in the actual situation.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Operation <b>2</b> includes: after the test currents are input to the first test terminal <b>111</b> and the second test terminal <b>112</b>, a detection voltage is applied to the first test terminal <b>111</b> and the third test terminal <b>113</b> to detect a first drain current of the ESD protection device <b>13</b>, and a detection voltage is applied to the second test terminal <b>112</b> and the third test terminal <b>113</b> to detect a second drain current of the transistor <b>14</b>; and in response to determining the first drain current is smaller than a preset current value, it is determined that the ESD protection device <b>13</b> has a self ESD protection capacity.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The first drain current is configured to represent the electrical property of the ESD protection device <b>13</b> after being subjected to ESD.

The blowing voltage is equal to the difference between different voltages applied to the first test terminal <b>111</b> and the second test terminal <b>112</b>.

Before the test current is input to the second test terminal <b>112</b> of the first detection circuit, the second fuse <b>122</b> of the first detection circuit is blown, so that current discharge of the diode is avoided, thereby accurately measuring the second drain current of the transistor <b>14</b> under the impact of the ESD, and then accurately determining the external ESD protection capacity of the ESD protection device <b>13</b> based on the second drain current. Then, before the test current is input to the first test terminal of the second detection circuit, a second fuse <b>122</b> of the second detection circuit is blown, thereby avoiding that the measured external ESD protection capacity of the ESD protection device <b>13</b> is substantially equal to the protection capacity of the ESD protection device <b>13</b> and that of the diode <b>15</b> in total, and ensuring the accuracy of the representation of the external ESD protection capacity.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to some embodiments, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, multiple ESD protection devices <b>13</b> in parallel may be provided to protect the transistor <b>14</b>, and an external ESD protection capacity of the ESD protection devices <b>13</b> is jointly determined by the multiple ESD protection devices <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to the embodiments, a connection terminal of the second fuse <b>122</b> and the diode <b>15</b> serves as the fourth test terminal <b>114</b>.
