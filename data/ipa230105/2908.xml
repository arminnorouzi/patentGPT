Wei et al in Langmuir vol. 31, no 3, 2015, pp 1105-1112, discloses the significance of increasing peptide length for promoting adhesion between two surfaces when the adhesion of peptides to each of the surfaces is dominated by DOPA-mediated interactions. Short peptides are compared to full length proteins Mfp-5. When the interactions are DOPA-mediated, the short peptides are only capable of weak bridging adhesion between two mica surfaces, but the full length Mfp-5 gives an adhesion about one order of magnitude stronger for similar DOPA density. This result gives that shorter peptides are not so efficient for adhesive purposes and a skilled person may believe that this result can also be applied for corrosion inhibition. At least the shorter peptides would be less attractive for corrosion protection because of a weaker adhesion.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">D. C.

It is desired that the corrosion protective coating should be effective as soon as possible after application. If coated products have to be stored in a protected environment for the coating to mature some time before the coating becomes effective, the product becomes more costly. A corrosion protective coating which is effective shortly after the application is desired, at least for certain applications where a quick corrosion protection is necessary. One example is metal surfaces where the surface will be exposed to a corrosive environment shortly after the coating. A problem in the prior art is that the coating takes time to reach its full effect.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">One object of the present invention is to obviate at least some of the disadvantages in the prior art and provide a new coating and a method for corrosion protection.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a first aspect there is provided a coating for corrosion protection of metal objects, said coating comprising at least one cerium oxide and at least one polypeptide, wherein the polypeptide comprises 29 or less amino acid residues of which more than 15% are DOPA.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a second aspect there is provided a method for corrosion protection of metal objects, said method comprising applying a coating as described above.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further embodiments of the present invention are defined in the appended dependent claims.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">An advantage of the use of shorter polypeptides than described in the prior art is that corrosion resistance is achieved faster, as shown in the appended Examples. The corrosion protective properties of the coating are obtained quicker compared to longer polypeptides. This is unexpected, in particular in view of W. Wei et al and S. Das et al indicating that the peptide length is a factor for strong adhesion, which could be assumed to translate into improved corrosion adhesion.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">From the appended examples it can be concluded that the shorter the peptide is, the better the short term corrosion protection is. 1 h after application, the AT-M5D-8 (10aa) provides the highest increase in the Rp values, as compared to the control sample, followed by the AT-M5D-4 (19aa), the full length AT-M5D (37aa) and the Mefp-1/ceria, in that order. Thus it can be understood that the shorter the peptide is, the better the short term corrosion protection. The short term corrosion protection is important in certain applications, for instance where a manufactured product is to be transported without cover directly after application of the corrosion protective coating. With the coating according to the present invention the protective effect occurs without waiting for many hours or even days as for similar coatings according to the prior art.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A bonus effect is that manufacturing of shorter peptides is generally easier and cheaper, the shorter polypeptides are more stable which results in easier handling of solutions of the polypeptide and a higher possible concentration of polypeptides in the solutions. The finished coating generally becomes more even and dense when using shorter polypeptides.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further advantages of the invention include that the material is environmental friendly and does not display the serious health risks as many of the compounds used in the state of the art.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Before the invention is disclosed and described in detail, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular configurations, process steps and materials disclosed herein as such configurations, process steps and materials may vary somewhat.

The samples were deposited on a cold-rolled carbon steel surface in combination with ceria nanoparticles through alternative immersion processes. Four layers of AT-M5D/ceria, AT-M5D-4/ceria, AT-M5D-8/ceria or Mefp-1/ceria respectively were deposited on the different steel surfaces by first dipping the steel in the peptide solution for 40 minutes, then dipping in the ceria suspension, and repeating the process three more times.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">1 h after application, the AT-M5D-8 (l0aa) provides the highest increase in the Rp values, as compared to the control sample, followed by the AT-M5D-4 (19aa), the full length AT-M5D (37aa) and the Mefp-1/ceria, in that order. The Rp value of the AT-M5D-8 (10aa) and AT-M5D-4 (19aa) 1 hour after application is higher than levels reached by the full length AT-M5D (37aa) within 1 hour to 7 days of application (Table 1, 2, 3) and higher than levels reached by the Mefp-1 within 1 hour to 2 days of application (Table 1, 2, 4).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">1 day or more after application, the AT-M5D (37aa) and Mefp-1 generally provide a higher increase in Rp value, as compared to the control sample, than the AT-M5D-4 (19aa) and AT-M5D-8 (10aa) do at the corresponding times.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In order to evaluate the EIS data the following simple equivalent circuit was used to describe the steel-solution interface.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="20.40mm" wi="68.24mm" file="US20230002909A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">Rs: solution resistance between the reference electrode and working electrode, Rp: polarization resistance, CPE: constant phase element.
