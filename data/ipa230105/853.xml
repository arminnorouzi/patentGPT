level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a malignant tumor that seriously threatens human health. Despite the continuous improvement of surgery and chemotherapy techniques, the prognosis of patients is still poor, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%. At present, molecular targeted therapy targeting human epithelium growth factor receptor (EGFR) has become the most important way to treat NSCLC.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">EGFR is the expression product of the proto-oncogene C-erbB-1, which is located on chromosome 7 and belongs to the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. After EGFR binds to its ligand, it can activate downstream signaling pathways, regulate tumor cell proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, and inhibition of apoptosis, thereby regulating a series of tumor biological behaviors.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">EGFR is the expression product of the proto-oncogene C-erbB-1, which is located on chromosome 7 and belongs to the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase.

This value reflects the non-specific binding of radioactivity in the absence of protein kinase or substrate. In addition, set 3 reaction wells without adding test substance, and take the median of the cpm value of 3 reaction wells as a negative control, that is, the enzyme activity without any inhibitor. The difference between the negative control and the blank is the 100% activity of each enzyme.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0056">As with the negative control, the blank value should be subtracted from the value of the corresponding 10 test substances.
