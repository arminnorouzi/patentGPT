Supply chain management depends on efficient resource allocation, so having accurate ETA from vehicle systems in the supply chain is beneficial to maintaining a well-integrated transportation system.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many factors may cause a change in ETA of a vehicle system. Traffic, weather, and operational problems may cause a change in ETA. While information related to these factors may allow for more accurate predictions of ETA the information may not be readily available for analysis. Current approaches to calculating ETA do not provide the desired accuracy due to factors such as data availability, data accuracy, consistency in datasets, and complexity of data sources.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Current systems for determining ETA may rely on manual input provided by transportation personnel at the time the vehicle systems leave an origin or reach a destination. The manual input may be prone to errors and may also fail to account for traffic flows at the origins and the destinations generated by all vehicle systems entering or leaving the locations. The resulting error in the ETA may cause failure to meet agreed shipment contracts that may result in delays in deliveries and/or penalties to transportation companies.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current systems for determining ETA may also be unable to use historical transportation data. Systems that currently determine a static ETA are not able to consider changing traffic flows over time that may change based on multiple factors, including inbound and outbound traffic at origin and destination locations, seasonal conditions such as weather, speed clusters, and recent trips between the origin and destination locations by other vehicle systems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with one embodiment, a method may include obtaining a transportation event and a transportation event time of a vehicle system at a current location of the vehicle system on a route from an origin to a destination and determining transportation event conditions based on historical transportation data. The method may further include predicting, by mathematical optimization methods, optimal transportation routes based on one or more of historical transportation routes, contractual routes, contractual junctions, and station master data and clustering transportation event data clusters from the historical transportation data using a machine learning classification method.

The systems and methods generate high dimensional context machine learning features for each transportation leg based on specific data attributes of the transportation route. The specific attributes may include traffic on the route, speed, distance, traffic at the origin and/or destination, and/or seasonal conditions. By identifying similar historical data patterns, the systems and methods can predict the most probable ETA. The systems and methods adapt to changing transportation conditions through attributes such as traffic flows through the origin and destination locations, which may be communicated to the vehicle systems using, for example, real time electronic EDI data exchanges.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The systems and methods provide automated predictive ETA using machine learning data clustering and regression methods. An incoming transportation event, that originates from the current vehicle system location, is captured and includes data having one or more transportation event attributes and one or more shipment attributes. The shipment identity and the vehicle system location are determined and traffic conditions are generated. A multidimensional transportation context vector is generated that corresponds to the current transportation route leg of the vehicle system. The current transportation event conditions are inserted into the route leg historical context vector and the machine learning methods use the traffic flows, speed, distance, and location clusters along with the moving average duration of the most recent completed trips on the route legs to predict the ETA.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Providing vehicle system operators and/or owners with more accurate estimated times of arrival allows the operators and/or owners to manage their operations in a timely and efficient manner. The systems and methods disclosed herein allow vehicle systems owners and/operators to allocate resources, crews, products, and facilities efficiently and reduce operational inefficiencies and increased overheads cause by trip delays. As the machine learning model is dynamic it can be implemented in multiple transportation domains, such as trucks and ports. Providing the machine learning model with trip duration information between two locations allows the machine learning model to learn from available data sources and predict an ETA using features that are created from the data source. The machine learning model can thus be extended to other transportation modes and comprehensively integrated into supply chains.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a transportation network <b>500</b> according to one embodiment includes a plurality of interconnected routes <b>502</b>. The routes <b>502</b> may represent tracks (such as, but not limited to, railroad tracks and/or the like) that rail vehicles travel across. The transportation network may extend over a relatively large area, such as hundreds of square miles or kilometers of land area. The number of routes shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is meant to be illustrative and not limiting on embodiments of the subject matter described herein. Moreover, while one or more embodiments described herein relate to a transportation network formed from rail tracks, not all embodiments are so limited. Rather, in addition or alternative to the rail tracks, the transportation network may be formed by any other structure, pathway, and/or the like, such as, but not limited to, roads, highways, interstates, flight paths through airspace, waterways, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Plural separate vehicle systems <b>504</b> travel along the routes. In the illustrated embodiment, the vehicle systems are shown and described herein as rail vehicles and/or rail vehicle consists. However, one or more other embodiments may relate to vehicles other than rail vehicles and/or rail vehicle consists. For example, the vehicle systems may represent other off-highway vehicles, on-highway vehicles such as automobiles (e.g., cars, busses, and the like), marine vessels, airplanes, mining vehicles, other off-highway vehicles, and/or the like. A vehicle system may include one or more propulsion-generating vehicles <b>506</b> (referring to rail vehicles configured for self-propulsion, e.g., locomotives and/or the like). A vehicle system optionally may include one or more non-propulsion-generating vehicles <b>508</b> (referring to rail vehicles not configured for self-propulsion, e.g., cargo cars, passenger cars, and/or the like) that are mechanically coupled or linked together to travel along the routes.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each propulsion-generating vehicle includes a propulsion system <b>510</b> that propels the propulsion-generating vehicle. The propulsion system may include one or more traction motors, brakes, and/or the like that provide tractive effort to propel the corresponding vehicle system along the routes and provide braking efforts to slow or stop movement of the vehicle system. The propulsion generating vehicles include various software applications, such as, but not limited to, movement control systems <b>512</b> that control movement of the vehicle systems along the routes. For example, the movement control systems may control various functions of the propulsion systems. In the illustrated embodiment, the movement control systems are locomotive control systems. The propulsion-generating vehicles and/or the non-propulsion-generating vehicles may include various other software applications, such as, but not limited to, fuel management systems that manage the amount of fuel consumed by the vehicle system, distributed power systems that distribute tractive efforts and braking efforts between different propulsion-generating vehicles, navigation systems, energy management systems, fuel injection systems, black box and/or other log recording applications, RMD systems, video functionality, fuel optimization systems, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The vehicle systems may include display devices <b>514</b> that visually present movement control instructions and/or other parameters to the operator onboard the vehicle system. For example, a computer monitor or display screen may present settings for a throttle and/or brake setting of the propulsion system. The settings may prompt the operator to change the tractive effort and/or braking effort of the propulsion subsystem. Alternatively, the control instructions may be communicated to the propulsion system from the movement control system to automatically control the tractive effort and/or braking effort of the propulsion subsystem. For example, the propulsion subsystem may receive an updated throttle and/or brake setting from the movement control system and modify the tractive effort or braking effort in response thereto.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The transportation network includes a central dispatch station <b>516</b> that controls movement of the vehicle systems along the routes of the transportation network. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the central dispatch station is disposed off-board (e.g., outside) the vehicle systems at a location that is remote from the vehicle systems as the vehicle systems travel along the routes of the transportation network. The transportation network may include one or more signaling devices <b>518</b> (e.g., stop signs, signaling lights, caution and/or other warning signs, and/or the like) for controlling the flow of traffic of the vehicle systems along the routes. The transportation network may include one or more switching devices <b>520</b> that enable the vehicle systems to transfer between different routes (e.g., between different railroad tracks). The central dispatch station may include an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The central dispatch station may be referred to herein, as a &#x201c;back-office&#x201d; and/or an &#x201c;ERP system&#x201d;. The central dispatch station may also be referred to herein as a &#x201c;remote location.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The vehicle systems are communicatively connected to the central dispatch station such that the vehicle systems and the central dispatch station can communicate with each other. For example, the propulsion-generating vehicles may be communicatively connected to the central dispatch station for communicating therewith. The vehicle systems and the central dispatch station may communicate with each other using any type of communication and using any type of communications equipment. For example, the vehicle systems and the central dispatch station may communicate wirelessly over a wireless network, such as, but not limited to, using radio frequency (RF), over a cellular network, over a satellite network, and/or the like. In some embodiments, two or more separate wireless networks are provided to provide two or more redundant wireless communications pathways between the vehicle systems and the central dispatch station. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the transportation network is configured such that the vehicle systems and the central dispatch station can communicate with each other over both a cellular network <b>522</b> and a satellite network <b>524</b> that is separate from the cellular network. As used herein, a &#x201c;satellite network&#x201d; refers to a wireless network that uses one or more satellites to relay communications between the vehicle systems and the central dispatch station. The satellite network may include any number of satellites, including only one satellite. Moreover, the cellular network may alternatively be any other type of wireless network.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, or alternatively, to communicating over one or more wireless networks, the vehicle systems and the central dispatch station may communicate over the Internet, an at least partially wired intranet, a network communication cable, a telephone cable, and/or the like. In some embodiments, two or more separate wired networks are provided to provide two or more redundant wired communications pathways between the vehicle systems and the central dispatch station. The transportation network may include both a wired network and a separate wireless network to provide at least two redundant communications pathways between the vehicle systems and the central dispatch station. In addition, or alternatively, to one or more wireless networks and one or more wired networks, the vehicle systems and the central dispatch station may communicate with each other over a single network that includes both wireless pathways and wired pathways.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, according to one embodiment the vehicle system may include a lead vehicle that may be a propulsion generating vehicle and one or more additional vehicles that may be non-propulsion-generating vehicles. According to one embodiment, one or more of the additional vehicles may be a propulsion-generating vehicle. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the last additional vehicle may be an end vehicle. According to one embodiment, the vehicle system may be a train and the lead vehicle may be a locomotive. According to one embodiment, the lead vehicle of the vehicle system may be a non-propulsion-generating vehicle and the propulsion-generating vehicle or vehicles may be positioned in the vehicle system between the lead vehicle and the end vehicle. According to one embodiment, the end vehicle may be a propulsion-generating vehicle.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The lead vehicle and the additional vehicles in the vehicle system may be communicatively coupled by a connection <b>550</b>. The connection may be a wired connection or a wireless connection. According to one embodiment, the connection may be a trainline cable. The lead vehicle may include a head-end-unit (HEU) <b>530</b> and the end vehicle may include an end-vehicle-unit (EVU) <b>540</b>. The HEU and the EVU may each include a processor <b>538</b>, <b>548</b>, respectively, and a memory <b>532</b>, <b>542</b>, respectively coupled to the processor and operative for storing software control program(s) and/or operational data. The HEU may include a display device.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to one embodiment, each memory can include dynamic, volatile memory, e.g., RAM, that loses program code and data stored therein when power to memory is lost or when overwritten by the corresponding processor, and a non-volatile memory. e.g., ROM, flash memory and the like, the latter of which (non-volatile) memory, can store at least, an embedded operating system and embedded data for use by the corresponding HEU or the EVU processor in the presence or absence of power being applied to the non-volatile memory of the processor. According to one embodiment, the HEU and/or the EVU can receive electrical power for their operation via the connection from a battery or generator of the lead vehicle or another vehicle.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to one embodiment, the HEU can include or be coupled to a receiver <b>534</b> disposed in the lead vehicle and the EVU can include or be coupled to a receiver <b>544</b> disposed in the end vehicle.
