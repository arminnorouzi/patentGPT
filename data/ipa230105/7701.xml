Discussion of the Background</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The 3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) New Radio (NR) system may support various numerologies in association with the standard of a time-frequency resource unit in consideration of various scenarios, service requirements, potential system compatibility, and the like, in order to satisfy requirements for 5<sup>th </sup>(5G) communication. Also, to overcome a poor channel environment, such as high pathloss, phase-noise, and frequency offset, occurring on a high carrier frequency, the NR system may support transmission of a physical signal/channel through a plurality of beams. Through this, the NR system may support applications, for example, enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC)/ultra Machine Type Communications (uMTC), and Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC). Here, mMTC, URLLC, and TSC may be associated with the utilization of an advanced Internet of Things (IoT) in consideration of the vertical industrial world. Such applications may be supported in the same network.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Discussions have been conducted in order to support a new type of device in the 3GPP NR system. For example, the new type of device may include industrial wireless sensors, video surveillance, and wearable devices. Services for such new type of device have a higher requirement than a low power wide area network (LPWAN) such as the legacy LTE-MTC (LTE M) or narrow band-IoT (NB-IoT), but have a lower requirement than eMBB or URLLC. Given the above-described feature, such new types of device may be referred to as a reduced capability (RC) device. A method of supporting an RC UE in the 3GPP NR system has been discussed, and particularly, a specific method for random access by an RC UE has not been provided.</p><heading id="h-0005"

To support URLLC, all URLLC functions have been introduced to Rel-15 LTE/NR. The NR URLLC is still continuously being evolved via Rel-16 eURLLC and industrial IoT (IIoT) work items. In addition, in Rel-16, 5G integration has been conducted for applying time-sensitive networking (TSN) and time sensitive communication (TSC).</p><p id="p-0083" num="0077">The 5G wireless communication system includes supporting of a connected industry. Such 5G connectivity may become the basis of dynamic force for digitalization of the next term and industrial field in the future. In the environment of such industrial field, a large number of 5G connectivity-based UEs may be connected to each other, and the massive industrial wireless network may support a small-sized UE showing relatively low performance, in addition to URLLC services of a high requirement, and may provide battery life that enables complete operation during several years. Actually, the services may have a feature of having a higher requirement than LPWA such as NB-IoT or LTE-M, but having a lower requirement than eMBB or URLLC.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0078">Similar to the above-described connected industry, 5G connectivity may be utilized as the basis for next generation smart city innovation. For example, in the case of utilizing a smart city, 5G connectivity may be effectively utilized for collecting data within a city, and utilizing and monitoring resources in a city. Specially, installation of a surveillance camera may be used for important/essential roles in an industrial area as well as a city.

In the case that an association configuration is present between an SSB/CSI-RS and a PRACH occasion, a PRACH occasion that is associated with an SSB or a CSI-RS selected by the UE may be determined. If an association configuration is not present between an SSB/SI-RS and a PRACH occasion, the UE may perform preamble transmission in a subsequently available PRACH occasion.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0110">Subsequently, the UE may perform preamble transmission based on the selected PRACH occasion. Specifically, MAC may provide a selected preamble, an associated radio network temporary identifier (RNTI), a preamble index, reception target power to PHY, and may indicate performing the transmission of the selected preamble.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0111">After transmitting the preamble, the UE needs to monitor reception of Msg2 (or RAR) corresponding thereto, and a time (window) interval for the same may be defined by ra-ResponseWindow. The UE may expect reception of an RAR within a predetermined number of symbols after transmitting the preamble, and may perform PDCCH/PDSCH monitoring in association with Msg2 during the period of time corresponding the window interval.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0112">More specifically, RAR information may be transmitted in the form of a MAC PDU via a PDSCH from the base station, and the UE may monitor a PDCCH based on a random access (RA)-RNTI value in order to receive the PDSCH. That is, the PDCCH may include information associated with a UE that needs to receive a PDSCH, information associated with PDSCH transmission resource, a PDSCH transmission format, and the like. In addition, the RAR may include a random access preamble identifier (RAPID), an uplink (UL) grant indicating an Msg3 transmission resource, a temporary cell identifier (temporary cell (C)-RNTI)), a timing adjustment/advance command (TAC), and the like.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0113">In the case that response information (e.g., RAPID) is included in the received Msg2, the UE considers the case as successful RAR reception. Otherwise, the UE may perform the above-described preamble resource selection again in order to retransmit a preamble.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0114">The UE may perform Msg3 transmission based on parameter information for Msg3 transmission, such as UL grant information in the received Msg2. Upon performing of Msg3 transmission, the UE starts a contention resolution timer (CR timer), and performs cell(C)-RNTI-based PDCCH monitoring for receiving Msg4. In the case that Msg4 is received while the CR timer operates, the UE may determine that contention resolution is successfully performed.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0115">Hereinafter, examples of the disclosure associated with a random access procedure in an RC NR system will be described.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0116">In the legacy NR system, normal UEs having high-end UE capability for eMBB and/or URLLC service are present. However, UEs having medium-low UE capability are employed for services such as industrial wireless sensor services, video surveillance services, wearable equipment services, and the like (i.e., reduced capability/complexity (RC) UEs), UEs having various capability levels may be mixedly present in the NR network. For example, an RC UE may have capability characterized in that the number of transmission antennas and the number of reception antennas are limited to 1, respectively, a bandwidth is reduced, a low transmission power class is assigned, or a restricted half duplex is applied.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0117">In this case, there are UEs having different channel environments and different levels of capability in a single cell, and thus the base station (e.g., an NG-RAN) may need to identify different capability levels of the corresponding UEs promptly from the initial cell access process. A cell coverage or a resource allocation scheme that a legacy base station sets based on a UE (e.g., a high-end capability UE, hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;normal UE&#x201d; or a &#x201c;first type UE&#x201d;) that supports NR eMBB, URLLC, and/or a wideband may not be appropriate for a new type of UE (e.g., a medium-low capability UE, hereinafter, referred to as an &#x201c;RC UE&#x201d; or a &#x201c;second type UE&#x201d;) that is incapable of supporting eMBB, URLLC, and/or broadband (e.g., supporting a narrow band).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0118">For example, if the base station is capable of being aware of the coverage level (e.g., repetition level) of the RC UE in advance during the initial cell selection (or initial access) process, resource utilization for various types of base station-UE transmission and reception performed in the initial access process may be optimized. For example, during the random access process, if the base station is capable of identifying an RC UE in advance by distinguishing the same from a normal UE (e.g., a Rel-15 and/or Rel-16 UE (or an eMBB, URLLC, and/or wideband UE)), the base station may be capable of optimizing utilization of resources for base station-UE transmission and reception after the random access process, and may also secure the reliability of reception and coverage of the RC UE.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0119">As described above, in order to minimize or limit deterioration in performance caused due to a decrease in UE complexity, a coverage recovery function for compensating for a latent decrease in coverage caused due to a decrease in UE complexity is required. To this end, a network or a network operator is required to explicitly identify an RC UE, and securing the coexistence of a normal UE and an RC UE is required.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0120">The disclosure includes examples associated with random access for an RC UE.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0121">A base station may transmit an SSB based on a predetermined transmission pattern. The SSB may include a synchronization signal (SS) and a physical broadcast signal (PBCH), the SS may include a primary synchronization signal (PSS) and a secondary synchronization signal (SSS), and the PBCH may include a PBCH demodulation reference signal (DMRS), and PBCH data.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0122">A physical signal or a physical channel that the UE transmits first in the uplink after receiving an SSB and SIB1 from the base station in the initial access process is a random access preamble (or PRACH or Msg1). Based on the SSB transmitted from the base station, each UE that operates in the NR system may select an optimal SSB index (e.g., the index of an SSB having the highest SSB-RSRP) appropriate for a corresponding channel environment.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0123">Here, unlike a normal UE (e.g., a Rel-15 and/or Rel-16 UE (or an eMBB, URLLC, and/or wideband UE)), the RC UE may need to perform SSB monitoring or measurement during a longer period of time. In the situation in which the reception levels or reception coverage of an SSB and SIB1 are the same, the RC UE may need to receive an SSB and/or SIB1 during a longer period of time than the normal UE, in order to identify corresponding information. After identifying the SSB and SIB1 information, the RC UE may perform a random access procedure including random access preamble transmission using random access configuration related information provided via the selected SSB index (or an CSI-RS index in the RRC CONNECTED mode) and SIB <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0124">In order to provide, to the RC UE, coverage similar to that of the normal UE, a function of compensating for a coverage loss and a decrease in the reliability of reception caused due to a reduced capability or a reduced complexity of the RC UE. For example, random access preamble transmission is a signal that a UE transmits first to a base station. Accordingly, in order to provide coverage compensation or a stable radio access function to an RC UE, the base station may need to recognize, in advance, whether the corresponding UE is an RC UE (or whether an RC UE is present) in the initial access or random access process, and may perform data transmission specialized for the corresponding UE. According to an existing procedure defined conventionally, it is difficult to explicitly identify the capability of a UE during an initial access or random access procedure, and the capability of the UE is capable of being identified when a base station receives a signaling associated with the capability of the UE after the initial access or random access procedure.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0125">Therefore, there is a desire for a new method that enables a base station to identify whether a corresponding UE is an RC UE via random access preamble transmission by which the UE performs uplink transmission to the base station. Accordingly, via uplink and downlink transmission, such as an RAR (or Msg2), an L2/L3 message (or Msg3) and a contention resolution message (or Msg4), and the like, that are performed after random access preamble transmission by the UE, an additional or improved method such as coverage compensation, optimization of the use of resources, and the like may be applied to the corresponding UE.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0126">In the examples of the disclosure as described below, a random access operation may be defined for identifying an RC UE by distinguishing the same from a normal UE from the perspective of system information transmission, transmission carrier selection, preamble selection, and configuration of a RACH occasion (RO).</p><p id="p-0121" num="0127">System information transmission</p><p id="p-0122" num="0128">A base station may provide a common (or cell-specific) system parameter to both a normal UE and an RC UE via a common channel (e.g., a PDCCH and a PDSCH) by transmitting system information (e.g., SIB1) including random access configuration related information.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0129">For example, the base station identifies an RC UE by distinguishing the same from a normal UE, and may independently perform optimal SIB1 transmission to each of the normal UE and the RC UE. That is, SIB1 information for the RC UE may be configured in a size smaller than the size of SIB1 information for the normal UE. Parallelly or separately, SIB1 PDCCH/PDSCH that provides the same system information for the RC UE may be repeatedly transmitted at transmission intervals (e.g., 20, 40, 80 ms) shorter than 160 ms that is the transmission interval of a PDSCH including SIB1 and a PDCCH for SIB1 scheduling (hereinafter, SIB1 PDCCH/PDSCH) for the normal UE.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0130">In addition, in the case that SIB1 information and/or a transmission interval is set separately by distinguishing a normal UE and an RC UE, signaling overhead may be increased and the efficiency of the use of resources may deteriorate from the perspective of a cell. Therefore, without distinguishing a normal UE and an RC UE, common SIB1 may be transmitted according to the same method. In this case, to perform compensation associated with reception coverage and reliability, and the like for the RC UE, the RC UE may receive SIB1 during a longer period of time than the normal UE. Accordingly, it is expected that SIB1 reception by the RC UE has a longer latency than the normal UE.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0131">Selection of transmission carrier</p><p id="p-0126" num="0132">A UE may select a transmission carrier (Tx carrier) for performing random access.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0133">In the case of a normal UE, for example, in the case of a wideband UE for which an SUL is additionally configured, an SUL or NUL may be selected depending on whether the RSRP value of a downlink pathloss is less than, or is greater than or equal to rsrp-ThresholdSSB-SUL in the random access configuration related information, and a P<sub>CMAX </sub>value may be set based on the same.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0134">In the case of an RC UE (if the RC UE is configured with an SUL), a Tx carrier for random access may be selected between an SUL and the NUL based on at least one of a coverage level, a repetitive transmission level (repetition level), the type of UE, and a UE category, in addition to the above-mentioned method of comparing a downlink pathloss and the set threshold value (i.e., a method of selecting an SUL Tx carrier if the RSRP value of the downlink pathloss is less than the threshold value, and otherwise, selecting an NUL Tx carrier.) For example, an RC UE corresponding to the case in which the RSRP value of the downlink pathloss is less than the threshold value, and a coverage level/repetitive transmission level is greater than or equal to a predetermined level (i.e., the situation that requires a high coverage level) may use an SUL carrier. Otherwise, the RC UE may use an NUL.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0135">In addition, a new Tx carrier selection threshold value (e.g., rsrp-ThresholdSSB-SUL-RCNR) may be set for an RC UE, that is different from a Tx carrier selection threshold value for a normal UE (e.g., rsrp-ThresholdSSB-SUL).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0136">Alternatively, a Tx carrier selection threshold value (e.g., rsrp-ThresholdSSB-SUL) may be set for a normal UE and an RC UE in common, and the RC UE may select a Tx carrier for random access between an SUL and an NUL based on at least one of a downlink pathloss, a coverage level, a repetitive transmission level, the type of UE, and a UE category.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0137">Alternatively, in the case that an SUL is configured for an RC UE, an SUL may be always selected as a Tx carrier for random access, irrespective of a Tx carrier selection threshold value.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0138">Alternatively, via higher layer information, a UL carrier that is one of the carriers (NUL or SUL) configured for a single service cell may be immediately configured for an RC UE as a carrier for random access.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0139">Selection of preamble</p><p id="p-0134" num="0140">An RC UE that receives random access configuration related information via system information (e.g., SIB1) obtained from a base station may determine parameter values for performing random access.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0141">Part of system information (e.g., SIB1) related to random access configuration related information to which the examples of the disclosure is applicable may be listed as shown in Table 5.

Alternatively, in the case that a mapping relationship between the number of times of repetitive preamble transmission and a preamble index/RO is defined, a UE may select a preamble corresponding to a corresponding repetitive transmission level and/or transmission power offset value based on measured channel information and channel measurement threshold values set for each repetition level, as described below. In addition, the UE may determine a repetition level based on a configuration for an SSB index (or SSB indices) that shares the same RO(s).</p><p id="p-0146" num="0151">Alternatively, based on channel information (e.g., the RSRP of a downlink pathloss), transmission power, a transmission power offset, a power class, the type of UE, a UE category, and the like measured by a UE itself, the UE may determine the number of times that a random access preamble is repeatedly transmitted (or a repetitive transmission level) based on a predetermined threshold value set or defined for the UE in advance.

Here, the above-mentioned type of UE (or a UE category or UE capability) may be taken into consideration in order to distinguish the transmission/reception capability of an RC UE (e.g., the maximum supportable bandwidth, whether a half-duplex mode is available, the number of antennas, whether MIMO transmission is performed, and the like), transmission power, a transmission power offset, a power class, and the like, and it is assumed that the types of UEs may have different UE characteristics and capability levels from each other. In addition, the RC UE may determine the number of times of preamble transmission, which differs depending on a random access procedure-related method (i.e., 4-step CBRA, 2-step CBRA or 4-step CFRA, 2-step CFRA). Particularly, in the case of 2-step CBRA and 2-step CFRA, preamble transmission and uplink message (PUSCH) transmission are performed together, and thus the number of times of repetitive transmission may be determined independently based on the above-described method for successful reception of a preamble and an uplink message.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0156">RO Configuration</p><p id="p-0152" num="0157">A RACH occasion or PRACH occasion (RO) corresponds to a resource in which a UE is capable of performing random access preamble transmission.

Alternatively, the first RO and the second RO may be configured to be separate. That is, the second RO that is distinguished from the first RO for the normal UE in the time and/or frequency domain may be configured in addition to the first RO. Alternatively, the first RO may include a normal UE-dedicated RO and an RO shared with an RC UE, and the second RO may include an RC UE-dedicated RO and an RO shared with a normal UE.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0159">In addition, some of the parameters included in Table 5 may be included or excluded depending on whether the first RO and the second RO for a normal UE and an RC UE are configured to have an RO in common or to partially overlap, or to be separate.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0160">The first RO and the second RO for the normal UE and the RC UE may be configured for a UE(s) by a base station.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0161">In the case of an RO configuration, a base station may additionally provide RO masking information associated with the whole or some of configured ROs. Masking information may indicate whether an RO(s) corresponding to a predetermined index (indices) is available among configured ROs. For example, if the first RO is configured for a normal UE, the second RO is configured for an RC UE, and masking information is additionally provided, the RC UE may determine an available RO in consideration of the masking information. The available RO of the RC UE and the available RO of the normal UE may have an RO in common, may partially overlap, or may be totally different from each other. If masking information is not provided, the RC UE may determine the second RO as an available RO. That is, the available ROs of the normal UE and the RC UE may be basically determined based on first and second RO configurations, and if additional masking information is provided, an available RO may be finally determined by additionally applying the same. In addition, in the case that masking information is provided, whether the first RO and the second RO overlap may be finally determined based on the masking information. Therefore, in the descriptions below, the first RO and the second RO may be available ROs for the normal UE and the RC UE, respectively, that are determined by applying masking information if the masking information is provided.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0162">For example, in the case that the first RO and the second RO are configured to partially overlap or to have an RO in common, a base station may perform configuration based on masking information (e.g., rc-ssb-sharedROmaskindex) so that a subset or a universal set of an RO that the normal UE uses is shared with the RC UE. In this case, the first RO and the second RO may be configured to have an intersection. Alternatively, the first RO may be configured to include the entirety of the second RO, or the first RO and the second RO may be configured to be an identical set. ROs that RC UEs are capable of actually using for preamble transmission may be indicated via the masking information (or an RO mask index) among a first RO and a second RO associated for each configured SSB (or CSI-RS). That is, ROs that the normal UE and the RC UE are capable of using may be distinguished via the above-described parameters or may be independently indicated, and based on the indication, ROs of the normal UE and the RC UE may be freely configured so as not to overlap, to partially overlap, or to be identical.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0163">Hereinafter, a first RO and a second RO are taken into consideration, and respective ROs may be separately indicated using independent RO mask configurations based on independent RO configurations or the identical RO configuration.

That is, the case in which the first preamble group includes group A and the second preamble group includes group C, or the case in which the first preamble group includes group A and group B and second preamble group includes group C is assumed. In addition, the range of preamble indices allocated to each of the preamble group A, B, and C or the number of preamble indices for each group may be set by a base station or may be defined in advance. As described above, the scope of the disclosure is not limited to the name of a preamble group (i.e., group A, B, or C) or the range or the number of preamble indices belonging to each group, and may include allocation of a preamble group that differs for each of a normal UE and an RC UE.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0168">In addition, the scope of the disclosure may include the case in which a single SSB (or a single CSI-RS) is associated with a single RO, the case in which a single SSB (or a single CSI-RS) is associated with a plurality of ROs, and the case in which a plurality of SSBs (or a plurality of CSI-RSs) are associated with a single RO.

The total number of preamble indices (or the number of preambles) per RO may be configured with respect to the one or more ROs. The total number of preambles in a single RO may be the sum of the number of preambles belonging to a first preamble group (i.e., group A and/or B) and the number of preambles belonging to a second preamble group.

For example, the base station may provide group C configuration information for the RC UE via system information (e.g., SIB1 or dedicated-RRC signaling). For example, the group C configuration information may include whether to configure group C (groupCconfigured). In the case that configuration of group C is indicated, the number of preambles obtained by subtracting the number of preambles in group B (numberOfRa-PreambleGroupB) and the number of preambles in group A (numberOfRA-PreamblesGroupA) from the total number of preambles is determined as the number of preambles in group C. Alternatively, in the case that the first preamble group includes only group A, the number of preambles obtained by subtracting the number of preambles in group A (numberOfRA-PreamblesGroupA) from the total number of preambles is determined as the number of preambles in group C.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0172">The start index of a preamble belonging to the second preamble group (or group C) may be determined as an index next to the end index of a preamble belonging to the first preamble group (or group A and/or B).</p><p id="p-0168" num="0173">As an additional example, an offset (e.g., offsetOfRA-PreamblesGroupC) may be configured in order to indicate the start index of a preamble belonging to the second preamble group (or group C). In this case, a preamble index that is spaced an offset value apart from the end index of a preamble belonging to the first preamble group (or group A and/or B) may be the start preamble index of the second preamble group, and preambles from the start preamble index to the end index of a preamble in all the preambles or to a preamble index corresponding to the number of preambles in the second preamble group may belong to the second preamble group. Alternatively, the start index of a preamble belonging to the second preamble group (or group C) may be directly configured, instead of using the above-described offset. Here, the start index of the second preamble group may be configured not to overlap an index that belongs to the first preamble group.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0174">In this case, the number of preambles of the second preamble group may be determined by subtracting the number of preambles of the first preamble group (or group A and/or B) from the total number of preambles, and by further subtracting the offset or the number of indices from an index next to the first preamble group end index to an index before the second preamble group start index.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0175">As an additional example, the second preamble group may be configured to include a predetermined number of preambles in a descending order from the end index of the entire preamble group. In this case, the predetermined number may be indicated by a base station (e.g., via system information).</p><p id="p-0171" num="0176">For example, the total number of preambles available in a single RO is set to 41, and the available preamble indices may be set to 0 to 40. A first preamble group may be configured with preamble indices 0 to 23. Specifically, the preamble indices 0 to 16 may be configured as group A, and the preamble indices 17 to 23 may be configured as group B. In addition, the second preamble group may be configured with preamble indices 32 to 40. Such preamble group configuration is merely an example, and the scope of the disclosure is not limited thereto, and the number of preambles belonging to each group and the range of indices may be configured variously.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0177">A UE may select a preamble group based on a predetermined criterion, and may randomly select a single preamble index within the selected preamble group.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0178">For example, a UE may select one of the first or second preamble group based on the type of UE or UE capability of the UE itself. Specifically, a normal UE may select one preamble index from the first preamble group, and an RC UE may select one preamble index from the second preamble group.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0179">Depending on which preamble group a preamble index that a base station receives from a UE belongs to, the type of UE or UE capability may be identified at the initial stage. For example, in the case that a random access preamble index that the base station receives from the UE belongs to the second preamble group, the base station may identify that the corresponding UE that attempts random access is an non-RC UE or an RC UE, and may identify the type of UE, the repetitive transmission level, the coverage level, and/or the UE capability of the RC UE at the initial stage.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0180">From the perspective of the base station, the type of UE, the repetitive transmission level, the coverage level, and/or capability information may be taken into consideration in a following procedure. For example, if it is identified that the base station receives a random access preamble from the RC UE, the base station may set, apply, or consider an independent or new resource, transmission, repetitive transmission, and the like that correspond to the reduced capability of the RC UE in the following procedure. For example, a procedure after receiving the random access preamble may include exchanging of Msg2, Msg3, and Msg4 during the random access procedure, or may include configuration of a HARQ ACK/NACK transmitted from the UE via an uplink channel (e.g., a PUCCH), processing thereof, or the like.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0181">As an additional example, the UE may select a preamble group based on the size of Msg 3 desired to be transmitted and a downlink pathloss value. The example may be applied together with or independently from selection of a preamble group based on the above-described UE type or UE capability.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0182">Generally, the minimum magnitude of downlink/uplink transmission to RC UEs needs to be performed, so as to apply coverage and reception reliability corresponding to similar level of the normal UEs to the system. Given the above, in association with the random access procedure, the RC UE may have Msg3 provided in a size smaller than that of the normal UE. Therefore, based on a predetermined threshold value (e.g., ra-Msg3SizeGroupA) for the size of Msg3, the UE may select a preamble group.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0183">As a specific example, in the case that the base station configures groups A, B, and C as preamble groups, the size of Msg3 may have the relationship of group B&#x3e;group A&#x3e;group C.

In this case, the values of preamble indices in a plurality of ROs associated with repetitive transmission of a single preamble by the RC UE may be selected to be the same or to be different from each other according to a predetermined rule or via additional signaling by a base station. That is, in the case of selecting ROs and a preamble index associated with repetitive transmission of a single preamble, preamble indices and/or RO resources associated with repetitive transmission of a single preamble may be determined according to a preamble rule (e.g., consecutive preamble indices or preamble indices based a rule, and consecutive ROs associated with a single SSB in the time/frequency domain) or according to higher layer signaling by a base station. Through the above, a base station reception end may easily recognize the association of repetitive transmission of a single preamble by a single RC UE, thereby clearly recognizing pieces of information obtained by receiving a correct preamble such as a random access preamble ID (RAPID) value or the like included in RAR transmission performed in the future. Particularly, the method of selecting a subsequent RO needs to equally assume the content related to the above-mentioned RO.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0208"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of an initial active bandwidth path (BWP) configuration to which the disclosure is applied.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0209">An RO may be defined in a predetermined resource.

In the present example, all preamble indices in a single RO may correspond to the same repetition level, and different repetition levels correspond to different ROs (or different RO groups).</p><p id="p-0262" num="0265">As described above, a preamble repetition level may be set based on an RO unit or an RO group unit. Accordingly, a UE may select an RO corresponding to a repetition level or an RO according to settings by a base station, may select a preamble index from the corresponding RO, and may transmit a preamble to the base station. For example, in an RO group corresponding to a predetermined repetition level, a plurality of ROs may be selected, the number of which corresponds to the predetermined repetition level. The UE may select a preamble index from each of the plurality of ROs, and may transmit a preamble based on the selected preamble index in the plurality of ROs. Here, the UE may select the same preamble index or a different preamble index for each of the plurality of ROs, or the UE may randomly select a preamble index from each RO.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0266">In addition, in a single RO group corresponding to a predetermined repetition level, ROs of which the number corresponds to the repetition level may be distinguished in time resources and/or frequency resources. For example, if the repetition level is 2 or a higher value, the UE may transmit a preamble in a plurality of ROs in frequency resources distinguished in the same time resource, may transmit a preamble in a plurality of ROs in time resources distinguished in the same frequency resource, or may transmit a preamble in a plurality of ROs in distinguished time resources and frequency resources.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0267">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the UE may determine SSB#1 as an optimal SSB, and may identify a total of 32 ROs corresponding to SSB#1. In addition, the total of 32 ROs corresponding to a single SSB may be configured as four RO groups. A first RO group corresponds to repetition level #1, a second RO group corresponds to repetition level #2, a third RO group corresponds to repetition level #3, and a fourth RO group corresponds to repetition level #4. Among all ROs corresponding to a single SSB, some ROs may be mapped to respective repetition level indices when a repetition level index (beginning with 0) is increased, and the mapping relationship of the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> may be configured. If the UE determines repetition level #2, the UE may select two ROs (a first RO and a second RO) among eight ROs belonging to the second RO group and may perform repetitive preamble transmission two times. Here, in each RO, the UE may randomly select a preamble index, may select the same preamble index from the first RO and the second RO, or may select different preamble indices from the first RO and the second RO.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0268">As described above, in the case that the UE performs preamble transmission in one or more ROs that belongs to the same RO group corresponding to a predetermined repetition level, the base station may recognize the repetition level of the corresponding UE based on an RO group in which the UE performs preamble transmission.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0269">The repetitive preamble transmission scheme in the above-described examples corresponds to the case of transmitting a preamble of a single preamble index in a single RO. That is, ROs of which the number corresponds to the value of a repetition level may be used for repetitive preamble transmission. For example, in the case that a single preamble group corresponding to repetition level M determined by the UE is selected, a single preamble index may be selected from the selected preamble group, and a single preamble may be transmitted in each of M ROs. In addition, in the case that a single RO group corresponding to repetition level M determined by the UE is selected, a single preamble may be transmitted in each of M ROs in the selected RO group.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0270">As an additional repetitive preamble transmission scheme according to the disclosure, a plurality of preambles may be transmitted in a single RO. For example, a plurality of preambles may be multiplexed in a single RO via distinguished time and/or frequency resources, or a plurality of preambles may be distinguished in the same time-frequency resource in a single RO according to a code division multiplexing (CDM) scheme. Here, a plurality of preambles transmitted in a single RO may have the same preamble index, or may have different preamble indices from each other.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0271">In this case, the repetition level M may correspond to the product of the number of preambles (M_Preamble) transmitted in a single RO and the number of preamble transmission ROs (M_RO) (herein, the number of preambles transmitted in a single RO is different from the number of different preamble indices transmitted in a single RO).</p><p id="p-0269" num="0272">For example, depending on the repetition level M, M_Preamble that is the number of preambles transmitted in a single RO, and M_RO that is the number of preamble transmission ROs may be determined. For example, in the case that repetition level M determined by a UE is 4, that is, M=4, M_Preamble and M_RO may be determined to be M_Preamble=2 and M_RO=2, M_Preamble=1 and M_RO=4, or M_Preamble=4 and M_RO=1.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0273">As described above, one or more times of preamble transmission may be performed in a single RO. In association with the same, the number of preambles allowed in a single RO may be set by a base station. Alternatively, an RO group may be configured based on the number of preambles transmitted in a single RO. For example, in some RO groups among RO groups corresponding to a repetition level of 2 or a higher value, a plurality of (e.g., two) times of preamble transmission may be configured in a single RO.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0274">Here, the above-described repetitive preamble transmission scheme needs to be distinguished from a correspondence relationship between a repetitive transmission level and a preamble group and/or an RO group.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0275">For example, selecting a preamble group and/or an RO group corresponding to the repetition level of a UE may be applied in the same manner as the above-described examples. In this case, the base station recognizes a repetition level determined by the UE not based on the number of times that a preamble is actually repeatedly received, but based on a preamble group or an RO group index selected by the UE.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0276">Particularly, one or a plurality of preamble indices may be selected from a single preamble group corresponding to the repetition level M determined by the UE. Alternatively, a single RO group may be selected from RO groups corresponding to the repetition level M determined by the UE, and one or multiple preamble indices may be selected from the corresponding RO (without distinguishing a preamble group).</p><p id="p-0274" num="0277">For example, the UE may determine repetition level M, and M=4. In this case, the UE may select a single preamble group corresponding to the repetition level M=4, and may select one or multiple preamble indices from the selected preamble group. Accordingly, in each of M_RO ROs among ROs associated with a single SSB (or CSI-RS), the one or more preamble indices selected from the selected preamble group may be repeatedly transmitted as M_Preamble preambles. Alternatively, the UE may select a single RO group corresponding to the repetition level M=4, and may select one or more multiple preamble indices from an RO belonging to the corresponding RO group. Accordingly, in each of M_RO ROs in the selected RO group, the one or more selected preamble indices may be repeatedly transmitted as M_Preamble preambles.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0278">As an additional example, a repetition level determined by the UE may correspond to the combination of an RO group and a preamble group. For example, ROs associated with a single SSB (or CSI-RS) may include a plurality of RO groups, and each RO may include a plurality of preamble groups. In this case, the base station may recognize the repetition level determined by the UE based on a combination of a preamble group and an RO group selected by the UE.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0279">For example, the repetition level determined by the UE may correspond to a combination of a first repetition level corresponding to an RO group and a second repetition level corresponding to a preamble group. For example, in the case that a repetition level determined by the UE is repetition level M=4, the UE may select a single RO group corresponding to a first repetition level=2, and may select a single preamble group corresponding to a second repetition level=2 in an RO belonging to the corresponding RO group. Alternatively, the UE may select a single RO group corresponding to a first repetition level=1, and may select a single preamble group corresponding to a second repetition level=4 from an RO belonging to the corresponding RO group. Alternatively, the UE may select a single RO group corresponding to a first repetition level=4, and may select a single preamble group corresponding to a second repetition level=1 from an RO belonging to the corresponding RO group.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0280">As described above, the UE may select an RO group, and may select one or more preamble indices from a preamble group selected from an RO belonging to the corresponding RO group. Accordingly, in each of M_RO ROs in the selected RO group, one or more preamble indices selected from the selected preamble group may be repeatedly transmitted as M_Preamble preambles.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0281">In addition, the base station may explicitly set or indicate, to a UE, a repetitive preamble transmission level based on the channel state of an RC UE and its type/capability and/or whether the RC UE is in an RRC connected mode. In this case, unlike the above-description, instead of selecting the repetition level by the UE, the base station may indicate the repetition level via DCI signaling and/or higher layer signaling. The UE may receive information associated with the repetition level from the base station, and based thereon, the UE may repeatedly transmit a preamble or message A (e.g., a preamble and a PUSCH in the case of 2-step CBRA and 2-step CFRA). In addition, in the 2-step CBRA or 2-step CFRA that transmits message A, the independent repetitive transmission of each of a preamble and a PUSCH payload included in message A may be configured by the base station or may be selected by the UE. For example, the number of times (P) of repetitive preamble transmission and the number of times (F) of repetitive PUSCH payload transmission corresponding to a repetition level selected by the UE or indicated by the base station according to the above-suggested method may be determined to be different or may be determined to be the same value.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0282"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating the operation of a UE according to the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0283">In operation S<b>1310</b>, a UE may receive random access-related configuration information.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0284">For example, the random access-related configuration information may be provided from a base station via system information signaling.
