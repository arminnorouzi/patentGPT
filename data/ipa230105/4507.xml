num="0002">As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option available to users is information handling systems. An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, and/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes thereby allowing users to take advantage of the value of the information. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements vary between different users or applications, information handling systems may also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information may be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, information handling systems may include a variety of hardware and software components that may be configured to process, store, and communicate information and may include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one embodiment, a method for managing a smart network interface controller (NIC) of an information handling system includes: sending, by a basic input/output system (BIOS) of the information handling system, a request for estimated resource requirements associated with the smart NIC to a baseboard management controller (BMC) of the information handling system, the estimated resource requirements indicating estimated system resources likely to be required by one or more emulated devices of the smart NIC;

In some embodiments, processor subsystem <b>120</b> may interpret and/or execute program instructions and/or process data stored locally (e.g., in memory subsystem <b>140</b> and/or another component of information handling system <b>100</b>). In the same or alternative embodiments, processor subsystem <b>120</b> may interpret and/or execute program instructions and/or process data stored remotely. In one embodiment, processor subsystem <b>120</b> may be or include a multi-core processor comprised of one or more processing cores disposed upon an integrated circuit (IC) chip. In other embodiments, processor subsystem <b>120</b> may be or include an integrated device (e.g., microcontroller, system on a chip (SoC), and the like) that includes memory, peripheral interfaces, and/or other components suitable for interpreting and/or executing program instructions and/or processing data.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, memory subsystem <b>140</b> may comprise a system, device, or apparatus operable to retain and/or retrieve program instructions and/or data for a period of time (e.g., computer-readable media). Memory subsystem <b>140</b> may comprise random access memory (RAM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), a PCMCIA card, flash memory, magnetic storage, opto-magnetic storage, and/or a suitable selection and/or array of volatile or non-volatile memory that retains data after power to its associated information handling system, such as system <b>100</b>, is powered down.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment, I/O subsystem <b>150</b> may comprise a system, device, or apparatus generally operable to receive and/or transmit data to, from, and/or within information handling system <b>100</b>. I/O subsystem <b>150</b> may represent, for example, a variety of communication interfaces, graphics interfaces, video interfaces, user input interfaces, and/or peripheral interfaces.

A device (e.g., a client information handling system <b>100</b> or a server information handling system <b>100</b>) on network <b>190</b> may be addressed by a corresponding network address including, for example, an Internet protocol (IP) address, an Internet name, a Windows Internet name service (WINS) name, a domain name or other system name. In particular embodiments, network <b>190</b> may include one or more logical groupings of network devices such as, for example, one or more sites (e.g. customer sites) or subnets. As an example, a corporate network may include potentially thousands of offices or branches, each with its own subnet (or multiple subnets) having many devices. One or more client information handling systems <b>100</b> may communicate with one or more server information handling systems <b>100</b> via any suitable connection including, for example, a modem connection, a LAN connection including the Ethernet or a broadband WAN connection including DSL, Cable, Ti, T3, Fiber Optics, Wi-Fi, or a mobile network connection including GSM, GPRS, 3G, or WiMax.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, network <b>190</b> may transmit data using a desired storage and/or communication protocol, including, but not limited to, Fibre Channel, Frame Relay, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Internet protocol (IP), other packet-based protocol, small computer system interface (SCSI), Internet SCSI (iSCSI), Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) or another transport that operates with the SCSI protocol, advanced technology attachment (ATA), serial ATA (SATA), advanced technology attachment packet interface (ATAPI), serial storage architecture (SSA), integrated drive electronics (IDE), and/or any combination thereof. Network <b>190</b> and its various components may be implemented using hardware, software, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, BIOS <b>110</b> may be a suitable system, apparatus, or device operable to manage resources for information handling system <b>100</b>. In particular, BIOS <b>110</b> may be or include a set of firmware instructions electronically stored within information handling system <b>100</b> that allows information handling system <b>100</b> to manage various resources and/or perform specific tasks. For example, information handling system <b>100</b> may use BIOS <b>110</b> to perform hardware initialization during a pre-boot sequence and/or to provide runtime services for other host services executing on information handling system <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, BIOS <b>110</b> may send a request for estimated resource requirements associated with smart NIC <b>170</b> to BMC <b>130</b> during a booting process of smart NIC <b>170</b>. That is, BIOS <b>110</b> may request estimated resource requirements indicating one or more estimated system resources likely to be required by one or more devices, or &#x201c;emulated devices,&#x201d; to be emulated by smart NIC <b>170</b>. In response, BIOS <b>110</b> may receive the estimated resource requirements from BMC <b>130</b> and may initialize the estimated system resources likely to be required by the one or more emulated devices of smart NIC <b>170</b> based on the estimated resource requirements.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Conventionally, BIOS may refrain from initializing system resources for a smart NIC until an operating system (e.g., ESXio) of the smart NIC has completed a booting process to ensure that each emulated device, or endpoint, associated with the smart NIC may be enumerated accordingly. In particular, BIOS may refrain from enumerating devices and booting an operating system of an information handling system until the operating system of the smart NIC has successfully completed a booting process. For example, conventional BIOS may refrain from enumerating one or more peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) devices of an information handling until identifying a signal from the smart NIC indicating that the operating system of the smart NIC has completed the booting process. However, this delay in enumerating devices and booting the operating system of the information handling system may result in a user waiting several minutes (e.g., 2 to 3 minutes) for the information handling system to complete the booting process. In addition, conventional BIOS typically enumerates devices of the information handling system early in the information handling system booting process. Thus, a user may not be provided with keyboard and/or mouse support to bypass the wait time associated with the booting process of the smart NIC, thereby decreasing efficiency and overall user experience.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In contrast, BIOS <b>110</b> may enumerate system resources for one or more additional devices (e.g., device <b>250</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of information handling system <b>100</b> without waiting for OS <b>180</b> of smart NIC <b>170</b> to complete a booting process. That is, BIOS <b>110</b> may initialize estimated system resources likely to be required by one or more emulated devices of smart NIC <b>170</b> and may continue enumerating system resources for one or more additional devices of information handling system <b>100</b> without causing a delay in the booting process of information handling system <b>100</b>. For example, BIOS <b>110</b> may reserve one or more busses and/or allocate one or more portions of memory of information handling system <b>100</b> for use by one or more emulated devices of smart NIC <b>170</b> and may continue enumerating system resources for use by one or more additional devices of information handling system <b>100</b>. Once BIOS <b>110</b> identifies that OS <b>180</b> of smart NIC <b>170</b> has successfully completed a booting process, or that smart NIC <b>170</b> is in a &#x201c;ready state,&#x201d; BIOS <b>110</b> may identify actual resource requirements associated with smart NIC <b>170</b>. That is, BIOS <b>110</b> may identify actual resource requirements indicating one or more actual system resources required by one or more emulated devices of smart NIC <b>170</b>. Upon identifying the actual resource requirements, BIOS <b>110</b> may enumerate the actual system resources for the one or more emulated devices of smart NIC <b>170</b> accordingly. In particular, BIOS <b>110</b> may initiate a hot-plug event to enumerate the estimated system resources that were previously initialized.

For example, BIOS <b>110</b> may reserve one or more busses of information handling system <b>100</b> for use by emulated devices <b>230</b> of smart NIC <b>170</b> and may then assign bus numbers to one or more busses for use by one or more additional devices of information handling system <b>100</b> as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In step <b>350</b>, BIOS may determine that smart NIC is in a ready state. For example, BIOS <b>110</b> may send a request to BMC <b>130</b> to identify that OS <b>180</b> of smart NIC <b>170</b> has completed the booting process and may receive a signal (e.g., assert a general purpose I/O (GPIO) signal, assert an interrupt signal, and the like) from BMC <b>130</b> indicating that smart NIC <b>170</b> is in the ready state as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In step <b>360</b>, BIOS may identify actual resource requirements associated with the smart NIC. The actual system resources may indicate actual system resources required by the one or more emulated devices of the smart NIC. For example, BIOS <b>110</b> may identify actual resource requirements indicating actual system resources required by emulated devices <b>230</b> of smart NIC <b>170</b> once actual resource requirements for each emulated device <b>230</b> of smart NIC <b>170</b> have been exposed by OS <b>180</b> as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In step <b>370</b>, BIOS may enumerate the actual system resources for the one or more emulated devices of the smart NIC. For example, BIOS <b>110</b> may perform one or more hot-plug events to enumerate the actual system resources for emulated devices <b>230</b> of smart NIC <b>170</b> before booting an operating system of information handling system <b>100</b> as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The above disclosed subject matter is to be considered illustrative, and not restrictive, and the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications, enhancements, and other embodiments which fall within the true spirit and scope of the present disclosure.
