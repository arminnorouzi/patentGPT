The inhaler is preferably a device for dispensing a powdered medicament preparation by inhalation. The device is in particular a portable, multiple-dose, breath activated dry powder inhaler without propellant gas, equipped with a metering device which dispenses doses from a medicament container. The electronic module is configured to detect at least a status and/or at least a working parameter of the inhaler and, possibly, to perform other related functions.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Background Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The administering of a powdered medicament preparation by inhalation from an inhaler is commonly known. Multiple-dose type powder inhalers comprising a powder container and a metering member which measures and dispenses a unit dose are also known.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Document WO 2004/012801, of the same Applicant, discloses a powder inhaler comprising a container for storing a powdered medicament, a metering member having a dosing recess to be filled with a dose of the powdered medicament and a mouthpiece in communication with an inhalation channel of the powder inhaler. The powder inhaler comprises a protective member which is slidingly moveable on the metering member between a closed position, in which the protective member covers the dosing recess of the metering member if the metering member is in an inhalation position, and an open position, in which the protective member exposes the dosing recess thereby enabling inhalation of the dose of the powdered medicament contained in the dosing recess. The protective member is coupled to an inhalation actuated mechanism in such a manner that the inhalation actuated mechanism moves the protective member from its closed position to its open position if there is an inhalation suction force exerted by a user which exceeds a predetermined level. The mechanical structure of the powder inhaler of WO 2004/012801 is able to provide a powder inhaler with an improved dosing ability, whereby unintended dosing can be avoided. Nowadays every user owns an electronic device, such as a computer, a smartphone or a tablet, with applications which could be used in everyday life and which could be useful to manage administering of medicaments. Document WO 2016/000983A1, by the same Applicant, discloses a powder inhaler similar to the one of WO 2004/012801.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The powder inhaler of WO 2004/012801 and of WO2016000983A1 do not comprise any electronic device to interface with an external electronic device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Inhalers provided with electronic devices configured to detect actuation of the inhaler itself and/or to collect data are also known.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Document EP2414978 discloses a reusable and portable communications device which may be fitted to an electronic medicament delivery device, such as electronic medicament inhalers. The communications device may include a battery for powering the device. The battery may be a disposable battery or a rechargeable battery.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Document EP3113817 discloses a compliance monitor for a dry powder medicament delivery device. The compliance monitor includes a first portion for receiving and/or retaining a base portion of the medicament delivery device and a second portion for releasably securing the medicament delivery device to the first portion. The compliance monitor may be powered by a battery (rechargeable or replaceable), a kinetic charger, or by solar power.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Document WO2017178865 discloses an add-on device for a metered dose inhaler. The add-on device comprises an observance system housing component comprising an observance system with at least one pressure sensor. The observance system allows to register certain predefined events. The device comprises a power supply, for example a removable and/or rechargeable battery. The use of rechargeable batteries cited in some documents above implies the adoption of a battery charger, which may raise the costs of the device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The use of replaceable batteries cited in some other documents above implies that the connection between the batteries and the device, such as contacts of a printed circuit board, do not provide a power supply that is robust to mechanical forces, such as those occurring during dropping of the device or various shocks and vibrations. Indeed, commonly used battery holders that allow removing and re-insertion of the battery cells are liable to deform during shocks and mechanical disturbances, hence causing interruptions in the supply of electrical power from the battery to the electronic circuitry (as the battery temporarily loses contact with the battery holder and/or the printed circuit board). These power interruptions cause the resetting of electronic control units of known devices, which may cause permanent software failure depending on the internal state of the control unit at the point when its power supply was lost.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Document U.S. Pat. No. 5,505,195 discloses a dry powder inhalant device adapted for mounting on a conventional medication dry powder dispenser having a mouthpiece incorporated in one end of the dispenser. The device is designed for monitoring prescribed dosages of dry powder medication received through the mouthpiece, the lips and into the mouth, throat, and respiratory system of a user of the device. The device includes main batteries which are the main power to the device and a further battery to power a ram memory if main batteries are ever removed or become low in energy. The redundant power supply of U.S. Pat. No. 5,505,195 is not cost effective.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is an object of the present invention to eliminate the above drawbacks of hitherto known electronic modules for inhalers.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide an electronic module for inhalers with a power supply that is robust to mechanical forces, thus preventing power failures.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is also object of the present invention to provide an electronic module for inhalers which allows to preserve the battery at least between the production of the device and its first use, i.e. during a long-term storage before the sale of the same.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is a further object of the present invention to minimize the power load presented to the battery during the long-term storage.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">At least one of the above objects is substantially achieved by an electronic module for an inhaler and to an inhaler assembly according to one or more of the appended claims and/or of the following aspects.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Aspects of the invention are disclosed in the following.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with a 1<sup>st </sup>independent aspect, an electronic module for an inhaler, wherein the electronic module is attached or attachable to the inhaler, comprises: a printed circuit board comprising electronic components, wherein the electronic components are configured to detect at least a status and/or at least a working parameter of the inhaler when the electronic module is attached to the inhaler;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">at least one battery permanently joined to the printed circuit board;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">wherein the printed circuit board comprises a first terminal and a second terminal electrically connectable one to the other through a main switch to close a circuit between the battery and the electronic components to power on the electronic components;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">wherein, in a rest configuration of the electronic module, the first terminal and the second terminal are electrically separated by the main switch;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">wherein, in a work configuration of the electronic module, the first terminal and the second terminal are electrically connected one to the other through said main switch;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">a latching circuit operatively electrically interposed between the battery and the electronic components, wherein, when the electronic module is in the work configuration, the latching circuit is configured to maintain power supply to the electronic components during momentarily disconnections of the first terminal from the second terminal due to a fault of the main switch.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an aspect according to the first aspect, the electronic module optionally comprises a removable electrical insulating pull-tab;

Therefore, only the main parts and the differences with respect to WO 2004/012801 or WO 2016/000983A1 will be detailed in the following description. The electronic module <b>3</b> (add-on module) is intended to be supplied separately from the inhaler <b>2</b> and to be assembled by the user upon first-time use. For example, the electronics within the electronic module <b>3</b> is fully built and assembled up to two years before the first use in the field, thus requiring a minimum shelf-life of twenty-four months prior to its in-use life which is specified as a further twelve months.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Powder Inhaler</heading><p id="p-0141" num="0143">The powder inhaler <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> comprises a plastic casing <b>4</b> and a plastic cover <b>5</b> being pivotably or rotatably coupled to the casing <b>4</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the cover <b>5</b> can be opened to reveal a mouthpiece <b>6</b> through which a user can inhale a powdered medicament. At an upper front side of the mouthpiece <b>6</b>, slots <b>7</b> are formed in the casing <b>4</b> which allow air inlet.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0144">The powder inhaler <b>2</b> comprises a container <b>8</b> for storing a powdered medicament, an inhalation channel <b>9</b> connected to the mouthpiece <b>6</b> and a metering device <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The inhalation channel <b>9</b> has a first opening connected to the mouthpiece and a second opening, opposite with respect to the first opening. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, all these elements are housed inside the casing <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0145">The container <b>8</b> is filled or is configured to be filled with an amount of powder medicament corresponding to a plurality of doses, e.g. up to 100-200 doses. The metering device <b>10</b> is a mechanism comprising a plurality of moving components.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0146">The metering device <b>10</b> is movable, with respect to the container <b>8</b> and with respect to the inhalation channel <b>9</b>, between an idle state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), in which a dosing recess <b>11</b> is in communication with an opening <b>12</b> of the container <b>8</b> so as to be filled with a dose of the powdered medicament, and a triggered state (not shown in the attached figures), in which the dosing recess <b>11</b> is in placed under the inhalation channel and in communication with the inhalation channel <b>9</b> for enabling inhalation of the dose of the powdered medicament contained in the dosing recess <b>11</b> through the mouthpiece <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0147">The metering device <b>10</b> comprises a shuttle <b>13</b> having the dosing recess <b>11</b> fashioned on an upper face like a cup shaped recess. The shuttle <b>13</b> is slidingly moveable between a filling position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) and an inhalation position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The filling position corresponds to the idle state (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) of the metering device <b>10</b>, in which the dosing recess is in alignment with the opening <b>12</b> of the container <b>8</b> so as to be filled with the dose of the powdered medicament. The inhalation position, corresponds to an armed state which, will be detailed later, and to the triggered state of the metering device <b>10</b>, in which the dosing recess <b>11</b> is in alignment with the inhalation channel <b>9</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0146" num="0148">The shuttle <b>13</b> is mechanically coupled to the cover <b>5</b> such that an opening of the cover <b>5</b> beyond a range of rotational movement from a closed position causes the shuttle <b>13</b> to move from the filling position to the inhalation position. Closing of the cover <b>5</b> causes the shuttle <b>13</b> to move back from the inhalation position to the filling position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the cover <b>5</b> in the closed position and the shuttle <b>13</b> in the filling position.

In the closed position, a rear part of the protective member <b>14</b> may at least in part close the second opening of the inhalation channel <b>9</b>. In the open position, the protective member <b>14</b> is shifted forward towards a wall of the casing <b>4</b>.

A further resilient element, not shown in the attached drawings, may be mounted on the coupling member <b>17</b> on an opposite side with respect to the resilient element <b>18</b> (as in WO 2016/000983). The flap <b>16</b> is coupled to the protective member <b>14</b> through the coupling member <b>17</b> such that, if there is an inhalation suction force exceeding a predetermined value, the flap <b>16</b> is moved from a first position to a second position, thereby causing the protective member <b>14</b> to move from the closed position to the open position. The flap <b>16</b> is placed inside the casing <b>4</b> and closes to the slots <b>7</b>. In the first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), the flap <b>16</b> separates the slots <b>7</b> from the inhalation channel <b>9</b> and seats in a main airflow path. In the second position, the flap <b>16</b> is rotated with respect to the first position to open the slots <b>7</b> and to allow air flowing through the slots <b>7</b> into the inhalation channel <b>9</b> and out of the mouthpiece <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0156">The coupling member <b>17</b> comprises a prolongation engaging with an opening <b>18</b> formed in the protective member <b>14</b> in order to move the protective member <b>14</b> from the closed position to the open position when the coupling member <b>17</b> moves from its respective first position to its respective second position and vice-versa.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0157">The casing <b>4</b> has an optically transparent window <b>19</b> placed close to the metering device <b>10</b> such that the metering device <b>10</b> is at least in part visible through the window <b>19</b> from outside the casing <b>4</b>.
