No. 16/705,355, filed Dec. 6, 2019, which claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/777,298 filed Dec. 10, 2018, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to heart valve replacements and, in particular, to collapsible prosthetic heart valves. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to collapsible prosthetic heart valves for use in the tricuspid valve annulus.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Prosthetic heart valves that are collapsible to a relatively small circumferential size can be delivered into a patient less invasively than valves that are not collapsible. For example, a collapsible valve may be delivered into a patient via a tube-like delivery apparatus such as a catheter, a trocar, a laparoscopic instrument, or the like. This collapsibility can avoid the need for a more invasive procedure such as full open-chest, open-heart surgery.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Collapsible prosthetic heart valves typically take the form of a valve structure mounted on a stent. There are two types of stents on which the valve structures are ordinarily mounted: a self-expanding stent and a balloon-expandable stent. To place such valves into a delivery apparatus and ultimately into a patient, the valve is generally first collapsed or crimped to reduce its circumferential size.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When a collapsed prosthetic valve has been delivered to the desired implant site in the patient (e.g., at or near the annulus of the patient's heart valve that is to be replaced by the prosthetic valve), the prosthetic valve can be deployed or released from the delivery apparatus and re-expanded to full operating size. For balloon-expandable valves, this generally involves releasing the entire valve, assuring its proper location, and then expanding a balloon positioned within the valve stent. For self-expanding valves, on the other hand, the stent automatically expands as the sheath covering the valve is withdrawn.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Transcatheter mitral valve replacement has garnered significant attention in the past. Transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement, however, has received less attention. Typically, tricuspid valve replacement has only been performed in the past when a patient exhibited symptoms as a result of tricuspid valve disease and a replacement of the mitral valve was also necessary, with the mitral and tricuspid valve replacement being performed concurrently. While significant advances have been made in transcatheter mitral valve replacement, less progress has been seen in transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement. Because the tricuspid valve is similar in at least some aspects to the mitral valve, designs and features of prosthetic mitral valves may have relevance to the design and features of prosthetic tricuspid valves. However, important differences between the mitral and tricuspid valve structures and anatomical environments exist and it would be desirable to have a transcatheter prosthetic tricuspid valve specifically designed for replacement of the native tricuspid valve.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to one aspect of the disclosure, a prosthetic heart valve includes a stent, a valve assembly disposed within the stent, a flange, and a plurality of anchor arms coupled to the stent. The stent may have a collapsed condition, an expanded condition, an inflow end, and an outflow end. The flange may comprise a plurality of braided wires and may be coupled to the stent and may be positioned adjacent the inflow end of the stent in the expanded condition of the stent. Each anchor arm may have a first end coupled to the stent adjacent the outflow end of the stent, a second end coupled to the stent adjacent the outflow end of the stent, and center portions extending from the first and second ends toward the inflow end of the stent. The center portions may be joined together to form a tip pointing toward the inflow end of the stent in the expanded condition of the stent.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a highly schematic cutaway representation of a human heart.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-B</figref> are highly schematic representations of a native tricuspid valve.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a bottom perspective view of a prosthetic heart valve.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a view of the outflow end of the prosthetic heart valve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a view of the inflow end of the prosthetic heart valve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a highly schematic side view of a prosthetic heart valve.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a highly schematic cross-section of the prosthetic heart valve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> in an expanded condition.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> is a highly schematic cross-section of the prosthetic heart valve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> in a collapsed condition.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a bottom perspective view of a flange for use with a prosthetic heart valve.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a highly schematic cross-section of the prosthetic heart valve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> in a collapsed condition.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a highly schematic cross-section of the prosthetic heart valve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> in an expanded condition.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a highly schematic representation of the prosthetic heart valve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> implanted into a native tricuspid valve annulus.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is a side view of a prosthetic heart valve according to another embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> is a side view of the prosthetic heart valve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> in a different rotational position.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, the term &#x201c;inflow end,&#x201d; when used in connection with a prosthetic tricuspid heart valve, refers to the end of the heart valve closest to the right atrium when the heart valve is implanted in a patient, whereas the term &#x201c;outflow end,&#x201d; when used in connection with a prosthetic tricuspid heart valve, refers to the end of the heart valve closest to the right ventricle when the heart valve is implanted in a patient. Also, as used herein, the terms &#x201c;substantially,&#x201d; &#x201c;generally,&#x201d; and &#x201c;about&#x201d; are intended to mean that slight deviations from absolute are included within the scope of the term so modified. Generally, materials described as being suitable for components in one embodiment of the disclosure may also be suitable for similar or identical components described in other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a highly schematic cutaway representation of human heart <b>100</b>. The human heart includes two atria and two ventricles: right atrium <b>112</b> and left atrium <b>122</b>, and right ventricle <b>114</b> and left ventricle <b>124</b>. Heart <b>100</b> further includes aorta <b>110</b> and aortic arch <b>120</b>. Disposed between left atrium <b>122</b> and left ventricle <b>124</b> is mitral valve <b>130</b>. Mitral valve <b>130</b>, also known as the bicuspid valve or left atrioventricular valve, is a dual-flap valve that opens as a result of increased pressure in left atrium <b>122</b> as it fills with blood. As left atrial pressure increases above that of left ventricle <b>124</b>, mitral valve <b>130</b> opens and blood passes into left ventricle <b>124</b>. Similarly, disposed between right atrium <b>112</b> and right ventricle <b>114</b> is tricuspid valve <b>140</b>. Tricuspid valve <b>140</b>, also known as the right atrioventricular valve, is a three-flap valve that opens as a result of increased pressure in right atrium <b>112</b> as it fills with blood. As right atrial pressure increases above that of right ventricle <b>114</b>, tricuspid valve <b>140</b> opens and blood passes into right ventricle <b>114</b>. Blood flows through heart <b>100</b> in the direction shown by arrows &#x201c;B&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition to mitral valve <b>130</b> and tricuspid valve <b>140</b>, heart <b>100</b> includes aortic valve <b>150</b>, which permits one-way flow of blood from left ventricle <b>124</b> to aorta <b>110</b>, and pulmonary valve <b>160</b>, which permits one-way flow of blood from right ventricle <b>114</b> to pulmonary artery <b>170</b>. A dashed arrow, labeled &#x201c;TA&#x201d;, indicates a transapical approach for implanting a prosthetic heart valve, in this case to replace tricuspid valve <b>140</b>. In transapical delivery, a small incision is made between the ribs and into the apex of right ventricle <b>114</b> to deliver the prosthetic heart valve to the target site. However, other approaches for implanting a prosthetic tricuspid valve are also possible. For example, tricuspid valve <b>140</b> may be approached via superior vena cava <b>180</b> or inferior vena cava <b>190</b> using any suitable access point including, for example, the femoral vein or the jugular vein. Still other delivery approaches may be appropriate, for example including a trans-atrial approach, an axillary vein approach, or any other approach to accessing the right atrium, including a cut-down approach to gain direct access.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a schematic representation of native tricuspid valve <b>140</b>, with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrating certain associated structures. As previously noted, tricuspid valve <b>140</b> typically includes three flaps or leaflets, including septal or medial leaflet <b>142</b>, anterior leaflet <b>144</b>, and posterior leaflet <b>146</b>, disposed between right atrium <b>112</b> and right ventricle <b>114</b>. Cord-like tendons, known as chordae tendineae <b>148</b>, connect the three leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, to papillary muscles <b>149</b>. Although heart <b>100</b> typically includes three papillary muscles <b>149</b> in right ventricle <b>114</b>, more or fewer papillary muscles may be present. During atrial systole, leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> open, enabling blood to flow from higher pressure in right atrium <b>112</b> to lower pressure in right ventricle <b>114</b>. When right ventricle <b>114</b> contracts in ventricular systole, the increased blood pressure in the chamber pushes leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> to close, preventing the backflow of blood into right atrium <b>112</b>. Since the blood pressure in right atrium <b>112</b> is much lower than that in right ventricle <b>114</b>, leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> attempt to evert to the low pressure regions. Chordae tendineae <b>148</b> prevent the eversion by becoming tense, thus pulling on leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> and holding them in the closed position.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a bottom perspective view of a prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> according to an aspect of the present disclosure.

Prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> is a collapsible prosthetic heart valve designed to replace the function of the native tricuspid valve of a patient, such as native tricuspid valve <b>140</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b>B</figref>. However, it should be understood that prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> may be suitable for use in replacing other valves, such as mitral valve <b>130</b>. Generally, prosthetic valve <b>300</b> has a substantially cylindrical stent <b>350</b> and a flared flange <b>380</b>, which may be an atrial flange. While in some embodiments, stent <b>350</b> may have a substantially circular cross-section, other shapes, including an oval cross-section or a D-shaped cross-section, may be appropriate.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a side view of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> showing stent <b>350</b> with various related structures, such as flange <b>380</b>, omitted for clarity. Stent <b>350</b> may be formed from biocompatible materials that are capable of self-expansion, such as, for example, shape-memory alloys including nitinol. Stent <b>350</b> may include a plurality of struts <b>352</b> that form cells <b>354</b> connected to one another in one or more annular rows around the stent. Cells <b>354</b> may all be of substantially the same size around the perimeter and along the length of stent <b>350</b>. Alternatively, cells <b>354</b> near inflow end <b>310</b> may be larger than the cells near outflow end <b>312</b>, or vice versa. In the illustrated embodiment, stent <b>350</b> includes two annular rows of cells <b>354</b>, including a first annular row of cells <b>354</b><i>a </i>adjacent inflow end <b>310</b>, and a second annular row of cells <b>354</b><i>b </i>adjacent outflow end <b>312</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> shows stent <b>350</b> as including nine substantially diamond shaped cells <b>354</b> in each row, whereas <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-C</figref> show the stent including twelve substantially diamond shaped cells in each row. It should be understood that more or fewer than nine or twelve cells may be provided in each row, and the cells may have shapes other than diamond shapes. Stent <b>350</b> may be expandable to exert a radial force to assist with positioning and stabilizing prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> in the annulus of native tricuspid valve <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a highly schematic cross-section of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b>. A valve assembly <b>360</b> may be disposed within stent <b>350</b>, the valve assembly including a plurality of leaflets <b>362</b> that may be attached to a cuff <b>364</b> and/or to struts <b>352</b> of stent <b>350</b>. Leaflets <b>362</b> replace the function of native tricuspid valve leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-B</figref>. That is, leaflets <b>362</b> coapt with one another to function as a one-way valve. The valve assembly <b>360</b> of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> may include three leaflets <b>362</b>, but it should be appreciated that more or fewer than three leaflets may be suitable. Cuff <b>364</b> may cover part or all of an interior surface of stent <b>350</b>, and may provide various benefits, for example including decreasing or eliminating contact between leaflets <b>362</b> and stent <b>350</b>, which could otherwise cause damage to the leaflets. Cuff <b>364</b> may also assist in fixing leaflets <b>362</b> to stent <b>350</b>, for example using sutures that directly couple the leaflets to the cuff. Still further, cuff <b>364</b> may assist in creating a seal between prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> and the annulus of native tricuspid valve <b>140</b>, to thereby limit paravalvular leak (&#x201c;PV leak&#x201d;) in which blood flows from right ventricle <b>114</b> to right atrium <b>112</b> between the prosthetic heart valve and the native tricuspid valve annulus. Both cuff <b>364</b> and leaflets <b>362</b> may be wholly or partly formed of any suitable biological material, such as bovine or porcine pericardium, or polymers, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), urethanes and the like. Cuff <b>364</b> may be positioned on the interior or luminal surface of stent <b>350</b>, on the abluminal surface of the stent, or on both surfaces. Valve assembly <b>360</b> may be secured to stent <b>350</b> by suturing to struts <b>352</b> and/or to cuff <b>364</b>, or by using tissue glue, ultrasonic welding, or other suitable attachment methods.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>4</b>A</figref>, stent <b>350</b> may include a plurality of commissure attachment features (&#x201c;CAFs&#x201d;) <b>366</b> to facilitate attachment of leaflets <b>362</b> to the stent. In the illustrated embodiment, CAFs <b>366</b> are positioned on the outflow end <b>312</b> of stent <b>350</b>, extending in a direction away from inflow end <b>310</b>. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, each CAF <b>366</b> may include a retainer <b>367</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, extending therefrom. Retainers <b>367</b> can have any shape, including substantially circular, and be configured to couple to a delivery device to prevent premature release or deployment of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b>. And while CAFs <b>366</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> as having a single eyelet, the CAFs can have other suitable shapes, including one or more rows of eyelets formed in one or more columns, and may additional include different sized eyelets and/or elongated eyelets. Prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> may also include stabilization or securement features to assist in maintaining the prosthetic heart valve within the native valve annulus, for example including flange <b>380</b>, described in greater detail below, and stabilization or anchor arms <b>370</b>. It should be noted that, although the term &#x201c;anchor arms&#x201d; is used herein, the arms may referred to as stabilization arms instead, and the arms may provide a stabilization and/or an anchoring function. It should further be understood that CAFs of the type described above may not be necessary. In other words, in some embodiments, the prosthetic leaflets may be directly attached to struts of the stent, instead of to a separate CAF feature.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> preferably includes three anchor arms <b>370</b>, corresponding to the three leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> of native tricuspid valve <b>140</b>. However, prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> may include more or fewer anchor arms <b>370</b>. As illustrated, anchor arms <b>370</b> are spaced at substantially equal intervals around the circumference of stent <b>350</b>, although other relative spacing may be suitable. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, each anchor arm <b>370</b> may include a first end <b>370</b><i>a </i>coupled or otherwise attached to an apex of a first cell <b>354</b> in the second row of cells <b>354</b><i>b </i>at outflow end <b>312</b>. Each anchor arm <b>370</b> may also include a second end <b>370</b><i>b </i>opposite first end <b>370</b><i>a</i>, the second end being coupled or otherwise attached to an apex of a second cell <b>354</b> in the second row of cells <b>354</b><i>b </i>at outflow end <b>312</b>, the first and second cells being circumferentially adjacent to each other. Preferably, ends <b>370</b><i>a </i>and <b>370</b><i>b </i>of each anchor arm <b>370</b> are coupled to the cell apices that are closest to the outflow end <b>312</b> of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b>. The first and second ends <b>370</b><i>a</i>, <b>370</b><i>b </i>may transition to elongated center portions <b>370</b><i>c</i>, <b>370</b><i>d</i>, respectively, that extend toward the inflow end <b>310</b> of stent <b>350</b>. Center portions <b>370</b><i>c</i>, <b>370</b><i>d </i>may transition to a tip <b>370</b><i>e </i>having a blunted and/or generally circular or oval shape. The tips <b>370</b><i>e </i>may include optional additional features to reduce trauma to adjacent tissue which the trips may contact, including, as described in greater detail below, applying materials such as polymers, tissues, fabrics, or the like to the tips. Tip <b>370</b><i>e </i>may have a width in a circumferential direction of stent <b>350</b> that is greater than the distance between center portions <b>370</b><i>c</i>, <b>370</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Anchor arms <b>370</b> may be formed of any suitable material, and may be coupled to stent <b>350</b> in any suitable fashion, or otherwise may be formed integrally with the stent. In one example, anchor arms <b>370</b> are formed of nitinol and are integral with stent <b>350</b>, the stent and anchor arms <b>370</b> being laser cut from the same structure. If anchor arms <b>370</b> are formed of a material having shape-memory properties, the anchor arms may be set (such as by heat setting) to have a desired shape and/or position in an unconstrained state. In use, anchor arms <b>370</b> are clipped or otherwise positioned over surfaces of the leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> of native tricuspid valve <b>140</b>, so that the native leaflets are positioned between the anchor arms and an exterior surface of stent <b>350</b>. Preferably, in use, each anchor arm <b>370</b> is positioned in contact with the center of the corresponding native leaflet <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>. By clipping over native leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, particularly at their centers, anchor arms <b>370</b> can help prevent the prosthetic heart valve from migrating into right atrium <b>112</b>, while also reducing movement of the native leaflets which might otherwise adversely affect proper functioning of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b>. Furthermore, if anchor arms <b>370</b> are positioned at the centers of corresponding native leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, the likelihood of the anchor arms interfering with chordae tendineae <b>148</b> may be reduced. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, about three cells <b>354</b> in the second row of cells <b>354</b><i>b </i>may be positioned between each pair of circumferentially adjacent anchor arms <b>370</b>. However, if stent <b>350</b> includes a different number of cells, the spacing may be different. For example, in a twelve cell embodiment, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-C</figref>, about four cells may be positioned between each pair of circumferentially adjacent anchor arms <b>370</b>. In some embodiments, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, it may be preferable that anchor arms <b>370</b> are attached to stent <b>350</b> centered between circumferentially adjacent CAFs <b>366</b>, such that, when implanted, the CAFs of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> are substantially aligned with the commissures of native valve leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> when anchor arms <b>370</b> are clipped over center portions of the corresponding native leaflets.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As noted above, anchor arms <b>370</b> may clip over native leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> when prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> is implanted in the annulus of tricuspid valve <b>140</b>. The blunted shape of tips <b>370</b><i>e </i>may help to reduce the likelihood that anchor arms <b>370</b> would damage native tissue at or near tricuspid valve <b>140</b>. However, additional features may be provided to further reduce the likelihood of anchor arms <b>370</b> damaging native tissue. For example, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, anchor arms <b>370</b> may include one or more layers of a buffer or other material. In the illustrated example, anchor arm <b>370</b> is covered with a first layer <b>372</b> of buffer material that is sutured or otherwise coupled to the anchor arm. First layer <b>372</b> may be one or more layers of tissue, for example bovine or porcine pericardium. In some embodiments, anchor arm <b>370</b> may be completely or substantially completely covered by first layer <b>372</b>, which may include two or more layers that sandwich the anchor arm therebetween. First layer <b>372</b> can extend over both center portions <b>370</b><i>c</i>, <b>370</b><i>d </i>and over tip <b>370</b><i>e </i>of anchor arms <b>370</b>. A second layer <b>374</b> of a buffer material may be provided on the tip <b>370</b><i>e </i>of anchor arm <b>370</b>. The tip <b>370</b><i>e </i>of anchor arm <b>370</b> may be more likely to damage native tissue, and second layer <b>374</b> may further reduce the likelihood of such damage. In the illustrated embodiment, second layer <b>374</b> is formed from a biocompatible polymer fabric or sheet material, such as PTFE, and overlies first layer <b>372</b>. It should be understood that, although first layer <b>372</b> is described as being formed of tissue, and second layer <b>374</b> is described as being formed of a polymer fabric or sheet material, either layer may be formed of either material, or of a combination of both materials. In some embodiments, second layer <b>374</b> may be provided without first layer <b>372</b>, and in other embodiments, the first layer may be provided without the second layer. The first layer <b>372</b> and the second layer <b>374</b> may increase the area of contact between anchor arm <b>370</b> and the corresponding native leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, and may be softer than the center portions <b>370</b><i>c</i>, <b>370</b><i>d </i>and tip <b>370</b><i>e </i>of the anchor arm, thus reducing the likelihood that the native tissue is damaged from interaction with the anchor arms.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As noted above, anchor arms <b>370</b> are preferably made from a shape-memory alloy. By using a shape-memory alloy, the anchor arms <b>370</b> may be set, for example by heat setting, to take the illustrated shape and/or position in the absence of applied forces. However, forces may be applied to anchor arms <b>370</b> and to prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> generally to reduce the radial size and/or bulk of the prosthetic heart valve when in the collapsed condition, which may facilitate intravascular (or other minimally invasive) delivery of the prosthetic heart valve via a delivery device (not shown). For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, stent <b>350</b> may be transitioned to the collapsed condition, with tips <b>370</b><i>e </i>of anchor arms <b>370</b> being distorted or &#x201c;flipped&#x201d; to point away from inflow end <b>310</b> rather than toward the inflow end. Prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> may be maintained in the collapsed condition, for example by a surrounding sheath of a delivery device (not shown), as prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> is delivered to native tricuspid valve <b>140</b>. When in a desired position relative to native tricuspid valve <b>140</b>, prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> may be released from the delivery device. As the constraining forces of the surrounding sheath are removed from prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b>, it begins to transition to the expanded condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, while anchor arms <b>370</b> transition to their preset shape. Since anchor arms <b>370</b> are shape-set so that their tips <b>470</b><i>e </i>point toward inflow end <b>310</b>, the anchor arms revert to that shape when released from the delivery device. As the tips <b>370</b><i>e </i>of anchor arms <b>370</b> transition from pointing away from inflow end <b>310</b> to pointing toward the inflow end, native tricuspid valve leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> are captured between the anchor arms and the abluminal surface of stent <b>350</b>. Distorting or flipping anchor arms <b>370</b> to point away from inflow end <b>310</b> while prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> is maintained in the collapsed condition may reduce the profile of the collapsed valve. However, it should be understood that this flipping of anchor arms <b>370</b> is not required. In other words, when stent <b>350</b> is transitioned into the collapsed condition, the tips <b>370</b><i>e </i>of anchor arms <b>370</b> may instead be kept pointing toward inflow end <b>310</b>, which may slightly increase the radial profile of the collapsed valve, but also decrease the total longitudinal length of the collapsed valve, which may be desirable in some circumstances.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Although anchor arms <b>370</b> are shown in the figures as having a particular length, the lengths may be greater or smaller than shown. For example, if it is desired that anchor arms <b>370</b> only clip onto native leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, the anchor arms may be relatively short. However, if it is desired that anchor arms <b>370</b> clip onto native leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> and also engage the native annulus for additional stabilization, the anchor arms may be relatively long. Still further, although anchor arms <b>370</b> are shown as being coupled to apices of two adjacent cells <b>354</b> in the second row <b>354</b><i>b</i>, other attachment positions may be suitable. For example, anchor arms <b>370</b> may be attached to a single cell <b>354</b> in the second row <b>354</b><i>b</i>, for example so that first and second ends <b>370</b><i>a</i>, <b>370</b><i>b </i>are positioned within a cell on either side of the apex. Further, anchor arms <b>370</b> may be attached to any desired portions of stent <b>350</b> in any suitable fashion. And while anchor arms <b>370</b> are shown as generally symmetrical, this is not necessary. For example, in some embodiments, different anchor arms <b>370</b> may have different lengths, may be attached at different locations (e.g. attached to cells in different rows), and may have unequal spacing around the perimeter of the stent.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates one type of stabilization feature in the form of anchor arms <b>370</b>, a second type of stabilization feature, in the form of flange <b>380</b>, is omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> but illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-C</figref>. Generally, flange <b>380</b>, which may also be referred to as an atrial flare, is intended to be positioned in right atrium <b>112</b> adjacent the annulus of native tricuspid valve <b>140</b>, with the size and shape of the flange helping to prevent migration of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> into right ventricle <b>114</b> and to further assist in providing a seal against the annulus. Flange <b>380</b> may be formed of a material braided to create various shapes and/or geometries to engage tissue. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates flange <b>380</b> attached to a portion of stent <b>350</b> in an intermediate stage of manufacture of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b>, with valve assembly <b>360</b>, anchor arms <b>370</b>, and any coverings, such as cuffs or tissue layers, omitted for purposes of clarity. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-C</figref> and <b>5</b>A, flange <b>380</b> includes a plurality of braided strands or wires <b>386</b> arranged in three dimensional shapes. In one example, wires <b>386</b> form a braided metal fabric that is resilient, collapsible and capable of heat treatment to substantially set a desired shape. One class of materials which meets these qualifications is shape-memory alloys, such as nitinol. Wires <b>386</b> may comprise various materials other than nitinol that have elastic and/or shape memory properties, such as spring stainless steel, tradenamed alloys such as Elgiloy&#xae; and Hastelloy, CoCrNi alloys (e.g., tradename Phynox), MP35N&#xae;, CoCrMo alloys, or a mixture of metal and polymer fibers. Depending on the individual material selected, the strand diameter, number of strands, and pitch may be altered to achieve the desired shape and properties of flange <b>380</b>. In the expanded condition of flange <b>380</b>, the porosity of the braided fabric is preferably such as to not interfere with the flow of blood through prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> when the leaflets <b>362</b> thereof are in the open position.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Flange <b>380</b> may include a plurality of groups of individual wires <b>386</b> that are bunched together at regular intervals around stent <b>350</b> to attach the flange to the stent. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, groups of individual wires <b>386</b> are attached to portions of stent <b>350</b> where a first cell <b>354</b> in the first row of cells <b>354</b><i>a </i>joins a circumferentially adjacent cell in the first row of cells. Thus, in some examples, the number of bunches of individual wires <b>386</b> coupling flange <b>380</b> to stent <b>350</b> is equal to the number of cells <b>354</b> in the first circumferential row of cells <b>354</b><i>a</i>, although this one-to-one relationship is not a requirement. The individual wires <b>386</b> in a particular group or bunch may be coupled together via a coupling tube <b>388</b> or other structure that is also attached to stent <b>350</b>. Although the groups of individual wires <b>386</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> as being coupled between adjacent cells <b>354</b> in the first row of cells <b>354</b><i>a</i>, it should be understood that the groups of individual wires may instead be attached to other portions of stent <b>350</b>, for example between adjacent cells in the second row of cells <b>354</b><i>b</i>, or to any desired apices of the cells. Flange <b>380</b> may additionally or alternatively be coupled to stent <b>350</b> by sutures, ultrasonic welds, glue, adhesives, or other suitable means. Examples of coupling tubes <b>388</b> and other suitable structures for coupling flange <b>380</b> to stent <b>350</b> are described in greater detail in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/745,528, titled &#x201c;Braid Connections for Prosthetic Heart Valves&#x201d; and filed on Oct. 15, 2018, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Flange <b>380</b> may extend around the outside of stent <b>350</b> from the points at which the flange is connected to the stent to inflow end <b>310</b> of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b>. The shape of flange <b>380</b> in an unconstrained condition may be generally disc-shaped or cylindrical, although other shapes including toroid-shaped, trumpet-shaped, elliptical, conical, and/or frustoconical may be suitable. Flange <b>380</b> may be preset to take the desired shape in the absence of applied forces. As with stent <b>350</b>, flange <b>380</b> may be collapsed to a decreased profile to facilitate minimally invasive delivery. For example, prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> may be transitioned from an expanded condition to a collapsed condition and maintained in the collapsed condition by a surrounding sheath of a delivery device. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, flange <b>380</b> may collapse radially inwardly and become substantially cylindrical and/or significantly less flared than in the expanded condition. In the collapsed condition, flange <b>380</b> extends away from outflow end <b>312</b>, so that much, most, or all of the flange does not radially overlap with stent <b>350</b>, reducing the radial profile of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> when it is collapsed. It should be noted that, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> is illustrated with the tips <b>370</b><i>e </i>of anchor arms <b>370</b> pointing toward inflow end <b>310</b> in the collapsed condition, which, as noted above, is an alternative to the collapsed condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>. The individual bunches of wires <b>386</b> of flange <b>380</b> may extend at an angle from stent <b>350</b> based at least in part by the angle at which coupling tubes <b>388</b> extend from the stent. The angle of each bunch of wires <b>386</b> may be substantially the same which my assist in forming a generally circular flange <b>380</b>. However, in some embodiments, it may be preferable for flange <b>380</b> to have a substantially oval shape in the expanded condition. One way to achieve such an oval shape for flange <b>380</b> is by providing different angles of coupling tubes <b>388</b> around the perimeter of the stent to create an oval shape. Exemplary angles for coupling tubes <b>380</b> may include, for example, about 30 degrees, about 45 degrees, or about 60 degrees relative to stent <b>350</b>, although other angles may be suitable.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates flange <b>380</b> without any additional materials covering or otherwise incorporated into the flange. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-C</figref>, one or more surfaces of flange <b>380</b> may be covered by material(s), such as tissue and/or fabric, including any of the materials described above as being suitable for leaflets <b>362</b> and/or cuff <b>364</b>. For example, the surface of flange <b>380</b> intended to contact the annulus of native tricuspid valve <b>140</b> may be partially or completely covered with tissue and/or fabric, which may help prevent PV leak and/or facilitate tissue ingrowth to further secure prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> after implantation. In other embodiments, similar layers of material may be provided on the surface of flange <b>380</b> opposite the surface intended to contact the annulus of native tricuspid valve <b>140</b>. Still further, layers of tissue and/or fabric may be provided on both surfaces of flange <b>380</b>. Alternatively or additionally, tissue and/or fabric layers may be provided between the opposing surfaces of flange <b>380</b>, particularly when the flange is folded over itself so that an interior space is provided between the opposing surfaces of the flange.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-C</figref> also illustrate a third type of stabilization feature in the form of cleats or barbs <b>390</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, barbs <b>390</b> are positioned at discrete locations in the circumferential direction around the outer perimeter of stent <b>350</b>, the barbs including sharp tips that point radially outwardly from the longitudinal center of the stent. Barbs <b>390</b> may extend radially outwardly from stent <b>350</b> a short distance compared to the distance which flange <b>380</b> extends radially outwardly from the stent. If included, barbs <b>390</b> may function to pierce or otherwise engage native tissue at or near the annulus of native tricuspid valve <b>140</b>, further stabilizing prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> upon implantation. Because stent <b>350</b> is already intended to be in close contact with the annulus of native tricuspid valve <b>140</b>, barbs <b>390</b> need not be long in order to effectively engage the native tissue. In some embodiments, barbs <b>390</b> are formed integrally with the stent, although in other embodiments the barbs could be formed separately and attached to the stent. Barbs <b>390</b> may be provided in any desired position and in any desired number on stent <b>350</b>. For example, one or more barbs <b>390</b> may be provided for each cell <b>354</b> in the first row of cells <b>354</b><i>a</i>, including at positions at either or both apices of each cell, or at positions where adjacent cells in the first row of cells join one another. One or more barbs <b>390</b> may also be provided for each cell <b>354</b> in the second row of cells <b>354</b><i>b</i>, including at either or both apices of each cell, or at positions where adjacent cells in the second row of cells join one another. In yet another example, barbs <b>390</b> may be provided on less than each cell <b>354</b> in the first row of cells <b>354</b><i>a </i>and/or the second row of cells <b>354</b><i>b</i>. Barbs <b>390</b> may extend substantially orthogonally to the center longitudinal axis of stent <b>350</b>, or may otherwise be flared or curved in any desired direction. In one example, one or more barbs <b>390</b> may curve between stent <b>350</b> and the sharp tip of the barb in a direction toward inflow end <b>310</b>, since prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> may experience the largest force in the direction of right atrium <b>112</b> when leaflets <b>362</b> coapt with one another and right ventricle <b>114</b> contracts. In addition, if barbs <b>390</b> curve toward inflow end <b>310</b>, the barbs may be able to fold or otherwise readily collapse when prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> is transitioned into the collapsed condition, which may reduce the likelihood of the barbs damaging components of the prosthetic heart valve and/or structures of the delivery device. However, other curvatures may be provided as desired, or omitted entirely. Depending on the particular delivery approach, a curvature of barbs <b>390</b> may be chosen that does not significantly restrict the ability to re-sheath prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> into a delivery device if, upon partial deployment, it is determined that the prosthetic heart valve should be re-collapsed into the delivery device so that the prosthetic heart valve may be repositioned and re-deployed. Still further, although barbs <b>390</b> are shown and described as being integral with or otherwise attached to stent <b>350</b>, barbs may be additionally or alternatively provided on flange <b>380</b>. For example, barbs <b>390</b> may be integrally formed with the braid of flange <b>380</b>, or may be separately attached thereto, particularly on the surface of the flange intended to contact the annulus of native tricuspid valve <b>140</b>. If barbs <b>390</b> are provided on flange <b>380</b>, as with barbs on stent <b>350</b>, they may be provided in any desired number and at any desired locations expected to contact native tissue to provide increased stabilization of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b>. If barbs <b>390</b> are provided on flange <b>380</b>, they may be less stiff than if barbs are provided on stent <b>350</b>, although this is not required. One way to provide barbs <b>390</b> on flange <b>380</b> may be to shape-set, for example by heating, a wire in a general U-shape, and suture the wire to the braid of the flange.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although barbs <b>390</b> are described above as being attached to stent <b>350</b> and/or flange <b>380</b>, it may be preferable instead to provide the barbs on coupling tubes <b>388</b> (or other suitable connectors that couple the flange to the stent), with the sharp end of the barbs pointing radially outwardly from the longitudinal center of the stent, with any desired curvature as described above. In addition, although the barbs <b>390</b> are described as being sharp, which may assist in piercing tissue to provide increased stability, the barbs may alternatively be blunted, with the blunted barbs providing increased friction to provide increased stability. Still further, although the barbs <b>390</b> are generally shown as being symmetrically placed around the perimeter of the prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b>, such symmetry is not necessary. For example, barbs <b>390</b> could be placed or omitted from strategic locations on the prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> depending on what anatomical structures are anticipated to be positioned adjacent those strategic locations. For example, it may be desirable to omit barbs <b>390</b> from locations on the prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> expected to be adjacent coronary arteries.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic longitudinal cross-section of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> in the expanded condition, illustrating the three stabilization features described above, including anchor arms <b>370</b>, flange <b>380</b>, and barbs <b>390</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> additionally illustrates a feature for mitigating PV leak in the form of parachute <b>400</b>. Parachute <b>400</b> is also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-B</figref>. Parachute <b>400</b> may be formed from tissue and/or fabric, including any of the materials described above in connection with leaflets <b>362</b> and/or cuff <b>364</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, parachute <b>400</b> is a substantially rectangular strip of tissue that has a first edge <b>402</b> coupled to the surface of flange <b>380</b> intended to contact the annulus of native tricuspid valve <b>140</b>. First edge <b>402</b> may be coupled along most or all of its length to flange <b>380</b>, for example by a continuous suture line. Parachute <b>400</b> may include a second edge <b>404</b> opposite first edge <b>402</b> that is also coupled to the surface of flange <b>380</b> intended to contact the annulus of native tricuspid valve <b>140</b>. However, second edge <b>404</b> may be coupled to flange <b>380</b> only at spaced locations along its length, for example by individual suture stitches. Preferably, second edge <b>404</b> is coupled to flange <b>380</b> at positions radially inward from first edge <b>402</b>. With this configuration, one or more pockets of space are created between parachute <b>400</b> and adjacent portions of flange <b>380</b> and/or stent <b>350</b>, with openings to those pockets being defined between the intermittent connections of second edge <b>404</b> to flange <b>380</b>, the openings facing the outer surface of stent <b>350</b>. When prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> is implanted and leaflets <b>362</b> are coapted so that the valve is closed, blood flowing in the retrograde direction between the outside of stent <b>350</b> and the native valve annulus may enter the openings to the pocket(s), which may cause parachute <b>400</b> to billow outwardly and create a better seal between prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> and the annulus of native tricuspid valve <b>140</b>, reducing or eliminating PV leak.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Although parachute <b>400</b> is described above as a single piece of rectangular material, other options may be suitable. For example, the material need not be rectangular, need not be a single continuous piece, and could take any shape and/or include any number of individual pieces joined together that allow for the parachute functionality described above. Also, while parachute <b>400</b> is shown as being wrapped around the entire perimeter of stent <b>350</b>, in some embodiments, a single section of parachute or multiple individual sections of parachute may be provided along less than the entire perimeter of the stent, for example in regions particularly susceptible to PV leak. Still further, although parachute <b>400</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-B</figref> and <b>6</b> as being coupled to flange <b>380</b>, the parachute may instead be attached to the exterior surface of stent <b>350</b> near the flange. Parachute <b>400</b> may be attached to stent <b>350</b> in substantially the same way as described above for attachment to flange <b>380</b>, with first edge <b>402</b> continuously or substantially continuously attached to the stent to form a closed side of the parachute, and second edge <b>404</b> attached to the stent only at intermittent locations to define openings into which blood may flow. In yet another embodiment, first edge <b>402</b> of parachute <b>400</b> may be coupled to flange <b>380</b> with second edge <b>404</b> coupled to stent <b>350</b>. In some embodiments, one parachute <b>400</b> may be provided on flange <b>380</b>, with a second parachute provided on the exterior surface of stent <b>350</b>. Still further, it should be understood that the intermittent attachments of second edge <b>404</b> to flange <b>380</b> or stent <b>350</b> may function to stop parachute <b>400</b> from everting by action of retrograde blood flow. However, depending on the specific material used for parachute <b>400</b> and the methods of attachment and relative geometries, the parachute may be able to resist everting even if second edge <b>404</b> is not directly attached to the flange or stent. Although it is noted above that parachute <b>400</b> may be provided on stent <b>350</b> and/or flange <b>380</b>, it should also be understood that more than one parachute may be provided on the stent, and more than one parachute may be provided on the flange. Although additional parachutes <b>400</b> may increase the resistance to PV leak, additional material typically increases the profile of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> in the collapsed condition, and it is generally desirable to limit the size of the profile in the collapsed condition. Still further, it should be understood that, when parachute <b>400</b> is coupled to flange <b>380</b>, an intervening layer of material may be positioned between the parachute and the surface of flange <b>380</b> to which the parachute is coupled, which may provide a better seal if the spacing of the wires <b>386</b> of the flange would otherwise allow blood to flow through the flange. If, on the other hand, parachute <b>400</b> is coupled to stent <b>350</b>, cuff <b>364</b> may serve a similar purpose as the above-mentioned intervening layer of material.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a highly schematic representation of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> implanted into the valve annulus VA of tricuspid valve <b>140</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, upon implantation of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b>, anchor arms <b>370</b> are clipped around the native leaflets of tricuspid valve <b>140</b>. Although two anchors <b>370</b> and two corresponding native leaflets are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, it should be appreciated that a third anchor arm and the third native leaflet are omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Barbs <b>390</b> are also illustrated as piercing into valve annulus VA to better secure prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> within the valve annulus. Flange <b>380</b> is able to closely conform to the tissue surfaces at and adjacent to valve annulus VA at least in part due to the flexibility provided by forming the flange from braided nitinol, although other configurations and other materials may be able to provide similar conformability. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, parachute <b>400</b> is positioned at or adjacent valve annulus VA so that, if blood flows from right ventricle <b>114</b> toward right atrium <b>112</b> between the outer surface of stent <b>350</b> and the inner surface of the valve annulus, that blood will tend to enter the pocket(s) of the parachute and billow the parachute outwardly to reduce or eliminate blood passing into the right atrium from the right ventricle around the outside of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As noted above, prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> is preferably intended for replacement of tricuspid valve <b>140</b>, although it may be effective at replacing native mitral valve <b>130</b>, with or without alterations such as providing two anchor arms to clip over the two mitral valve leaflets instead of three anchor arms to clip over the three tricuspid valve leaflets. However, certain elements of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> also make it particularly suited for replacing tricuspid valve <b>140</b>. For example, although it may not be clear from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which is not drawn to scale, right ventricle <b>114</b> is generally smaller than left ventricle <b>124</b>, at least in part due to the fact that the left ventricle pumps blood to the entire body, whereas the right ventricle pumps blood only to the lungs. As a result, while a mitral valve prosthesis may be able to extend a relatively large distance into left ventricle <b>124</b>, prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> may include features that allow it to extend only a relatively small distance into right ventricle <b>114</b>. For example, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>7</b></figref>, anchor arms <b>370</b> are attached to stent <b>350</b> at outflow end <b>312</b>, so that there is little or no additional structure beyond the point of attachment of the anchor arms to the stent. As a result, when anchor arms <b>370</b> clip over the native leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> of tricuspid valve <b>140</b>, there is little or no additional structure extending beyond the native leaflets into right ventricle <b>114</b>. Another anatomical difference between left ventricle <b>124</b> and right ventricle <b>114</b> is that, typically, there is no native leaflet belly in the right ventricular outflow tract (&#x201c;RVOT&#x201d;), which may make it easier to capture the native leaflets with a prosthetic tricuspid valve compared to the mitral valve. Further, the shape of the RVOT is different than the shape of the left ventricular outflow tract (&#x201c;LVOT&#x201d;). For example, the native pulmonary valve is farther away from the native tricuspid valve, compared to the distance between the native aortic valve and the native mitral valve. As a result, it may be less likely that a prosthetic tricuspid valve will interfere with the pulmonary valve function, compared to the likelihood that a prosthetic mitral valve will interfere with aortic valve function. Still other features of the left heart may need to be taken into account in prosthetic tricuspid valve <b>300</b>. For example, the coronary sinus flows into right atrium <b>112</b>, and prosthetic tricuspid valve <b>300</b> does not obstruct the coronary sinus. Further, there is an atrioventricular (&#x201c;AV&#x201d;) node, sometimes referred to as the triangle of Koch, adjacent the native tricuspid valve. It is preferable that the portion of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> at or adjacent this AV node does not include barbs <b>390</b> or other features that would exert excessive pressure on the AV node, otherwise conduction problems could arise.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Although anchor arms <b>370</b> of prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> are shown and described above as being coupled to outflow end <b>312</b> of stent <b>350</b>, in other embodiments, anchor arms having similar functionality may be coupled to the stent near inflow end <b>310</b>, or to flange <b>380</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> illustrates stent <b>350</b> in the same view as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, with anchor arms <b>370</b>&#x2032; coupled to inflow end <b>310</b> of stent <b>350</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> shows stent <b>350</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> rotated about 90 degrees about the longitudinal axis of the stent. Anchor arms <b>370</b>&#x2032; may each include a first end <b>370</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; coupled or otherwise attached to an apex of a first cell <b>354</b> in the first row of cells <b>354</b><i>a </i>at inflow end <b>310</b>, and a second end <b>370</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; opposite the first end coupled or otherwise attached to an apex of a second cell in the first row of cells at the inflow end, the first and second cells being circumferentially adjacent to each other. The first and second ends <b>370</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;, <b>370</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; may transition to elongated center portions <b>370</b><i>c</i>&#x2032;, <b>370</b><i>d</i>&#x2032;, respectively, that extend toward the outflow end <b>312</b> of stent <b>350</b>. Center portions <b>370</b><i>c</i>&#x2032;, <b>370</b><i>d</i>&#x2032; may hook back and join one another to form a tip <b>370</b><i>e</i>&#x2032; that points toward inflow end <b>310</b>, the tip having a blunted and/or generally circular or oval shape. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, each anchor arm <b>370</b>&#x2032; forms a recess or gap between its tip <b>370</b><i>e</i>&#x2032; and adjacent portions of its center portions <b>370</b><i>c</i>&#x2032;, <b>370</b><i>d</i>&#x2032;, with the recess or gap intended to receive a portion of the native leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> of tricuspid valve <b>140</b> therein.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It should be understood that the features described above with respect to anchor arms <b>370</b> may generally apply with equal force to anchor arms <b>370</b>&#x2032;. For example, anchor arms <b>370</b>&#x2032; may be formed of any of the materials described above for anchor arms <b>370</b>, and may include additional tissue and/or fabric layers similar or identical to those described in connection with anchor arms <b>370</b>. The placement of anchor arms <b>370</b>&#x2032; around the circumference of stent may also be similar or identical to that described in connection with anchor arms <b>370</b>. For example, prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> may include three anchor arms <b>370</b>&#x2032; spaced at equal intervals around the circumference of the stent, with the anchor arms functioning to grasp portions of native leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, preferably at or near their centers, to stabilize the prosthetic heart valve within the annulus of native tricuspid valve <b>140</b>, and further to reduce movement of the native leaflets. Still further, as with anchor arms <b>370</b>, the positioning of anchor arms <b>370</b>&#x2032; is such that, when prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> is implanted and the anchor arms clip over or otherwise grasp native leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, there is little or no structure of the prosthetic heart valve positioned beyond the native leaflets toward right ventricle <b>114</b>. It should be understood that a prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> incorporating anchor arms <b>370</b>&#x2032; may also include one or more of flange <b>380</b>, barbs <b>390</b>, and parachute <b>400</b> described above. Further, although one particular exemplary structure for anchor arms <b>370</b>&#x2032; is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-B</figref>, modifications may be suitable. For example, although the portion of each anchor arm that hooks back toward inflow end <b>310</b> is illustrated as having a length that is small in relation to the remainder of center portions <b>370</b><i>c</i>&#x2032;, <b>370</b><i>d</i>&#x2032;, it should be understood that these portions may in some embodiments extend a greater distance back toward the inflow end. For example, in some embodiments, center portions <b>370</b><i>c</i>&#x2032;, <b>370</b><i>d</i>&#x2032; may extend from inflow end <b>310</b> toward outflow end <b>312</b>, flip or otherwise hook back toward inflow end <b>310</b>, and extend a greater distance than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-B</figref> back toward the inflow end prior to transitioning into tip <b>370</b><i>e</i>&#x2032;. With this alternative option, a larger gap or recess may be provided to receive native leaflets <b>142</b>, <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>. Still further, and as noted above, although anchor arms <b>370</b>&#x2032; are illustrated as coupled to the inflow end <b>310</b> of stent <b>350</b>, if flange <b>380</b> is included in the device, the anchor arms may instead be coupled to the surface of the flange intended to contact the native valve annulus of tricuspid valve <b>140</b>, preferably at a position near the connection between the flange and the stent.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Prosthetic heart valve <b>300</b> is described above as including anchor arms <b>370</b> (or anchor arms <b>370</b>&#x2032;), flange <b>380</b>, barbs <b>390</b>, and parachute <b>400</b>. However, it should be understood that each feature provides one or more particular functions, and any one of those features may be used in any combination with any one or more of the other features.
