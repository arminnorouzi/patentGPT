Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Valves are used in a variety of applications to manage and transmit flows of materials. Valves generally can be placed in an open position that enables fluid flow through a primary flow path and a closed position that reduces or completely shuts off that flow path. However, when transporting a proppant containing fluid (e.g., frac fluid), proppant may enter crevices or affect interfaces of the valve, causing undesirable wear and/or a reduction in the useful life of the valve.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Certain aspects of some embodiments disclosed herein are set forth below. It should be understood that these aspects are presented merely to provide the reader with a brief summary of certain forms the invention might take and that these aspects are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Indeed, the invention may encompass a variety of aspects that may not be set forth below.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to valves for controlling fluid flow. More specifically, some embodiments relate to gate valves for controlling the flow of fracturing fluid in fracturing systems. The gate valves can include seat assemblies configured to retain pressurized lubricant within an interior volume. In some embodiments, the seat assemblies include telescoping seat assemblies responsive to fluid pressure to reinforce sealing. For example, in one embodiment a telescoping seat assembly includes a first seat ring telescopically received by a second seat ring and fluid pressure biases the first seat ring against the gate of a gate valve.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various refinements of the features noted above may exist in relation to various aspects of the present embodiments. Further features may also be incorporated in these various aspects as well. These refinements and additional features may exist individually or in any combination.

Fracing, also referred to as fracturing or fracking, generally entails the injection of a proppant-laden frac fluid into the wellbore to fracture the formation and, in turn, increase the formation's yield. Typically, the frac fluid is injected into the wellbore via a frac tree that is mounted on the wellhead. The wellhead, along with the frac tree, provides access to the formation via a wellbore. Specifically, frac fluid from a frac fluid supply is routed to a goat head mounted to the frac tree. The frac tree has a series of valves, some of which may be gate valves, to control the ingress of frac fluid into the wellhead and, in turn, into the wellbore.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">These gate valves include a flow control element that transitions between open and closed positions to enable or block fluid flow (e.g., frac fluid). For example, the gate valve may control the flow of a proppant-laden fluid (e.g., frac fluid), corrosive fluid, etc. When controlling the flow of proppant-laden fluid, the proppant (e.g., sand, ceramic, etc.) may enter an interior volume of the gate valve, as well as interfaces between the flow control element and valve seats. To mitigate the negative impacts of proppant in the volume, a lubricant can be injected into the volume. The disclosed embodiments include a gate valve with a valve insert system with seats and seals that retain a pressurized lubricant in the interior volume. In operation, the seals, seats, and pressurized lubricant block proppant from entering an interior volume of the gate valve.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a gate valve <b>10</b> in an open position. As illustrated, the gate valve <b>10</b> includes an actuator assembly <b>12</b> that moves a valve stem <b>14</b> coupled to a flow control element <b>16</b>. As the actuator drives the valve stem <b>14</b> along a central axis <b>18</b>, the gate valve <b>10</b> opens and closes. In a closed position, the gate valve <b>10</b> blocks the flow of a fluid (e.g., proppant-containing fluid) with a fluid tight seal, while the open position enables the fluid to flow freely through the gate valve <b>10</b>. Unfortunately, during operation, proppant in a proppant-laden fluid may enter first and second chambers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> (e.g., annular, square, rectangular chambers) of a gate valve interior volume <b>24</b> (shown here as a gate cavity transverse to the flow bore) and enter interfaces <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> between the flow control element <b>16</b> and upstream and downstream seats <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> (e.g., annular metal seats). This can wear the seats and clog the interfaces, making it difficult to move the control element. However, the gate valve <b>10</b> may include a valve insert system <b>34</b> and a pressurized lubricant (e.g., grease) may block the movement of proppant into the first and second chambers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. In operation, lubricant may be pumped into the first and second chambers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> of the interior volume through respective lubrication supply ports <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> (e.g., through grease fittings), pressurizing the lubricant in the first and second chambers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. The pressure of the lubricant in the chambers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> may be controlled during operation and monitored (e.g., via a pressure gauge) in any suitable manner. In some embodiments, a single lubrication port supplies lubricant to the first and second chambers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, the lubricant may be a very viscous lubricant such as grease with a viscosity in excess of 5000 centistokes.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">As illustrated, the gate valve <b>10</b> includes an inlet passage <b>44</b> and an outlet passage <b>46</b> that fluidly couple to the gate valve interior volume <b>24</b> to form the passage <b>42</b>. In operation, fluid (e.g., proppant-containing fluid) may flow along a flow axis <b>43</b> from an upstream component <b>48</b> (e.g., pipe or another valve) to a downstream component <b>50</b> (e.g., pipe or another valve) which transports the fluid into a well during fracing operations. In such an embodiment, the gate valve <b>10</b> may be used in an on/off manner to allow or block flow from the upstream component <b>48</b> through the gate valve <b>10</b> and into the downstream component <b>50</b>. In other embodiments, the gate valve <b>10</b> may be used to regulate (e.g., choke) flow from the upstream component <b>48</b> to the downstream component <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As explained above, the gate valve <b>10</b> includes a valve stem <b>14</b> (e.g., an elongated rod) that couples to the flow control element <b>16</b>. For example, the valve stem <b>14</b> may couple to the flow control element <b>16</b> via threading. However, in other embodiments, the flow control element <b>16</b> may attach to the valve stem <b>14</b> using other connection joints, such as T-slots, pins, lift nuts, bolts, clamps, welds, and so forth. As illustrated, the flow control element <b>16</b> (e.g., gate or slab) includes a port <b>53</b> that selectively allows a fluid through a valve body <b>52</b>, when the flow control element <b>16</b> is in an open position. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the flow control element <b>16</b> is in an open position, so the port <b>53</b> generally aligns with openings <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> within the seat <b>30</b> and the outlet seat <b>32</b>, respectively, to open a passage <b>42</b>. By moving the flow control element <b>16</b> in directions <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> along the central axis <b>18</b>, the port <b>53</b> aligns or misaligns with the openings <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> in the seat <b>30</b> and the outlet seat <b>32</b>, which enables or blocks the flow of the fluid through the valve body <b>52</b> of the gate valve <b>10</b>. It should be appreciated that the gate valve <b>10</b> may be bi-directional, and the terms &#x201c;inlet&#x201d; and &#x201c;outlet&#x201d; are used for ease of reference and do not describe any specific directional limitation of the gate valve <b>10</b>. For example, the seats <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> may be either inlet or outlet seats, respectively.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As described above, the gate valve <b>10</b> includes the actuator assembly <b>12</b>, which opens and closes the gate valve <b>10</b> by moving the flow control element <b>16</b>. The actuator assembly <b>12</b> may include the valve stem <b>14</b>, hand wheel <b>62</b> (e.g., manual actuator), and bearing assembly <b>64</b>. In some embodiments, the actuator assembly <b>12</b> may include a powered drive system, such as a hydraulic or electric drive system, for automatic actuation. As illustrated, the valve stem <b>14</b> extends through an aperture <b>66</b> in a bonnet <b>68</b>. This enables the valve stem <b>14</b> to couple to the hand wheel <b>62</b> (e.g., actuator) and to the flow control element <b>16</b>. More specifically, the hand wheel <b>62</b> couples to portion <b>70</b> of the valve stem <b>14</b>, while a second threaded end portion <b>74</b> threadingly couples to the flow control element <b>16</b>. In operation, an operator opens and closes the gate valve <b>10</b> by rotating the hand wheel <b>62</b> (e.g., manual actuator) or engaging a powered drive system to thread the second threaded end portion <b>74</b> in and out of the flow control element <b>16</b>. For example, as the valve stem <b>14</b> threads into the flow control element <b>16</b>, the gate valve <b>10</b> opens as the flow control element <b>16</b> moves in direction <b>60</b>. Similarly, when the valve stem <b>14</b> threads out of the flow control element <b>16</b>, the gate valve <b>10</b> closes as the flow control element <b>16</b> moves in direction <b>58</b>. The bearing assembly <b>64</b> facilitates rotation of the valve stem <b>14</b> by surrounding and aligning the valve stem <b>14</b> in the aperture <b>66</b>. In some embodiments, the bearing assembly <b>64</b> rests within a counterbore <b>76</b> and surrounds a flange <b>78</b> on the valve stem <b>14</b>.

The seals <b>81</b> couple to the seats <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> and form a seal with the valve body <b>52</b> and with the flow control element <b>16</b>. As illustrated, the seat <b>30</b> may include an upstream inner diameter seal <b>82</b> and an upstream outer diameter seal <b>84</b> that form a seal between the seat <b>30</b> and the valve body <b>52</b>. The seat <b>30</b> may also include a downstream seal <b>86</b> that forms a seal between the seat <b>30</b> and the flow control element <b>16</b>.

In operation, these check valves enable the use of flow line pressure to pressurize the lubricant when the lubricant pressure is lower than flow line pressure. For example, the lubricant in the chambers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> may be periodically cleared to remove lubricant that contains proppant. New lubricant is injected into ports <b>38</b> and/or <b>40</b> and pressurized inside chambers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>.
