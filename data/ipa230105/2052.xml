For instance, helicopters, transport and fast jet aircraft may be provided with various types of ejecting systems for dispensing countermeasure means. Such countermeasure means may comprise radar reflecting aluminized foil, free-fall radio frequency jammers and hot IR decoys to confuse and divert any means that may be targeted towards the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Major parts of the ejecting systems and specifically theft magazines are often enclosed in capsules or cases arranged under the wings, in or under the fuselage of a vehicle. Specifically, the ejecting systems and major parts thereof are fixed mounted in a fixed dispensing direction.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the dispensing operation is used only when the vehicle is exposed for threats. Thus, the dispensing unit may be inactivated during a long period of time. Under such period the countermeasures within the dispenser unit might be exposed to air flow and water or particles in the air flow which may come into the parts of the ejecting system and reach the countermeasures, and as a result damage the countermeasures. Moreover, dispensing units arranged externally contribute to increased aerodynamic drag and increased radar cross section. Further, ejecting systems in the market today are usually loaded with expendables prior to flight and cannot be re-loaded during a flight. Thus, the ejecting system has a limited amount of expendables which may result in that a vehicle is susceptible to threats when said expendables are dispensed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Based on the above, there is in the present art room for improvements in order to have ejecting systems that allow for a compact arrangement in a vehicle, efficient loading of the ejecting systems with expendables (so to prepare a dispensing operation), and a flexible dispensing mechanism that allow for handling of a larger quantity of expendables.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, there is room for ejecting systems in the present art to explore the domain to provide improved ejecting systems that are able to be compactly mounted in a vehicle that can handle a great quantity of magazines with expendables, that are flexible in dispensing and that are efficient in the loading.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Even though some currently known solutions work well in some situations it would be desirable to provide an ejecting system that specifically fulfills requirements relating to efficiency, flexibility and compactness.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is therefore an object of the present disclosure to provide an ejecting system, a vehicle comprising an ejecting system and a method for preparing at least one magazine for a countermeasure operation from an ejecting system to mitigate, alleviate or eliminate one or more of the above-identified deficiencies and disadvantages.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">This object is achieved by means of methods, a vehicle, and an ejecting system as defined in the appended claims <b>1</b>, <b>14</b> and <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure is at least partly based on the insight that by providing an improved ejecting system with focus on loading efficiency, compactness and flexibility, the ejecting systems will be improved in terms of having a better performance (by the flexibility and compactness) and provide enhanced endurance (by being reloadable).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure provides an ejecting system for dispensing countermeasure comprising at least one magazine comprising at least one expendable cartridge, wherein the at least one magazine comprises a transporting rack extending in a first direction.

The connector contact surface may be arranged to contact connector pins so to allow for igniting the expendable cartridges in the magazine and the dispensing surface allows for dispensing the expendable cartridges.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each magazine may comprises a first axis extending along the first direction and a second axis extending in a second direction, wherein said dispensing means comprises a second positioning mechanism configured to, when in said protruding position, rotate said magazine about at least one of the first and the second axis. The first axis may be a transversal axis of said magazine extending transversally along the transporting rack, wherein the second axis may be predominantly perpendicular to the first axis and extending from a dispensing surface to a connector contact surface.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The rotation allows for flexibility in the dispensing direction of the countermeasures. Thus, the dispensing surface may be angled and aimed at any suitable position.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The ejecting system may comprise a hatch, enclosing at least the dispensing means within a storage compartment, the hatch being configured to be open when said dispensing means is in a protruded position and to close when said dispensing means is in an initial position.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The dispensing means may comprise a bracket and a magazine housing adapted to hold said magazine, and wherein the magazine housing is provided with a launch opening (on said dispensing surface), wherein said second positioning mechanism is arranged to rotate the bracket with respect to a first rotational axis, and rotate the magazine housing with respect to a second rotational axis. The first rotational axis may be conjoined with the second axis of said magazine when said dispensing means holds said magazine, and wherein the second rotational axis may be conjoined with said first axis of said magazine when said dispensing means holds said magazine. In other words, the dispensing means may rotate the magazine with 2 degrees of freedom.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The first positioning mechanism may further be arranged to retract the dispensing means to an initial position after a dispensing operation so to allow additional of the plurality of magazines to move from a stored position to a loaded position.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A benefit of this is that it allows for reloading of the dispensing means with additional magazines after a dispensing operation has been performed.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The at least one expandable may comprise expendable countermeasure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The at least one magazine is, when in said storing position, arranged along a common row in a storage compartment extending in said first direction towards said dispensing means (<b>6</b>). Thus, the magazines are in close connection to said dispensing means allowing for a rapid reloading. The magazines may be arranged along several rows,</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The ejecting system may be fully enclosed in a storage compartment (in a body of e.g. a vehicle), wherein said storage compartment comprises a hatch, enclosing at least the dispensing means within said storage compartment, the hatch being configured open in order to allow said dispensing means to move into a protruded position.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A benefit of this is that the hatch allows for the ejecting system to be arranged in a compact manner in e.g. a vehicle. Further, allows the ejecting system to be implemented so to be hidden from an exterior of e.g. the body of a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">There is further provided a vehicle comprising the ejecting system in accordance with the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The said magazines may be provided in a storage compartment inside the body of said vehicle when in said storing position and in said loaded position, and wherein a magazine (loaded in the dispensing means) protrude outwardly from an opening of said body when in said protruded position.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Thus, a large quantity of magazines may be stored in a storage compartment inside the body of said vehicle and be loaded on the dispensing means automatically after each dispensing operation.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The opening may be enclosed by a hatch (or a door means) when in said storing position and in said loaded position, wherein said hatch is opened in said protruded position.
