In a mixed flow turbofan engine, the cool bypass airflow is ducted between a surrounding nacelle and an outer casing of the core engine section and mixed with a hot exhaust stream from the core engine section prior to discharge from the engine nozzle in a combined or mixed exhaust stream. The surrounding nacelle may include a thrust reverser capable of redirecting the mixed exhaust stream from a rearward direction to, at least partially, a forward direction thus producing a rearward thrust that may serve to decelerate forward motion of an aircraft and thereby assist braking the aircraft upon landing. Pivot door thrust reversers may be used with turbofan gas turbine engines for aircraft, including for corporate or business jets. Pre-exit pivot door thrust reversers may generally be characterized as including thrust reverser doors having trailing edges positioned forward of the exit plane of an exhaust duct, while post-exit pivot door thrust reversers may generally be characterized as including thrust reverser doors having trailing edges that form at least a portion of the exit plane of an exhaust duct.</p><heading

While these various embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the disclosure, it should be understood that other embodiments may be realized and that changes may be made without departing from the scope of the disclosure. Thus, the detailed description herein is presented for purposes of illustration only and not of limitation. Furthermore, any reference to singular includes plural embodiments, and any reference to more than one component or step may include a singular embodiment or step. Also, any reference to attached, fixed, connected, or the like may include permanent, removable, temporary, partial, full or any other possible attachment option. Additionally, any reference to without contact (or similar phrases) may also include reduced contact or minimal contact. It should also be understood that unless specifically stated otherwise, references to &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; or &#x201c;the&#x201d; may include one or more than one and that reference to an item in the singular may also include the item in the plural. Further, all ranges may include upper and lower values and all ranges and ratio limits disclosed herein may be combined.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In various embodiments, a thrust reverser, as provided herein, includes an actuation arrangement including a carrier configured to translate along a single, fixed direction with respect to a reverser frame and at least one reverser door configured to move between a stowed position and a deployed position in response to the translation of the carrier with respect to the frame. The carrier may be driven along a track by a linear actuator. The actuation arrangement, as provided herein, may react five degrees of freedom directly into the reverser frame, leaving the linear actuator to react only a single degree of freedom. In this regard, an actuation arrangement as provided herein, may provide for reduced actuator wear.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A thrust reverser, as provided herein, includes a deployable fairing configured to move away from a central axis of the thrust reverser to provide clearance for one or more thrust reverser pivot doors to rotate into a deployed position. The deployable fairing may be actuated via an actuation arrangement dependent on the position of carrier.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A deployable fairing, as provided herein, may comprise a robust design that is not limited by space constraint at the trailing edge. A deployable fairing, as provided herein, may be used with side or center actuation. A deployable fairing, as provided herein, may be used independently of the (hinge line location) type of reverser. A deployable fairing, as provided herein, may provide additional space for the thrust reverser structure, hinges, and pivot doors. A deployable fairing, as provided herein, may provide clean trim lines and unwanted loft protrusions. A deployable fairing, as provided herein, may eliminate large gaps at the trailing edge of the thrust reverser.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">An actuation arrangement, as provided herein, can be tailored to accommodate any reverser door scheduling/timing desired. For example, one door can open faster than the other, or be delayed over the other, or the two doors can open simultaneously at a similar rate. An actuation arrangement, as provided herein, may reduce overall weight of the thrust reverser. Packing of the actuation arrangement, as provided herein, may be simplified since the actuator is not necessarily &#x201c;planar&#x201d; with the pair of links. An actuation arrangement, as provided herein, may be used with a wide variety of door hinge line configurations.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically illustrates a gas turbine engine <b>100</b> of a mixed flow turbofan variety.

As discussed below, thrust reversal is affected by opening the upper reverser door <b>134</b> and the lower reverser door <b>136</b> to direct all or a portion of the mixed exhaust stream <b>120</b> in a direction having an upstream component relative to the central longitudinal axis A of the gas turbine engine <b>100</b>. The momentum of the upstream component of the mixed exhaust stream <b>120</b> exiting the thrust reverser <b>130</b> while in an open or deployed position provides the reverse thrust used to decelerate an aircraft upon landing or during a rejected takeoff.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, a schematic view of a thrust reverser <b>200</b> in a stowed position and a deployed position, respectively, are illustrated, in accordance with various embodiments. The thrust reverser <b>200</b> generally includes an upper reverser door <b>202</b>, a lower reverser door <b>204</b>, a frame <b>206</b>, and an actuation arrangement <b>210</b>. In various embodiments, the frame <b>206</b> includes an annular structure <b>207</b> with a pair of opposing side beams <b>208</b> extending from the annular structure <b>207</b>.

In various embodiments, a second actuation arrangement is mounted to the starboard side beam. The second actuation arrangement may be similar to actuation arrangement <b>210</b> and the two actuation arrangements may be generally symmetric about central axis A. Stated differently, the starboard side actuation arrangement and side beam configuration may be symmetrical with the port side actuation arrangement and side beam configuration described herein. In this regard, although described herein with respect to the port side, it should be understood that the starboard side may comprise a similar arrangement as the port side.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, <b>3</b>A, and <b>3</b>B</figref>, when the thrust reverser <b>200</b> assumes the closed or stowed position, e.g., during flight, the upper reverser door <b>202</b> and the lower reverser door <b>204</b> are rotated to their closed positions (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). The outer surfaces of the upper reverser door <b>202</b> and the lower reverser door <b>204</b> blend with the outer surface of the nacelle, forming a smooth aerodynamic shape of the gas turbine engine. In the same stowed configuration, a mixed exhaust stream <b>120</b> exits the exhaust duct <b>205</b> and is generally unaffected by the thrust reverser <b>200</b> or its componentry, as the inner surfaces of the upper reverser door <b>202</b> and the lower reverser door <b>204</b> are blended with the interior surface of the exhaust duct <b>205</b> to provide a generally smooth and annular exhaust flow path from downstream of the core engine exhaust to a downstream exit plane or aft end of the thrust reverser <b>200</b>. While in the stowed position, the mixed exhaust stream <b>120</b> flows out the exhaust duct <b>205</b>, providing forward thrust necessary to propel the aircraft. When the thrust reverser <b>200</b> assumes the open or deployed position, e.g., upon landing, the upper reverser door <b>202</b> and the lower reverser door <b>204</b> are rotated to their open positions (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). The mixed exhaust stream <b>120</b> is diverted from the exit of the exhaust duct <b>205</b> to form a first stream <b>292</b>, following an inner surface of the upper reverser door <b>202</b> and a second stream <b>294</b>, following an inner surface of the lower reverser door <b>204</b>. Both the first stream <b>292</b> and the second stream <b>294</b> have forward vector components of thrust, which provide the reverse thrust acting on the aircraft.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A central axis A is illustrated extending through the thrust reverser <b>200</b>. The central axis A may define a fore end or fore direction (negative Z-direction) of the thrust reverser <b>200</b> and an aft end or aft direction (positive Z-direction) of the thrust reverser <b>200</b>. Various embodiments of the disclosure may be described in relation to the central axis A. For example, the upper reverser door <b>202</b> may be considered positioned above the central axis A while the lower reverser door <b>204</b> may be considered positioned below the central axis A. Similarly, the port side beam <b>209</b> may be considered positioned to the port or left side of the central axis A (looking in the fore direction (negative Z-direction)) while the starboard side beam may be considered positioned to the right or starboard side of the central axis A (looking in the fore direction). More generally, reference to a first reverser door may broadly refer to a reverser door positioned opposite a second reverser door with respect to the central axis A, there being no preferred up or down or side to side orientation, while reference to a first side beam may broadly refer to a side beam positioned opposite a second side beam with respect to the central axis A.
