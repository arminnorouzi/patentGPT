FlexO includes a specific frame structure, which is the same as the 400ZR frame as defined in OIF-400ZR-1.0, Mar. 10, 2020, the contents of which are incorporated by reference. OpenROADM also includes a similar frame structure and OpenROADM is defined in the OpenROADM MSA ver. 4.0, Dec. 7, 2020, the contents of which are incorporated by reference. As described herein, ZR is used to include the 400ZR, ZR+, OpenROADM, etc. specifications. That is, there are various coherent interface specifications being issued and worked on and all of them are contemplated herein.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">FlexO is evolving and ITU-T is in the process of discussing new applications. One such application involves capability for a FlexO regenerator, a FlexO extender, a FlexO multiplexer, and/or a FlexO transponder. The implications of such new applications are that the FlexO signal rate must be preserved and asynchronous to the coherent line interface. Various different types of line interfaces (e.g., proprietary, standard Open Forward Error Correction (OFEC), etc.) can be considered.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To preserve the FlexO signal rate, existing solutions include:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Mapping data into a new frame structure (e.g., Generic Mapping Protocol (GMP)), which includes a new set of overhead, with some overhead fields used to identify the location of the idle/stuffing data.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Wrapping data into a packet or cell structure, where each packet or cell is either active payload data or idle/stuffing data, and each packet or cell contains overhead identifying which.

The FlexO asynchronous adaptation application <b>10</b> includes mapping a FlexO-x-RS-m interface group via a FlexO-x group transponder <b>20</b> to a FlexO-x-DO-m interface group. The FlexO asynchronous adaptation application <b>10</b> is a multiplexing application. The FlexO asynchronous adaptation application <b>12</b> similarly includes mapping a FlexO-x-DO-m interface group via a FlexO-x group 3R regenerator <b>22</b> to a FlexO-x-DO-m interface group which is interfaced to a FlexO-x-DO-m.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0025">Variously, these FlexO asynchronous adaptation applications <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> provide a mechanism for FlexO to FlexO signal mapping and it needs to be transparent. The present disclosure includes a process of performing asynchronous FlexO/ZR adaptation, where idle/stuffing data is added using various techniques to adapt a lower rate FlexO/ZR signal to match the rate of a (slightly) higher rate interface, e.g., FlexO-x-RS-m interface group (lower rate) to FlexO-x-DO-m interface group (higher rate). The process centers around the identification of the idle/stuffing data to allow data recovery by a receiver.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0026">The process can be used to rate adapt a FlexO/ZR signal into a FEC wrapper, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The process can similarly be used to rate adapt a FlexO/ZR signal into a probabilistic shaping algorithm and proprietary FEC, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The disclosed process provides an asynchronous adaptation of what ITU-T calls the FEC adaptation function as circled in the functional diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0027">Conventional approaches, such as a sigma-delta distribution of the idle/stuffing data, provide ways of identifying whether or not the data is idle/stuffing data at a particular distance from boundary (such as frame boundary). But this traditionally operates over a fixed length of data, and conventional approaches add their own frame structure and overhead to make the post-stuffing frame a fixed duration.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram of a FlexO-x frame <b>50</b> with idle words <b>52</b> included therein. The asynchronous adaptation process is described herein using a FlexO/ZR frame. Of course, it could be applied to other type of frame/TDM structures. The asynchronous adaptation process requires no overhead to be added because it uses the existing frame boundary (modified by the amount of idle data/stuffing sent) and sends information by repurposing existing overhead. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the frame size is variable based on amount of stuffing injected.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0029">The asynchronous adaptation process uses an existing frame marker (based on FlexO/ZR frame), which means no addition of overhead is necessary. However, complications arise when using an existing marker because the idle//stuffing data added, the quantity of which will vary from frame to frame, changes the amount of data between frame boundaries. The sigma-delta distribution and the receiver's framer expect a fixed duration to the next frame boundary.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0030">The present disclosure resolves these issues by sending the information about the number of idles/stuffing added a frame in advance and uses this information at the receiver to dynamically adjust the length of data over which the sigma-delta distribution and framer act on a frame-by-frame basis. This data is sent by being aware of the protocol whose rate is being adapted and repurposing its existing overhead. Reserved or other unused fields or may be used to send this information. There are various reserved locations in the FlexO/ZR frame that could be used for such purpose, but it is preferred to be before the encryption processes since the information must be cleartext for the framing algorithms as described above. It also must not be possible to insert idle/stuffing data must between the frame pattern and the information sent about the amount of idle data added to this frame period, otherwise the receiver does not know where to look for that key information. This means re-purposing some of the AM of the FlexO frame is ideal.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a diagram of a FlexO-x frame <b>50</b> with a stuff indicator/timing value included therein in the AM. Note that the information about the number of idles/stuffing added can also be used as distinct timing information.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0032">Error correction could be performed on the sigma-delta information sent, such as by sending that data multiple times (e.g., 3 times) and performing a majority vote. This will be highly desired for robust communication because a corruption in the information sent will cause significant errors on recovery (loss of frame and corruption of extracted data).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart of an asynchronous adaptation process <b>100</b>. The asynchronous adaptation process <b>100</b> can implemented as a method and via circuitry.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0034">The asynchronous adaptation process <b>100</b> includes receiving a first plurality of frames of a first interface group at a first rate (step S<b>1</b>), determining idle/stuffing data to be added in each of the first plurality of frames based on a second rate associated with a second plurality of frames of a second interface group (step S<b>2</b>), adding information about the idle/stuffing data in each frame of the first plurality of frames in a preceding frame (step S<b>3</b>), and transmitting the second plurality of frames of the second interface group with the idle/stuffing data included therein, wherein the second plurality of frames includes the first plurality of frames with the idle/stuffing data (step S<b>4</b>). As described herein, a preceding frame means any previous frame including the most recent frame. If the second interface group has m&#x3e;1, i.e., multiple interfaces, then the preceding frame is in frames of the same interface group member.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0035">The first interface group can be a FlexO-x-RS-m interface group and the second interface group can be a FlexO-x-DO-m interface group. The first interface group can be a FlexO-x-DO-m interface group and the second interface group can be another FlexO-x-DO-m interface group.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0036">The idle/stuffing data can be added/distributed based on a sigma delta function. An amount of the idle/stuffing data can be different in each frame of the first plurality of frames. The receiving end can adjust the sigma-delta calculation period and the framer's expected frame period dynamically on a frame-by-frame basis based on the received information. The second rate is slightly larger than the first rate.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0037">The information can be added in overhead of the second interface group. The information can be added in Alignment Marker (AM) overhead of the second interface group. The information can be added in multiple locations for a receiver to perform a majority vote.
