In particular, the present disclosure relates to a guide for assisting with stabbing pin ends of tubulars into box ends of tubulars. Still more particularly, the present disclosure relates to a passive guide for assisting robotic equipment with stabbing pin ends of drill pipe into box ends of drill pipe.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventor, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many pipe handling operations, such as drill pipe handling operations, are conventionally performed with workers performing manual operations. For example, drilling of wells involves tripping of the drill string, during which drill pipes are lowered into (tripping in) or pulled out of (tripping out) a well. Tripping may typically occur in order to change all or a portion of the bottom hole assembly, such as to change a drill bit. Where drill pipe is tripped into a well, stands or lengths of drill pipe may be supplied from a storage position in a setback area of the drill rig and connected end-to-end to lengthen the drill string in the well. Prior to tripping and/or during tripping, lengths of drill pipe may also be connected end-to-end to create pipe stands. Where drill pipe is tripped out of a well, stands or lengths of drill pipe may be disconnected from the drill string and may be positioned in the setback area.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As with other pipe handling operations, tripping and, thus, the connection of stands end-to-end has conventionally been performed with human operators that manually place a stabbing guide. In particular, while hoisting equipment may be used to carry the load of a stand of drill pipe during trip in and trip out operations, human operators may typically maneuver the drill pipe stands around the drill floor, such as between the well center and the setback area. For example, a first human operator may be positioned on the drill floor, at or near the well, to maneuver a lower end of drill pipe stands as they are tripped into or out of the well, while a second human operator may be positioned on or above the racking board to maneuver an upper end of drill pipe stands as the stands are moved between the well and the setback area. Operators often use ropes and/or other tools to maneuver the drill pipe stands on or above the drill floor. The operators may also use a clam shell type guide for helping to guide pin ends of drill pipe into box ends of drill pipe. This guide can help with the alignment of the pipes. The guide may be manually moved into place on a top of a drill string by the deckhands. With the guide in place, a top drive elevator may, for example, lift a pipe stand into position above the drill string and stab the pin end of the pipe stand into the box end of the upper most pipe in the drill string relying on the guide to position the pin end of the pipe stand. Once the pin end of the upper pipe is stabbed into the box end of the lower pipe and the upper pipe is spun into the lower pipe, the operator may actuate a lever, for example, to open the clamshell guide and remove it from the connected pipes. Such work is labor-intensive and can be dangerous. Moreover, trip in and trip out operations may be limited by the speed at which the human operators can maneuver the stands between well center and the setback area.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Robotic pipe handling systems may be used to handle pipe to assist with and/or perform the above pipe handling operations on a drill rig. The robots may include a series of links that are hingedly and/or pivotally connected to one another and perform a multitude of operations using selectable tools referred to as end effectors. While helpful to have a robot to assist with pipe handling, the detailed lever actuation on current pipe stabbing guides may be difficult for a robot to perform. Moreover, electrical, hydraulic, or other power may not be desirable to aid in opening/closing a stabbing guide. That is, while a robot may have power for moving the robot, particular actuation power for opening and closing a tool being used by the robot may not be present or desirable in the robotic drilling environment or in other environments.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following presents a simplified summary of one or more embodiments of the present disclosure in order to provide a basic understanding of such embodiments. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated embodiments and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all embodiments, nor delineate the scope of any or all embodiments.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one or more embodiments, a guide mechanism may include a first jaw and a second jaw pivotably coupled to the first jaw. The first and second jaws may form a guide having a bottom pocket adapted for seating arrangement of the guide on a box end of a first tubular and a top funnel configured for laterally guiding a pin end of a second tubular into the box end. The guide mechanism may also include a linkage system secured to the first and second jaws and adapted to control pivoting motion of the jaws. The guide mechanism may also include a bias mechanism coupled to the linkage system and configured to impart a biasing force on the first jaw and the second jaw via the linkage system. The biasing force may be adapted to resist opening of the jaws such that opening of the jaws occurs when a lateral force is applied to the guide mechanism that overcomes the biasing force.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one or more embodiments, a guide mechanism may include a first jaw and a second jaw pivotally coupled to the first jaw at a pivot point and forming a tubular connection guide. The guide mechanism may also include a pair of main links pivotally coupled to one another at a central location outside the first and second jaw and proximate the pivot point. The pair of main links may extend away from the central location and along respective first and second jaws to respective free ends. The free ends may be pivotally coupled to the first jaw and the second jaw, respectively, at first and second outer pivot points. The guide mechanism may also include a biasing mechanism resistant to compression and arranged between the first and second outer pivot points.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one or more embodiments, a method of guiding a tubular connection may include placing a guide on a box end of a first tubular and seating the box end in a bottom pocket of the guide. The method may also include suspending a second tubular above the first tubular and lowering a pin end toward the box end. The method may also include guiding the pin end with the guide into the box end and pulling the guide laterally off of the first and second tubular, wherein pulling of the guide in a lateral direction opens the guide. As the stabbing guide clears the tubulars, it may close based on a biasing force so as to prepare for a next placement.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">While multiple embodiments are disclosed, still other embodiments of the present disclosure will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, which shows and describes illustrative embodiments of the invention. As will be realized, the various embodiments of the present disclosure are capable of modifications in various obvious aspects, all without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. Accordingly, the drawings and detailed description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">While the specification concludes with claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter that is regarded as forming the various embodiments of the present disclosure, it is believed that the invention will be better understood from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying Figures, in which:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an elevation view of a drill rig having a robotic system and a passive tubular connection guide, according to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of a passive tubular connection guide with a passive rotation disconnect for selectively securing the guide to a robotic arm, according to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of a passive tubular connection guide, according to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a top view thereof.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a top view thereof with the guide in an open condition.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a rear view thereof.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a side view thereof.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view of a bracket and a liner portion, according to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a transparent view of a liner portion, according to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a breakaway view of a core within a liner, according to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a front side perspective view of a linkage system, according to one or more embodiments, where the semicircular plates of the brackets have been omitted for clarity.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a back side perspective view of a linkage system, according to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a top view of the linkage system in a closed condition, according to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a top view of the linkage system in an open condition, according to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the linkage system, according to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref> is a perspective view of the passive tubing guide in place on a pipe string poised to receive a pipe or pipe stand, according to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B</figref> is a perspective view of the passive tubing guide in place on a pipe string and receiving the pipe or pipe stand, according to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>C</figref> is a perspective view of the passive tubing guide in a partially removed state, according to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>D</figref> is a perspective view of the passive tubing guide in a fully removed state, according to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a diagram depicting a method of use of the passive tubular connection guide, according to one or more embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present disclosure, in one or more embodiments, relates to devices, systems, and methods for guiding the connection of tubulars. In particular, a passive tubular connection guide may be provided that is particularly adapted for use without a power source to open and close the guide. For example, the passive tubular connection guide may be used without compressed air, hydraulic power, electric power, or other power source for opening and closing the guide. Rather, a robot, user, tool arm, or other manipulating device or system may operate the guide in a manner that allows for opening and closing of the guide simply by motion of the guide relative to the tubulars. In the context of well drilling, this approach to a tubular connection guide may obviate the need for hydraulic lines, electrical lines, air lines, or other power-providing cords that may otherwise be draped across the drill floor, not to mention obviating the need for a hydraulic pump, generator, compressor, or other energy source.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an elevation view of a drill rig <b>50</b> having a robotic system and a passive tubular connection guide <b>100</b>, according to one or more embodiments. As shown, the drill rig <b>50</b> may include a support structure <b>52</b> supporting a drill floor <b>54</b> and a mast <b>56</b>. The drill rig <b>50</b> may include a racking board <b>58</b> extending laterally from the mast <b>56</b> and robotic handlers <b>64</b><i>a/b </i>may be arranged on the drill floor <b>54</b> and the racking board <b>58</b>. The drill rig <b>50</b> may include a top drive <b>60</b> with a pipe elevator <b>62</b>. As described in more detail below, the top drive <b>60</b>, top drive elevator <b>62</b> and the robotic handlers <b>64</b><i>a/b </i>may operate in a coordinated tripping process to trip drill pipe or other tubulars <b>66</b> into and out of a well bore. In one or more embodiments, the robotic handlers <b>64</b><i>a/b </i>may rely on interchangeable tools that may be selectively secured to the ends of the robotic arms to allow the robotic handlers <b>64</b><i>a/b </i>to perform particular operations in the process.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, for example, a passive tubular connection guide <b>100</b> may be bolted or otherwise secured to a tool portion <b>68</b> of a remote connection interface <b>74</b> such as a passive rotation disconnect and may be stationed in a saddle or other holder <b>70</b>. The robotic handler <b>64</b><i>a </i>may have a proximal portion <b>72</b> of the remote connection interface <b>74</b> secured thereto. The robotic handler <b>64</b><i>a </i>may use the remote connection interface <b>74</b> to selectively pick up or set down the passive tubular connection guide <b>100</b>. Operation of the remote connection interface <b>74</b> and the guide <b>100</b> may be performed without the need for external power extending to them. One example of a remote connection interface <b>74</b> may be a passive rotation disconnect and may be the same or similar to the device described in International Patent Application PCT/US2021/070488 entitled Passive Rotation Disconnect and filed on Apr. 30, 2021, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As discussed in more detail below, the robotic handler <b>64</b><i>a </i>may use the passive tubular connection guide <b>100</b> to assist with tripping operations by guiding a free end of a suspended tubular into a box end of a drill string extending into a well bore. While the passive tubular connection guide <b>100</b> has been described as being used by a robotic system, this discussion is simply for purposes of providing one example use of the passive tubular connection guide <b>100</b> and nothing in the present application shall foreclose other uses of the passive tubular connection guide <b>100</b> including manual use. Moreover, while the passive tubular connection guide <b>100</b> has been discussed in the context of drilling tubulars, the passive tubular connection guide <b>100</b> may be used in other contexts as well where, for example, end-to-end connection of tubulars is being performed.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of a passive tubular connection guide <b>100</b>, according to one or more embodiments.

The brackets <b>110</b> may also have a linkage interface <b>172</b> which is discussed in more detail below in conjunction with the linkage system <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the liner portion <b>108</b> of each jaw <b>102</b> is shown. The liner portion <b>108</b> may be configured for physically interacting, together with a corresponding liner portion <b>108</b>, with a box end <b>76</b> and a pin end <b>78</b> of a set of tubulars that are to be joined and for guiding the pin end <b>78</b> into the box end <b>76</b>. As shown, the liner portion <b>108</b> may include a substantially thick and semi-circular body portion <b>126</b> having an outer surface <b>128</b> adapted for engagement by a respective bracket <b>110</b>. That is, for example, the outer surface <b>128</b> may be a substantially radiused surface having a radius <b>130</b> the same or similar to the radius <b>114</b> of the inside surface of the bracket <b>110</b>. The outer surface <b>128</b> may have a height <b>132</b> extending between a bottom edge <b>134</b> and a top edge <b>136</b>. The liner portion <b>108</b> may include a bottom semi annular surface <b>138</b> having an outer edge coinciding with the bottom edge <b>134</b> of the outer surface and defined by the radius <b>130</b> of the outer surface <b>128</b>. The bottom semi annular surface <b>138</b> may also have an inner edge <b>140</b> defined by a radius <b>142</b> substantially smaller than the radius <b>130</b> of the outer surface <b>128</b>, thus, defining a substantially thick wall of the body portion <b>126</b>. The radius <b>142</b> of the inner edge <b>140</b> may be selected to be slightly larger, but similar in size to an outer radius of a box end <b>76</b> of a selected size of drill pipe or other tubular <b>66</b>. An inner semi cylindrical wall <b>144</b> may extend upward from the inner edge <b>140</b> defining one half of a bore or bottom pocket extending upward from the bottom surface <b>138</b> and into the body portion <b>126</b>. When placed adjacent another same or similar liner portion <b>108</b>, the two may form the full bore or bottom pocket on a bottom side of the guide <b>100</b>. In one or more embodiments, the inner semi cylindrical wall <b>144</b> may extend upward from the bottom a distance ranging between approximately &#x2153; and &#x215e; of the height <b>132</b> of the body portion <b>126</b> or between approximately &#xbd; and &#xbe; of the height <b>132</b> of the body portion <b>126</b>, or approximately &#x2154; of the height <b>132</b> of the body portion <b>126</b>. A lip, catch, rib, or other protrusion <b>146</b> may be provided at the top of the inner semi cylindrical wall <b>144</b>, which may function to allow the guide <b>100</b> to rest on a box end <b>76</b> of a tubular <b>66</b>. The protrusion <b>146</b> may extend radially inward relative to the semi cylindrical wall <b>144</b> forming an annular stop surface <b>148</b>. The annular stop surface <b>148</b> may have an inner edge <b>150</b> defined by a radius <b>152</b>. The radius <b>152</b> may be selected to be smaller than the radius <b>142</b> of the inner semi-cylindrical wall <b>144</b>, but larger than a pin end <b>78</b> of a tubular <b>66</b> such that the pin end <b>78</b> may pass through the guide <b>100</b> and into a box end <b>76</b> of a lower tubular <b>66</b>. The inner edge <b>150</b> of the annular stop surface <b>148</b> may give way to a chamfered edge <b>154</b> in the form of a semi cylindrical inner ribbon with a radius the same as the inner edge <b>150</b> of the annular stop surface <b>148</b> and extending a short distance upward from the annular stop surface <b>148</b> to a relief edge <b>156</b>. The remaining height of the inner portion of the body portion <b>126</b> may include a diverging surface <b>158</b> that extends upward from the relief edge <b>156</b> at an angle to meet the top edge <b>136</b> of the outer surface <b>128</b> at a semi-circular edge that forms a semi peripheral point around the top of the liner portion <b>108</b>. When placed adjacent another liner portion <b>108</b> with a same or similar shape, the diverging surfaces <b>158</b> of the two liner portions <b>108</b> may form a conical or funnel shaped guide for physically guiding a pin end <b>78</b> of the tubular <b>66</b> to the center of the guide <b>100</b> and into a box end <b>76</b> of a lower tubular <b>66</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In one or more embodiments as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the liner portion <b>108</b> may be reinforced with an internal core <b>160</b>. The internal core <b>160</b> may be molded within the liner portion <b>108</b> to stiffen or reinforce the liner portion <b>108</b>. As shown, the internal core <b>160</b> may include a semi-circular plate similar to the bracket <b>110</b>, but having smaller radii such that the internal core <b>160</b> fits within the liner portion <b>108</b>. In one or more embodiments, the liner portion may be injection molded, overmolded, or otherwise formed around the internal core <b>160</b>. As shown, the internal core <b>160</b> may include a hinge component <b>162</b> or other pivoting component on one end thereof that is arranged to extend out of one side of the liner portion <b>108</b> so as to engage a hinge component <b>162</b> or other pivoting component on an opposing inner core <b>160</b>. The hinge component <b>162</b> on each of two adjacent internal cores <b>160</b> may be secured to one another with a hinge pin to create the pivot mechanism <b>104</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) for the two liner portions <b>108</b> and to establish a pivot axis about which the two liner portions <b>108</b> may pivot between an open condition (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) and a closed condition (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). The internal core <b>160</b> may also provide for a strong internal structure for attaching the brackets <b>110</b> to the liner portions <b>108</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, bolts or other fasteners <b>164</b> may extend from outside the bracket <b>110</b>, through the bracket, into the liner portion <b>108</b> and threadingly engage bores in the core plate <b>160</b> so as to pull or press the bracket against the liner portion <b>108</b>. In one or more embodiments, pipe doping brackets <b>166</b> may be included as part of this connection.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">With the jaws <b>102</b> described, the linkage system <b>106</b> that controls or manages the opening and closing operation of the jaws <b>102</b> may be described. That is, the linkage system <b>106</b> may be adapted to maintain the jaws <b>102</b> in a closed condition unless/until a sufficient radial force acting radially and/or generally parallel to a the joint <b>124</b> between the free ends of the jaws <b>102</b> is sufficient to overcome a biasing closing force. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>15</b></figref>, the linkage system <b>106</b> may include a central bracket <b>168</b>, a pair of main links <b>170</b>, a biasing mechanism <b>174</b>, and a detent mechanism <b>176</b>. As mentioned above, the brackets <b>110</b> may include a linkage interface <b>172</b> for interfacing with the linkage system. Each of these parts may be taken in turn. It is noted that the semicircular plate portions of the brackets <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> have been omitted to allow for better viewing of the linkage system <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The central bracket <b>168</b> may be adapted to provide a grasping or mounting location for a user. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the central bracket <b>168</b> may include a back plate <b>178</b> with a bolt pattern adapted for securing the guide <b>100</b> to a remote connection interface <b>74</b>, directly to a robot arm, directly to a tool arm, or for securing another operable element. In one or more embodiments, a handle or other gripping device may be provided extending from the back plate <b>178</b>. The central bracket <b>168</b> may also be configured to provide a common location for securing the pair of main links <b>170</b> such that operation of the links <b>170</b> is relative to one another and relative to the central bracket <b>168</b>. As shown, the central bracket <b>168</b> may include a top bracket plate <b>180</b> and a bottom bracket plate <b>182</b> each extending toward the jaws <b>102</b> from the back plate <b>178</b> (e.g., opposite the back plate connection to a tool arm or remote connection interface). The top and bottom bracket plates <b>180</b>/<b>182</b> may be adapted for securing the pair of main links <b>170</b> to the central bracket <b>168</b>. As shown, a base end of each link <b>170</b> may be placed between the top and bottom brackets <b>180</b>/<b>182</b> and a bolt, pin, or other elongate element <b>171</b> may be arranged through the top and bottom brackets <b>180</b>/<b>182</b> and through the base end of each respective link <b>170</b>. The elongate elements <b>171</b> may be substantially adjacent one another and may establish pivot axes for the main links <b>170</b>. The pivot axes may extend parallel to one another such that pivoting motion of the main links <b>170</b> is parallel to one another and since the main links <b>170</b> are arranged between shared top and bottom brackets <b>180</b>/<b>182</b>, the pivoting motion of the pivot links <b>170</b> may also be in a same plane.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The pair of main links <b>170</b> may extend from their pivoting connection to the central bracket <b>168</b> generally laterally and in opposite directions along respective brackets <b>110</b>. The pair of main links <b>170</b> may be configured to pivot relative to the central bracket <b>168</b> between a relatively flat configuration where each link is extending in substantially opposite directions and a more v-shaped configuration where each link <b>170</b> is extending partially in opposite directions but also in a direction toward the liner <b>108</b>. In the former condition of the links <b>170</b>, the jaws <b>102</b> of the guide <b>100</b> may be closed and in the latter condition of the links <b>170</b>, the jaws <b>102</b> of the guide <b>100</b> may be open.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The links may be secured to the brackets <b>110</b> at a linkage interface <b>172</b> on the brackets <b>110</b>. The linkage interface <b>172</b> may be part of respective brackets <b>110</b> and may be configured for establishing a pivoting connection between the free ends of the links <b>170</b> and the bracket <b>110</b> of each jaw <b>102</b>. The linkage interface <b>172</b> may also provide an attachment point for one or more biasing mechanisms <b>174</b>. As shown, the linkage interface <b>172</b> may include upper and lower plates <b>184</b>/<b>186</b> secured to one another by a closure plate <b>188</b> extending between the outboard edges of the upper and lower plates <b>184</b>/<b>186</b>. The closure plate <b>188</b> may extend forward toward the semicircular plate of the bracket <b>110</b> and may include a nose <b>190</b> formed from upper and lower chamfered forward corners of the closure plate <b>188</b>. The nose <b>190</b> of the closure plate may be secured to the semicircular plate portion of the bracket <b>110</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref>, the upper and lower plates <b>184</b>/<b>186</b> may have a generally flat front edge and a segmented back edge to provide connection points for the links <b>170</b> and the biasing mechanism <b>174</b>. That is, the linkage interface <b>172</b> may be sized to receive the free end of the main links <b>170</b> between the upper and lower plates <b>184</b>/<b>186</b> and an elongate element <b>171</b> may extend through the upper and lower plates <b>184</b>/<b>186</b> and through the free end of the main link <b>170</b> to establish a substantially vertical axis about which the linkage interface <b>172</b> may rotate relative to the main link <b>170</b>. On a central bracket side of the elongate element, a biasing mechanism <b>174</b> may be secured to each of the upper and lower plates <b>184</b>/<b>186</b>. The upper and lower plates <b>184</b>/<b>186</b> may each include an inner thumb, tab, or standoff <b>192</b> secured to the semicircular plate portion of the bracket.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The biasing mechanism <b>174</b> may extend laterally across the linkage system <b>106</b>. As shown, a biasing mechanism <b>174</b> may extend between each of the upper plates <b>184</b> and another biasing mechanism <b>174</b> may extend between each of the lower plates <b>186</b>. The biasing mechanism <b>174</b> may be biased toward an extended position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. In one or more embodiments, the biasing mechanism may be in the form of spring cylinders, or another type of biasing mechanism may be provided. In one or more embodiments, the biasing mechanisms on the top and bottom of the linkage <b>106</b> may be oriented oppositely as shown.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">One or more detent mechanisms <b>176</b> may be arranged to extend from the central bracket <b>168</b> and may be adapted to hold the main links <b>170</b> in a generally straight (e.g., extending in substantially opposite directions) condition unless/until a force is present to release the detent. In one or more embodiments, the detent mechanism <b>176</b> may include one or more magnets extending off of the sides of the back plate <b>178</b> of the central bracket <b>168</b> via brackets <b>194</b>. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, a bracket <b>194</b> such as an L-bracket may be provided on either side of the back plate <b>178</b> providing a mounting surface for a magnet that may face the back side of a respective main link <b>170</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, when the guide <b>100</b> in a closed condition, the magnet may be pressed against or arranged in close proximity to a back side of the main link <b>170</b> and, as such, may function to hold the main link <b>170</b> in a substantially straight condition extending substantially opposite the direction of the other main link <b>170</b>. Magnets may be provided on each side of the central bracket <b>168</b> and, as such, both main links <b>170</b> may be held. Unless or until the magnet force is overcome and sufficient separation between the magnet and the main links <b>170</b> is present, the magnet may exhibit a detent force functioning to hold the linkage <b>106</b> in the closed condition. In one or more embodiments, the magnets may be omitted and a stronger biasing force may be used in lieu of a detent mechanism. In still other embodiments, the main links may move passed center to create a detent force.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in the cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the linkage system <b>106</b> may have an overall arrangement in the shape of a diamond formation <b>196</b> having hinges or pivot points on all corners and a biasing mechanism <b>174</b> extending from one corner to an opposite corner thereby biasing the diamond formation <b>196</b> in an elongated condition. However, upon pulling in opposite directions on the corners of the diamond formation not having the biasing mechanism <b>174</b>, the biasing mechanism <b>174</b> may be compressed allowing the diamond formation <b>196</b> to be less elongate unless/until the pulling force is released. As shown, two of the four sides of the diamond formation <b>196</b> may include the pair of main links <b>170</b>. The other two sides of the diamond formation <b>196</b> may each be made up, collectively, of a linkage interface <b>172</b> and a liner portion <b>108</b>. The pair of main links <b>170</b> may be pivotally coupled to one another at a substantially common point at the central bracket <b>168</b>. The liner portions <b>108</b> may be pivotally coupled to one another at the pivot mechanism <b>104</b>. The linkage interface <b>172</b> and liner portion <b>108</b> may each be pivotally coupled to respective main links <b>170</b> at the linkage interface <b>172</b>. The biasing mechanism <b>174</b> may extend across the diamond formation <b>196</b> between the free ends of the main links <b>170</b>. Notably, the features of the guide <b>100</b> are arranged such that widening out or reduction of the elongate nature of the diamond formation <b>196</b> also opens the jaws <b>102</b>. Moreover, the lateral extension of the central bracket <b>168</b> may be such that the detention mechanism <b>176</b> engages the diamond formation <b>196</b> at or near the free ends of the main links <b>170</b>. Holding the free ends of the links <b>170</b> against relative rotation to the central bracket <b>168</b> may resist opening of the diamond formation <b>196</b> and doing so at or near the free ends of the links <b>170</b>, provides a relatively high level of resistance to rotation of the main links <b>170</b> due to the engagement of the links <b>170</b> at a relatively large distance from their common pivot point. The central bracket <b>168</b> and detention magnets may, thus, function as a splint along an elongated side of the diamond formation <b>196</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In view of the above, one example guide mechanism may be described a bit differently as including a first jaw <b>102</b> and a second jaw <b>102</b> pivotally coupled to the first jaw <b>102</b> at a pivot point <b>104</b> and forming a tubular connection guide <b>100</b>. The guide mechanism may also include a pair of main links <b>170</b> pivotally coupled to one another at a central location outside the first and second jaw <b>102</b> and proximate the pivot point <b>104</b>. That is, the jaws <b>102</b>, when closed may have an inside portion for handling tubulars and an outside portion outside the clamping region of the jaws <b>102</b>. So, the central location may be central to the pair of main links <b>170</b>, but may be outside of the clamping region of the jaws <b>102</b> and near the pivot point <b>104</b> of the jaws. The pair of main links <b>170</b> may extend away from the central location and along respective first and second jaws <b>102</b> to respective free ends. The free ends may be pivotally coupled to the first jaw <b>102</b> and the second jaw <b>102</b>, respectively, at first and second outer pivot points. That is, while the linkage interfaces <b>172</b> have been described as being secured to the semicircular plate and pivotally coupled to the links <b>170</b>, here, we are simply saying the free ends of the links <b>170</b> may be pivotally coupled to the jaws <b>102</b> in some way and we have suggested this location be termed the outer pivot points. This could very well be the pivot connection between the linkage interfaces <b>172</b> and the links <b>170</b>, but another outer pivot point may also be provided. Moreover, as described here, a portion of each jaw <b>102</b> and the pair of main links <b>170</b>, may, thus, form a diamond formation <b>196</b>. The example guide mechanism may also include a biasing mechanism <b>174</b> resistant to compression and arranged between the first and second outer pivot points. In one or more embodiments, the example guide mechanism may also include a detent mechanism <b>176</b> adapted to hold the pair of main links <b>170</b> in a generally parallel arrangement. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, for example, when the diamond formation <b>196</b> is elongated, the pair of main links <b>170</b> may extend in almost exactly opposite directions and, as such, be generally parallel. In one or more embodiments, the detent mechanism <b>176</b> may include a central bracket <b>168</b> and a pair of magnets arranged at or near the outer pivot points. In still further embodiments, the central bracket <b>168</b> may be adapted for engagement by a tool arm.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In operation and use, the present guide may be used for tripping drill pipe into a well or otherwise accommodating the stabbing of tubular connections while protecting relatively delicate surfaces such as pipe threads, for example. That is, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a robotic handler <b>64</b><i>b </i>at the racking board <b>58</b> may grasp a top portion of a tubular <b>66</b> with an end effector and may tip the tubular <b>66</b> to deliver a top portion of the tubular to the top drive elevator <b>62</b>. The top drive elevator <b>62</b> may grasp the top of the tubular <b>66</b> and lift the tubular <b>66</b> while the robotic handler <b>64</b><i>a </i>at the drill floor <b>54</b> grasps the bottom of the tubular <b>66</b> with an end effector and guides the bottom of the tubular <b>66</b> as it swings toward well center. The drill string in the well bore may have a top end that stops a short distance above the drill floor <b>54</b> and, having retrieved another tubular <b>66</b>, the top drive elevator <b>62</b> may suspend the tubular <b>66</b> above and generally in line with the drill string. The robotic handler <b>64</b><i>a </i>at the drill floor <b>54</b> may replace its end effector with a passive tubular connecting guide <b>100</b> by placing the end effector in a stand and releasing the end effector using a remote connection interface <b>74</b>, such as a passive rotation disconnect, and engaging the tubing guide <b>100</b> using a the remote connection interface <b>74</b>. That is, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the passive tubular connection guide <b>100</b> may be bolted or otherwise secured to a remote connection interface <b>74</b> and may be positioned in a stand or holder. The robotic handler <b>64</b><i>a </i>may have a robot portion configured for engaging the remote connection interface <b>74</b> secured to an end of a manipulator arm. The remote connection interface <b>74</b> may allow the robot to passively retrieve a variety of different tools.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">With the passive tubular connection guide <b>100</b> secured to its arm, the robotic handler <b>64</b><i>a </i>may perform a method <b>200</b> of guiding a tubular connection as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> and as portrayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b><i>a</i>-<b>16</b><i>b</i></figref>. However, a manual user or other operator may also perform this method <b>200</b> and nothing shall be construed to require robotics for operation of the guide <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b><i>a</i></figref>, the passive tubular connection guide <b>100</b> may be arranged above the drill string and below the suspended tubular (<b>202</b>), aligned with the top of the drill string (<b>204</b>), and lowered onto the drill string (<b>206</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b><i>b</i></figref>, the bottom pocket of the guide <b>100</b> may nestle or seat onto the box portion <b>76</b> of the tubular <b>66</b>. The top drive may then lower the suspended tubular (<b>208</b>) relying on the guide <b>100</b> to guide the pin end <b>78</b> of the suspended tubular <b>66</b> into a box end <b>76</b> of the drill string. The top drive may spin the suspended tubular <b>66</b> to threadingly engage the suspended tubular <b>66</b> with the drill string (<b>210</b>) thereby preliminarily securing the tubular <b>66</b> to the drill string. In one or more embodiments, the spinning may be performed before removing the guide <b>100</b> or the guide may be removed before the spinning operation. The robotic handler <b>64</b><i>a </i>or other user may then pull the passive tubular connection guide <b>100</b> off of the now coupled, preliminarily coupled, or stabbed tubulars (<b>212</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b><i>c</i></figref>, the pulling of the guide <b>100</b> off of the tubulars <b>66</b> may generate a lateral force on the guide <b>100</b> extending generally away from the linkage <b>106</b> and passing generally through the seam <b>124</b> between the free ends of the jaws <b>102</b>. The circular surface of the tubular <b>66</b> may cause this force to result from two radially extending loads on the tips of the jaws <b>102</b>. Under this force, which acts generally orthogonally to the biasing mechanisms across the diagonal formation <b>196</b>, the detent force and the biasing force may be overcome and the guide <b>100</b> may open and compress the biasing mechanism <b>174</b> generating a compressive force therein (<b>214</b>). The opening of the guide <b>100</b> may free the guide up to be removed laterally from the now extended drill string as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b><i>c </i></figref>(<b>216</b>). As the guide is removed from the drill string, the tubular may maintain separation between the free ends of the jaws <b>102</b> and maintain the compressive force in the biasing mechanism <b>174</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b><i>d</i></figref>, upon pulling the guide free from the tubulars <b>66</b>, the resistance to the compressive force in the biasing mechanism <b>174</b> may be removed and the biasing mechanism <b>174</b> may extend thereby drawing the free ends of the jaws <b>102</b> back together again and into the closed position (<b>218</b>).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; or &#x201c;generally&#x201d; refer to the complete or nearly complete extent or degree of an action, characteristic, property, state, structure, item, or result. For example, an object that is &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; or &#x201c;generally&#x201d; enclosed would mean that the object is either completely enclosed or nearly completely enclosed. The exact allowable degree of deviation from absolute completeness may in some cases depend on the specific context. However, generally speaking, the nearness of completion will be so as to have generally the same overall result as if absolute and total completion were obtained. The use of &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; or &#x201c;generally&#x201d; is equally applicable when used in a negative connotation to refer to the complete or near complete lack of an action, characteristic, property, state, structure, item, or result.
