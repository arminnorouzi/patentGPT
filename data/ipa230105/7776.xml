The mother board <b>200</b> includes a flat insulating layer including a plurality of regions to be the lower insulating layers <b>107</b> layered on each other and an insulating layer including a plurality of regions to be the upper insulating layers <b>106</b>. In these insulating layers, each of regions, which become the upper insulating layers <b>106</b>, includes an opening to be a cavity <b>104</b>. Hereinafter, the term &#x201c;upper insulating layer <b>106</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;lower insulating layer <b>107</b>&#x201d; are also used in the mother board <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The insulating substrate <b>101</b> (the upper insulating layer <b>106</b> and the lower insulating layer <b>107</b>) is composed of a ceramic material such as an aluminum oxide-based sintered body, an aluminum nitride sintered body, a mullite-based sintered body, or a glass-ceramic sintered body. The insulating substrate <b>101</b> has, for example, a rectangular shape having a side length of about 1.2 to 10 mm in plan view, a plate shape having a thickness of about 0.3 to 2 mm, and the cavity <b>104</b> has a rectangular shape having a side length of about 1 to 9 mm in plan view, and a depth of about 0.1 to 1.5 mm.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The insulating substrate <b>101</b> can be produced as follows when the upper insulating layer <b>106</b> and the lower insulating layer <b>107</b> are made of an aluminum oxide-based sintered body. First, a plurality of ceramic green sheets are produced by adding and mixing an appropriate organic binder, solvent, plasticizer, or the like, to raw material powders such as aluminum oxide, silicon oxide, magnesium oxide, and calcium oxide to form a slurry, and forming the slurry into a sheet by, for example, a sheet forming method such as a doctor blade method or a roll calender method. Next, a part of the ceramic green sheet is formed into a frame shape by appropriate punching processing, and a laminate is produced by vertically layering the ceramic green sheet having a frame shape on the upper surface of the ceramic green sheet having a flat plate shape. The laminate can be produced, for example, by firing at 1200&#xb0; C. to 1600&#xb0; C. The above description of the manufacturing method of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> is given by focusing on a portion of one wiring board region <b>100</b>A in the multipiece board (mother board <b>200</b>), in other words, an explanation in the case where there are no multiple pieces.

The connection pad <b>114</b> functions as a conductor layer for connecting an electrode (not illustrated) of an electronic component <b>112</b> such as a piezoelectric oscillating element to be mounted on the mounting region <b>102</b>A. When the electronic component <b>112</b> is a piezoelectric oscillating element, the outer shape thereof is generally rectangular in plan view, and a pair of electrodes (not illustrated) for connection are provided at corners of the surface thereof.

That is, the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> of the present disclosure includes an insulating substrate <b>101</b> including a first surface <b>102</b> with a mounting region <b>102</b>A mounting an electronic component <b>112</b>, a second surface <b>103</b> located opposite to the first surface <b>102</b>, a plurality of side surfaces <b>105</b> located between the first surface <b>102</b> and the second surface <b>103</b>, and a corner portion located between two of the side surfaces <b>105</b>; an external connection conductor <b>108</b> located on the second surface <b>103</b>; and the corner conductor <b>109</b> connected to the external connection conductor <b>108</b>. The corner conductor <b>109</b> is located in a manner to increase the distance from the second surface <b>103</b> as advancing from the external connection conductor <b>108</b> toward the corner portion between the two side surfaces <b>105</b> of the insulating substrate <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In recent years, electronic component housing packages have become increasingly small, and as a result, the area of the external connection conductor located on the lower surface of the electronic component housing package has become increasingly small. Therefore, when an electronic device is connected to the module substrate by a joining material such as solder, there is a possibility that the joining strength between the insulating substrate and the external connection conductor may be reduced. In the electronic component housing package with such marked size reduction, there is a possibility that the joining strength between the insulating substrate and the external connection conductor may be lowered, especially at the end portion on the lower surface side of the corner portion between the two side surfaces of the insulating substrate.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> of the present disclosure, the strength of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> can be increased to reduce the likelihood of chipping and cracking. This is because when the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> (electronic device <b>300</b>) is mounted on the module substrate <b>400</b>, the end portion (corner portion formed by the two side surfaces <b>105</b> and the second surface <b>103</b>) on the second surface <b>103</b> side of the corner portion between the side surface <b>105</b> of the insulating substrate <b>101</b>, which is most susceptible to stress, is sandwiched between the external connection conductor <b>108</b> and the corner conductor <b>109</b> and protected. Since the likelihood of chipping or cracking of the corner portion of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> is reduced, peeling of the external connection conductor <b>108</b> from the insulating substrate <b>101</b> is suppressed, and the joining strength between the insulating substrate <b>101</b> and the external connection conductor <b>108</b> is high.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The corner conductor <b>109</b> is located such that the distance from the second surface <b>103</b> gradually increases as advancing from the second surface <b>103</b> around the corner portion of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> toward the corner portion of the insulating substrate <b>101</b>. Further, the corner conductor <b>109</b> may be a fan shape that is &#xbc; of a circle in plane perspective. &#x201c;fan shape&#x201d; refers to not only a complete fan, but also one in which the arc portion of the fan is not a complete arc, and the lengths of the two radial portions extending from the central angle are not exactly the same. The shape of the external connection conductor <b>108</b> in plan view may be rectangular, such as square, located at the corner portion of the rectangular second surface <b>103</b>, where two adjacent sides of the external connection conductor <b>108</b> overlap with the two sides of the second surface <b>103</b>. The corner conductor <b>109</b> may overlap with one corner section of the external connection conductor <b>108</b> in plane perspective, the central angle of the sector of the corner conductor <b>109</b> overlaps with one corner of the second surface <b>103</b> and one corner of the external connection conductor <b>108</b>, and the radial portion extending from the central angle of the sector overlaps with the two sides of the external connection conductor <b>108</b> located across the one corner. When the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> is viewed in side view, the shape of the corner conductor <b>109</b> exposed to the side surface <b>105</b> of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> is an arc shape. The shape of the corner conductor <b>109</b> is an arc shape, which is formed, in one side surface <b>105</b>, around the corner between the other side surface <b>105</b> and the second surface <b>103</b>. This arc can be a perfect circle arc as well as an elliptical arc as in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Additionally, the connection portion between the external connection conductor <b>108</b> and the corner conductor <b>109</b> has a convex arc shape toward the center (inside) of the second surface <b>103</b> in plane perspective. The corner conductor <b>109</b> extends from the arc-shaped connection portion to a point at the corner portion in a convex arc shape toward the first surface <b>102</b> in a manner to increase the distance from the second surface <b>103</b> (distance from the external connection conductor <b>108</b>). That is, the three-dimensional shape of the corner conductor <b>109</b> is a shape in which the hemispherical shape (dome shape) is reduced to &#xbc;, a &#xbc; dome shape. It is &#xbc; dome-shaped extending from an arc on the external connection conductor <b>108</b> to a point at the corner portion. Because of this shape of the corner conductor <b>109</b>, the corner of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> between the second surface <b>103</b> and the two side surfaces <b>105</b> is sandwiched (surrounded) between the external connection conductor <b>108</b> and the corner conductor <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Additionally, an insulator <b>110</b> sandwiched between the external connection conductor <b>108</b> and the corner conductor <b>109</b> and located at the corner portion of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> on the second surface <b>103</b> side is provided. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, a region sandwiched between the external connection conductor <b>108</b> and the corner conductor <b>109</b> at the corner portion on the second surface <b>103</b> side of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> is illustrated as the insulator <b>110</b> with hatching different from that of the upper insulating layer <b>106</b> and the lower insulating layer <b>107</b>. The insulator <b>110</b> is sandwiched and protected between the external connection conductor <b>108</b> and the corner conductor <b>109</b>. Since the insulator <b>110</b> is surrounded by the external connection conductor <b>108</b> and the corner conductor <b>109</b>, which are mainly composed of a metal having elasticity higher than that of the ceramics of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> and easily absorb stress, even when stress is applied to the electronic component housing package <b>100</b>, the insulator <b>110</b> located at this corner is not prone to chipping and cracking. Furthermore, even when cracks and chips are generated at the corner portion of the insulating substrate <b>101</b>, the cracks and chips tend to remain within a range sandwiched between the external connection conductor <b>108</b> and the corner conductor <b>109</b>. Therefore, the likelihood of disconnection of the conduction path such as the through-hole conductor <b>117</b> due to the breaking of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> is reduced, and since the electrical connection between the module substrate <b>400</b> and the external connection conductor <b>108</b> is maintained, the connection reliability is excellent.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">To obtain an electronic component housing package <b>100</b> including such a corner conductor <b>109</b>, the following method can be used. For example, in a ceramic green sheet for the upper insulating layer <b>106</b>, an opening to be the cavity <b>104</b> is formed by punching or the like, and a metallization paste to be the frame-shaped metallization layer <b>113</b> and the through-hole conductor <b>117</b> or the like, is positioned at predetermined places. The metallization paste to be the through-hole conductor <b>117</b> can be filled in a through hole formed at a predetermined position of the ceramic green sheet by punching or the like. In a ceramic green sheet to be a lower insulating layer <b>107</b>, a metallization paste to be the connection pad <b>114</b>, the external connection conductor <b>108</b>, the corner conductor <b>109</b>, and the through-hole conductor <b>117</b> or the like, is positioned at predetermined places. Then, after the ceramic paste to be the insulator <b>110</b> is positioned at a predetermined place in a manner to cover the upper surface of the metallization paste to be the corner conductor <b>109</b>, the ceramic green sheet provided with the metallization paste and the ceramic paste at the predetermined position may be pressure processed. The metallization paste to be the external connection conductor <b>108</b> overlaps the ceramic paste to be the insulator <b>110</b>. A ceramic paste to be the insulator <b>110</b> is provided on the metallization paste to be a part of the external connection conductor <b>108</b> (a part inside the corner conductor <b>109</b>) and the corner conductor <b>109</b>, and a metallization paste to be the remaining part of the external connection conductor <b>108</b> (a part overlapping with the corner conductor <b>109</b>) is provided on the ceramic paste, and pressure processing is performed. Alternatively, a ceramic paste to be the insulator <b>110</b> may be provided on a metallization paste to be the corner conductor <b>109</b>, and a metallization paste to be the external connection conductor <b>108</b> may be provided on the ceramic paste to perform pressure processing. The ceramic green sheet for the upper insulating layer <b>106</b> and the ceramic green sheet for the lower insulating layer <b>107</b> thus processed are layered and the laminate is fired to produce the electronic component housing package <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The ceramic paste to be the insulator <b>110</b> may be substantially made of the same material as the ceramic green sheet. &#x201c;The same material&#x201d; refers to a material that contains the same ceramic components as the upper insulating layer <b>106</b> and the lower insulating layer <b>107</b> after firing, and the amount of binder and solvent added to the ceramic paste is adjusted according to the specification of the coating method (e.g., screen printing, or the like). Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, for example, the ceramic paste (to be the insulator <b>110</b>) may be applied in a fan shape (circular on mother board <b>200</b>) of &#xbc; of a circle and positioned so that the thickness thereof is greatest at the corner portion of the insulating substrate <b>101</b>. Thus, in the pressure process, the corner conductor <b>109</b> can be positioned such that the corner conductor <b>109</b> tends to curve convexly toward the first surface <b>102</b> in the longitudinal sectional view from the outer peripheral end of the external connection conductor <b>108</b> to the end of the corner portion of the insulating substrate <b>101</b>, and such that the distance between the corner conductor <b>109</b> and the second surface <b>103</b> gradually increases in the thickness direction of the insulating substrate <b>101</b>. That is, the portion where the insulator <b>110</b> is positioned to be thick before pressure pushes the metallization paste to be the corner conductor <b>109</b>, deeper into the ceramic green sheet to be the insulating substrate <b>101</b>, when pressurized.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">It should be noted that although the above-described manufacturing method is configured such that a frame-shaped ceramic green sheet for the upper insulating layer <b>106</b> and a flat ceramic green sheet to be the lower insulating layer <b>107</b> are used for layering, the present embodiment is not limited to this method. For example, a pressure jig having a protrusion and a recess may be used to apply pressure such that a recessed cavity <b>104</b> is located on the surface of a ceramic green sheet to be an insulating substrate <b>101</b> to which a metallization paste or a ceramic paste is applied. At this time, by determining the position of the pressure jig so as to apply pressure to the bottom portion of the cavity <b>104</b>, the portion where the ceramic green sheet is pushed by the protrusion of the pressure jig becomes the cavity <b>104</b>, and the portion pushed by the recess of the pressurizing jig becomes the frame portion (upper insulating layer <b>106</b>) surrounding the mounting region <b>102</b>A. On the second surface <b>103</b> side of the ceramic green sheet, the ceramic paste to be the insulator <b>110</b> is pushed by a jig together with the metallization paste to be the external connection conductor <b>108</b>, and the metallization paste to be the corner conductor <b>109</b> becomes a structure in which the metallization paste is curved convexly toward the first surface <b>102</b>. Then, as a result of pressing the metallization paste to be the external connection conductor <b>108</b> with the jig, the exposed surface of the external connection conductor <b>108</b> and the second surface <b>103</b> of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> become coplanar. As the binder to be added to the ceramic green sheet, the metallization paste, or the ceramic paste, which are used, a binder having a glass transition temperature equal to or lower than a temperature when pressed by a mold can be used. By using such a binder, when the ceramic green sheet or the like is pressed by a pressure jig, it is possible to excellently perform molding such as coplanarity of the frame portion and the exposed surface of the external connection conductor <b>108</b> and the second surface <b>103</b> of the insulating substrate <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">At this time, the width and depth of the recess of the pressure jig are constant, and the width and the height of the frame after the pressurizing process can be constant. Therefore, the dimensional accuracy can be improved by keeping the width of the frame after the pressure process constant. Then, by firing a molded body in which the lower insulating layer <b>107</b> provided with the external connection conductor <b>108</b> or the like and the upper insulating layer <b>106</b> provided with the frame-shaped metallization layer <b>113</b> or the like are integrated, a mother board <b>200</b> in which a plurality of wiring board regions <b>100</b>A to be an electronic component housing package <b>100</b> are arranged, can be manufactured.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The electronic component housing package <b>100</b> of the present disclosure may further include a cover conductor <b>120</b>. The cover conductor <b>120</b> is located closer to the first surface <b>102</b> than the corner conductor <b>109</b> at the corner portion of the insulating substrate <b>101</b>. The cover conductor <b>120</b> covers a portion toward the first surface <b>102</b> from the corner conductor <b>109</b> at the corner portion. Since the corner portion in the side surface <b>105</b> of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> is covered with the cover conductor <b>120</b>, the strength of the corner portion in the side surface <b>105</b> of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> can be enhanced, and chipping and cracking can be suppressed.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As described above, the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> is produced by dividing a multipiece wiring board (mother board <b>200</b>). The mother board <b>200</b> includes a plurality of wiring board regions <b>100</b>A in the vertical and horizontal directions (X direction, Y direction) of the board surface. The mother board <b>200</b> includes a dividing groove (hereinafter referred to simply as a groove) at the boundary between two adjacent wiring board regions <b>100</b>A at the first surface <b>102</b> and the second surface <b>103</b>, and the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> of each piece is obtained by breaking along the dividing groove. This groove can be formed by cutting the first surface <b>102</b> and the second surface <b>103</b> against the mother board <b>200</b> or against the mother board before firing, using a laser or a cutter blade. The inner surface of the groove is a cut surface <b>122</b>, which is an inclined portion <b>111</b> with respect to the first surface <b>102</b> and the second surface <b>103</b>. Therefore, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, since the side surface <b>105</b> of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> includes the fracture surface <b>121</b> and the cut surface <b>122</b> (inclined portion <b>111</b>), and the fracture surface <b>121</b> is the uneven portion <b>126</b> with many irregularities due to fracture, there is a possibility of chipping and cracking at the corner portion of the side surface of the insulating substrate <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As described above, of the corner portion between the two side surfaces <b>105</b> in the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> of the present disclosure, the end portion adjacent to the second surface <b>103</b> is surrounded and protected by the external connection conductor <b>108</b> and the corner conductor <b>109</b>. A portion located toward the first surface <b>102</b> from the corner conductor <b>109</b> at the corner portion corresponds to the uneven portion <b>126</b> described above. When the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> includes the cover conductor <b>120</b> covering the corner portion of the insulating substrate <b>101</b>, since the corner portion located at the uneven portion <b>126</b> is protected by the cover conductor <b>120</b> mainly composed of a metal, the occurrence of cracking and chipping at the corner portion of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> can be suppressed. Thus, for example, even contact with the tray when the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> is stored in the tray or the like for conveyance or chucking when the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> is conveyed, occurs, it becomes difficult to chip the corner portion of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> and foreign matter can be prevented from entering the cavity <b>104</b> due to chipping of the insulating substrate <b>101</b>. The cover conductor <b>120</b>, like the corner conductor <b>109</b> and other wiring conductors, is a metal sintered body mainly composed of a metal such as tungsten and molybdenum, and has excellent protective performance of the insulating substrate <b>101</b>. &#x201c;Mainly composed of a metal&#x201d; means containing 90% or more of a metal, and in addition to the above metals, ceramic components and glass components can be included in order to enhance the sinterability or the joining properties with the insulating substrate <b>101</b>. The cover conductor <b>120</b> protrudes from the corner conductor <b>109</b> toward the first surface <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described above, exposed surfaces such as the corner conductor <b>109</b>, the frame-shaped metallization layer <b>113</b>, the connection pad <b>114</b>, and the external connection conductor <b>108</b> may include plating films on their exposed surfaces. Oxidation corrosion can be prevented, and connection such as between the connection pad <b>114</b> and the electrode of the electronic component <b>112</b>, or between the external connection conductor <b>108</b> and the module substrate <b>400</b> can be made easier or stronger. The plating film may be a plating layer formed by sequentially depositing a nickel plating layer having a thickness of about 1 to 20 &#x3bc;m and a gold plating layer having a thickness of about 0.1 to 3.0 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this way, for example, an electroplating method can be used to deposit the plating layer on each wiring board. A supply conductor for supplying a current in electroplating is arranged outside a plurality of wiring board regions <b>100</b>A arranged on a mother board <b>200</b>, and a connection conductor for connecting the supply conductor and the wiring board regions <b>100</b>A located at the outermost periphery and a connection conductor for connecting the respective wirings over adjacent wiring board regions <b>100</b>A can be arranged. With such a configuration, when a current is supplied to the supply conductor, electricity can be supplied to all of the wiring conductors of each wiring board region <b>100</b>A, and the plating layers are deposited on the exposed wiring conductors of each wiring board region <b>100</b>A.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the mother board <b>200</b> for obtaining the electronic component housing package <b>100</b>, the corner conductor <b>109</b> functions as the above connection conductor. In the mother board <b>200</b>, the corner conductors <b>109</b> located in the adjacent wiring board regions <b>100</b>A are connected to each other to form a circular shape in plane perspective view. As long as the corner conductor <b>109</b> only functions as a connection conductor, the corner conductor <b>109</b> may be a belt-like wiring conductor having a small width, but as described above, the wiring conductor has the above-described shape in order to surround and protect the corner portion (insulator <b>110</b>) of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> together with the external connection conductor <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The cover conductor <b>120</b> may be connected to the corner conductor <b>109</b>. In other words, the cover conductor <b>120</b> may extend from the corner conductor <b>109</b> toward the first surface <b>102</b>. With such a configuration, the connection reliability of the above connection conductor is improved. When individual pieces of the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> are obtained from the mother board <b>200</b>, there is a possibility of cutting also the corner conductor <b>109</b> by grooving using a laser or the like. When the corner conductor <b>109</b> is cut, the connection conductor is broken, and therefore, there is a possibility that a plating film is not formed on the wiring conductor. The corner conductor <b>109</b> is furthest from the second surface <b>103</b> in the vicinity of the boundary between the adjacent wiring board regions, and it is difficult for the corner conductor <b>109</b> to become disconnected when the second surface <b>103</b> is grooved. When the cover conductor <b>120</b> is connected to the corner conductor <b>109</b>, the connection conductor is composed of the corner conductor <b>109</b> and the cover conductor <b>120</b>. Since the cover conductor <b>120</b> is connected to the top of the dome-shaped corner conductor <b>109</b> in the mother board <b>200</b>, the thickness of the central portion of the connection conductor is increased. Therefore, even when the grooving is performed from the second surface <b>103</b> of the mother board <b>200</b> to reach a depth exceeding the corner conductor <b>109</b>, the cover conductor <b>120</b> is not cut and the conduction between the corner conductors <b>109</b> of the adjacent wiring board regions <b>100</b>A is maintained.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, in the second surface <b>103</b> of the mother board <b>200</b>, an external connection conductor <b>108</b> is located at the corner portion of each wiring board region <b>100</b>A. On the first surface <b>102</b> side of the external connection conductor <b>108</b>, the circular insulator <b>110</b> is located straddling the adjacent wiring board regions <b>100</b>A. The dome-shaped corner conductor <b>109</b> covering the insulator <b>110</b> is located on the first surface <b>102</b> side of the insulator <b>110</b>. Further, the cover conductor <b>120</b> is located on the first surface <b>102</b> side of the corner conductor <b>109</b> in the vicinity of the boundary between the four wiring board regions <b>100</b>A adjacent to each other in plane perspective.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In order to position the cover conductor <b>120</b> at the corner portion of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> in this manner, the following steps may be added to the manufacturing method described above.

A metallization paste to be the corner conductor <b>109</b> is applied thereon. The holes may be filled at the same time as applying the metallization paste to be the corner conductor <b>109</b> without filling the holes with the metallization paste to be the cover conductor <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> of the present disclosure, the width on the first surface <b>102</b> side in the cover conductor <b>120</b> may be smaller than the width on the corner conductor <b>109</b> side. In other words, the cover conductor <b>120</b> may have a width near the first surface <b>102</b> that is smaller than a width near the second surface <b>103</b>. With such a configuration, the position shift of the groove when the mother board <b>200</b> for manufacturing the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> is divided, can be easily determined by the shape of the cover conductor <b>120</b>. In other words, when the cover conductor <b>120</b> has a smaller shape than the predetermined shape of the cover conductor <b>120</b>, it means that the groove is deviated from the predetermined position, and when the shape of the cover conductor <b>120</b> is within a proper range, it is easily confirmed that the groove is located in the predetermined position and the size of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> is appropriate.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">When, as in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the dividing grooves formed in the second surface <b>103</b> of the mother board <b>200</b> and extending vertically and horizontally, pass through the center of the cover conductor <b>120</b> in plane perspective, then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, at the corner portion of the insulating substrate <b>101</b>, the portions appearing on the two side surfaces <b>105</b> sandwiching the corner portion of the cover conductor <b>120</b> are approximately the same in shape and size. Further, the cover conductor <b>120</b> appearing on the side surface <b>105</b> of each electronic component housing package <b>100</b> obtained from the adjacent wiring board regions <b>100</b>A is substantially the same in shape and size as one another. On the other hand, when the cover conductor <b>120</b> is not divided at the center, the shape and size of the cover conductor <b>120</b> appearing in each of the two side surfaces <b>105</b> sandwiching the corner portion, and the shape and size of the cover conductor <b>120</b> appearing on the side surface <b>105</b> of the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> obtained from the adjacent wiring board regions <b>100</b>A are different from one another. When the groove position is greatly deviated, the cover conductor <b>120</b> is not exposed to the side surface <b>105</b>. Even when the width of the cover conductor <b>120</b> on the first surface <b>102</b> side is the same as the width of the second surface <b>103</b> side, that is, the cover conductor <b>120</b> on the mother board <b>200</b> is cylindrical, the size of the portion appearing on the side surface <b>105</b> is different. On the other hand, when the width of the cover conductor <b>120</b> on the first surface <b>102</b> side is smaller than the width of the second surface <b>103</b> side, that is, when the cover conductor <b>120</b> on the mother board <b>200</b> is a conical shape with a rounded tip, the difference in shape becomes more distinguished. Therefore, the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> having a large position shift of the grooves and a large dimensional deviation can be easily selected, and the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> having excellent dimensional accuracy can be efficiently manufactured.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">As described above, the side surface <b>105</b> of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> includes cut surfaces <b>122</b> and a fracture surface <b>121</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the fracture surface <b>121</b> is located at the center in the thickness direction of the insulating substrate <b>101</b>, and the cut surfaces <b>122</b> are located on the upper side (first surface <b>102</b> side) and the lower side (second surface <b>103</b> side), respectively, across the fracture surface <b>121</b>. An upper dividing line <b>123</b> is located at the boundary between the fracture surface <b>121</b> and the cut surface <b>122</b> on the upper side, and a lower dividing line <b>124</b> is located at the boundary between the fracture surface <b>121</b> and the cut surface <b>122</b> on the lower side. The upper dividing line <b>123</b> corresponds to the bottom of the groove formed in the first surface <b>102</b> of the mother board <b>200</b>, and the lower dividing line <b>124</b> corresponds to the bottom of the groove formed in the second surface <b>103</b>. The upper dividing line <b>123</b> extends substantially parallel to the first surface <b>102</b>, and includes a portion that curves convexly toward the second surface <b>103</b> at the corner portion of the insulating substrate <b>101</b>. The lower dividing line <b>124</b> extends substantially parallel to the second surface <b>103</b>, and includes a portion that curves convexly toward the first surface <b>102</b> at the corner portion of the insulating substrate <b>101</b>. The respective curved portions in the upper dividing line <b>123</b> and the lower dividing line <b>124</b> are depressions <b>125</b> that are deeper in the groove. When the groove is formed by a laser machining process, a portion where the groove in the X direction and the groove in the Y direction intersect each other receives laser irradiation two times in total, at the time of forming the groove in the X direction and at the time of forming the groove in the Y direction. In the portion where the groove in the X direction and the groove in the Y direction intersect, the groove becomes deeper than the other portion. Therefore, the upper dividing line <b>123</b> and the lower dividing line <b>124</b> each include a depression <b>125</b> at the corner portion of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> in the electronic component housing package <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the case where the depression <b>125</b> of the upper dividing line <b>123</b> is deep, when the cover conductor <b>120</b> is exposed to the depression <b>125</b> in plan view from the first surface <b>102</b> in the mother board <b>200</b> state, it can be confirmed that the groove is formed at a predetermined position. When the width of the cover conductor <b>120</b> on the first surface <b>102</b> side is smaller than the width on the second surface <b>103</b> side, the position of the groove can be determined with higher accuracy.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> of the present disclosure, the side surface <b>105</b> includes an inclined portion <b>111</b> located near the second surface <b>103</b> and an uneven portion <b>126</b> extending in the thickness direction of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> from the inclined portion <b>111</b>, and the cover conductor <b>120</b> may be located at the uneven portion <b>126</b>. Such a configuration reduces, for example, the likelihood that solder joined to the external connection conductor <b>108</b> and the brazing material <b>118</b> or the like when joining the lid <b>116</b> may be short-circuited through the cover conductor <b>120</b>. &#x201c;The cover conductor <b>120</b> is located at the uneven portion <b>126</b>&#x201d; means that the cover conductor <b>120</b> is located at the fracture surface <b>121</b>. This means that the cover conductor <b>120</b> is not exposed on the outer surface of the mother board <b>200</b> for manufacturing the electronic component housing package <b>100</b>. Therefore, a metal layer (plating film) formed on the surface of the wiring conductor or the like exposed on the surface in the state of the mother board <b>200</b> is not formed on the surface of the cover conductor <b>120</b>. Therefore, in the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> obtained by singulating the mother board <b>200</b>, the metal layer (plating layer) is not located on the surface of the cover conductor <b>120</b> located between the external connection conductor <b>108</b> and the frame-shaped metallization layer <b>113</b> to which the lid <b>116</b> is connected. Therefore, it is difficult for solder, when joining the external connection conductor <b>108</b> to the module substrate <b>400</b>, and the brazing material <b>118</b>, when joining the lid <b>116</b>, to be joined to the cover conductor <b>120</b>, and the likelihood of short-circuiting between the external connection conductor <b>108</b> and the frame-shaped metallization layer <b>113</b> via the cover conductor <b>120</b> is reduced. The inclined portion <b>111</b> is located between the uneven portion <b>126</b> and the second surface <b>103</b> at the side surface <b>105</b>, and is adjacent to the second surface <b>103</b>. The angle between the inclined portion <b>111</b> and the second surface <b>103</b> is greater than a right angle (90 degrees). As a result, the distance along the side surface <b>105</b> from the external connection conductor <b>108</b> of the second surface <b>103</b> to the cover conductor <b>120</b>, and further to the frame-shaped metallization layer <b>113</b> of the first surface <b>102</b>, becomes longer than in the case where the angle between the second surface <b>103</b> and the side surface <b>105</b> is a right angle. In other words, including the inclined portion <b>111</b> further reduces the likelihood of the above-described short circuit. When the inclined portion <b>111</b> is also located between the first surface <b>102</b> and the uneven portion <b>126</b>, the distance from the external connection conductor <b>108</b> to the frame-shaped metallization layer <b>113</b> along the side surface <b>105</b> is further increased, further reducing the likelihood of a short circuit between them.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">An electronic device <b>300</b> of the present disclosure includes the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> described above and an electronic component <b>112</b> mounted on the electronic component housing package <b>100</b>. With such a configuration, chipping and cracking of the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> during handling are suppressed, and an electronic device <b>300</b> with excellent dimensional accuracy can be provided. In other words, an electronic device with excellent dimensional accuracy can be manufactured by using the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> in which chipping and cracking of the corner portion on the second surface <b>103</b> side of the insulating substrate <b>101</b> in the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> are suppressed. In addition, the likelihood of disconnection of the conduction path such as the through-hole conductor <b>117</b> due to cracking, chipping, or the like, and the likelihood of separation of the external connection conductor <b>108</b> from the insulating substrate <b>101</b> are reduced, and an electronic device excellent in electrical connection reliability between the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> and the module substrate <b>400</b> can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The electronic component <b>112</b> may include, for example, a piezoelectric element such as: a ceramic piezoelectric element or a surface acoustic wave element; a semiconductor element; a capacitative element; a resistive element; or the like, in addition to a piezoelectric oscillator such as a crystal oscillation element of a temperature compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Each electrode (not illustrated) of the electronic component <b>112</b> is connected to the connection pad <b>114</b> via a joining material <b>115</b> such as a conductive adhesive, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The electronic module <b>500</b> of the present disclosure includes the electronic device <b>300</b> described above and a module substrate <b>400</b> to which the electronic device <b>300</b> is connected. Due to the high joining strength of the external connection conductor <b>108</b> of the electronic component housing package <b>100</b>, the reliability of the electrical connection between the electronic device <b>300</b> and the module substrate <b>400</b> is high, thereby providing the electronic module <b>500</b> with excellent operation reliability.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">It should be noted that the present disclosure is not limited to one example of the above-described embodiment, and various modifications are possible as long as they do not deviate from the gist of the present disclosure.

In addition, although four rectangular external connection conductors <b>108</b> are located at the corner portions of the second surface <b>103</b>, the present embodiment is not limited thereto, and the external connection conductors <b>108</b> other than those located at the four locations may have a shape other than a rectangular shape and may be located at positions other than the corner portions, depending on the size of the electronic component housing package <b>100</b>, the type of the electronic device, the electronic component to be mounted, or the like.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Although the insulating substrate <b>101</b> of the electronic component housing package <b>100</b> has been described as having a shape including a cavity <b>104</b>, it may be a flat insulating substrate <b>101</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.
