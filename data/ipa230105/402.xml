More particularly, apparatuses for applying a transcutaneous analyte assembly to skin of a host for accurately measuring blood glucose of the host and methods of their use and/or manufacture are provided.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the pancreas cannot create sufficient insulin (Type I or insulin dependent) and/or in which insulin is not effective (Type 2 or non-insulin dependent). In the diabetic state, the victim suffers from high blood sugar, which can cause an array of physiological derangements associated with the deterioration of small blood vessels, for example, kidney failure, skin ulcers, or bleeding into the vitreous of the eye. A hypoglycemic reaction (low blood sugar) can be induced by an inadvertent overdose of insulin, or after a normal dose of insulin or glucose-lowering agent accompanied by extraordinary exercise or insufficient food intake.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, a person with diabetes carries a self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) monitor, which typically requires uncomfortable finger pricking methods. Due to the lack of comfort and convenience, a person with diabetes normally only measures his or her glucose levels two to four times per day. Unfortunately, such time intervals are spread so far apart that the person with diabetes likely finds out too late of a hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic condition, sometimes incurring dangerous side effects. Glucose levels may be alternatively monitored continuously by a sensor system including an on-skin sensor assembly. The sensor system may have a wireless transmitter which transmits measurement data to a receiver which can process and display information based on the measurements.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This Background is provided to introduce a brief context for the Summary and Detailed Description that follow.

Thus, sterilization of an applicator (and/or of the portions of an applicator that come in contact with, or that are inserted into, a body part of the host) are not only desirable, but required in many circumstances. Various sterilization methods can be used in embodiments, including but not limited to heat sterilization, gamma sterilization, electron beam sterilization, and gas (e.g. ethylene oxide) sterilization. In embodiments adapted for gas sterilization, an applicator can be configured with one or more apertures, at least during one or more steps of manufacture, which are configured to allow ingress and egress of gas during one or more sterilization steps. In addition, it may be desirable to seal applicators from ingress of moisture (e.g., water vapor) in some embodiments. Moisture, especially water vapor, can corrode (e.g., rust, tarnish) any metallic parts within an applicator, for example, a needle, a spring, or any other metallic structure. Such corrosion coming in contact with the host, especially where a needle enters the skin of a host, can cause serious health consequences. Moisture can also promote growth of infectious agents and provide a medium for their proliferation, causing serious health consequences. The present application provides various embodiments of applicators that are gas sterilizable and/or include a moisture (e.g., water vapor) seal, for example, through the use of one or more removable caps on the top (e.g., proximal) or bottom (e.g., distal) ends of the applicator, through one or more trigger mechanisms comprising integrated caps, through one or more sealing layers that cover one or more orifices, apertures or vents of the applicator, through sterilizable gas-permeable polymers, through sterilizable gas-permeable trigger mechanisms, through protective cups, or any combinations of the same, as will be described in more detail in connection with at least some of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>40</b></figref> below.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Safety Features of Applicators</heading><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Consumers may find it desirable to use applicators that provide particular safety features. For example, tamper evident sealing or other tamper evidence features may be desirable because such features allow a consumer to identify when an applicator has been previously used or containment has been breached and, thus, avoid using an applicator that may be faulty or pose an increased health risk if used. Examples of tamper evidence features are described in more detail in connection with at least some of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>40</b></figref> below.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In addition, especially in the case of disposable applicators, it can be frustrating or dangerous to have an applicator deploy prematurely or unexpectedly. Thus, consumers may find it desirable for applicators to include premature deployment prevention features to substantially reduce or prevent the occurrence of premature activation. Examples of premature deployment prevention features are described in more detail in connection with at least some of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>40</b></figref> below.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In line with premature deployment prevention features, it may be desirable to provide features which minimize the risk of unintended activation when the applicator is dropped. For example, an exposed trigger mechanism may be accidentally activated if the applicator is dropped on the exposed trigger mechanism. However, in some cases, the shock of dropping the applicator itself can cause accidental activation of the applicator even where there is no exposed trigger mechanism. Examples of drop protection features and other premature deployment prevention features are described in more detail in connection with at least some of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>40</b></figref> below.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0000">Bulk Manufacturing and/or Sterilization</p><p id="p-0129" num="0127">The cost of manufacture of applicators is a concern for the manufacturer as well as for the consumer. In general, the less expensive it is to produce an applicator, the lower the cost it is to the consumer. Thus, it is desirable to provide bulk manufacturing, sterilizing and/or sealing of applicators. Examples of applicator configurations and methods of bulk sterilizing and/or sealing of applicators include, but are not limited to, melting, chemically altering, or physically altering a vent, plug, feature, or layer such that it transforms from a state of being permeable to a sterilizing gas and/or moisture (e.g., water vapor) to impermeable to the sterilizing gas and/or moisture, as will be described in more detail in connection with at least some of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>40</b></figref> below.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Easy and Repositionable Deployment</heading><p id="p-0130" num="0128">Consumers may additionally find it desirable to easily position (and reposition if desired) an applicator in a particular location on the body, optionally using only a single hand, without necessarily requiring a complete view of the applicator as it is held in the desired location. Such easy single-handed deployment may be achieved through the provision of various orientations and forms of actuation members, as well as the use of one or more raised or recessed portions configured as tactile grips and/or orientation indicators, as will be described in more detail in connection with at least some of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>40</b></figref> below. Consumers may also find it desirable to be able to reposition the applicator prior to activation even after it has been first placed on the body, without comprising the integrity of the applicator and/or any adhesive provided thereon.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Embodiments Including a Removable Cap</heading><p id="p-0131" num="0129">Some embodiments can include a removable cap configured to function as a sterilization seal and/or as a moisture barrier.

Housing <b>104</b> comprises an aperture <b>106</b> through which on-skin assembly <b>102</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) is configured to pass during deployment. The side of housing <b>104</b> may further comprise an opening <b>120</b> configured to receive an actuation member (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref>). Such an actuation member can be configured to, upon activation, cause insertion assembly <b>118</b> to insert at least a portion of on-skin assembly <b>102</b> into the skin of a host. The actuation member is disposed on a side of housing <b>104</b> in the region of the opening <b>120</b>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, sealing element <b>110</b> comprises a removable cap <b>112</b> configured to couple with a portion of housing <b>104</b>. Specifically, and as an example, removable cap <b>112</b> is configured to couple with a distal portion of housing <b>104</b> via threads <b>114</b>. For example, threads <b>114</b> disposed on removable cap <b>112</b> may be configured to mate with threads <b>108</b> disposed on housing <b>104</b>. Removable cap <b>112</b> may be detached from housing <b>104</b> by twisting removable cap <b>112</b> with respect to housing <b>104</b>, or vice versa, until threads <b>114</b> and threads <b>108</b> are no longer mated with each other, and then pulling housing <b>104</b> and removable cap <b>112</b> apart. Sealing element <b>110</b> may additionally comprise retention element <b>138</b> between removable cap <b>112</b> and housing <b>104</b> before removal of removable cap <b>112</b>. As shown, removable cap <b>112</b> covers the actuation member by virtue of the actuation member being disposed on a side of housing <b>104</b>. Sealing element <b>110</b> may further comprise a first layer <b>122</b> that is permeable to a sterilizing gas (e.g., ethylene oxide, or ETO). First layer <b>122</b> may comprise Tyvek&#xae; material, although any other material permeable to a sterilizing gas may be utilized. Application of first layer <b>122</b> to removable cap <b>112</b> may allow for the ingress and egress of a sterilizing gas during manufacture. Sealing element <b>110</b> may further comprise a second layer <b>124</b> that is substantially impermeable to moisture (e.g., water vapor). Second layer <b>124</b> may comprise a metallic foil, although any suitable material impermeable to moisture (e.g., water vapor) may be utilized, for example, a metallic foil (e.g., aluminum or titanium), a metallic substrate, an aluminum oxide coated polymer, parylene, a polymer coated with a metal applied via vapor metallization, a silicon dioxide coated polymer, or any material having a moisture vapor transmission rate less than 10 grams/100 in<sup>2 </sup>or preferably less than 1 gram/100 in<sup>2</sup>. First layer <b>122</b> and second layer <b>124</b> may seal an opening <b>126</b> in the bottom of removable cap <b>112</b>. Application of second layer <b>124</b> over first layer <b>122</b> after sterilization may further maintain sterility via the first layer and add a moisture barrier via the second layer.

It should further be appreciated that the implementation and/or execution of all methods and processes may be performed by any suitable devices or systems, whether local or remote. Further, any combination of devices or systems may be used to implement the present methods and processes.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0247">The above description presents the best mode contemplated for carrying out the present invention, and of the manner and process of making and using it, in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains to make and use this invention. This invention is, however, susceptible to modifications and alternate constructions from that discussed above that are fully equivalent. Consequently, this invention is not limited to the particular embodiments disclosed. On the contrary, this invention covers all modifications and alternate constructions coming within the spirit and scope of the invention as generally expressed by the following claims, which particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter of the invention. While the disclosure has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, such illustration and description are to be considered illustrative or exemplary and not restrictive.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0248">All references cited herein are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. To the extent publications and patents or patent applications incorporated by reference contradict the disclosure contained in the specification, the specification is intended to supersede and/or take precedence over any such contradictory material.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0249">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) are to be given their ordinary and customary meaning to a person of ordinary skill in the art, and are not to be limited to a special or customized meaning unless expressly so defined herein. It should be noted that the use of particular terminology when describing certain features or aspects of the disclosure should not be taken to imply that the terminology is being re-defined herein to be restricted to include any specific characteristics of the features or aspects of the disclosure with which that terminology is associated. Terms and phrases used in this application, and variations thereof, especially in the appended claims, unless otherwise expressly stated, should be construed as open ended as opposed to limiting. As examples of the foregoing, the term &#x2018;including&#x2019; should be read to mean &#x2018;including, without limitation,&#x2019; &#x2018;including but not limited to,&#x2019; or the like; the term &#x2018;comprising&#x2019; as used herein is synonymous with &#x2018;including,&#x2019; &#x2018;containing,&#x2019; or &#x2018;characterized by,&#x2019; and is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps; the term &#x2018;having&#x2019; should be interpreted as &#x2018;having at least;&#x2019; the term &#x2018;includes&#x2019; should be interpreted as &#x2018;includes but is not limited to;&#x2019; the term &#x2018;example&#x2019; is used to provide exemplary instances of the item in discussion, not an exhaustive or limiting list thereof; adjectives such as &#x2018;known&#x2019;, &#x2018;normal&#x2019;, &#x2018;standard&#x2019;, and terms of similar meaning should not be construed as limiting the item described to a given time period or to an item available as of a given time, but instead should be read to encompass known, normal, or standard technologies that may be available or known now or at any time in the future; and use of terms like &#x2018;preferably,&#x2019; &#x2018;preferred,&#x2019; &#x2018;desired,&#x2019; or &#x2018;desirable,&#x2019; and words of similar meaning should not be understood as implying that certain features are critical, essential, or even important to the structure or function of the invention, but instead as merely intended to highlight alternative or additional features that may or may not be utilized in a particular embodiment of the invention. Likewise, a group of items linked with the conjunction &#x2018;and&#x2019; should not be read as requiring that each and every one of those items be present in the grouping, but rather should be read as &#x2018;and/or&#x2019; unless expressly stated otherwise. Similarly, a group of items linked with the conjunction &#x2018;or&#x2019; should not be read as requiring mutual exclusivity among that group, but rather should be read as &#x2018;and/or&#x2019; unless expressly stated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0250">Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that the upper and lower limit, and each intervening value between the upper and lower limit of the range is encompassed within the embodiments.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0251">With respect to the use of substantially any plural and/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the art can translate from the plural to the singular and/or from the singular to the plural as is appropriate to the context and/or application. The various singular/plural permutations may be expressly set forth herein for sake of clarity. The indefinite article &#x2018;a&#x2019; or &#x2018;an&#x2019; does not exclude a plurality. A single processor or other unit may fulfill the functions of several items recited in the claims. The mere fact that certain measures are recited in mutually different dependent claims does not indicate that a combination of these measures cannot be used to advantage. Any reference signs in the claims should not be construed as limiting the scope.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0252">It will be further understood by those within the art that if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is intended, such an intent will be explicitly recited in the claim, and in the absence of such recitation no such intent is present. For example, as an aid to understanding, the following appended claims may contain usage of the introductory phrases &#x2018;at least one&#x2019; and &#x2018;one or more&#x2019; to introduce claim recitations. However, the use of such phrases should not be construed to imply that the introduction of a claim recitation by the indefinite articles &#x2018;a&#x2019; or &#x2018;an&#x2019; limits any particular claim containing such introduced claim recitation to embodiments containing only one such recitation, even when the same claim includes the introductory phrases &#x2018;one or more&#x2019; or &#x2018;at least one&#x2019; and indefinite articles such as &#x2018;a&#x2019; or &#x2018;an&#x2019; (e.g., &#x2018;a&#x2019; and/or &#x2018;an&#x2019; should typically be interpreted to mean &#x2018;at least one&#x2019; or &#x2018;one or more&#x2019;); the same holds true for the use of definite articles used to introduce claim recitations. In addition, even if a specific number of an introduced claim recitation is explicitly recited, those skilled in the art will recognize that such recitation should typically be interpreted to mean at least the recited number (e.g., the bare recitation of &#x2018;two recitations,&#x2019; without other modifiers, typically means at least two recitations, or two or more recitations). Furthermore, in those instances where a convention analogous to &#x2018;at least one of A, B, and C, etc.&#x2019; is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., &#x2018;a system having at least one of A, B, and C&#x2019; would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). In those instances where a convention analogous to &#x2018;at least one of A, B, or C, etc.&#x2019; is used, in general such a construction is intended in the sense one having skill in the art would understand the convention (e.g., &#x2018;a system having at least one of A, B, or C&#x2019; would include but not be limited to systems that have A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together, etc.). It will be further understood by those within the art that virtually any disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more alternative terms, whether in the description, claims, or drawings, should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms. For example, the phrase &#x2018;A or B&#x2019; will be understood to include the possibilities of &#x2018;A&#x2019; or &#x2018;B&#x2019; or &#x2018;A and B.&#x2019;</p><p id="p-0256" num="0253">All numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term &#x2018;about.&#x2019; Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth herein are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of any claims in any application claiming priority to the present application, each numerical parameter should be construed in light of the number of significant digits and ordinary rounding approaches.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0254">Furthermore, although the foregoing has been described in some detail by way of illustrations and examples for purposes of clarity and understanding, it is apparent to those skilled in the art that certain changes and modifications may be practiced. Therefore, the description and examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention to the specific embodiments and examples described herein, but rather to also cover all modification and alternatives coming with the true scope and spirit of the invention.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
