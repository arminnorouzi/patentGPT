is a parameter of the semantic representation model, f(*,&#x3b8;) is the corresponding semantic representation obtained after * is processed by the semantic representation model, &#x3c4; is a hyper-parameter, and sim( )represents a calculation of a similarity among vectors.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0051">After the contrast loss function is obtained, the semantic representation model may be trained using the contrast loss function; that is, the parameter of the semantic representation model is adjusted based on the contrast loss function until a preset ending condition is reached, the ending condition being, for example, convergence of the contrast loss function or achievement of a preset number of iterations; the model parameter obtained when the preset ending condition is reached is used as a final model parameter, and the corresponding semantic representation model is used as a final semantic representation model, such that the final semantic representation model may be applied to process the sentence to obtain a semantic representation corresponding to the sentence including the syntactic information.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0052">In the present embodiment, the positive sample and the negative sample are obtained based on the syntactic information of the sentence, and the semantic representation model is trained based on the anchor sample, the positive sample, and the negative sample, such that the semantic representation of the sentence may include the syntactic information without modifying the structure of the model.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">Further, the method according to the present embodiment may be applied to a pretraining process; that is, in the pretraining process of the semantic representation model, the above-mentioned contrast loss function is adopted for training without changing the structure of the pretrained model, such that when the pretrained model is applied to a downstream task, the downstream task is unaware of the process. In addition, when the pretrained model is applied to a fine tuning operation in the downstream task, the syntactic information is not required to be introduced, and therefore, a performance of the downstream task is not influenced. In the present embodiment, the syntactic information may be implicitly included in the semantic representation, and compared with a method in which the syntactic information is used explicitly (for example, addition of a pretraining task for predicting a parent node of each token), the method according to the present embodiment may avoid syntactic error accumulation and improve accuracy of the semantic representation model.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic diagram according to a fifth embodiment of the present disclosure, and the present embodiment provides an apparatus for training a semantic representation model.
