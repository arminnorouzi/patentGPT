Such non-foamed aqueous compositions are applied generally to only one side of such fabric substrates to reduce light glare inside the room or cabin. The non-foamed aqueous compositions contain porous particles, a film-forming binder material including at least a chlorinated polymer, a white inorganic filler material having a refractive index greater than 2, and a white low-density particulate hydrated alumina.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Windows are the most common way to admit light into a room. Other ways light can be streamed into a space is through light-transmitting fenestration such as skylights and glass doors. In general, at least for windows, various window treatments such as antiglare films, woven shades, roller blinds, and drapes can be used to modulate the nature of light entering the space to maximize visual comfort and to reduce energy use in air-conditioned spaces. Unlike antiglare films, rolling solar shades and other textile treatments are more versatile as they can be opened or closed as needed and they come in a variety of colors and geometric shapes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">High-end window treatments such as roller shades or screens are designed to provide a level of privacy from the outside while maintaining a good view of the outside environment from within the room. During daytime hours, this requires very good control of glare caused by bright sunlight coming into a room. Light coloration of window treatments lets more light through causing higher glare while darker window treatments absorb more light coming through, reducing glare. Moreover, in order to maintain a high level of privacy, it is imperative to block the view from outside looking in. An advantage of light coloration in window treatments, especially for the street side is that it increases glare and reflection for a viewer looking in, thereby increasing privacy.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">High-efficiency window shades are intended to control heat and glare for a chosen coloration. Materials having such properties are marketed by MERMET as E Screen&#x2122; materials and are available as a variety of woven vinyl coated fiberglass fabric with a range of Openness Factors (OF, the percentage of open holes in a material or the number of open holes per square inch). The tighter the weave, the lower the openness and the material blocks more incident light. The more incident light is blocked, the more the views from the inside and outside are blocked. Such window shades come in several neutral shades from white to charcoal black. The goal, however, is to provide privacy from the street side while maintaining a good view of the outside from the inside, using a higher Openness Factor for all shade colorations.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Such high-efficiency window shade materials can be designed using yarns having a multifilament core that can be clad or coated with a flame retardant polymeric plastisol or other chemicals, for example as described in EP Patent 0 900 294B1 (Damour et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 9,920,458 (MERMET). For example, the described multifilament core can be composed on multiple strands of fiberglass and clad with a poly(vinyl chloride) plastisol in mixture with inorganic flame retardants such as zinc borate, or oxides of aluminum, magnesium, zinc, tin, and lead.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One use for such fabrics is as window shades for installation into commercial sites. Synthetic woven fabrics consisting of bonded PVC-coated polyester and fiberglass yarns are also described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,587,997 (Brooks) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,032,454 (Damour et al.). Such fiberglass core yarns with plastic coatings are considered to provide durability and dimensional stability.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Patent Application Publication 2020/0173067 (Sedita et al.) describes fabric substrates made using yarns having fiberglass cores. Such fiberglass cores are coaxially coated with a composition containing organic porous particles, a film-forming binder, and a relatively soft inorganic filler (MOHS value less than 5). Such compositions do not contain opacifying colorants such as carbon black. By applying this composition to the fiberglass core of the yarn, the resulting fabric substrates demonstrate increased opacity and glare control over those previously known in the art.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Despite the advances provided in the technical field of yarns and textiles produced therefrom as described above, there is a further need to improve the quality of solar irradiance control of white or near white woven textiles designed as window screens, and to further reduce glare inside a room from incident outside light for improved view from the inside, especially when the fabrics are composed of yarns that comprise multifilament fiberglass. It is also needed to reduce the inside glare while reflectance and glare on the &#x201c;street side&#x201d; are undiminished to foster privacy from those looking into the room.

Thus, the formed and generally dry coating becomes light-attenuating particularly to reduce glare from incident sunlight, while providing privacy from an outside source.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The inventive non-foamed aqueous composition solves problems noted above because of the presence of i) porous particles that can opacify visible light coming into the room by their use in woven fiberglass-containing yarns, ii) a film-forming binder material comprising at least a chlorinated polymer that acts as a binder for the components of the non-foamed light attenuating coating and provides adhesion to the woven yarns, a relatively high refractive index iii) inorganic particulate filler material that adds to the lightness of the coloration, and iv) a white low-density particulate hydrated alumina that acts as a filler and confers flame retardancy and lightness of coloration, as described below.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">This invention can be used to provide coated fabric substrates having a dry non-foamed light-attenuating coating on at least on one side thereon without noticeably degrading the OF or the open holes in the fabric material, and that can be fabricated for window and other glass covered light transmitting fenestration treatments, in the form of roller shades, solar screens, signage, and the like to control light coming into a space or room.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The following discussion is directed to various embodiments of the present invention and while some embodiments can be desirable for specific uses, the disclosed embodiments should not be interpreted or otherwise considered to limit the scope of the present invention, as claimed below. In addition, one skilled in the art will understand that the following disclosure has broader application than is explicitly described for any specific embodiment.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As used herein to define various components of the non-foamed aqueous composition, fabric substrate materials, or materials used to prepare the porous particles, unless otherwise indicated, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include one or more of the components (that is, including plurality referents).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Each term that is not explicitly defined in the present application is to be understood to have a meaning that is commonly accepted by those skilled in the art. If the construction of a term would render it meaningless or essentially meaningless in its context, the term definition should be taken from a standard dictionary.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The use of numerical values in the various ranges specified herein, unless otherwise expressly indicated otherwise, are considered to be approximations as though the minimum and maximum values within the stated ranges were both preceded by the word &#x201c;about.&#x201d; In this manner, slight variations above and below the stated ranges can be used to achieve substantially the same results as the values within the ranges. In addition, the disclosure of these ranges is intended as a continuous range including every value between the minimum and maximum values.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The terms &#x201c;porous particle&#x201d; and &#x201c;porous particles&#x201d; are used herein, unless otherwise indicated, to refer to porous organic polymeric materials described below in more detail. The porous particles generally comprise a solid continuous polymeric phase having an external particle surface and discrete pores dispersed within the continuous polymeric phase. The continuous polymeric phase also can be chemically crosslinked or elastomeric in nature, or both chemically crosslinked and elastomeric in nature.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The i) porous particles can include &#x201c;micro,&#x201d; &#x201c;meso,&#x201d; and &#x201c;macro&#x201d; discrete pores, which according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, are the classifications recommended for discrete pore sizes of less than 2 nm, from 2 nm to 50 nm, and greater than 50 nm, respectively. Thus, while the i) porous particles can include closed discrete pores of all sizes and shapes (that is, closed discrete pores entirely within the continuous polymeric phase) providing a suitable volume in each discrete pore, macro discrete pores are particularly useful. While there can be open macro pores on the surface of the i) porous particle, such open pores are not desirable and can be present only by accident. The size of the i) porous particles, their formulation, and manufacturing conditions are the primary controlling factors for discrete pore size. However, typically the discrete pores independently have an average size of at least 100 nm and up to and including 7,000 nm, or more likely at least 200 nm and up to and including 2,000 nm. Whatever the size of the discrete pores, they are generally distributed randomly throughout the continuous polymeric phase.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">When used in describing certain particulate sizes, the term &#x201c;median particle size&#x201d; has the standard definition known in the art, for example, referring to the d<sub>50 </sub>size of a particle size distribution.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Openness Factor (OF) refers to, the percentage of open holes in a fabric construction per area, and is sometimes referred to as &#x201c;weave density.&#x201d; The lower the OF, the greater the visible light that is obstructed, scattered, or blocked, which in turn depends on the spacing and dimension of the yarn.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Different types of window treatments along with the window glass used can affect the amount of light transmission through windows.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Total visible reflection (TVR), according to the present invention, refers to the percentage of measured visible light at normal incidence that is diffusely reflected off a woven fabric facing the street-side. TVR can be measured, for example, as described below in the 400-700 nm wavelength range using a Hunter Labs UltraScan XE spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere, a pulsed Xenon light source, and a solid-state diode array detector.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Total visible transmission (TVT), according to the present invention, refers to the percentage of measured visible light at normal incidence directly transmitted through a screen into the inside of a room. This is a measure of how much visible light is admitted into the room by a woven fabric substrate used as the window treatment. TVT can be measured, for example, as described below in the 400-700 nm wavelength range using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 800 UV-Vis spectrophotometer.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Diffuse visible transmission (DVT), according to the present invention, refers to the percentage of visible light transmitted through a yarn from the street-side that does not directly pass through the open holes of the fabric substrate, including light reflected off the sides of the translucent woven yarn that surround the open holes. The lower this value, the lower the light glare in a room. DVT can be measured as described below, for example, similarly to measurement of TVT, but using a light trap to collect all of the non-scattered light.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The non-scattered visible transmission (NVT) according to the present invention is the percentage of light that passes only through the open areas of the fabric weave and not through the fibers of the fabric. NVT can be estimated by subtracting DVT from TVT and therefore can be related to how tight the weave is in a fabric substrate and in turn, reduce the OF.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Whiteness Index (WI) is a measure that correlates the visual ratings of whiteness for certain white and near-white surfaces. The American Standards Test Methods (ASTM) E313-10 has defined whiteness index and is used for measuring near-white, opaque materials such as paper, paint, and plastic materials, or for measuring any material whose color (coloration) appears white.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">CIELAB L*, a*, and b* values described herein have the known definitions according to CIE 1976 color space or later known standard versions of color space and were calculated using the power distribution function for a standard D65 illuminant and the 10&#xb0; Standard Observer function. These calculated values can be used to express a color as three numerical color values: L* for the lightness (or brightness) of the color, a* for the green-red component of the color, and b* for the blue-yellow component of the color.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Refractive index (RI) or index of refraction refers to the known property of the measure or the extent of a material's ability to bend light as the light passes from one medium to another, or through an interface. The refractive indices of many materials in nature are well known and reported in the literature.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Glass transition temperatures of the organic polymers used to prepare either the continuous polymeric phase, or the ii) film-forming binder materials described below, can be measured using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) using known equipment and procedures. For many commercially available organic polymers, the glass transition temperatures are known from commercial suppliers.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As used herein, a &#x201c;yarn&#x201d; is a continuous length of interlocked fiber strands. Yarns are classified according to their structure into three basic categories: staple fiber yarns are made of several short staple fibers that are wound together; ply yarns are made of one or more strands of staple fiber yarns; a single ply yarn is a single strand of staple fibers held together by twisting. Multi-ply yarns are made of multiple single yarns twisted together. Filament yarn is made of one or more continuous strands that run the entire length of the yarn and are longer than staple fibers. Multiple filaments can be woven together or intertwined in a suitable manner or arranged together as a bundle with or without intertwining.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As used herein, a &#x201c;coated yarn&#x201d; is a yarn that has a &#x201c;yarn core&#x201d; on which a coating is disposed as described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;fabric,&#x201d; &#x201c;textile,&#x201d; and &#x201c;fabric substrate&#x201d; are meant to refer to materials can be or prepared according to the present invention, of any desirable diameter or length.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Uses</heading><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The non-foamed aqueous compositions according to this invention can be used to prepare various coated fabric substrates (coated textiles) having the properties described above. Such coated (or treated) fabric substrates can be used as, for example, curtains and other window treatments, window blinds, room dividers, cubicle curtains, and banners. Coated fabric substrates can optionally have a printable outer surface that is able to accept ink used in screen printing, gravure printing, inkjet printing, thermal imaging (such as &#x201c;dye sublimation thermal transfer&#x201d;), or other imaging processes.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Non-Foamed Aqueous Compositions</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The inventive non-foamed aqueous compositions generally have a % solids of at least 5% or at least 25% and up to and including 40% or up to and including 50%. The formulation can be designed with a desired % solids in order to facilitate a desired means for applying to a fabric substrate, as described below. In some embodiments, the % solids is optimized for application using spray coating as described below.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Moreover, the inventive non-foamed aqueous compositions typically are shear thinning and exhibit a zero shear viscosity (measured at very low shear rates and displays the viscosity of a material at rest) of at least 100 mPa-sec or at least 500 mPa-sec, and up to and including 750 mPa-sec or up to and including 1000 mPa-sec, all measured at 25&#xb0; C. using a frequency sweep using commercially available rheological equipment and procedures (for example, using an Anton Pair MCR 501 instrument as described below for the working examples. &#x201c;Zero shear viscosity&#x201d; is a term known in the art as described for example, referring to the viscosity plateau prior to the onset of shear thinning. This phenomenon could occur at very low shear rates, but for certain materials it can still also occur at very high shear rates.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">It is essential that there be minimal air bubbles (or other gaseous voids) in the non-foamed aqueous composition since air bubbles can reduce the uniformity of coating or application to a fabric substrate or they can allow light passage through the dry coating, and thereby diminish the light-attenuating properties of the resulting dry coatings. As noted below, to minimize or prevent foaming of the non-foamed aqueous composition, it can include a water-soluble or water-dispersible v) defoaming agent or anti-foaming agent described below in an appropriate amount, but such components may not be essential in every embodiment. However, in general, it is desired that the non-foamed aqueous composition has a density (or &#x201c;foam density&#x201d;) of greater than 0.8 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>or greater than 0.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In many embodiments, the non-foamed aqueous composition according to this invention contains four essential components, all defined below: i) porous particles; ii) film-forming binder material; iii) white inorganic particulate filler material; and iv) white low-density particulate hydrated alumina.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">For the method described below in which coated fabric substrates are prepared according to the present invention, the inventive non-foamed aqueous composition is used to form or provide a non-foamed light-attenuating coating on a fabric substrate.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">i) Porous Particles:</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Each of the i) porous particles useful in the non-foamed aqueous composition comprises a continuous polymeric phase and discrete pores distributed within the continuous phase and has a mode particle size of at least 2 &#x3bc;m and up to and including 50 &#x3bc;m. The i) porous particles can be prepared using one or more water-in-oil emulsions in combination with an aqueous suspension process, such as in the Evaporative Limited Coalescence (ELC) process. The details for the preparation of i) porous particles and their common properties are provided, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 8,110,628 (Nair et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 8,703,834 (Nair), 7,754,409 (Nair et al.), 7,887,984 (Nair et al.), 8,329,783 (Nair et al.), and 8,252,414 (Putnam et al.), the disclosures of all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Thus, each porous particle is generally polymeric and organic in nature (that is, the continuous polymeric phase is polymeric and organic in nature) and non-porous particles (having less than 20 volume % porosity) are generally excluded for use in the present invention.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Unlike the porous particles used in the multifilament cladding described below, it is possible that the i) porous particles used according to the present invention can contain a certain amount of one or more opacifying colorants described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Each of the i) porous particles generally has a porosity of at least 20 volume % or of at least 35 volume % and up to and including 65 volume % or up to and including 70 volume %, or more typically a porosity of at least 40 volume % and up to and including 60 volume %, all based on the total porous particle volume. Porosity can be measured using the mercury intrusion technique using equipment and procedures that would be readily apparent to one skilled in the art of polymer and physical chemistry.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The i) porous particles can be composed of a continuous polymeric phase derived from one or more organic polymers that are chosen so that the continuous polymeric phase has a glass transition temperature (T<sub>g</sub>) of at least 25&#xb0; C., or more typically of at least 25&#xb0; C. and up to and including 180&#xb0; C., as determined using Differential Scanning Calorimetry using known equipment and procedures.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The continuous polymeric phase can comprise one or more organic polymers having the properties noted above that comprise generally at least 70 weight % and up to and including 100 weight % based on the total weight of the continuous polymeric phase. In some embodiments, the continuous polymeric phase is composed of one or more cellulose polymers (or cellulosic polymers) including but not limited to, those cellulosic polymers derived from one or more of cellulose acetate, cellulose butyrate, cellulose acetate butyrate, and cellulose acetate propionate. Details about such polymers are provided, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 9,963,569 (Nair et al.), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Other useful polymers for composing the continuous polymeric phase are described in the incorporated Nair, Nair et al., and Putnam et al. patents noted above so the known details are omitted here. Mixtures of one or more of such polymers with one or more of the cellulose polymers described above can also be used.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The continuous polymeric binder of the i) porous particles can also be derived from ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable monomers and polyfunctional reactive compounds as described for example in U.S. Pat. No. 8,703,834 (noted above).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In general, the i) porous particles used in the present invention have a mode particle size equal to or less than 50 &#x3bc;m, or of at least 2 &#x3bc;m and up to and including 50 &#x3bc;m, or typically of at least 3 &#x3bc;m and up to and including 30 &#x3bc;m or even up to and including 40 &#x3bc;m. Most useful i) porous particles have a mode particle size of at least 3 &#x3bc;m and up to and including 20 &#x3bc;m. Mode particle size is a known parameter and represents the most frequently occurring diameter for spherical particles and the most frequently occurring largest diameter for the non-spherical particles in a particle size distribution histogram, which can be determined using known equipment (including light scattering equipment such as the Sysmex FPIA 3000 Flow Particle Image Analyzer that used image analysis measurements and that can be obtained from various sources including Malvern Panalytical; and coulter counters and other particle characterizing equipment available from Beckman Coulter Diagnostics), software, and procedures.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The i) porous particles can be provided as powders, or as aqueous suspensions (including water or water with water-miscible organic solvents such as alcohols). Such powders and aqueous suspensions can also include surfactants or suspending agents to keep the i) porous particles suspended or to facilitate rewetting them in an aqueous medium.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The i) porous particles can be present in the non-foamed aqueous compositions according to the present invention in an amount of at least 0.1 weight % or of at least 5 weight %, and up to and including 15 weight % or up to and including 20 weight %, all based on the total weight of the non-foamed aqueous composition.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As discussed in more detail below, some i) porous particles can comprise one or more opacifying colorants (defined below), while other i) porous particles do not. Mixtures of i) porous particles with and without opacifying colorants can be used, and the different i) porous particles can be composed of the same or different polymeric materials and have the same or different mode particle sizes and porosities.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Some particularly useful optional components are what are identified herein as &#x201c;opacifying colorants&#x201d; that can be used as a single colorant material or chosen from any suitable combination of colorants such that the single or multiple colorants form the &#x201c;opacifying colorant&#x201d; that absorbs predetermined electromagnetic radiation (typically from UV to near-IR, for example, from 350 nm to 800 nm, or from 350 nm to 700 nm). Opacifying colorants can be soluble dyes or pigments or combinations of each or both types of materials.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">When present, one or more opacifying colorants can be present within a volume of discrete pores within some or all of the i) porous particles or within the continuous polymeric binder of the i) porous particles, or within both the volume of the discrete pores and the continuous polymeric binder of the i) porous particles. This is highly advantageous as the i) porous particles can be used to &#x201c;encapsulate&#x201d; various opacifying colorants as well as tinting colorants and other additives so they are kept isolated from the other components of the non-foamed aqueous composition and are additionally not exposed to the environment. However, in some embodiments, it can be useful to incorporate opacifying agents solely or additionally within the ii) film-forming binder material in which the i) porous particles are dispersed.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As used herein, an opacifying colorant includes one or more colorant materials that are chosen, individually or in combination, to provide blocking of predetermined electromagnetic radiation (as defined above). While the opacifying colorants can provide some coloration or desired hue, they are not purposely chosen for this purpose and are thus materials that are chosen to be different from any tinting colorants included within the non-foamed aqueous composition especially since the opacifying colorants are within the i) porous particles.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Examples of opacifying colorants that can be used individually or in combination include but are not limited to, neutral or black pigments or dyes, carbon blacks, black iron oxide, graphite, aniline black, anthraquinone black, and combinations of colored pigments or dyes chosen from cyan, magenta, yellow, green, orange, blue, red and, and violet dyes or pigments, and infrared absorbing pigments or dyes. The present invention is not limited to using only the specific opacifying colorants described herein but these are considered as representative and as suitable guidance for a skilled worker to devise other combinations of opacifying colorants for the desired absorption of the predetermined electromagnetic radiation. A carbon black is particularly useful as an opacifying colorant, especially when present in the discrete pores of the i) porous particles, of which there are many types of carbon black available from commercial sources. Combinations of dyes or pigments such as a combination of the subtractive primary colored pigments (cyan, magenta, and yellow colored pigments) can also be used to provide a &#x201c;black&#x201d; or visually neutral opacifying colorant.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The opacifying colorant can be generally present in the non-foamed aqueous composition in an amount of up to 1 weight %, or more likely in an amount of at least 0.005 weight % and up to and including 1 weight %, all based on the total weight of the i) porous particles in the non-foamed aqueous composition (and a resulting non-foamed light-attenuating coating). Mixtures of the noted opacifying colorants can be used if desired and these amounts also refer to the total amount of a mixture of opacifying colorants. For example, as noted above, an opacifying colorant can comprise a combination of two or more component colorants (such as a combination of dyes or a combination of pigments) designed in hues and amounts so that the combination meets the desired properties described herein.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition, different i) porous particles can contain different opacifying colorants as long as the total amount meets the noted ranges above. Moreover, some i) porous particles can contain opacifying colorant(s) while other i) porous particles can contain no opacifying colorants, and such different i) porous particles can be used alone or in combination.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, the opacifying colorants, if in pigment form, are generally milled to a fine particle size and then encapsulated within the volume of the discrete pores of the porous particles by incorporating the milled pigment within an aqueous phase used in making the porous particles. Alternatively, the opacifying colorant can be incorporated within the continuous polymeric phase of the porous particles by incorporating the opacifying colorant in the oil phase used in making the porous particles. Such arrangements can be achieved during the manufacture of the i) porous particles using the teaching provided herein and teaching provided in references cited herein.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">ii) Film-Forming Binder Materials:</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">One or more ii) film-forming binder materials are present in the non-foamed aqueous compositions, and each film-forming binder material is designed or chosen so that it has the following properties: it is generally water-soluble or water-dispersible; it is capable of adhering well to the woven yarns of the fabric substrate; it is capable of being dried and where desired also crosslinked (or at least partially cured); it has good light and heat stability; and it is film-forming, for example having a T<sub>g </sub>of less than 25&#xb0; C., a T<sub>g </sub>of less than or equal to 0&#xb0; C., or a T<sub>g </sub>of less than or equal to &#x2212;10&#xb0; C., or a T<sub>g </sub>of less than or equal to &#x2212;25&#xb0; C., all determined using Differential Scanning Calorimetry.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The ii) film-forming binder materials can include one or more organic polymers that can be provided as an emulsion, dispersion, or in an aqueous solution.

Pure liquids do not foam. Aqueous solutions or dispersions containing additives such as surfactants and filler materials and other particles are prone to foam formation in water. In the practice of the present invention, the presence of foam or entrained air is generally undesirable and can significantly impact the outcome (for example, appearance and performance of the resulting coated fabric substrate). To prevent foam and the problems it generates, and to keep the process running smoothly, many embodiments of the non-foamed aqueous compositions of this invention include one or more defoaming agents.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The chemistry of defoaming agents and anti-foaming agents is often similar, their main difference being timing of application. Defoaming agents can be used to control any existing foam in an aqueous composition while anti-foaming agents can be used to prevent the formation of foam in an aqueous composition.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Typically, anti-foaming agents and defoaming agents are inert (or non-reactive) chemicals. They are typically comprised of a liquid or hydrophobic solid. An effective anti-foaming agent must be insoluble in the medium it is used in or it will not perform the desired function. However, an anti-foaming agent must not be so incompatible in the aqueous composition so as to cause deposition problems. Such materials are different from all of the i) porous particles, ii) film-forming binder materials, iii) white inorganic particulate filler materials, and iv) white low-density particulate hydrated alumina, and different from the vi) flame retardants described below. Such materials are intended in the present invention to either break down a foam or to prevent the formation of foam in the non-foamed aqueous composition. Even modest mixing of chemical components can tend to form some foam, for example so the presence of a defoaming agent can serve to minimize foam formation, so that the eventual non-foamed aqueous composition can be applied to a fabric substrate while having a density of greater than 0.8 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, or even greater than 0.9 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Useful v) defoaming agents and anti-foaming agents include but are not limited to, liquids such as mineral oil, silicone, and/or hydrophobic polyol, and a hydrophobic solid, such as hydrophobic silica, ethylene-bis-stearamide, fatty acid, and/or fatty alcohol.

Chlorinated polymers such as poly(vinyl chloride) and poly(vinylidene chloride) are inherently self-extinguishing, flame retardant materials due to the presence of chlorine in the compositions. Poly(vinyl chloride) can also be used to coat the core yarns used to make fabric substrates. Additionally, some fiberglass-containing yarns are inherently flame retardant. The ii) film-forming binder materials, and the iv) white low-density particulate hydrated alumina, both described above, can also act as flame retardants in the practice of this invention. Hydrated alumina is known to be a flame retardant and a smoke suppressing filler.

The desired coloration or hue can be obtained using specific tinting colorants and can be used in combination with specific amounts of i) porous particles to offset or modify the original color to provide more whiteness (or brightness) in the final &#x201c;color&#x201d; (or coloration). The one or more tinting colorants can be incorporated within the i) porous particles (either within the volume of discrete pores, within the continuous polymeric phase, or in both places), or they can be uniformly dispersed within the ii) film-forming binder material. Alternatively, one or more tinting colorants can be present within both the i) porous particles (in a suitable location) and within the ii) film-forming binder material. Tinting colorants can be dyes or organic pigments that are soluble or dispersible in organic solvents and polymers that are used for making the i) porous particles and thus can be included within the oil phase used to prepare such i) porous particles.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">It can also be useful to include one or more optical brighteners to increase the whiteness (brightness, L*, or &#x201c;fluorescent&#x201d; effect) of the final coloration in the non-foamed light-attenuating coating.

The second (or street) side of the fabric substrate then would generally have incident outside light or radiation and be seen, for example, by someone outside the room or building and, can be referred to as the street side.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">A non-foamed light-attenuating coating is then formed generally on the first side of a suitable fabric substrate, and by application of a non-foamed aqueous composition that is generally dried using conventional means, and optionally cured to provide a coated fabric substrate according to the present invention. Drying and optional curing can be accomplished by, for example, using hot air at 120&#xb0; C. for up to two minutes or heating at a temperature greater 135&#xb0; C. for up to three minutes. By the term &#x201c;dry&#x201d;, it is meant that the non-foamed light-attenuating coating generally comprises less than 5 weight %, or even less than 1 weight %, or water or other liquids. The amounts of the various essential and optional components of the non-foamed light-attenuating coating are as follows:</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">i) porous particles as described above are generally present in an amount of at least 0.5 weight % or at least 2 weight % and up to and including 20 weight % or up to and including 40 weight %, which i) porous particles can optionally comprise an opacifying colorant, as described above, in an amount of at least 0.01 weight % or at least 0.1 weight %, and up to and including 0.3 weight % or up to and including 1 weight %, based on the total weight of the i) porous particles;</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">ii) a film-forming binder material comprising at least a chlorinated polymer (as described above), which ii) film-forming binder material, as described above, and being present in an amount of at least 15 weight % or at least 20 weight % and up to and including 35 weight % or up to and including 50 weight %;</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">iii) a white inorganic particulate filler material having a refractive index (RI) greater than 2 and a median particle size of less than 1 &#x3bc;m, the iii) inorganic particulate filler material being present in an amount of at least 8 weight % or at least 15 weight %, and up to and including 30 weight % or up to an including 40 weight %; and</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">iv) a white low-density particulate hydrated alumina having a median particle size of less than or equal to 3 &#x3bc;m, as described above, and being present in an amount of at least 10 weight % or at least 20 weight %, and up to and including 30 weight % or up to and including 50 weight %,</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">all amounts of the i), ii), iii), and iv) components being based on the total weight of the non-foamed light-attenuating dry coating.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">The non-foamed aqueous composition can be applied as a conformal coating to the first side of a fabric substrate using a suitable application means, such as spray coating, such that the openness facture (OF) is only minimally reduced (that is, reduction of less than 20% of the original openness factor), and the resulting coating covers only the top surface of the fibers and optionally the sides of the fibers without flowing significantly to the second side of the fabric substrate. It is beneficial to place an adsorbent pad directly behind and in intimate contact with the second side to achieve these results.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">The parameters of a spray system used for such application, such as the size of the nozzle tip, coating speed, duty cycle, and distance between sample and the spray nozzle, can be optimized by a skilled worker for controlling coating weight, coating thickness, coating uniformity, and coating reproducibility. Examples of spray coating for various fabric substrates ranging from small squares to roll-to-roll high speed continuous and scalable fabrication include airbrushing and atomized spray techniques.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">There are also several methods for spraying aqueous compositions onto surfaces that are known in the art and they can be used in the practice of this invention. These include but are not limited to, compressed air spraying that converts the drops of the non-foamed aqueous composition into a mist; electrostatic spray systems where application of an electric field at the nozzle controls the drop size and the electric field between the drop of non-foamed aqueous composition and the surface controls its deposition; ultrasonic spray systems where the ultrasonic energy can be used to create a mist of uniform drop size of the non-foamed aqueous composition; and rotary spraying that uses centrifugal force to atomize the non-foamed aqueous composition. The most common spray technology uses fluid pressure and nozzle design to create non-foamed aqueous composition drops of a desired size. In addition to controlling drop size, nozzle designs also include the geometry of an ensemble of drops exiting the nozzle. Such geometries include for example, a cone, a fan (trapezoidal), or a jet. The choice of the geometry is selected based on the application method and depends upon the orientation between the spray nozzle and the substrate and whether the spray system is mobile and the surface is stationary or vice versa or a combination of the two.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">A desirable method of applying the non-foamed aqueous composition according to the present invention is to use a stationary spray system with a moving surface. In this process, the desired geometry of the ensemble of non-foamed aqueous composition drops exiting a nozzle is a that of a fan with the first side of a fabric substrate moving perpendicularly to the plane of the fan. When the first side surface width is larger than the width of the fan, multiple nozzles can be employed and spaced apart such that the overlapping sprays from adjacent nozzles creates a uniform coverage of drops across the width of the first side of the fabric substrate. In addition to using hydraulic pressure to disperse the drops, other mechanical forces such as nozzle pulsation, ultrasound, centrifugal force, or air currents, or a combination of two or three of these means, can be used to aid uniform distribution of the non-foamed aqueous composition onto the first side of the fabric substrate. Another aspect of controlling the uniformity of depositing the non-foamed aqueous composition is to control its properties, specifically its viscosity and surface tension, which are properties well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, for achieving desirable small drops, the viscosity and surface tension at the shear rates experienced at the nozzle should be low. Hence shear thinning fluids are preferred such that the viscosity at the nozzle shear rates is low, lower than 10 mPa-sec, but the zero-shear viscosity is high, higher than 100 mPa-sec measured at 25&#xb0; C. using procedures and equipment described above. In such embodiments, the non-foamed aqueous composition comprises a suitable coating aid (for example, a wetting surfactant), such as any low molecular weight surfactant, which can lower the dynamic surface tension of the non-foamed aqueous composition and thus provide the lowest surface tension. Useful surfactants for this purpose are described above.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">A uniformly distributed coating of the non-foamed aqueous composition can thus be formed over (or directly onto) only the first side of the fabric substrate, by any spraying technique described above.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">The applied non-foamed aqueous composition can be dried by simple evaporation of water and any other solvents, to form the dry non-foamed light-attenuating coating on the first side of the fabric substrate. This drying can be accelerated by known techniques such as convection heating including forced air or infrared heating, or other means that would be apparent to one skilled in the art. The drying can also be carried out or continued in the optional curing operation described as follows.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">Curing the applied or formed non-foamed aqueous composition can be carried out under suitable conditions known to one skilled in the art For example, curing (and drying) can be accomplished using heat or infrared radiation or other conditions which are responsive to achieve crosslinking of the ii) film forming binder materials</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">The resulting coated fabric substrates can be cut to desired sizes, &#x201c;finished&#x201d; in any suitable manner, and images or text can be printed thereon as described above for the fabric substrates.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">The present invention provides at least the following embodiments and combinations thereof, but other combinations of features are considered to be within the present invention as a skilled artisan would appreciate from the teaching of this disclosure:</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">1.

compared to that for Comparative Example 1 (the uncoated commercial white/white E Screen&#x2122;), thereby lowering the glare in a room significantly when the inventive fabric substrate is used as a window treatment. The total light coming into the room, TVT, was also lowered without noticeably compromising the NVT (or by association, the OF). The WI on the other hand was maintained with only a&#x3c;10% lowering of the total visible reflectance (TVR). The same was true for the inventive coated fabric substrate of Invention Example 2 where the DVT was lowered by more than 50% compared to the DVT of the article of Comparative Example 1. In this instance, the WI and TVR were almost the same as the Comparative Example 1.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0213">For the coated fabric substrate of Comparative Example 2 in which no i) porous particles were present, the DVT was reduced by less than 35%, in spite of the significantly larger amount of iv) white low-density particulate hydrated alumina used to replace the i) porous particles.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0214">For the coated fabric substrate of Comparative Example 3 in which no porous particles were present, but only the equivalent amount of carbon black, the DVT was lowered as desired but so was the WI and the TVR to a visually noticeable extent compared to the coated fabric substrate of Invention Example 1.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0215">For the coated fabric substrate of Comparative Example 4 where the carbon black level was lowered to match that in the coated fabric substrate of Invention Example 2, the WI and TVR values decreased with the DVT thereby showing an advantage for the presence of i) porous particles in a dry non-foamed light-attenuating coating.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0216">The invention has been described in detail with particular reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, but it will be understood that variations and modifications can be obtained within the spirit and scope of the invention.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
