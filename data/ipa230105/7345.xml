Some conventional systems can keep track of television programs that have been viewed on all user devices in a particular household. Yet other conventional systems can keep track of television programs that have been viewed by individual household members on these user devices and generate user viewing histories for each household member. Typically, these conventional systems require the household member to create a user profile and associate the television programs viewed by the household member to his or her user profile. However, there is no provision in conventional systems to detect whether the correct user profile has been selected for the household member currently viewing television programs on a user device. If an incorrect user profile is selected, the user profile may be corrupted due to inclusion of the television programs that the household member has viewed while the incorrect user profile was selected.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Systems and methods are described to address shortcomings in conventional media systems via a novel technique to prevent corruption of a user's viewing profile. In some aspects, the systems and methods determine that a media asset, such as a television program, selected for viewing is inconsistent with the currently selected user viewing profile and determine another user viewing profile such that the media asset is consistent with the other user viewing profile. The systems and methods may be implemented via an interactive media guidance application running on a user device, a remote server, or another suitable device. The interactive media guidance application may be implemented partially on multiple devices such that some portions of the interactive media guidance application are executed on one device while other portions of the interactive media guidance application are executed on another device.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Certain viewing situations may not necessarily be a part of a user's ordinary viewing experience. These viewing situations may &#x201c;corrupt&#x201d; the user's viewing profile and therefore provide unwanted recommendations of particular media content to the user. For example, a father may view action films, sports programs, and news programs on a regular basis, but a child may occasionally view a cartoon program on his father's account, thereby &#x201c;corrupting&#x201d; his profile. In another example, the user may view one episode to see what all the hype is about for popular programming, such as the television program &#x201c;Downton Abbey.&#x201d; However, the television program may not necessarily be of interest to the user. When a particular television program is viewed on a user's account that is not consistent with their regular viewing habits, the interactive media guidance application may prompt the user to provide feedback on the particular television program (e.g., whether or not the user liked it) or whether the user would like to include the television program in the user's viewing profile. Accordingly, the user's viewing profile may be prevented from being corrupted if the media content is orthogonal to the user's typical viewing habits.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, a viewer may select a television program for viewing. The interactive media guidance application may retrieve the user's viewing profile or a set of rules associated with the user's viewing profile to analyze whether the television program is inconsistent with the user's viewing patterns. Additionally or alternatively, the interactive media guidance application may compare the television program to user viewing profiles from other users who have profiles similar to the current user. The interactive media guidance application may determine that the selected television program is inconsistent with the user's viewing profile and, in response, perform a related function. The interactive media guidance application may notify the user of the inconsistency. Additionally, the interactive media guidance application may prompt the user to confirm whether he or she would like to proceed with the selected television program. Additionally or alternatively, the interactive media guidance application may offer the user an option to proceed with the selected television program without updating the user's viewing profile to indicate that the user has viewed the television program.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additionally or alternatively, the interactive media guidance application may notify the user of the inconsistency and update another user's viewing profile that is consistent with the selected television program. The interactive media guidance application may update the other user's viewing profile automatically or prompt the user to affirmatively select the other user's viewing profile. For example, if a child selects a television program while the parent's user viewing profile is in use, the interactive media guidance application may recognize that the selected program is inconsistent with the parent's user viewing profile but consistent with the child's user viewing profile. The interactive media guidance application may update the child's user viewing profile, indicating the child has viewed the selected television program, instead of updating the parent's user viewing profile with the selected television program.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another example, the interactive media guidance application may determine that a selected television program is inconsistent with a currently selected child's user viewing profile and notify the parent regarding the inconsistency. For example, the child may have selected a television program that is inappropriate for him or her. The interactive media guidance application may notify the parent so he or she may review the television program for appropriateness. Alternatively, the parent may learn that another family member had selected the television program but it was inconsistent with the child's user viewing profile which was last used on the user device in question.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The user viewing profile may include information regarding the television programs the user has viewed in the past. The user viewing profile may include information such as genre, rating, actor, director, channel, air time, end time, air length, length watched, date, month, day of the week, and other suitable information relating to the television program. The interactive media guidance application or another suitable application may analyze information regarding television programs viewed by the user and determine trends across the information. For example, the interactive media guidance application may determine that a majority of the viewed television programs belong to the comedy genre. In such a case, if the user were to select a television program belonging to the horror genre, the interactive media guidance application may determine the selected television program to be inconsistent with the user's viewing profile.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another example, the interactive media guidance application may determine that the user predominantly watches television programs from the comedy genre on weekdays but watches television programs form the drama genre on weekends. In such a case, if the user were to select a television program belonging to the drama genre on a weekday, the interactive media guidance application may determine the selected television program to be inconsistent with the user's viewing profile. In another example, the interactive media guidance may determine that the user watches television programs relating to soccer games in the summer months but watches television programs relating to football games in the winter months. In such a case, if the user were to select a television program relating to soccer in a winter month, the interactive media guidance application may determine the selected television program to be inconsistent with the user's viewing profile.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The interactive media guidance application may analyze past determinations of inconsistent television programs being selected to determine similar future occurrences. For example, the interactive media guidance application may analyze multiple determinations of inconsistent television programs being selected during the Thanksgiving holiday. The user may have visitors at his or her home who may select television programs that are inconsistent with the user's viewing profile. The interactive media guidance application may determine that this period is appropriate for preventing updates to the user's viewing profile based on the selected television programs. In another example, the interactive media guidance application may analyze multiple determinations of inconsistent television programs being selected during the first week of new fall television programming. The user may be trying out new fall television programming to find a new favorite show, but some or all of the selected television programs may be inconsistent with the user's viewing profile. The interactive media guidance application may determine that this period is appropriate for preventing updates to the user's viewing profile based on the selected television programs.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The interactive media guidance application or another suitable application may determine rules based on the information in the user's viewing profile. The interactive media guidance application may store the rules in local memory for easy access while the user's viewing profile may be stored at a remote server. The rules may require less storage space and may be more resource efficient when determining whether a selected television program is consistent with the user's viewing profile. The rules may be updated when the information in the user's viewing profile is changed. In some embodiments, the rules are updated at every instance information is changed in the user's viewing profile. In some embodiments, the rules are updated at specified intervals of time. In some embodiments, the rules are updated after a threshold number of changes have occurred to the user's viewing profile.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some aspects, a user, such as a parent or a child, of the interactive media guidance application may select a media asset, such as television program &#x201c;Care Bears,&#x201d; for viewing on a user device, such as a set-top box, a television device, a mobile device, or another suitable device. The interactive media guidance application may receive a user viewing profile for a first user, such as the parent, from a remote server. Alternatively, the interactive media guidance application may have already received the user viewing profile for the first user from the remote server. The interactive media guidance application may determine whether the media asset is consistent with the user viewing profile for the first user. If the media asset is determined to not be consistent with the user viewing profile, the interactive media guidance application may retrieve another user viewing profile for another user of the user device, such as the child. The interactive media guidance application may determine whether the media asset is consistent with the other user viewing profile. If the media asset is determined to be consistent with the other user viewing profile, the interactive media guidance application may update the other user viewing profile based on the media asset.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some aspects, the systems and methods described herein provide for a method for preventing corruption of a first user viewing profile for a first user of a user device. The method may be implemented via an interactive media guidance application that is executed on control circuitry. The interactive media guidance application receives, from a remote server, the first user viewing profile including a first plurality of media assets. The interactive media guidance application determines a first set of rules for the first user viewing profile based on the first plurality of media assets. The interactive media guidance application receives a selection to view a media asset on the user device. The interactive media guidance application applies the first set of rules to the media asset to determine whether the media asset is consistent with the first user viewing profile.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In response to determining that the media asset is not consistent with the first user viewing profile, the interactive media guidance application retrieves, from the remote server, a second user viewing profile for a second user of the user device. The second user viewing profile includes a second plurality of media assets and is associated with a second set of rules. The interactive media guidance application further applies the second set of rules to the media asset to determine whether the media asset is consistent with the second user viewing profile. In response to determining that the media asset is consistent with the second user viewing profile, the interactive media guidance application updates the second user viewing profile to include the media asset in the second plurality of media assets. The interactive media guidance application further updates the second set of rules for the second user viewing profile based on the updated second plurality of media assets.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, in response to determining that the media asset is consistent with the first user viewing profile, the interactive media guidance application updates the first user viewing profile to include the media asset in the first plurality of media assets. The interactive media guidance application further updates the first set of rules for the first user viewing profile based on the updated first plurality of media assets.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the first set of rules is stored in a local memory of the user device and the first viewing profile is stored on the remote server.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application determines the first set of rules for the first user viewing profile based on the first plurality of media assets by retrieving one or more metadata tags for each of the first plurality of media assets, determining one or more trends in the one or more metadata tags for each of the first plurality of media assets, and determining the first set of rules based on the one or more trends.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the one more metadata tags includes one or more of a genre, a time slot, a title, a channel, a media source, a language, a month, a day of week, a parental rating, and a popularity rating.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application applies the first set of rules to the media asset to determine whether the media asset is consistent with the first user viewing profile by retrieving one or more metadata tags for the media asset, and determining, based on the one or more metadata tags, whether any of the first set of rules indicate a likelihood of the first user having selected the media asset.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application generates for display a prompt requesting confirmation from the first user whether to proceed with the selected media asset in response to determining that the media asset is not consistent with the first user viewing profile.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, in response to receiving the confirmation from the first user to proceed with the selected media asset, the interactive media guidance application generates for display another prompt requesting a passcode from the first user.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the interactive media guidance application receives the passcode. In response to the passcode being incorrect, the interactive media guidance application generates for display the media asset but prevents the media asset from being included in the first user viewing profile.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, in response to the passcode being correct, the interactive media guidance application generates for display the media asset and including the media asset in the first user viewing profile.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">There is no provision in conventional systems to detect whether the correct user profile has been selected for the household member currently viewing television programs on a user device. If an incorrect user profile is selected, the user profile may be corrupted due to inclusion of the television programs that the household member has viewed while the incorrect user profile was selected. The described systems and methods address shortcomings in conventional systems via a novel technique to prevent corruption of a user's viewing profile. In some aspects, the systems and methods determine that a media asset, such as a television program, selected for viewing is inconsistent with the currently selected user viewing profile and determine another user viewing profile such that the media asset is consistent with the other user viewing profile. While conventional systems require the household member to manually specify a user profile and associate the television programs viewed by the household member to the specified user profile, the described systems and methods can prevent corruption of a user's viewing profile by televisions programs being viewed by another user and optionally determine the other user's viewing profile as the television programs are viewed.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">It should be noted that the systems, methods, apparatuses, and/or aspects described above may be applied to, or used in accordance with, other systems, methods, apparatuses, and/or aspects described in this disclosure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The above and other objects and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an illustrative example of a display screen generated by a media guidance application in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows another illustrative example of a display screen generated by a media guidance application in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows yet another illustrative example of a display screen generated by a media guidance application in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows yet another illustrative example of a display screen generated by a media guidance application in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows yet another illustrative example of a display screen generated by a media guidance application in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows yet another illustrative example of a display screen generated by a media guidance application in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a block diagram of an illustrative user equipment device in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a block diagram of an illustrative media system in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process for preventing corruption of a first user viewing profile of a first user in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process for determining whether the selected media asset is consistent with the first user viewing profile in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Systems and methods are described to address shortcomings in conventional media systems via a novel technique to prevent corruption of a user's viewing profile. The systems and methods may be implemented via an interactive media guidance application running on a user device, a remote server, or another suitable device. The interactive media guidance application may be implemented partially on multiple devices such that some portions of the interactive media guidance application are executed on one device while other portions of the interactive media guidance application are executed on another device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an illustrative example of a display screen <b>100</b> generated by the interactive media guidance application. In the example, the user has requested television program &#x201c;Care Bears&#x201d; for viewing. For example, the user may be a parent who is a fan and wishes to view the television program. In another example, the user may wish to preview the television program and judge its appropriateness for his or her child. In yet another example, the user may be a parent who has accidentally selected this television program. In yet another example, the user may be a child who has selected to view the television program while the parent's user viewing profile is selected.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The interactive media guidance application may retrieve a user viewing profile for the parent, i.e., the currently selected user, from remote sources <b>816</b> or <b>818</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) and/or a set of rules for the parent's user viewing profile from local storage <b>708</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). When a particular television program is viewed on a user's account that is not consistent with their regular viewing habits, the interactive media guidance application may generate prompt <b>102</b> and notify the user via message <b>104</b> that the selected program is inconsistent with the user's viewing profile. The user may choose to proceed via option <b>106</b> or cancel viewing of the television program via option <b>108</b>.

Consequently, many users desire a form of media guidance through an interface that allows users to efficiently navigate content selections and easily identify content that they may desire. An application that provides such guidance is referred to herein as an interactive media guidance application or, sometimes, a media guidance application or a guidance application.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Interactive media guidance applications may take various forms depending on the content for which they provide guidance. One typical type of media guidance application is an interactive television program guide. Interactive television program guides (sometimes referred to as electronic program guides) are well-known guidance applications that, among other things, allow users to navigate among and locate many types of content or media assets. Interactive media guidance applications may generate graphical user interface screens that enable a user to navigate among, locate and select content. As referred to herein, the terms &#x201c;media asset&#x201d; and &#x201c;content&#x201d; should be understood to mean an electronically consumable user asset, such as television programming, as well as pay-per-view programs, on-demand programs (as in video-on-demand (VOD) systems), Internet content (e.g., streaming content, downloadable content, Webcasts, etc.), video clips, audio, content information, pictures, rotating images, documents, playlists, websites, articles, books, electronic books, blogs, chat sessions, social media, applications, games, and/or any other media or multimedia and/or combination of the same. Guidance applications also allow users to navigate among and locate content. As referred to herein, the term &#x201c;multimedia&#x201d; should be understood to mean content that utilizes at least two different content forms described above, for example, text, audio, images, video, or interactivity content forms. Content may be recorded, played, displayed or accessed by user equipment devices, but can also be part of a live performance.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The media guidance application and/or any instructions for performing any of the embodiments discussed herein may be encoded on computer readable media. Computer readable media includes any media capable of storing data. The computer readable media may be transitory, including, but not limited to, propagating electrical or electromagnetic signals, or may be non-transitory including, but not limited to, volatile and non-volatile computer memory or storage devices such as a hard disk, floppy disk, USB drive, DVD, CD, media cards, register memory, processor caches, Random Access Memory (&#x201c;RAM&#x201d;), etc.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">With the advent of the Internet, mobile computing, and high-speed wireless networks, users are accessing media on user equipment devices on which they traditionally did not. As referred to herein, the phrase &#x201c;user equipment device,&#x201d; &#x201c;user equipment,&#x201d; &#x201c;user device,&#x201d; &#x201c;electronic device,&#x201d; &#x201c;electronic equipment,&#x201d; &#x201c;media equipment device,&#x201d; or &#x201c;media device&#x201d; should be understood to mean any device for accessing the content described above, such as a television, a Smart TV, a set-top box, an integrated receiver decoder (IRD) for handling satellite television, a digital storage device, a digital media receiver (DMR), a digital media adapter (DMA), a streaming media device, a DVD player, a DVD recorder, a connected DVD, a local media server, a BLU-RAY player, a BLU-RAY recorder, a personal computer (PC), a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a WebTV box, a personal computer television (PC/TV), a PC media server, a PC media center, a hand-held computer, a stationary telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile telephone, a portable video player, a portable music player, a portable gaming machine, a smart phone, or any other television equipment, computing equipment, or wireless device, and/or combination of the same. In some embodiments, the user equipment device may have a front facing screen and a rear facing screen, multiple front screens, or multiple angled screens. In some embodiments, the user equipment device may have a front facing camera and/or a rear facing camera. On these user equipment devices, users may be able to navigate among and locate the same content available through a television. Consequently, media guidance may be available on these devices, as well. The guidance provided may be for content available only through a television, for content available only through one or more of other types of user equipment devices, or for content available both through a television and one or more of the other types of user equipment devices. The media guidance applications may be provided as on-line applications (i.e., provided on a web-site), or as stand-alone applications or clients on user equipment devices. Various devices and platforms that may implement media guidance applications are described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">One of the functions of the media guidance application is to provide media guidance data to users. As referred to herein, the phrase &#x201c;media guidance data&#x201d; or &#x201c;guidance data&#x201d; should be understood to mean any data related to content or data used in operating the guidance application. For example, the guidance data may include program information, guidance application settings, user preferences, user profile information, media listings, media-related information (e.g., broadcast times, broadcast channels, titles, descriptions, ratings information (e.g., parental control ratings, critic's ratings, etc.), genre or category information, actor information, logo data for broadcasters' or providers' logos, etc.), media format (e.g., standard definition, high definition, 3D, etc.), on-demand information, blogs, websites, and any other type of guidance data that is helpful for a user to navigate among and locate desired content selections.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref> show illustrative display screens that may be used to provide media guidance data. The display screens shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref> may be implemented on any suitable user equipment device or platform. While the displays of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref> are illustrated as full screen displays, they may also be fully or partially overlaid over content being displayed. A user may indicate a desire to access content information by selecting a selectable option provided in a display screen (e.g., a menu option, a listings option, an icon, a hyperlink, etc.) or pressing a dedicated button (e.g., a GUIDE button) on a remote control or other user input interface or device. In response to the user's indication, the media guidance application may provide a display screen with media guidance data organized in one of several ways, such as by time and channel in a grid, by time, by channel, by source, by content type, by category (e.g., movies, sports, news, children, or other categories of programming), or other predefined, user-defined, or other organization criteria.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows illustrative grid of a program listings display <b>500</b> arranged by time and channel that also enables access to different types of content in a single display. Display <b>500</b> may include grid <b>502</b> with: (1) a column of channel/content type identifiers <b>504</b>, where each channel/content type identifier (which is a cell in the column) identifies a different channel or content type available; and (2) a row of time identifiers <b>506</b>, where each time identifier (which is a cell in the row) identifies a time block of programming. Grid <b>502</b> also includes cells of program listings, such as program listing <b>508</b>, where each listing provides the title of the program provided on the listing's associated channel and time. With a user input device, a user can select program listings by moving highlight region <b>510</b>. Information relating to the program listing selected by highlight region <b>510</b> may be provided in program information region <b>512</b>. Region <b>512</b> may include, for example, the program title, the program description, the time the program is provided (if applicable), the channel the program is on (if applicable), the program's rating, and other desired information.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition to providing access to linear programming (e.g., content that is scheduled to be transmitted to a plurality of user equipment devices at a predetermined time and is provided according to a schedule), the media guidance application also provides access to non-linear programming (e.g., content accessible to a user equipment device at any time and is not provided according to a schedule). Non-linear programming may include content from different content sources including on-demand content (e.g., VOD), Internet content (e.g., streaming media, downloadable media, etc.), locally stored content (e.g., content stored on any user equipment device described above or other storage device), or other time-independent content. On-demand content may include movies or any other content provided by a particular content provider (e.g., HBO On Demand providing &#x201c;The Sopranos&#x201d; and &#x201c;Curb Your Enthusiasm&#x201d;). HBO ON DEMAND is a service mark owned by Time Warner Company L.P. et al. and THE SOPRANOS and CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM are trademarks owned by the Home Box Office, Inc. Internet content may include web events, such as a chat session or Webcast, or content available on-demand as streaming content or downloadable content through an Internet web site or other Internet access (e.g. FTP).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Grid <b>502</b> may provide media guidance data for non-linear programming including on-demand listing <b>514</b>, recorded content listing <b>516</b>, and Internet content listing <b>518</b>. A display combining media guidance data for content from different types of content sources is sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;mixed-media&#x201d; display.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Various permutations of the types of media guidance data that may be displayed that are different than display <b>500</b> may be based on user selection or guidance application definition (e.g., a display of only recorded and broadcast listings, only on-demand and broadcast listings, etc.). As illustrated, listings <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, and <b>518</b> are shown as spanning the entire time block displayed in grid <b>502</b> to indicate that selection of these listings may provide access to a display dedicated to on-demand listings, recorded listings, or Internet listings, respectively. In some embodiments, listings for these content types may be included directly in grid <b>502</b>. Additional media guidance data may be displayed in response to the user selecting one of the navigational icons <b>520</b>. (Pressing an arrow key on a user input device may affect the display in a similar manner as selecting navigational icons <b>520</b>.)</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Display <b>500</b> may also include video region <b>522</b>, and options region <b>526</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Video region <b>522</b> may allow the user to view and/or preview programs that are currently available, will be available, or were available to the user. The content of video region <b>522</b> may correspond to, or be independent from, one of the listings displayed in grid <b>502</b>. Grid displays including a video region are sometimes referred to as picture-in-guide (PIG) displays. PIG displays and their functionalities are described in greater detail in Satterfield et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,564,378, issued May 13, 2003 and Yuen et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,239,794, issued May 29, 2001, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. PIG displays may be included in other media guidance application display screens of the embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Options region <b>526</b> may allow the user to access different types of content, media guidance application displays, and/or media guidance application features. Options region <b>526</b> may be part of display <b>500</b> (and other display screens described herein), or may be invoked by a user by selecting an on-screen option or pressing a dedicated or assignable button on a user input device. The selectable options within options region <b>526</b> may concern features related to program listings in grid <b>502</b> or may include options available from a main menu display. Features related to program listings may include searching for other air times or ways of receiving a program, recording a program, enabling series recording of a program, setting program and/or channel as a favorite, purchasing a program, or other features. Options available from a main menu display may include search options, VOD options, parental control options, Internet options, cloud-based options, device synchronization options, second screen device options, options to access various types of media guidance data displays, options to subscribe to a premium service, options to edit a user's profile, options to access a browse overlay, or other options.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The media guidance application may be personalized based on a user's preferences. A personalized media guidance application allows a user to customize displays and features to create a personalized &#x201c;experience&#x201d; with the media guidance application. This personalized experience may be created by allowing a user to input these customizations and/or by the media guidance application monitoring user activity to determine various user preferences. Users may access their personalized guidance application by logging in or otherwise identifying themselves to the guidance application. Customization of the media guidance application may be made in accordance with a user profile. The customizations may include varying presentation schemes (e.g., color scheme of displays, font size of text, etc.), aspects of content listings displayed (e.g., only HDTV or only 3D programming, user-specified broadcast channels based on favorite channel selections, re-ordering the display of channels, recommended content, etc.), desired recording features (e.g., recording or series recordings for particular users, recording quality, etc.), parental control settings, customized presentation of Internet content (e.g., presentation of social media content, e-mail, electronically delivered articles, etc.) and other desired customizations.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The media guidance application may allow a user to provide user profile information or may automatically compile user profile information. The media guidance application may, for example, monitor the content the user accesses and/or other interactions the user may have with the guidance application.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Additionally, the media guidance application may obtain all or part of other user profiles that are related to a particular user (e.g., from other web sites on the Internet the user accesses, such as www.allrovi.com, from other media guidance applications the user accesses, from other interactive applications the user accesses, from another user equipment device of the user, etc.), and/or obtain information about the user from other sources that the media guidance application may access. As a result, a user can be provided with a unified guidance application experience across the user's different user equipment devices. This type of user experience is described in greater detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.

Control circuitry <b>704</b> may be used to send and receive commands, requests, and other suitable data using I/O path <b>702</b>. I/O path <b>702</b> may connect control circuitry <b>704</b> (and specifically processing circuitry <b>706</b>) to one or more communications paths (described below). I/O functions may be provided by one or more of these communications paths, but are shown as a single path in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawing.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Control circuitry <b>704</b> may be based on any suitable processing circuitry such as processing circuitry <b>706</b>. As referred to herein, processing circuitry should be understood to mean circuitry based on one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, digital signal processors, programmable logic devices, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), etc., and may include a multi-core processor (e.g., dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core, or any suitable number of cores) or supercomputer. In some embodiments, processing circuitry may be distributed across multiple separate processors or processing units, for example, multiple of the same type of processing units (e.g., two Intel Core i7 processors) or multiple different processors (e.g., an Intel Core i5 processor and an Intel Core i7 processor). In some embodiments, control circuitry <b>704</b> executes instructions for a media guidance application stored in memory (i.e., storage <b>708</b>). Specifically, control circuitry <b>704</b> may be instructed by the media guidance application to perform the functions discussed above and below. For example, the media guidance application may provide instructions to control circuitry <b>704</b> to generate the media guidance displays. In some implementations, any action performed by control circuitry <b>704</b> may be based on instructions received from the media guidance application.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In client-server based embodiments, control circuitry <b>704</b> may include communications circuitry suitable for communicating with a guidance application server or other networks or servers. The instructions for carrying out the above mentioned functionality may be stored on the guidance application server. Communications circuitry may include a cable modem, an integrated services digital network (ISDN) modem, a digital subscriber line (DSL) modem, a telephone modem, Ethernet card, or a wireless modem for communications with other equipment, or any other suitable communications circuitry. Such communications may involve the Internet or any other suitable communications networks or paths (which is described in more detail in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). In addition, communications circuitry may include circuitry that enables peer-to-peer communication of user equipment devices, or communication of user equipment devices in locations remote from each other (described in more detail below).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Memory may be an electronic storage device provided as storage <b>708</b> that is part of control circuitry <b>704</b>. As referred to herein, the phrase &#x201c;electronic storage device&#x201d; or &#x201c;storage device&#x201d; should be understood to mean any device for storing electronic data, computer software, or firmware, such as random-access memory, read-only memory, hard drives, optical drives, digital video disc (DVD) recorders, compact disc (CD) recorders, BLU-RAY disc (BD) recorders, BLU-RAY 3D disc recorders, digital video recorders (DVR, sometimes called a personal video recorder, or PVR), solid state devices, quantum storage devices, gaming consoles, gaming media, or any other suitable fixed or removable storage devices, and/or any combination of the same. Storage <b>708</b> may be used to store various types of content described herein as well as media guidance data described above. Nonvolatile memory may also be used (e.g., to launch a boot-up routine and other instructions). Cloud-based storage, described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, may be used to supplement storage <b>708</b> or instead of storage <b>708</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Control circuitry <b>704</b> may include video generating circuitry and tuning circuitry, such as one or more analog tuners, one or more MPEG-2 decoders or other digital decoding circuitry, high-definition tuners, or any other suitable tuning or video circuits or combinations of such circuits. Encoding circuitry (e.g., for converting over-the-air, analog, or digital signals to MPEG signals for storage) may also be provided. Control circuitry <b>704</b> may also include scaler circuitry for upconverting and downconverting content into the preferred output format of the user equipment <b>700</b>. Circuitry <b>704</b> may also include digital-to-analog converter circuitry and analog-to-digital converter circuitry for converting between digital and analog signals. The tuning and encoding circuitry may be used by the user equipment device to receive and to display, to play, or to record content. The tuning and encoding circuitry may also be used to receive guidance data. The circuitry described herein, including for example, the tuning, video generating, encoding, decoding, encrypting, decrypting, scaler, and analog/digital circuitry, may be implemented using software running on one or more general purpose or specialized processors. Multiple tuners may be provided to handle simultaneous tuning functions (e.g., watch and record functions, picture-in-picture (PIP) functions, multiple-tuner recording, etc.). If storage <b>708</b> is provided as a separate device from user equipment <b>700</b>, the tuning and encoding circuitry (including multiple tuners) may be associated with storage <b>708</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A user may send instructions to control circuitry <b>704</b> using user input interface <b>710</b>. User input interface <b>710</b> may be any suitable user interface, such as a remote control, mouse, trackball, keypad, keyboard, touch screen, touchpad, stylus input, joystick, voice recognition interface, or other user input interfaces. Display <b>712</b> may be provided as a stand-alone device or integrated with other elements of user equipment device <b>700</b>. For example, display <b>712</b> may be a touchscreen or touch-sensitive display. In such circumstances, user input interface <b>710</b> may be integrated with or combined with display <b>712</b>. Display <b>712</b> may be one or more of a monitor, a television, a liquid crystal display (LCD) for a mobile device, amorphous silicon display, low temperature poly silicon display, electronic ink display, electrophoretic display, active matrix display, electro-wetting display, electrofluidic display, cathode ray tube display, light-emitting diode display, electroluminescent display, plasma display panel, high-performance addressing display, thin-film transistor display, organic light-emitting diode display, surface-conduction electron-emitter display (SED), laser television, carbon nanotubes, quantum dot display, interferometric modulator display, or any other suitable equipment for displaying visual images. In some embodiments, display <b>712</b> may be HDTV-capable. In some embodiments, display <b>712</b> may be a 3D display, and the interactive media guidance application and any suitable content may be displayed in 3D. A video card or graphics card may generate the output to the display <b>712</b>. The video card may offer various functions such as accelerated rendering of 3D scenes and 2D graphics, MPEG-2/MPEG-4 decoding, TV output, or the ability to connect multiple monitors. The video card may be any processing circuitry described above in relation to control circuitry <b>704</b>. The video card may be integrated with the control circuitry <b>704</b>. Speakers <b>714</b> may be provided as integrated with other elements of user equipment device <b>700</b> or may be stand-alone units. The audio component of videos and other content displayed on display <b>712</b> may be played through speakers <b>714</b>. In some embodiments, the audio may be distributed to a receiver (not shown), which processes and outputs the audio via speakers <b>714</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The guidance application may be implemented using any suitable architecture. For example, it may be a stand-alone application wholly-implemented on user equipment device <b>700</b>. In such an approach, instructions of the application are stored locally (e.g., in storage <b>708</b>), and data for use by the application is downloaded on a periodic basis (e.g., from an out-of-band feed, from an Internet resource, or using another suitable approach). Control circuitry <b>704</b> may retrieve instructions of the application from storage <b>708</b> and process the instructions to generate any of the displays discussed herein. Based on the processed instructions, control circuitry <b>704</b> may determine what action to perform when input is received from input interface <b>710</b>. For example, movement of a cursor on a display up/down may be indicated by the processed instructions when input interface <b>710</b> indicates that an up/down button was selected.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some embodiments, the media guidance application is a client-server based application. Data for use by a thick or thin client implemented on user equipment device <b>700</b> is retrieved on-demand by issuing requests to a server remote to the user equipment device <b>700</b>. In one example of a client-server based guidance application, control circuitry <b>704</b> runs a web browser that interprets web pages provided by a remote server. For example, the remote server may store the instructions for the application in a storage device. The remote server may process the stored instructions using circuitry (e.g., control circuitry <b>704</b>) and generate the displays discussed above and below. The client device may receive the displays generated by the remote server and may display the content of the displays locally on equipment device <b>700</b>. This way, the processing of the instructions is performed remotely by the server while the resulting displays are provided locally on equipment device <b>700</b>. Equipment device <b>700</b> may receive inputs from the user via input interface <b>710</b> and transmit those inputs to the remote server for processing and generating the corresponding displays. For example, equipment device <b>700</b> may transmit a communication to the remote server indicating that an up/down button was selected via input interface <b>710</b>. The remote server may process instructions in accordance with that input and generate a display of the application corresponding to the input (e.g., a display that moves a cursor up/down). The generated display is then transmitted to equipment device <b>700</b> for presentation to the user.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, the media guidance application is downloaded and interpreted or otherwise run by an interpreter or virtual machine (run by control circuitry <b>704</b>). In some embodiments, the guidance application may be encoded in the ETV Binary Interchange Format (EBIF), received by control circuitry <b>704</b> as part of a suitable feed, and interpreted by a user agent running on control circuitry <b>704</b>. For example, the guidance application may be an EBIF application. In some embodiments, the guidance application may be defined by a series of JAVA-based files that are received and run by a local virtual machine or other suitable middleware executed by control circuitry <b>704</b>. In some of such embodiments (e.g., those employing MPEG-2 or other digital media encoding schemes), the guidance application may be, for example, encoded and transmitted in an MPEG-2 object carousel with the MPEG audio and video packets of a program.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">User equipment device <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> can be implemented in system <b>800</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> as user television equipment <b>802</b>, user computer equipment <b>804</b>, wireless user communications device <b>806</b>, or any other type of user equipment suitable for accessing content, such as a non-portable gaming machine. For simplicity, these devices may be referred to herein collectively as user equipment or user equipment devices, and may be substantially similar to user equipment devices described above. User equipment devices, on which a media guidance application may be implemented, may function as a standalone device or may be part of a network of devices. Various network configurations of devices may be implemented and are discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">A user equipment device utilizing at least some of the system features described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> may not be classified solely as user television equipment <b>802</b>, user computer equipment <b>804</b>, or a wireless user communications device <b>806</b>. For example, user television equipment <b>802</b> may, like some user computer equipment <b>804</b>, be Internet-enabled allowing for access to Internet content, while user computer equipment <b>804</b> may, like some television equipment <b>802</b>, include a tuner allowing for access to television programming The media guidance application may have the same layout on various different types of user equipment or may be tailored to the display capabilities of the user equipment. For example, on user computer equipment <b>804</b>, the guidance application may be provided as a web site accessed by a web browser. In another example, the guidance application may be scaled down for wireless user communications devices <b>806</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In system <b>800</b>, there is typically more than one of each type of user equipment device but only one of each is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawing. In addition, each user may utilize more than one type of user equipment device and also more than one of each type of user equipment device.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, a user equipment device (e.g., user television equipment <b>802</b>, user computer equipment <b>804</b>, wireless user communications device <b>806</b>) may be referred to as a &#x201c;second screen device.&#x201d; For example, a second screen device may supplement content presented on a first user equipment device. The content presented on the second screen device may be any suitable content that supplements the content presented on the first device. In some embodiments, the second screen device provides an interface for adjusting settings and display preferences of the first device. In some embodiments, the second screen device is configured for interacting with other second screen devices or for interacting with a social network. The second screen device can be located in the same room as the first device, a different room from the first device but in the same house or building, or in a different building from the first device.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The user may also set various settings to maintain consistent media guidance application settings across in-home devices and remote devices. Settings include those described herein, as well as channel and program favorites, programming preferences that the guidance application utilizes to make programming recommendations, display preferences, and other desirable guidance settings. For example, if a user sets a channel as a favorite on, for example, the web site www.allrovi.com on their personal computer at their office, the same channel would appear as a favorite on the user's in-home devices (e.g., user television equipment and user computer equipment) as well as the user's mobile devices, if desired. Therefore, changes made on one user equipment device can change the guidance experience on another user equipment device, regardless of whether they are the same or a different type of user equipment device. In addition, the changes made may be based on settings input by a user, as well as user activity monitored by the guidance application.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The user equipment devices may be coupled to communications network <b>814</b>. Namely, user television equipment <b>802</b>, user computer equipment <b>804</b>, and wireless user communications device <b>806</b> are coupled to communications network <b>814</b> via communications paths <b>808</b>, <b>810</b>, and <b>812</b>, respectively. Communications network <b>814</b> may be one or more networks including the Internet, a mobile phone network, mobile voice or data network (e.g., a 4G or LTE network), cable network, public switched telephone network, or other types of communications network or combinations of communications networks. Paths <b>808</b>, <b>810</b>, and <b>812</b> may separately or together include one or more communications paths, such as, a satellite path, a fiber-optic path, a cable path, a path that supports Internet communications (e.g., IPTV), free-space connections (e.g., for broadcast or other wireless signals), or any other suitable wired or wireless communications path or combination of such paths. Path <b>812</b> is drawn with dotted lines to indicate that in the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> it is a wireless path and paths <b>808</b> and <b>810</b> are drawn as solid lines to indicate they are wired paths (although these paths may be wireless paths, if desired).

Content source <b>816</b> may include cable sources, satellite providers, on-demand providers, Internet providers, over-the-top content providers, or other providers of content. Content source <b>816</b> may also include a remote media server used to store different types of content (including video content selected by a user), in a location remote from any of the user equipment devices. Systems and methods for remote storage of content, and providing remotely stored content to user equipment are discussed in greater detail in connection with Ellis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,761,892, issued Jul. 20, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Media guidance data source <b>818</b> may provide media guidance data, such as the media guidance data described above. Media guidance data may be provided to the user equipment devices using any suitable approach. In some embodiments, the guidance application may be a stand-alone interactive television program guide that receives program guide data via a data feed (e.g., a continuous feed or trickle feed). Program schedule data and other guidance data may be provided to the user equipment on a television channel sideband, using an in-band digital signal, using an out-of-band digital signal, or by any other suitable data transmission technique. Program schedule data and other media guidance data may be provided to user equipment on multiple analog or digital television channels.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some embodiments, guidance data from media guidance data source <b>818</b> may be provided to users' equipment using a client-server approach. For example, a user equipment device may pull media guidance data from a server, or a server may push media guidance data to a user equipment device. In some embodiments, a guidance application client residing on the user's equipment may initiate sessions with source <b>818</b> to obtain guidance data when needed, e.g., when the guidance data is out of date or when the user equipment device receives a request from the user to receive data. Media guidance may be provided to the user equipment with any suitable frequency (e.g., continuously, daily, a user-specified period of time, a system-specified period of time, in response to a request from user equipment, etc.). Media guidance data source <b>818</b> may provide user equipment devices <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>, and <b>806</b> the media guidance application itself or software updates for the media guidance application.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some embodiments, the media guidance data may include viewer data. For example, the viewer data may include current and/or historical user activity information (e.g., what content the user typically watches, what times of day the user watches content, whether the user interacts with a social network, at what times the user interacts with a social network to post information, what types of content the user typically watches (e.g., pay TV or free TV), mood, brain activity information, etc.). The media guidance data may also include subscription data. For example, the subscription data may identify to which sources or services a given user subscribes and/or to which sources or services the given user has previously subscribed but later terminated access (e.g., whether the user subscribes to premium channels, whether the user has added a premium level of services, whether the user has increased Internet speed). In some embodiments, the viewer data and/or the subscription data may identify patterns of a given user for a period of more than one year. The media guidance data may include a model (e.g., a survivor model) used for generating a score that indicates a likelihood a given user will terminate access to a service/source. For example, the media guidance application may process the viewer data with the subscription data using the model to generate a value or score that indicates a likelihood of whether the given user will terminate access to a particular service or source. In particular, a higher score may indicate a higher level of confidence that the user will terminate access to a particular service or source. Based on the score, the media guidance application may generate promotions that entice the user to keep the particular service or source indicated by the score as one to which the user will likely terminate access.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Media guidance applications may be, for example, stand-alone applications implemented on user equipment devices. For example, the media guidance application may be implemented as software or a set of executable instructions which may be stored in storage <b>708</b>, and executed by control circuitry <b>704</b> of a user equipment device <b>700</b>. In some embodiments, media guidance applications may be client-server applications where only a client application resides on the user equipment device, and server application resides on a remote server. For example, media guidance applications may be implemented partially as a client application on control circuitry <b>704</b> of user equipment device <b>700</b> and partially on a remote server as a server application (e.g., media guidance data source <b>818</b>) running on control circuitry of the remote server. When executed by control circuitry of the remote server (such as media guidance data source <b>818</b>), the media guidance application may instruct the control circuitry to generate the guidance application displays and transmit the generated displays to the user equipment devices. The server application may instruct the control circuitry of the media guidance data source <b>818</b> to transmit data for storage on the user equipment. The client application may instruct control circuitry of the receiving user equipment to generate the guidance application displays.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Content and/or media guidance data delivered to user equipment devices <b>802</b>, <b>804</b>, and <b>806</b> may be over-the-top (OTT) content. OTT content delivery allows Internet-enabled user devices, including any user equipment device described above, to receive content that is transferred over the Internet, including any content described above, in addition to content received over cable or satellite connections. OTT content is delivered via an Internet connection provided by an Internet service provider (ISP), but a third party distributes the content. The ISP may not be responsible for the viewing abilities, copyrights, or redistribution of the content, and may only transfer IP packets provided by the OTT content provider. Examples of OTT content providers include YOUTUBE, NETFLIX, and HULU, which provide audio and video via IP packets. Youtube is a trademark owned by Google Inc., Netflix is a trademark owned by Netflix Inc., and Hulu is a trademark owned by Hulu, LLC. OTT content providers may additionally or alternatively provide media guidance data described above. In addition to content and/or media guidance data, providers of OTT content can distribute media guidance applications (e.g., web-based applications or cloud-based applications), or the content can be displayed by media guidance applications stored on the user equipment device.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Media guidance system <b>800</b> is intended to illustrate a number of approaches, or network configurations, by which user equipment devices and sources of content and guidance data may communicate with each other for the purpose of accessing content and providing media guidance.

Each of the multiple individuals in a single home may operate different user equipment devices on the home network.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">As a result, it may be desirable for various media guidance information or settings to be communicated between the different user equipment devices. For example, it may be desirable for users to maintain consistent media guidance application settings on different user equipment devices within a home network, as described in greater detail in Ellis et al., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0251827, filed Jul. 11, 2005. Different types of user equipment devices in a home network may also communicate with each other to transmit content. For example, a user may transmit content from user computer equipment to a portable video player or portable music player.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In a second approach, users may have multiple types of user equipment by which they access content and obtain media guidance. For example, some users may have home networks that are accessed by in-home and mobile devices. Users may control in-home devices via a media guidance application implemented on a remote device. For example, users may access an online media guidance application on a website via a personal computer at their office, or a mobile device such as a PDA or web-enabled mobile telephone. The user may set various settings (e.g., recordings, reminders, or other settings) on the online guidance application to control the user's in-home equipment. The online guide may control the user's equipment directly, or by communicating with a media guidance application on the user's in-home equipment. Various systems and methods for user equipment devices communicating, where the user equipment devices are in locations remote from each other, is discussed in, for example, Ellis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 8,046,801, issued Oct. 25, 2011, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In a third approach, users of user equipment devices inside and outside a home can use their media guidance application to communicate directly with content source <b>816</b> to access content. Specifically, within a home, users of user television equipment <b>802</b> and user computer equipment <b>804</b> may access the media guidance application to navigate among and locate desirable content. Users may also access the media guidance application outside of the home using wireless user communications devices <b>806</b> to navigate among and locate desirable content.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In a fourth approach, user equipment devices may operate in a cloud computing environment to access cloud services. In a cloud computing environment, various types of computing services for content sharing, storage or distribution (e.g., video sharing sites or social networking sites) are provided by a collection of network-accessible computing and storage resources, referred to as &#x201c;the cloud.&#x201d; For example, the cloud can include a collection of server computing devices, which may be located centrally or at distributed locations, that provide cloud-based services to various types of users and devices connected via a network such as the Internet via communications network <b>814</b>. These cloud resources may include one or more content sources <b>816</b> and one or more media guidance data sources <b>818</b>. In addition or in the alternative, the remote computing sites may include other user equipment devices, such as user television equipment <b>802</b>, user computer equipment <b>804</b>, and wireless user communications device <b>806</b>. For example, the other user equipment devices may provide access to a stored copy of a video or a streamed video. In such embodiments, user equipment devices may operate in a peer-to-peer manner without communicating with a central server.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The cloud provides access to services, such as content storage, content sharing, or social networking services, among other examples, as well as access to any content described above, for user equipment devices. Services can be provided in the cloud through cloud computing service providers, or through other providers of online services. For example, the cloud-based services can include a content storage service, a content sharing site, a social networking site, or other services via which user-sourced content is distributed for viewing by others on connected devices. These cloud-based services may allow a user equipment device to store content to the cloud and to receive content from the cloud rather than storing content locally and accessing locally-stored content.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">A user may use various content capture devices, such as camcorders, digital cameras with video mode, audio recorders, mobile phones, and handheld computing devices, to record content. The user can upload content to a content storage service on the cloud either directly, for example, from user computer equipment <b>804</b> or wireless user communications device <b>806</b> having content capture feature. Alternatively, the user can first transfer the content to a user equipment device, such as user computer equipment <b>804</b>. The user equipment device storing the content uploads the content to the cloud using a data transmission service on communications network <b>814</b>. In some embodiments, the user equipment device itself is a cloud resource, and other user equipment devices can access the content directly from the user equipment device on which the user stored the content.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">Cloud resources may be accessed by a user equipment device using, for example, a web browser, a media guidance application, a desktop application, a mobile application, and/or any combination of access applications of the same. The user equipment device may be a cloud client that relies on cloud computing for application delivery, or the user equipment device may have some functionality without access to cloud resources. For example, some applications running on the user equipment device may be cloud applications, i.e., applications delivered as a service over the Internet, while other applications may be stored and run on the user equipment device. In some embodiments, a user device may receive content from multiple cloud resources simultaneously. For example, a user device can stream audio from one cloud resource while downloading content from a second cloud resource. Or a user device can download content from multiple cloud resources for more efficient downloading. In some embodiments, user equipment devices can use cloud resources for processing operations such as the processing operations performed by processing circuitry described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">As referred herein, the term &#x201c;in response to&#x201d; refers to initiated as a result of.

At step <b>904</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> determines a first set of rules for the first user viewing profile based on the first plurality of media assets. In some embodiments, control circuitry <b>704</b> determines the first set of rules for the first user viewing profile based on the first plurality of media assets by retrieving one or more metadata tags for each of the first plurality of media assets, determining one or more trends in the one or more metadata tags for each of the first plurality of media assets, and determining the first set of rules based on the one or more trends. In some embodiments, the one more metadata tags includes one or more of a genre, a time slot, a title, a channel, a media source, a language, a month, a day of week, a parental rating, and a popularity rating. At step <b>906</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> receives a selection to view a media asset on the user device. At step <b>908</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> applies the first set of rules to the media asset to determine whether the media asset is consistent with the first user viewing profile. In some embodiments, control circuitry <b>704</b> applies the first set of rules to the media asset to determine whether the media asset is consistent with the first user viewing profile by retrieving one or more metadata tags for the media asset, and determining, based on the one or more metadata tags, whether any of the first set of rules indicate a likelihood of the first user having selected the media asset.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">At step <b>910</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> determines whether the media asset is consistent with the first user viewing profile. If the media asset is consistent with the first user viewing profile, at step <b>912</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> updates the first user viewing profile to include the media asset in the first plurality of media assets. At step <b>914</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> further updates the first set of rules for the first user viewing profile based on the updated first plurality of media assets and returns to step <b>906</b>. In some embodiments, the first set of rules is stored in a local memory of the user device and the first viewing profile is stored on the remote server.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">If the media asset is not consistent with the first user viewing profile, at step <b>916</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> retrieves, from the remote server, a second user viewing profile for a second user of the user device. The second user viewing profile includes a second plurality of media assets and associated with a second set of rules. At step <b>918</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> further applies the second set of rules to the media asset to determine whether the media asset is consistent with the second user viewing profile. In some embodiments, the second set of rules is stored in a local memory of the user device and the second viewing profile is stored on the remote server.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">At step <b>920</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> determines whether the media asset is consistent with the second user viewing profile. If the media asset is consistent with the second user viewing profile, at step <b>922</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> updates the second user viewing profile to include the media asset in the second plurality of media assets. At step <b>924</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> further updates the second set of rules for the second user viewing profile based on the updated second plurality of media assets and returns to step <b>906</b>. If the media asset is not consistent with the second user viewing profile, at step <b>926</b>, control circuitry <b>704</b> determines whether another user viewing profile is available for analysis. If another user viewing profile is not available, control circuitry <b>704</b> proceeds to step <b>906</b> and waits for another selection to view a media asset on the user device. If another user viewing profile is available, control circuitry <b>704</b> proceeds to step <b>916</b> to retrieve another user viewing profile for analysis.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some embodiments, control circuitry <b>704</b> generates for display a prompt requesting confirmation from the first user whether to proceed with the selected media asset in response to determining that the media asset is not consistent with the first user viewing profile.
