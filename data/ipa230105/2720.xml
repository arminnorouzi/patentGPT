However, if the algae are not present at a certain concentration or more in the open system at the start of cultivation, they often cannot grow healthily because the amount of light to be irradiated per cell is too high. Accordingly, it is necessary to previously prepare a dense culture of microalgae at a certain concentration or more. Such a dense culture is often prepared in a closed system.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, there is a need for a method of efficiently cultivating algae in a closed system.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to cultivate a large amount of algae efficiently and inexpensively throughout the year all day and night without being influenced by the cultivation location, Japanese Patent Publication No. 2002-315569 discloses a method of cultivating algae, characterized in that an algal culture is irradiated with monochromatic light (red or blue light) from a light emitting diode having a wavelength at which the specific absorbance of chlorophyll a contained in the algae is 60 or more, to promote the growth of the algae and keep the growth rate constant. The document also discloses a method of promoting photosynthesis, characterized in that the culture is irradiated with monochromatic light of 500 to 630 nm (green light, yellow light and orange light), which light is absorbed by phycocyanin (a phycobilin pigment).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Japanese Patent Publication No. 2011-30463 discloses an underwater lighting device including a blue LED and a red LED, for promoting photosynthesis of algae having chlorophyll. The document also discloses an underwater lighting device including a green LED, for promoting photosynthesis of algae having phycobilin.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">PCT Publication WO 2014/119794 discloses a method of promoting growth of Chlorophyceae, in which the growth of Chlorophyceae that is in a state of being a green swarm cell is promoted by irradiating the Chlorophyceae with an artificial light, wherein the Chlorophyceae are grown in a liquid medium while maintaining a state in which the color of a culture solution of the Chlorophyceae is green or brown by intermittently radiating a red illumination light while continuously radiating a blue illumination light.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Even if a large reactor vessel is used in the methods in order to provide efficient algal cultivation, light only reaches to a certain depth, so that light intensity per unit of cultivation medium is reduced in deep regions of the vessel. Consequently, the cell density is reduced in the deep regions of the reactor vessel. On the other hand, irradiation of microalgae with intense light to provide a high amount of photoenergy induces in the microalgae photo-oxidative stress (generation of active oxygen species), which has an adverse effect on growth of the microalgae cells.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the methods described in the above-mentioned documents, red light and blue light are used to promote the photosynthesis in algal cells having chlorophyll. There are few studies about the effects of light of other colors on the photosynthesis in algal cells having chlorophyll.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, there is still a need for a technique for efficiently cultivating microalgal cells.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present inventors investigated the wavelengths contributing to efficient cultivation of microalgal cells. As a result, the inventors have found that light in a range of 520 nm to 630 nm is more effective in biomass production in cells of an algae belonging to a class selected from Chlorophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Bacillariophyceae and Haptophyceae than red light, which has been conventionally used, thereby forming the basis of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to one embodiment, a method of cultivating algal cells of an algae belonging to a class selected from Chlorophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Bacillariophyceae and Haptophyceae includes irradiating the algal cells with an artificial light having a ratio of (i) photon flux density in the wavelength range of 520-630 nm to (ii) photosynthetic photon flux density, that is 65% or more; and measuring a condition of the algal cells and/or a condition of the algal cell culture. The irradiation and non-irradiation of the algal cells with the artificial light are switched, or the photon flux density in the wavelength range of 520-630 nm is changed, according to the measured condition of the algal cells and/or the measured condition of the algal cell culture.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to another embodiment, a method comprises providing an algal cell culture including cultivating algal cells of an algae belonging to a class selected from Chlorophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Bacillariophyceae and Haptophyceae by the above-mentioned method.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another embodiment, a photobioreactor for cultivating algal cells includes: a reactor vessel, a lighting device, and a sensor. The reactor vessel is configured to contain algal cells of an algae belonging to a class selected from Chlorophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Bacillariophyceae and Haptophyceae, and a culture medium for the algal cells. The lighting device is configured to irradiate the reactor vessel, wherein the lighting device is capable of emitting light having a ratio of (i) photon flux density in the wavelength range of 520-630 nm to (ii) photosynthetic photon flux density, that is 65% or more. The sensor is configured to measure a condition of the algal cells and/or a condition of the algal cell culture in the reactor vessel. The control unit controls the light source according to the output of the sensor.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings

Thus, according to a method of the disclosure, the algal cells can be cultivated efficiently. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the present inventors believe that the effect of the disclosure results partially from light in the specific wavelength range reaching deeper into the culture than red light.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">As used herein, the term &#x201c;artificial light&#x201d; refers to light emitted by an artificial light source, and a light component of certain wavelengths extracted (by using an optical filter, for example) from natural light (mostly sunlight).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the context of the artificial light, the term &#x201c;ratio of photon flux density in the wavelength range of c-d to photosynthetic photon flux density&#x201d; (wherein &#x201c;c&#x201d; and &#x201c;d&#x201d; indicate the lower and upper limit wavelengths (in nm), respectively, of a specific wavelength range) means a ratio value calculated from the following formula: [(photon flux density in the wavelength range of c-d)/(photosynthetic photon flux density)]&#xd7;100(%). The &#x201c;photosynthetic photon flux density&#x201d; is the photon flux density of photosynthetically active components (in the wavelength range of 400 to 700 nm) of the artificial light.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the context of present cultivation method, the &#x201c;photon flux density&#x201d; is a photon flux density measured at the light-receiving surface of the culture medium containing the algal cells to be irradiated. For example, the photon flux density at the light-receiving surface of the culture medium may be a photon flux density measured at an area on the outer surface of a photobioreactor vessel or container containing the culture medium.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The artificial light to be irradiated to the algal cells in the present invention has a ratio of (i) photon flux density in the wavelength range of 520-630 nm to (ii) photosynthetic photon flux density, that is 65% or more, more particularly 70% or more, more particularly 75% or more, more particularly 80% or more, more particularly 85% or more, more particularly 90% or more, and more particularly 95% or more.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the artificial light has a ratio of (i) photon flux density in the wavelength range of 520-600 nm to (ii) photosynthetic photon flux density, that is 65% or more, more particularly 70% or more, more particularly 75% or more, more particularly 80% or more, more particularly 85% or more, more particularly 90% or more, and more particularly 95% or more. The embodiments can improve energy intensiveness, and cultivate the algal cells more efficiently.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Preferably, the artificial light has the maximum peak wavelength in the wavelength range of 520 to 630 nm, and more preferably in the wavelength range of 520 to 600 nm. Use of such an artificial light is preferable in that the algal cells can be efficiently irradiated with light in the wavelength range, which can grow the algal cells more efficiently than red light.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Accordingly, in some embodiments, the artificial light consists substantially of wavelengths from 520 to 630 nm, or from 520 to 600 nm. In some embodiments, the artificial light has a wavelength spectrum with a peak wavelength at 545&#xb1;25 nm (and more preferably at 545&#xb1;15 nm) and a half-width of 0.1 to 50 nm (and more preferably 0.1 to 20 nm).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The artificial light may be light emitted by a single light source, or a mixed or composite light emitted by two or more light sources. In the latter case, it is sufficient that the mixed or composite light, but not necessarily light emitted by each of the light sources (that is, each light to be mixed or made into composite), has a ratio of (i) photon flux density in the wavelength range of 520-630 nm (and more particularly 520-600 nm) to (ii) photosynthetic photon flux density, that is such a value as mentioned above (that is 65% or more, for example).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The artificial light may include light having a wavelength spectrum with a peak wavelength at 545&#xb1;25 nm (and more preferably at 545&#xb1;15 nm) and a half-width of 0.1 to 50 nm (and more preferably 0.1 to 20 nm). In other words, the artificial light may be such a mixed or composite light that is composed of light having a wavelength spectrum with a peak wavelength at 545&#xb1;25 nm (and more preferably at 545&#xb1;15 nm) and a half-width of 0.1 to 50 nm (and more preferably 0.1 to 20 nm), and light having a different wavelength spectrum.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Of the artificial light, light in the wavelength range of 520 to 630 nm (and more particularly 520 to 600 nm) may include, or consist of, light emitted by light-emitting diode (LED) or laser diode (LD). The use of LED light or LD light can suppress the radiation of red light and/or blue light that can have an adverse effect on the cells (such as cell damage by active oxygen species generated). Thus efficient irradiation with such light can allow the light to reach the algae in the inside of the culture (e.g., in the deeper parts of the culture when irradiated from the top, and in the central part and more distant parts of the culture when irradiated from the lateral direction). This can allow the light to be absorbed by chlorophylls, and thus, utilized for photosynthesis. In view of energy efficiency and economic efficiency, use of LED or LD is preferable due to the energy intensiveness, low heat generation, low power consumption, and long life. The use of LED or LD can also facilitate control and maintenance of photon flux density.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The value of photon flux density in the wavelength range of 520 to 630 nm (and more particularly 520 to 600 nm) is not particularly limited so long as it is effective in cultivating the algal cells. As used herein, the expression &#x201c;effective in cultivating the algal cells&#x201d; means that the culture does not intermittently decrease (preferably increases) in the number or density of algal cells therein.

Irradiation of the algal cells at a low cell density with light in the wavelength range of 520 to 630 nm (and more particularly 520 to 600 nm) at a low photon flux density induces a high rate of cell growth without wasting energy. Meanwhile, irradiation of the algal cells at a high cell density with light in the wavelength range of 520 to 630 nm (and more particularly 520 to 600 nm) at a high photon flux density enables high density cultivation.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Thus, in some embodiments wherein the condition is the cell density of the algal cell culture, light of wavelengths from 520 to 630 nm (and more particularly 520 to 600 nm) is irradiated to the algal cells in culture at a photon flux density of 50 to 500 &#x3bc;mol/m<sup>2</sup>/s, more particularly 50 to 400 &#x3bc;mol/m<sup>2</sup>/s, more particularly 50 to 300 &#x3bc;mol/m<sup>2</sup>/s when the cell density of the culture is a predetermined value or less, and at a photon flux density of 300 to 3000 &#x3bc;mol/m<sup>2</sup>/s, more particularly 300 to 2000 &#x3bc;mol/m<sup>2</sup>/s, more particularly 300 to 1000 &#x3bc;mol/m<sup>2</sup>/s, and more particularly 300 to 900 &#x3bc;mol/m<sup>2</sup>/s when the cell density is the predetermined value or more.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In specific embodiments, light in the wavelength range of 520 to 630 nm (and more particularly from 520 to 600 nm) irradiates the algal cells at a first photon flux density value when the cell density is a predetermined value or less, and at a second photon flux density value, which is larger than the first photon flux density value, when the cell density is the predetermined value or more. The first photon flux density value may be, for example, 50 to 500 &#x3bc;mol/m<sup>2</sup>/s, more particularly 50 to 400 &#x3bc;mol/m<sup>2</sup>/s, and more particularly 50 to 300 &#x3bc;mol/m<sup>2</sup>/s.

Accordingly, the irradiation of the algal cell culture having a singlet oxygen level of less than a particular value with light in the wavelength range of 520 to 630 nm (and more particularly 520 to 600 nm) at a relatively high photon flux density value can induce a high rate of cell growth while reducing cell damage. Meanwhile, cell damage can be reduced by irradiating algal cell culture having a singlet oxygen level of more than the particular value with light in the wavelength range of 520 to 630 nm (and more particularly 520 to 600 nm) at a relatively low photon flux density value or by stopping the artificial light irradiation (preferably by placing the culture in dim light or darkness, and more preferably in darkness).
