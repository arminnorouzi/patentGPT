Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electronic device may refer to a device performing a particular function according to its equipped program, such as a home appliance, an electronic scheduler, a portable multimedia player, a mobile communication terminal, a tablet PC, a video/sound device, a desktop PC or laptop computer, a navigation for automobile, etc. For example, electronic devices may output stored information as voices or images. As electronic devices are highly integrated, and high-speed, high-volume wireless communication becomes commonplace, an electronic device, such as a mobile communication terminal, is recently being equipped with various functions. For example, a smartphone integrates various features for entertainment, e.g., playing video games, multimedia, e.g., playing music/video, communication and security for mobile banking, or as a scheduler or e-wallet, with communication capabilities.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The recent trend to stress on slimness and compactness for smartphones, laptop computers, or other electronic devices leads to an attempt to adopt elegant metallic parts as exterior materials for electronic devices. Further, various surface treatment techniques are being developed to give the metallic exterior material functional effects as well as design effects.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An aluminum material is mainly used as an exterior material of an electronic device. The exterior (e.g., surface) of an aluminum exterior material is implemented by high-gloss specifications and sanding specifications. The high-gloss specifications may be specifications capable of maximizing the gloss of the surface of the exterior material by flattening the surface of the exterior material through a machining process, such as wet polishing or dry polishing, on the surface of the exterior material. The sanding specifications may be specifications for forming the surface of the exterior material by letting sand or ceramic particles hit the surface of the exterior material at a constant pressure or chemically forming the surface of the exterior material through acid or alkali etching.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the surface of the exterior material is formed by the high gloss specifications or the sanding specifications, the surface of the exterior material may have a uniform texture as a whole, and such an exterior material may not be able to meet the needs of users who want the exterior material having a novel texture.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Various embodiments of the present disclosure relate to an electronic device including a plate, a plate, and a method for manufacturing a plate, which may provide an exterior material having a partially shiny texture by forming irregular curves on a surface thereof.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Objects of the present disclosure are not limited to the foregoing, and other unmentioned objects would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art from the following description.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to various embodiments of the present disclosure, an electronic device may comprise a housing including a front plate facing in a first direction and a rear plate facing in a second direction opposite to the first direction and a display disposed in the housing and including a screen area exposed through the front plate.
