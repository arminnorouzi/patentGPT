These aspects and features may be applied alone or in any desired combination with one another.

Furthermore, if desired, one or more of the described functions or procedures may be optional or may be combined. As such, the following description should be considered as illustrative of the principles and teachings of certain example embodiments, and not in limitation thereof.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the process of poultry processing, a turkey can be hung by the hocks, a position that can be known as an inverted position, in that the neck of the bird may point toward the ground. While turkey and bird may be referred to interchangeably herein, a turkey is used as an example because a turkey is one example of a bird that has a well-developed crop. Other examples may include quail and pheasants. There are other species of birds that do not have a crop or in which the crop is essentially vestigial, such as an owl, or waterfowl, including geese, ducks, and swans. While the principles of certain embodiments of the present invention are explained with reference to removing the skin that covers the crop of a turkey, the same principles may be applied to removing the skin that covers the crop of a quail or pheasant, or skin in homologous areas of other poultry birds, such as ducks or geese.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Breast meat of birds is one of the highly valued portions. The crop of a bird is typically found lying against the breast muscles of the bird. While the breast muscles are considered a valuable food product, the crop is generally not high value meat. Likewise, lying in front of the crop cavity, the breast sponge of a wild turkey may be edible and nutritious, but as it is not breast meat, it may not be the primary target of the turkey processing. Thus, even if present in, for example, a heritage turkey, the sponge, crop, and skin covering the crop, may be removed to allow access to the valuable breast meat below.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">At a high level, poultry processing may include slaughtering, cleaning and evisceration, and processing and preparation. Certain embodiments may be applicable to the cleaning and evisceration process.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In commercial processing centers turkeys may be hung by their hocks in an inverted position throughout the cleaning and evisceration process. The hocks may be hung from what is referred to as a shackle line. The shackle line may hold the hocks and convey the hanging bird through numerous stages. The stages can include removal of the feathers from the skin of the bird, removal of the heads, feet, and internal organs of the bird, and so on. The removal of parts of the birds, including the internal organs, can be referred to as the evisceration of the birds. Certain embodiments may particularly applicable to the evisceration process.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a functional block diagram of a system according to certain embodiments of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a processing station may, at <b>110</b>, receive a bird conveyed by a shackle line. The shackle line may include conveyors. While the bird travels down the shackle line, a guide bar or other structure can, at <b>120</b>, separate the loose hanging crop skin from the neck of the bird. Before or after the separation of the hanging skin from the neck at <b>120</b>, the station can, at <b>115</b>, tilt the bird. If tilting the bird at <b>115</b> occurs before separating the hanging skin from the neck, it may be easier for the guide bar to pass between the neck and the hanging skin that covered the crop. By the time that the bird arrives at the station, the crop itself may already have been removed but the skin that covered the crop may still be present. An auger can be used to hold the neck of the bird such that the bird tilts for the tilting at <b>115</b>. The auger can also keep the turkey moving in the direction of the shackle line, thereby minimizing swaying.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">At <b>130</b>, the station can grasp the skin using a pair of rollers. The rollers can be peeler rollers. The rollers can grasp the skin at <b>130</b>, but they can also tension the skin at <b>140</b>. The rollers can have ribs, flutes, or the like, which may be provided in a spiral around the rollers in opposing directions to one another. In this way, the surface of the rollers may grasp and tension the skin of the bird while the bird continues to move in the direction of the shackle line. Other surface textures are also permitted. Peeler rollers may have a shaft length and shaft diameter exclusive of the surface texturing, and a bushing length and bushing diameter that includes the surface texture. Thus, for example, if the overall length of a roller is 1 meter, and 90 cm of the roller has the surface texturing, the shaft length (exclusive of the surface texturing) may be 10 cm, which may correspond to a portion of the roller. Similarly, if the diameter of the roller including the surface treatment is 2 cm, then the diameter of the shaft (exclusive of the surface texturing) may be 1 cm. These are simply numerical examples to demonstrate the principles, other lengths and diameters may be provided. The peeler rollers may also be characterized by the rate of spiraling of the surface treatment. For example, in a tightly wound spiral pattern, the pattern may advance one rotation every 1 cm of length. In a more loosely wound spiral pattern, the pattern may advance one rotation every 10 cm of length. The rollers may be made from stainless steel, tool steel, surgical steel, or the like.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Various techniques can be used to generate tension. For example, the rollers may be configured to provide uniform tension by being installed in parallel to the shackle line, or non-uniform tension (for example, gently increasing tension) by being angled slightly away from the shackle line. The degree of tension may be based on the rotation speed and the tightness of the spiral wound pattern of surface texture on the peeler rollers. The tension may also be enhanced by the tilting of the bird at <b>115</b>, which may supply a component of force opposite the peeler rollers. Thus, the peeler rollers may provide a force that is opposed both by an auger holding the neck of the bird and by the shackles holding the hocks of the bird.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">At <b>150</b>, the station can slice the skin. The slice may be made while the skin is being tensioned at <b>140</b>. By slicing while the skin is being tensioned at <b>140</b>, the cut can safely remove more of the skin without risking damage to the valuable breast meat. Additionally, by slicing the skin while the bird is being tilted at <b>115</b>, the bird may angled away from the slicing. Yet again, this may reduce the chances of nicking or otherwise damaging the valuable breast meat.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The slicing at <b>150</b> can be performed in a variety of different ways. For example, a rotating blade can be used. The rotating blade may be in the form of a disk with a serrated or sharpened edge. The rotating blade may be constructed similarly to the blade of a deli meat slicer. For example, the blade may be a disk with a serrated edge, which is able to withstand many revolutions per minute (rpm). For example, the blade may spin at a speed of 200 rpm to 2000 rpm. Other speeds are also permitted. The blade may be made from an integral disk that is mounted on a driving axel. Alternatively, the blade may be a ring that is mounted around an outer periphery of one or a pair of disks. When the blade is a separable ring, replacement cost of the blade may be slightly reduced. On the other hand, construction complexity of the blade may be slightly increased. A single blade may be used to slice the skin. The single blade may slice through the skin in an approximately horizontal direction. For example, if the shackle line is moving the bird from right to left, the blade may slice the skin starting at a left edge of the skin and proceeding to the right edge of the skin. The rotating blade may rotating contrary to the motion of the bird. Thus, for example, if the bird is moving from right to left, then the portion of the blade that contacts the skin may be moving from left to right.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Other slicing tools are also permitted. For example, instead of a disk blade, a single rotating knife blade or a fan-type arrangement of knife blades could be provided. In this approach, however, since only an outer tip of the blades may contact the skin, the only apparent benefit may be a slight reduction in the amount of metal used to construct the blade. Moreover, the fan-type approach may have lower stability as compared with a disk blade. As another option, a stationary blade can be provided, such that the skin is pressed against the static blade by the movement of the bird along the shackle line. This approach may have the benefit of reducing the need for a motor to power the blade. On the other hand, such a blade may need constant maintenance or replacement to maintain a sufficiently high level of sharpness.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a further option, a reciprocating blade, similar in construction to a so-called electric knife, can be used. With a disk blade rotating at high speeds there is the potential for material from the bird to be ejected anywhere along the disk. By contrast, with a reciprocating blade, any material ejected by the blade may have a narrower field. Furthermore, the potentially dangerous sharp surface of a reciprocating blade may be much smaller than the potentially dangerous sharp surface of a disk blade.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Nevertheless, with a reciprocating blade, it may be more difficult to limit the travel of the distal of the end of the blade, to avoid jabbing the breast meat of the bird. While this jabbing may be softened by blunting the end of the blade, any such blunting may have the effect of requiring greater clearance between the usable cutting point of the blade and the breast meat. Thus, a rotating disk blade may reduce the chances that the breast meat will be jabbed. Furthermore, the potential mess caused by skin fragments or the like being ejected from the rotating blade may be controlled by placing one or more static shields, such as stainless steel baffles, around the majority of the circumference of the blade.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Other slicers are also permitted. For example, a high energy laser or plasma cutter could be used to slice the neck skin. However, such slicers may require a relatively high degree of computer vision or similar control mechanism in order to limit the cutting only to the desired skin without further cutting into the valuable breast meat. Similarly, these cutting tools may require a high energy input to operate. Furthermore, because of its water content and for other reasons, a bird's skin may be rather resistant to laser cutting, as distinct from, for example, paper.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The slicer may be positioned on the opposite side of the skin from the neck of the bird. This positioning may permit easier clearance. For example, if the blade were positioned between the bird's breast and the skin, it may be necessary to make the blade very small. This position may be described as inside, because it is between the meat of the bird and the skin of the bird. By contrast, a blade with a diameter on the same order of magnitude as the length of the bird may be used when the blade is positioned on the outside rather than the inside.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">At <b>160</b>, the station can dispose of the cut skin. For example, the cut skin can fall into a trough beneath the shackle line. The cut skin can be conveyed through the trough by a conveyer belt or by a flow of water through the trough. As another option, the cut skin can be manually removed from time to time.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Thus, certain embodiments of the present invention use a series of conveyors, rollers, at least one auger, and a blade to remove the skin that covers the crop of the turkey. While the bird travels down a shackle line, certain embodiments of an apparatus may use a guide bar to separate the loose hanging crop skin from the neck of the bird. The neck can be contained in a segmenting auger that can help to keep the bird moving through the machine, while simultaneously angling the bird so that a precise cut can be made. The guide bar can lead the crop skin to a pair of peeler rollers with fluting, which can pull the skin away from the bird, providing tension to the skin while simultaneously keeping pace with the shackle line. While the skin is being pulled downward, a rotating serrated blade can slice through the skin, removing the skin below the cut. The rotating serrate blade can be mounted on a gimbal that allows the blade to be adjusted in a multiple-axis manner. Once the skin is cut, the cut off portion can drop into a chute or trough for further processing and/or disposal.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The gimbal and the operation of the gimbal are not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The gimbal or similar device can be used to precisely position the station and elements of the station. For example, the shackle line may be provided in a facility that processes poultry, and the bird position, therefore, may be determined by the processing facility. Accordingly, the station may include one or multiple movable elements that can adjust the height of the station to align to the hanging position of the birds. The adjustment may be performed while the station is off-line. For example, when processing is not being performed on birds, the gimbal can be used to precisely position the blade as well as the other components of the station. For example, the gimbal can be used to adjust the station to be level even if the floor on which the station is placed is not level.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view from an entry side of a station according to certain embodiments of the present invention.
