To implement the recited functions, surroundings detection sensors generally based on radar, LiDAR, ultrasound and camera sensors are employed. LiDAR sensors are important in particular for highly automated and autonomous driving, since they are capable of providing high-resolution three-dimensional images of the vehicle surroundings at from close to distant range.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">LiDAR (short for light detection and ranging) or else LaDAR (laser detection and ranging) is a method for optical distance and velocity measurement based on infrared laser beams. Very different types of LiDAR systems are in existence and differ inter alia in terms of their horizontal detection range (for example 70&#xb0; up to 360&#xb0;), light source type (for example continuous wave laser, pulsed laser or light emitting diode (LED)) and sensor technology (for example mechanically rotating mirror or digital micromirrors).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">LiDAR sensors are already used in the field of vehicle sensors today. One great advantage of these optical sensors is that they record a very precise three-dimensional image of the environment which they can save as a point cloud image. It is possible to employ one LiDAR sensor or two or more LiDAR sensors in a motor vehicle.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">LiDAR sensors typically have a cover in the region of the sensor field of view.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thermoplastic material may be employed as the base material for a LiDAR sensor cover. Component parts based on thermoplastic material offer many advantages over conventional materials such as for example glass for use in the automotive sector. These include for example elevated fracture resistance and/or weight reduction which in the case of automobiles allow greater occupant safety in road traffic accidents and lower fuel consumption. Finally, materials containing thermoplastic polymers allow substantially greater freedom in design on account of their easier mouldability.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The purpose of a cover made from a thermoplastic material is to conceal the LiDAR sensor and also to protect the sensitive sensor electronics.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is especially relevant for the LiDAR sensor function for the cover to function as an optical layer having very specific transmission characteristics in the range of the operating wavelengths and detection wavelengths of the sensor. A high-quality optical cover makes it possible to achieve for example a high sensor reach and high data quality/image quality. US 2012/0287417 A1 describes this rationale for selection of suitable spectral filters in the field of view of the sensor: A suitable spectral filter is characterized in that it is transparent in the emission spectrum of the LiDAR sensor and simultaneously not transparent for ambient light, i.e. incident stray light, outside this emission spectrum.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">LiDAR sensors and the use of the polycarbonate Makrolon 2405 with the colour formulation 450601 are described in US 2012/0287417 A1. Such a composition contains only colorants such as are hereinbelow defined as colorants of group a. Further polycarbonate applications or compositions relating to LiDAR sensors are described in WO 2018/197398 A1. It has been found that the signal from the LiDAR sensor is disrupted by extraneous light when using such materials.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It has been found that a wavelength range of electromagnetic radiation that is particularly critical for LiDAR sensors is between 700 and &#x3c;900 nm. The receivers of many LiDARs&#x2014;the so-called photodetectors&#x2014;still have sufficient sensitivity in this range for electromagnetic radiation of these wavelengths to generate measured signals. There is simultaneously a great deal of ambient light in this wavelength range which derives from natural or artificial light and can reach the photodetector as stray light. Examples of stray light sources are the sun, road lighting at night, light from the headlights of other traffic or backscattered light from the headlights of one's own vehicle. This generates spurious signals in the sensor which mask the actual measured signals. Possible consequences include deterioration of the signal-to-noise ratio or disruption of distance measurements or even damage to the hardware of the receiver. Since the cover does not ensure complete absorption of the light it is possible for stray light to penetrate through the cover and reach the receiving unit and for the LiDAR sensor to be disrupted or damaged as described by extraneous light of these wavelengths.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It has especially been found that commonly used LiDAR sensors whose operating wavelength is 900 to 980 nm, for example 905 nm, but whose receiver registers light in a broader wavelength range, especially also below the operating wavelength of the LiDAR sensor, are disrupted by any extraneous light, but in particular light which has a wavelength of 700 to &#x3c;900 nm and does not derive from the LiDAR emitter. For such LiDAR sensors the requirements of the transmission characteristics of the covers are particularly demanding since the highly transparent and non-transparent wavelength ranges are adjacent. The same also applies to LiDAR sensors having their operating wavelengths in higher wavelength ranges. For these too, extraneous light having a wavelength of 700 to &#x3c;900 nm is particularly disruptive.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In order to block this disruptive light and to protect the LiDAR sensor from extraneous light it is desirable to achieve the highest possible absorption in the range from 700 to &#x3c;900 nm. However this is beset by a great many problems. Since the colorants never exhibit very sharp absorption lines but rather absorption bands extending over a particular wavelength range, entirely vertical absorption flanks that simply filter out the desired light range are not possible. Only very few colorants from the group of all colorants are suitable for polycarbonate or polymethyl methacrylate. A colorant must have an appropriate and sufficient heat stability for the compounding process and for the moulding process. Good incorporability must also be present. Furthermore, the fact that a colorant is in principle suitable for polycarbonate or polymethylmethacrylate does not allow conclusions to be drawn as to its suitability for LiDAR applications. A further problem is that many colorants are not stable, i.e. exhibit inadequate lightfastness. However, for the present objective it is especially important that the absorption properties in the range from 700 to &#x3c;900 nm do not change. One fundamental problem is that most commonly used colorants for LiDAR-capable thermoplastic substrate materials, i.e. especially polycarbonate and polymethylmethacrylate, only exhibit relevant absorptions between 400 and 650 nm</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Japanese patent JP 6354888 B2 describes a multilayer article made of polycarbonate for an IR sensor system containing a certain colorant mixture. The following colorants are described: a first type of colorant from the group of quinoline dyes which absorb in the wavelength range 300 to 550 nm, a second type from the group of anthraquinones dyes which absorb between 450 and 800 nm, a third type of dye from the group of perinones which absorb between 400 and 800 nm and a fourth type from the group of triazines, actually UV absorbers, which absorb between 100 and 400 nm. This application thus describes a multiplicity of colorants but the decisive colorants of colorant group b as defined hereinbelow which have an absorption maximum in the range from 650 to 850 nm are not mentioned. A person skilled in the art thus cannot in practice develop LiDAR-capable substrates showing cutoff bands shifted to higher wavelengths. The cutoff band is the long-wavelength flank in the absorption band of the colorant mixture characterized by an absorption maximum followed by a fall in absorption with increasing wavelength and an absorption minimum. The application further describes a single transmission measurement to demonstrate the suitability of the colorant mixture for IR-assisted sensors. However, a single transmission measurement does not make it possible to draw any conclusions about the suitability of corresponding compositions for LiDAR systems. Colorant mixtures forming part of the subject matter of the present invention are not described in JP 6354888 B2.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">JP 2008009222 A and JP 2008009238 A likewise describe colorant mixtures for sensor systems. However, LiDAR systems are not described. The colorant mixtures are suitable for polycarbonate. The colorant mixtures contain colorants unsuitable for LiDAR systems. Concentration ranges unsuitable for LiDAR systems are also mentioned. Also required for these colorant mixtures are phosphorus-based stabilizers which are not required for the colorant mixtures disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The cover systems behind which the LiDAR units are located are in most cases nontransparent, i.e. opaque/black-coloured, i.e. the corresponding substrate materials are absorbent over the entire visible spectral range, i.e. in the range between about 380 and 780 nm, and in this range have a transmission Ty of &#x3c;0.5% determined according to DIN EN ISO 13468-2:2006 at a layer thickness of 4 mm. Since many LiDAR systems operate in the range from 900 nm to 980 nm, i.e. emit signals in this range, for example at an operating wavelength of 905 nm, it is necessary for the corresponding thermoplastic substrate to have a high transmission at 900 nm, ideally higher than 85%, preferably higher than 86% and especially preferably higher than 88%, determined according to DIN EN ISO 13468-2:2006 at a layer thickness of 4 mm. However it must be noted here that the transmission measurement alone gives no indication of whether a material is suitable for LiDAR sensors.

A cover within the meaning of the invention may here be a housing which completely or substantially completely&#x2014;apart from cable ducts etc. &#x2014;encompasses the LiDAR sensor. Such a combination of housing and LiDAR sensor likewise forms part of the subject matter of the invention in addition to the superordinate system of the vehicle. It will be appreciated that all embodiments and configurations described as preferable also apply to this combination alone. Likewise the cover may however also be only one element placed in front of the LiDAR sensor in the direction of the vehicle outer skin, preferably as the vehicle outer skin. Such a cover is for example a front panel or a bumper, preferably a front panel. According to the invention a front panel is to be understood as meaning a vehicle body part which as part of the outer shell is attached to the vehicle. This may be a formative constituent of the vehicle front or a design element attached to the front of the vehicle. The cover here is the element traversed by the laser pulses of the LiDAR sensor for detection of the surroundings.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The cover is preferably a moulding employed in the front or rear region of a vehicle, in particular of a motor vehicle, for example a bumper, radiator grille, front panel or a rear panel, in particular a front panel for a motor vehicle, but may likewise be a vehicle side element. The cover may also be only one part of such an element. However, the cover may likewise also be a roof or roof module for a motor vehicle. The cover may equally be a moulding employed in the interior of a vehicle. The system according to the invention may then be used to discern control gestures made by occupants of a vehicle. A &#x201c;front panel&#x201d; is to be understood as meaning for example a replacement for a radiator grille. As a result of new forms of mobility, for example electromobility, a radiator grille consisting of a multiplicity of openings is no longer necessary. A front panel is therefore preferably a self-contained front cover or a body part which may comprise only occasional ventilation slots or retains a radiator grille appearance only for design reasons and combines various functions. Such a component part can be integrated seamlessly.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The cover may be mounted not only on motor vehicles but also on other means of transport and means of locomotion, such as drones, aeroplanes, helicopters or rail vehicles, which in accordance with the invention are all subsumed within the term &#x201c;vehicles&#x201d;. Use in (semi)autonomous machines which are not necessarily used for locomotion, such as robots, harvesters and the like, is also possible.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The distance between the cover and the LiDAR unit is preferably in the range from 1 cm to 20 cm. Larger distances or smaller distances are also possible in principle however. In principle, the LiDAR sensor may be placed directly onto the cover and optionally connected to the cover, by adhesive bonding or by screwing, for example.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The term &#x201c;system&#x201d; is understood not only in the narrow sense of a package of mechanically joined individual parts, such as an apparatus, for instance, but also more broadly as a mere combination of individual parts (merely) joined in a functional sense to form a unit. The LiDAR emitter and receiver may be installed into the respective vehicle separately and the cover provided for a desired position in the vehicle through which the pulses of the LiDAR sensor are intended to pass. However, a mechanically joined combination may likewise be concerned.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The LiDAR unit comprises an emitter for laser light having a wavelength of 900 nm to 1600 nm. In accordance with the nature of laser light, this is not to be understood as meaning that the emitter emits light having every wavelength between 900 nm and 1600 nm. On the contrary, it is sufficient when light of one wavelength, for example 905 nm, is emitted. The wavelength which is emitted as light is the so-called operating wavelength. It is also possible to employ a plurality of lasers having different wavelengths in the recited range. It is preferable when the operating wavelength of the laser is in the range from 900 to 980 nm, more preferably up to 950 nm. It is very particularly preferable when the operating wavelength of the laser is 905 nm.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The receiver is typically tuned to a broader spectral window in the wavelength range of 800 nm to 1600 or to a plurality of wavelengths in this range. A broad-spectrum tuning to the recited wavelength range does not mean that the receiver needs to cover the whole range. In contrast to the defined operating wavelength of the LiDAR sensor, i.e. for example the 905 nm of the emitter, the receiver covers a significantly wider range, however, for example 800 to 1000 nm. However, according to the invention it is provided that the receiver at least partially receives light from the range 700 to 900 nm.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The cover comprises a substrate layer or a subregion of a substrate layer made of a thermoplastic composition based on aromatic polycarbonate and/or polymethyl methacrylate. It is preferable when the substrate layer consists of the thermoplastic composition.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">&#x201c;Based on&#x201d; is to be understood as meaning that the composition of the substrate layer contains the aromatic polycarbonate and/or polymethylmethacrylate as the principal component, preferably in a proportion of at least 70% by weight, preferably at least 80% by weight, more preferably at least 85% by weight, yet more preferably at least 90% by weight, particularly preferably at least 95% by weight, in each case based on the total composition of the substrate layer.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">It is particularly preferable when the thermoplastic composition of the substrate layer is based on aromatic polycarbonate. According to the invention &#x201c;polycarbonate&#x201d; is to be understood as meaning both homopolycarbonates and copolycarbonates. These polycarbonates may be linear or branched in the familiar manner. It is also possible according to the invention to employ mixtures of polycarbonates, both mixtures of different homopolycarbonates and mixtures of different copolycarbonates and also mixtures of different homo- and copolycarbonates.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In addition to these polymers the thermoplastic composition may also contain blend partners, for example polyestercarbonate, aromatic polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), PET cyclohexanedimethanol copolymer (PETG), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). It is preferable when the thermoplastic composition of the substrate layer contains, however, no further thermoplastic polymer in addition to aromatic polycarbonate and/or polymethyl methacrylate. Further thermoplastic polymer may be present only in amounts such that the permeability to the laser pulses of the LiDAR sensor is not disrupted to an extent such that the system loses its functionality. The substrate layer therefore preferably contains less than 5.0% by weight, more preferably less than 1.0% by weight, of further thermoplastic polymer, and very preferably no further thermoplastic polymer at all. According to the invention &#x201c;less than&#x201d; is to be understood as meaning that the respective component may also not be present at all.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Aromatic polycarbonates selected in accordance with the invention preferably have weight-average molecular weights M<sub>w </sub>of 22 000 to 29 000 g/mol, although in principle weight-average molecular weights M<sub>w </sub>of 10 000 to 50 000 g/mol, more preferably of 14 000 to 40 000 g/mol, very preferably of 16 000 to 32 000 g/mol would also be suitable. The values for M<sub>w </sub>here are determined by a gel permeation chromatography, calibrated against bisphenol A polycarbonate standards using dichloromethane as eluent, calibration with linear polycarbonates (made of bisphenol A and phosgene) of known molar mass distribution from PSS Polymer Standards Service GmbH, Germany; calibration according to method 2301-0257502-09D (2009 Edition in German) from Currenta GmbH &#x26; Co.

One variant is the use of the adhesive primer necessary for the siloxane-based topcoat as a UV protection primer when said primer is mixed with a UV absorber and applied in a higher layer thickness.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">(b) thermally curable multilayer systems comprising a UV protection primer and a topcoat based on a polysiloxane coating. Suitable systems are known for example from U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,391,795 A and 5,679,820 A.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">(c) UV-curable coating systems, based on acrylate, urethane acrylate or acryloylsilane for example and optionally including fillers for improving scratch resistance, may likewise provide sufficient protection from weathering on account of their relatively broad application layer thickness window. Such systems are known and are described inter alia in U.S. Pat. No. 3,707,397 A or DE 69 71 7959 T2, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,990,188 A, 5,817,715 A, 5,712,325 A and WO 2014/100300 A1.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">If an adhesion promoter layer (primer layer) is present between the topcoat layer and the substrate layer said layer is preferably a combination of an adhesion promoting UV protection primer based on polymethyl methacrylate comprising dibenzoyl resorcinol as a UV absorber and a polysiloxane topcoat comprising a silylated UV absorber. Both layers, i.e. the primer layer and the topcoat layer together, assume the UV protection function.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0096">The cover may further include inter alia the following layers: an anti-reflection layer, an anti-condensation layer, an anti-dust layer, a layer improving media resistance, a layer improving scratch resistance or a combination thereof. Examples of anti-condensation and anti-dust coatings are layers obtained by flame silicatization. Anti-reflection layers include all single-ply or multi-ply layer constructions having as their outer layer a layer of low refractive index (nD&#x3c;1.5). The use of the exteriorly employed coating may also improve inter alia the following properties: media-resistance, scratch resistance, reflection reduction (antireflection) and mild anti-dust effect.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0097">The substrate layer of the covers described according to the invention in the region of the described thermoplastic compositions, preferably in the entire region of the substrate layer, preferably has a thickness of 1.0 to 7.0 mm, more preferably 1.6 to 6.0 mm, particularly preferably a thickness of 2.0 to 4.0 mm. The reported thicknesses relate to the average thickness over the entire area of the substrate layer. Since any topcoat layer optionally present has a thickness in the &#x3bc;m range, and the same is true of any primer layer optionally present, the overall thickness of the cover preferably does not deviate substantially from these values and these values may therefore apply equally to the total thickness of the cover.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0100" num="0098">Components</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099">PC-1: Linear bisphenol A homopolycarbonate comprising end groups based on phenol having a melt volume rate MVR of 12 cm<sup>3</sup>/10 min (measured at 300&#xb0; C. and a loading of 1.2 kg according to ISO 1133-1:2011) and containing as colorants of group a 0.031% by weight of Oracet Yellow 180, 0.12% by weight of Macrolex Violet B and 0.067% by weight of Macrolex Green 5B, further additives: 0.30% by weight of pentaerythritol tetrastearate and 0.05% by weight of Irganox B900.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">PC-2: Linear bisphenol A homopolycarbonate comprising end groups based on phenol having a melt volume rate MVR of 6 cm<sup>3</sup>/10 min (measured at 300&#xb0; C. and a loading of 1.2 kg according to ISO 1133-1:2011).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0101">PC-3: Linear bisphenol A homopolycarbonate comprising end groups based on phenol having a melt volume rate MVR of 18 cm<sup>3</sup>/10 min (measured at 300&#xb0; C. and a loading of 1.2 kg according to ISO 1133-1:2011) and containing as colorants from group a 0.005% by weight of Macrolex Yellow 3G, 0.06% by weight of Macrolex Red EG and 0.019% by weight of Amaplast Blue HB and as colorant from group b 0.032% by weight of colorant A (colorant of formula (4)), further additives: 0.04% by weight of pentaerythritol tetrastearate.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0102">PC-4: Luminate 7276.

id="p-0137" num="0134">Example 1 shows that without colorants of the claimed group b the desired &#x201c;cutoff&#x201d; in spectrum is not achievable&#x2014;the LED, as used in automotive headlights, is thus clearly visible and would thus likewise be captured by the LiDAR Sensor. Examples 2, 3, 5 and 6 contain colorants from the group b and thus exhibit the desired &#x201c;cutoff characteristics&#x201d;. Despite the use of colorants absorbent at longer wavelengths the attenuation of the LiDAR signal remains low. Example 4 shows that concentrations of colorants from group b which are outside the inventive concentration range, presently an excessively high concentration, result in a surprisingly severe increase in attenuation of the LiDAR signal. This also applies to example 10. Example 7 does not show the desired attenuation of the LED light despite the use of a colorant whose absorption maximum is between 650 and 700 nm. Example 9 also employed a colorant that exhibits an absorption maximum in the range from &#x3e;650 nm bis 800 nm and shows practically no absorption above 750 nm but significantly attenuates the LiDAR signal. It could thus be demonstrated that not all colorants having their absorption maximum in the range from &#x3e;650 nm to 800 nm were able to achieve the desired &#x201c;cutoff characteristics&#x201d; coupled with low attenuation of the LiDAR signal. It is apparent that only the compositions according to the invention allow a high residual signal strength and achieve the required covering of the LED light.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00001" cdx-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00001.CDX" mol-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00001.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00002" cdx-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00002.CDX" mol-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00002.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00003" cdx-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00003.CDX" mol-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00003.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00004" cdx-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00004.CDX" mol-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00004.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00005" cdx-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00005.CDX" mol-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00005.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00006" cdx-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00006.CDX" mol-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00006.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00007" cdx-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00007.CDX" mol-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00007.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00008" cdx-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00008.CDX" mol-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00008.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00009" cdx-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00009.CDX" mol-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00009.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00010" cdx-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00010.CDX" mol-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00010.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00011" cdx-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00011.CDX" mol-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00011.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00012" cdx-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00012.CDX" mol-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00012.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00013" cdx-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00013.CDX" mol-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00013.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00014" cdx-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00014.CDX" mol-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00014.MOL"/><us-chemistry idref="CHEM-US-00015" cdx-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00015.CDX" mol-file="US20230003839A1-20230105-C00015.MOL"/><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-15" num="01-15"><claim-text><b>1</b>.-<b>15</b>.
