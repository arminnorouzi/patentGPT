Also, the user can firstly register in the first application with the user name UserA1 and then set the user UserA in the target application as the associated user. The user names UserA and UserA1 represent actual users of the terminal device and thus can be collectively called the local user of the terminal device.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The target application can acquire the messages from the client of the first application.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The messages of the first application can be Wechart messages, NetEasy Email messages or SMS messages.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Step S<b>202</b>: adding and displaying list items of the messages in an electronic content list.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The electronic content list of the target application contains multiple list items of electronic contents. After the target application acquires the messages, the list items of the messages can be added and displayed in the electronic content list of the target application, for example, list items of instant messages are added and displayed, so that the electronic content list can also contain the list items of the messages. Therefore, the user can view the list items of the messages directly or by sliding the electronic content list.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the embodiment, the list items of the messages can display all or part of message contents of the messages, for example, summary contents extracted from the messages, or contents of the set number of words or lines of the messages. In actual use, due to the limit of the screen size of the terminal device, the terminal device can display only part of the list items in the electronic content list at any moment, so the list items of the messages can be further added and displayed in the current display area of the electronic content list. The current display area is an area where the user can view the list through the terminal device at the current moment. In this way, the user can immediately view the list item of the latest message in the current area of the electronic content list interface, and can receive the latest message without the need of pulling up or down the list for search.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an electronic content list interface <b>300</b>.

For example, the user can enter an instant message list by clicking on the &#x201c;Message&#x201d; option <b>393</b>, wherein the instant message in the list items can come from the target application or other applications such as the first application.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the middle area is the current display area of the electronic content list and comprises five list items. In the uppermost list item <b>340</b>, an item <b>341</b> indicates the title information (&#x201c;Title4&#x201d;) of electronic contents, and an item <b>342</b> indicates the summary information (&#x201c;Summary&#x201d;) of the electronic contents. The following four list items of electronic contents have the title information of &#x201c;Title5&#x201d; to &#x201c;Title8&#x201d;. The rightmost item <b>301</b> in the middle area is a slider, indicating that the area to the left can slide up and down.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">When the user clicks on any list item such as the item <b>340</b>, the terminal device can open the corresponding electronic content detail interface <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> in response to the operation of opening the list item <b>340</b>, and the detail interface <b>400</b> not only displays the title information (&#x201c;Title4&#x201d;) item <b>341</b> of the electronic contents, but also displays the author information (&#x201c;Author&#x201d;) item <b>421</b> and the text information (&#x201c;Content&#x201d;) item <b>422</b> of the electronic contents.

The list items are marked as list items of instant messages by displaying &#x201c;Message&#x201d; in the message marking areas <b>511</b> and <b>521</b> so that the list items of instant message can be displayed in a notable mode different from the list items of electronic contents. An item <b>512</b> in the message area is the sender UserB of instant messages, and a message content item <b>513</b> is &#x201c;Have you ever seen the movie Avengers: Endgame?&#x201d;. Also, for example, an item <b>522</b> in the message content area of the list item <b>520</b> displays the sender of instant messages as UserC, and a message content item <b>523</b> is a share link of Yahoo website.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the list items <b>510</b> and <b>520</b> of instant messages respectively have dedicated message marking areas <b>511</b> and <b>521</b> where &#x201c;Message&#x201d; is written, and the background color can be deeper. The measures are designed to display list items of instant messages in a notable mode to highlight the differences from list items of electronic contents and to alert the user to new instant messages in a more notable mode so that the user will not miss out on important messages.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">For other types of messages acquired, the list items can be displayed in the same notable mode as the list items of instant messages or in different notable modes so that the user can also distinguish different types of messages through the message marking areas. For example, different colors are used in the message marking areas, or different message sources are indicated, so as to distinguish instant communication messages, Email messages, SMS messages, etc. sent from different applications.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">According to the above steps S<b>201</b>-S<b>202</b>, the data processing method of the embodiment is used in the electronic content list. If a new message is received, the list item of the new message will be inserted and naturally embedded in the electronic content list, which maintains the integrity of the reading interface, not only alerts the user to the new message in a timely manner, but also reduces disturbance to the reading of the user. The user can read the message after reading the current electronic contents, or easily decide to continue reading the electronic contents or reply immediately or after thinking according to the content of the message after a quick glance at the message. Even if a new message is received and the list item cannot be displayed when the user reads electronic content details, after the user reads the electronic content details and then returns to the electronic content list, the new message can be quickly discovered.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In addition, the method of the embodiment has obvious advantages compared with the solution that the terminal device displays a corresponding prompt bar when a new instant message is received in the prior art. The prompt bar not only destroys the integrity of the electronic content interface and has smaller font size which is inconvenient for reading, but also appears on the screen for a short time, and if the user does not read the content of the prompt bar immediately, the prompt bar may disappear, so the user is forced to immediately stop reading the current electronic contents, which disturbs the normal reading of the user. Moreover, even if the user reads the content of the prompt bar immediately, the prompt bar may disappear before the user has time to think. Once the prompt bar is missed out, the user may need to return to the desktop first and then click on the instant communication application to enter the instant communication dialog interface to view the new message, which has many drawbacks. With the data processing method of the embodiment, the user will neither stop the current reading because of worrying about the disappearance of the prompt bar nor need to switch to the instant message interface to view the message through cumbersome steps after the disappearance of the prompt bar, which improves the user experience.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In embodiment 2, the data processing method can also comprise the following step after the above step S<b>202</b>, for example, when the user clicks on the list item <b>520</b> of the instant message shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>: opening an interface corresponding to the messages in response to the operation of opening the list item of the message.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The interface corresponding to the message is an interface completely displaying the corresponding message provided by the message application. For example, if the message is an instant message, the interface corresponding to the message is an instant communication dialog interface.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">For example, when the user of the terminal device clicks on the list item <b>510</b> of the instant message on the list interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the target application will open the instant communication dialog interface <b>600</b> corresponding to the instant message shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, that is to open the instant communication dialog interface <b>600</b> between the receiver of the instant message and the sender UserB of the instant message. In this way, the user can communicate instantly with the sender UserB through the instant communication dialog interface. As mentioned above, the instant communication dialog interface <b>600</b> may belong to the target application or first application.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The instant communication dialog interface <b>600</b> comprises an item <b>611</b>, an item <b>612</b> and an item <b>613</b>, wherein the text of the item <b>612</b> is used for displaying the name UserB of the other party of a dialog, the button of the item <b>611</b> is used for returning to the instant message list interface corresponding to the instant communication application, and the button of the item <b>613</b> is used for returning to the previous electronic content interface. For example, in the case of entering the instant communication dialog interface <b>600</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> through the electronic content list interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the user can return to the electronic content list interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> through the item <b>613</b>.

In this way, the user can conduct a dialog, answer questions and express opinions through the interface corresponding to the message. Moreover, the user can directly return to the electronic content interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> by clicking on the item <b>613</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In embodiment 3, when the local user clicks on the list item <b>520</b> of the instant message shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the data processing method can also comprise the following step after the above step S<b>202</b>: displaying shared contents in the case that the instant message contains the shared contents in response to the operation of opening the list item of the instant message.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">According to the embodiment, in the case that the instant message contains shared contents, the user can directly open the shared contents by opening the list item of the instant message without the need of opening the instant communication dialog interface corresponding to the instant message first and then loading and displaying the shared contents by clicking on the link of the shared contents on the instant communication dialog interface.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In embodiment 4, further, the above step of displaying the shared contents can comprise: loading the shared contents according to the identifier of the shared contents specifically in at least one of the following methods:</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The first method: in the case that the identifier is a website, opening the website to display the corresponding shared contents.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">With <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> as an example, the item <b>523</b> in the list item <b>520</b> of the instant message in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> contains shared contents, and the identifier &#x201c;http://www.yahoo.com\ . . . &#x201d; of the shared contents is a website.
