a band part <b>200</b> for tightening the wrist of the user from the outside of the compression part <b>100</b> to fix the compression part <b>100</b> to the wrist of the user; and a reinforcing bar <b>300</b> located around the ligament covering the wrist tunnel and positioned between the compression part <b>100</b> and the band part <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In other words, the compression part <b>100</b> has a cylindrical shape, is made of a fabric having elasticity so that the user can wear the wrist guard on the wrist. The compression part <b>100</b> which has elasticity comes into contact with the user's wrist to be suitable for the curve of the wrist, absorbs sweat generated from the wrist skin of the user, and is smoothly transformed according to the curve of the wrist, thereby minimizing a sense of difference in wearing.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The band part <b>200</b> is disposed outside the compression part <b>100</b> to surround the periphery of the compression part <b>100</b> surrounding the user's wrist. The band part <b>200</b> includes: a wrist support <b>210</b> which is attached to the outer surface of the compression part <b>100</b> to surround the periphery of the ligament covering the wrist tunnel; and a strip <b>220</b> extending from both ends of the wrist support <b>210</b> to surround the circumference of the compression part <b>100</b> surrounding the wrist.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The band part <b>200</b> may be integrally formed with the compression part <b>100</b> by being sewed at a portion getting in contact with the compression part <b>100</b>, be integrally formed with the compression part <b>100</b> by an adhesive applied on the outer surface of the band part <b>200</b> getting in contact with the compression part <b>100</b>, or be integrally formed with the compression part <b>100</b> by thermal bonding of the compression part <b>100</b> and the band part <b>200</b> since primer is interposed between the compression part <b>100</b> and the band part <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition, the strip <b>220</b> is provided with a ring <b>221</b> at the front end thereof and a Velcro tape <b>222</b> disposed at a base end thereof to be inserted into the ring <b>221</b>. Accordingly, when the compression part <b>100</b> is put on the user's wrist, the front end and the base end of the strip <b>220</b> tighten the outer surface of the compression part <b>100</b> to fix the compression part <b>100</b> on the user's wrist.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The strip <b>220</b> is not limited to the ring <b>221</b> and the Velcro tape <b>222</b> described above, and may be transformed in various ways. For instance, the strip <b>220</b> may include a ring formed at the front end thereof, a retaining pin (not shown) disposed at the ring, and a plurality of holes (not shown) formed at the base end thereof in a longitudinal direction, so as to have a fixing structure that the retaining pin is inserted into the hole or a fixing structure that snap buttons are respectively disposed at the front end and the base end of the strip <b>220</b> to be coupled with each other.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The band part <b>200</b> has a structure thin waterproof films (not shown) are stacked on the upper surface and the lower surface of a cushiony member (not shown) showing an elastic restoring force like sponge. Accordingly, the band part <b>200</b> is not expanded in the longitudinal direction. When the front end and the base end of the strip <b>220</b> are coupled with each other to tighten the compression part <b>100</b>, the cushiony member is elastically transformed according to the curve of the wrist, thereby minimizing a sense of difference and firmly fixing the compression part <b>100</b> on the wrist.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Especially, the band part <b>200</b> stiffens the reinforcing force on the user's wrist by intensively reinforcing around the wrist tunnel and the ligament covering the wrist tunnel causing pain when the wrist is bent after the compression part <b>100</b> of the wrist guard is worn on the user's wrist and is fixed on the wrist by the strip <b>220</b>. The strip <b>200</b> is formed to be narrower than the wrist support <b>210</b> so as not to provide inconvenience in bending the wrist.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In other words, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>4</b></figref>, in case of the wrist support <b>210</b> and the strip <b>220</b>, the strip <b>200</b> extending at both ends of the wrist support <b>210</b> is formed to be narrower than the wrist support <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this instance, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the base end of the strip <b>220</b> is as wide as to surround and tighten between the wrist joint and the ulnar head A so that the strip <b>220</b> can tighten the outer surface of the compression part <b>100</b>. Accordingly, when the compression part <b>100</b> is fixed on the user's wrist, the base end of the strip <b>220</b> is located between the wrist joint and the ulnar head A so that the base end of the strip <b>220</b> is caught to the ulnar head A to stably tighten the wrist even though the wrist is bent. Therefore, the user does not feel inconvenience in a bending action of the wrist after wearing the wrist guard.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Moreover, the wrist support <b>210</b> has an extension portion <b>212</b> that extends convexly toward the elbow. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the extension portion <b>212</b> is extended from the inside of the wrist toward the elbow to increase the area of the wrist support <b>210</b>. Furthermore, the extension portion <b>212</b> also increases the reinforcing force supporting the ligament covering the wrist tunnel due to an area increase of the wrist guard <b>210</b> by the extension portion <b>212</b> when the wrist is bent toward the palm.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Meanwhile, the reinforcing bar <b>300</b> is disposed between the band part <b>200</b> and the compression part <b>100</b> to be located around the ligament covering the wrist tunnel. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> to <b>5</b></figref>, the reinforcing bar <b>300</b> is provided between the band part <b>200</b> and the compression part <b>100</b> such that a pair of rectangular plates are positioned at both sides of the wrist tunnel.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this instance, the reinforcing bar <b>300</b> may be a pair of rectangular plates made of a hard material, such as synthetic resin or metal. Preferably, the reinforcing bar <b>300</b> is formed in a rectangular shape extending from the palm to the elbow, and the pair of reinforcing bars <b>300</b> are spaced apart from each other and the wrist tunnel is positioned between the pair of reinforcing bars <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As described above, when the pair of reinforcing bars <b>300</b> are spaced apart from each other and the wrist tunnel is positioned between the pair of reinforcing bars <b>300</b>, the wrist guard according to the present invention does not provide inconvenience in bending the wrist and firmly supports the wrist since the reinforcing bars <b>300</b> do not press the wrist tunnel when the user wears the wrist guard.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The reinforcing bars <b>300</b> are not limited to the above-mentioned material, such as synthetic resin or metal, but may be modified in various ways. For instance, the reinforcing bar <b>300</b> may be made of a magnetic material generating a magnetic force, and when the reinforcing bar <b>300</b> is made of a magnetic material. In a case in which the reinforcing bar <b>300</b> is made of a magnetic material, it facilitates the blood flow of the wrist on which the reinforcing bar <b>300</b> is located, thereby helping health.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The wrist guard according to the present invention can increase a reinforcing force supporting the ligament since the wrist support <b>210</b>, which intensively reinforces the wrist tunnel and the periphery of the ligament covering the wrist tunnel, has a wide area and the extension part <b>212</b> extending from the palm of a user toward the elbow is formed on the wrist support <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Furthermore, the wrist guard according to the present invention can stably tighten the wrist even though a user bends the wrist, and does not provide inconvenience in use since the strip <b>220</b> of the band part <b>200</b> fixing the compression part <b>100</b> to tighten the user's wrist is located between the wrist joint and the ulnar head A.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In addition, the wrist guard according to the present invention includes a pair of the reinforcing bars <b>300</b> disposed between the compression part <b>100</b> and the band part <b>200</b> to be spaced apart from each other and the wrist tunnel is positioned between a pair of the reinforcing bars <b>300</b> such that the reinforcing bars <b>300</b> can firmly support the wrist without pressing the wrist tunnel and without inconvenience in bending the wrist when the user wears the wrist guard.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The present invention is not limited to the embodiments.
