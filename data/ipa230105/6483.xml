The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy by electromagnetic means was first demonstrated by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1821 and later quantified by the work of Hendrik Lorentz.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A magnetic field is generated when electric charge carriers such as electrons move through space or within an electrical conductor. The geometric shapes of the magnetic flux lines produced by moving charge carriers (electric current) are similar to the shapes of the flux lines in an electrostatic field. Magnetic flux passes through most metals with little or no effect, with certain exceptions, notably iron and nickel. These two metals, and alloys and mixtures containing them, are known as ferromagnetic materials because they concentrate magnetic lines of flux. Areas of greatest field strength or flux concentration are known as magnetic poles.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a traditional electric motor, a central core of tightly wrapped current carrying material creates magnetic poles (known as the rotor) which spins or rotates at high speed between the fixed poles of a magnet (known as the stator) when an electric current is applied. The central core is typically coupled to a shaft which will also rotate with the rotor. The shaft may be used to drive gears and wheels in a rotary machine and/or convert rotational motion into motion in a straight line.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generators are usually based on the principle of electromagnetic induction, which was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831. Faraday discovered that when an electrical conducting material (such as copper) is moved through a magnetic field (or vice versa), an electric current will begin to flow through that material. This electromagnetic effect induces voltage or electric current into the moving conductors.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Current power generation devices such as rotary alternator/generators and linear alternators rely on Faraday's discovery to produce power. In fact, rotary generators are essentially very large quantities of wire spinning around the inside of very large magnets. In this situation, the coils of wire are called the armature because they are moving with respect to the stationary magnets (which are called the stators). Typically, the moving component is called the armature and the stationary components are called the stator or stators.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Motors and generators used today produce or utilize a sinusoidal time varying voltage. This waveform is inherent to the operation of these devices.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In most conventional motors, both linear and rotating, enough power of the proper polarity must be pulsed at the right time to supply an opposing (or attracting) force at each pole segment to produce a particular torque. In conventional motors at any given instant only a portion of the coil pole pieces is actively supplying torque.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">With conventional motors a pulsed electrical current of sufficient magnitude must be applied to produce a given torque/horsepower. Horsepower output and efficiency then is a function of design, electrical input power plus losses.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">With conventional generators, an electrical current is produced when the rotor is rotated. The power generated is a function of flux strength, conductor size, number of pole pieces and speed in RPM. However output is a sinusoidal output with the same losses as shown in conventional electric motors.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In traditional generators and motors, the pulsed time varying magnetic fields produces undesired effects and losses, i.e. Iron Hystersis losses, Counter-EMF, inductive kickback, eddy currents, inrush currents, torque ripple, heat losses, cogging, brush losses, high wear in brushed designs, commutation losses and magnetic buffeting of permanent magnets. In many instances, complex controllers are used in place of mechanical commutation to address some of these effects.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In motors and generators that utilize permanent magnets it is desirable to increase magnetic flux densities to achieve more efficient operation. Most permanent magnet motor/generators used today rely on permanent magnets such as Neodymium magnets. These magnets are the strongest of the man made magnetic materials. Due to their strategic value to industry and high costs it is desirable to increase flux densities without relying on a breakthrough in material composition of these magnets or manufacturing high density special purpose magnet shapes and sizes.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In motors or generators, some form of energy drives the rotation and/or movement of the rotor. As energy becomes more scarce and expensive, what is needed are more efficient motors and generators to reduce energy costs.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In response to these and other problems, there is presented various embodiments disclosed in this application, including methods and systems of increasing flux density by permanent magnet manipulation. Specifically, methods and systems of increasing flux density utilizing commercially available shapes or sizes that can be chosen based on lower cost rather than flux density. Also described are methods of producing mechanical power by moving a coil/s coupled to a core into a magnet assembly with an increased flux density or producing an electrical output power when the coils are mechanically forced through the magnetic assembly with an increased flux density. In certain aspects, within the magnetic cylinder or magnet assembly magnetic flux lines are created and increased by the configuration of permanent magnets or electromagnets and are restrained within the magnetic cylinder or magnet assembly until exiting at predetermined locations.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In certain aspects presented herein, non-pulsating or non-sinusoidal DC current is applied to the power terminals which produces a Lorentz force at each length of coil conductor. This force is applied continuously throughout the entire rotation of the rotor hub without variations in amplitude or interruptions in output power. There are no pole pieces to provide magnetic attraction or repulsion consequently, there is reduced torque ripple, no pole piece polarity reversals and no interruptions in power output thus producing more efficient output than traditional motors</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">When certain aspects of the disclosed embodiments are used as a generator non pulsating or non-sinusoidal DC current is produced at the power terminals. A voltage is induced through the length of coil conductor and across all coils which induces an output current flow. This output is supplied continuously throughout the entire rotation of the rotor hub without variations in amplitude, polarity reversals, or interruptions in output power.

These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to limit the invention from that described in the claims. Well-known elements are presented without detailed description in order not to obscure the present invention in unnecessary detail. For the most part, details unnecessary to obtain a complete understanding of the present invention have been omitted inasmuch as such details are within the skills of persons of ordinary skill in the relevant art. Details regarding control circuitry, power supplies, or circuitry used to power certain components or elements described herein are omitted, as such details are within the skills of persons of ordinary skill in the relevant art.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">When directions, such as upper, lower, top, bottom, clockwise, or counter-clockwise are discussed in this disclosure, such directions are meant to only supply reference directions for the illustrated figures and for orientation of components in the figures. The directions should not be read to imply actual directions used in any resulting invention or actual use. Under no circumstances, should such directions be read to limit or impart any meaning into the claims.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Most motors and generators used today require or produce a sinusoidal time varying voltage referred to as Alternating Current (AC). When Direct Current is utilized it must first be inverted and pulsed to replicate an AC waveform to produce the desired current or mechanical output. Certain embodiments of the present invention neither produces nor utilizes Alternating Current but instead directly produces or utilizes a non sinusoidal Direct Current without the need for rectification or commutation. This results in the elimination of Alternating Current Losses and results in a more efficient utilization of input or output power. However, certain aspects of the invention may accept any rectified NC current and thus may be &#x201c;blind&#x201d; to input power supply phasing. Thus, simple rectified single phase, two phase, three phase power, etc. are all acceptable for input power depending on the configuration.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there is a cross-sectional view of one embodiment of a partial toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>100</b> illustrating representative planar magnetic flux paths <b>101</b> within and around the partial cylinder. These are representative illustrations; actual flux paths are dependent on the material design and specific configuration of the magnets within the cylinder. In certain embodiments, the partial magnetic cylinder <b>100</b> comprises an inner cylinder wall <b>104</b> positioned around a longitudinal axis <b>176</b>. An outer cylinder wall <b>102</b> is positioned at a lateral distance from the inner cylinder wall <b>104</b>. The outer cylinder wall <b>102</b> and inner cylinder wall <b>104</b> may be made with a plurality of magnets. In a lateral section view, such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it can be seen that the outer cylinder wall <b>102</b> is comprised of a plurality of magnets <b>106</b>, comprising individual magnets, such as magnets <b>106</b><i>a</i>, <b>106</b><i>b</i>, <b>106</b><i>c</i>, etc. Similarly, the inner cylinder wall <b>104</b> may be comprised with a plurality of magnets <b>108</b>, comprising individual magnets <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b</i>, etc. It should be noted that only one polarity of the magnets are utilized within (or facing into) the magnetic cylinder or magnet assembly. For instance in the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the north poles of the magnets <b>106</b> are each pointing radially towards a center <b>120</b>. On the other hand, the north poles of the magnets <b>108</b> each point radially away from the center <b>120</b> and towards an interior cavity <b>124</b> of the partial toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In certain embodiments, there may be a central iron core <b>110</b>, with most of the iron core positioned in the interior cavity <b>124</b> between the outer wall <b>102</b> and the inner wall <b>104</b>, however other core materials maybe used when design considerations such as strength, reduction of eddy currents, cooling channels, etc. are considered. In fact, in certain embodiments do not use the central iron core <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In certain embodiments, the magnets of the plurality of magnets <b>106</b> and magnets <b>108</b> may be made of out any suitable magnetic material, such as: neodymium, Alnico alloys, ceramic permanent magnets, or electromagnets. The exact shape and number of magnets or electromagnets will be dependent on the required magnetic field strength or mechanical configuration. The illustrated embodiment is only one way of arranging the magnets, based on certain commercially available magnets. Other arrangements are possible&#x2014;especially if magnets are manufactured for this specific purpose.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the partial toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>100</b> has two open ends <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>. Thus, an open area or throat <b>115</b> is formed between the open end <b>114</b> and the open end <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">When the plurality of magnets <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> are arranged into the outer wall <b>102</b> and inner wall <b>104</b> to form the partial cylinder <b>100</b>, the flux lines <b>101</b> will form particular patterns as represented in a conceptual manner by the flux lines illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The actual shape, direction, and orientation of the flux lines <b>101</b> depend on factors such as the use of an interior retaining ring, material composition and configuration. For example, the flux line <b>112</b><i>a </i>from the magnet <b>106</b><i>a </i>of the exterior wall <b>102</b> tends to flow from the north pole of the magnet in a perpendicular manner from the face of the magnet around the interior cavity <b>124</b> of the cylinder <b>100</b>, through the iron core <b>110</b>, exiting through an open end <b>114</b> into the open area <b>115</b>, then flow around the exterior of the partial toroidal cylinder <b>100</b>, and back to an exterior face of the magnet <b>106</b><i>a </i>containing its south pole.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Similarly, the flux line <b>112</b><i>b </i>from the magnet <b>106</b><i>b </i>of the exterior wall <b>102</b> tends to flow from the north pole of the magnet in a perpendicular manner from the face of the magnet around the interior cavity <b>124</b> of the cylinder <b>100</b>, through the iron core <b>110</b>, exiting through the open end <b>114</b> into the open space <b>115</b>, then flow around the exterior of the cylinder <b>100</b>, and back to the face of the magnet <b>106</b><i>b </i>containing its south pole. Although only a few flux lines <b>112</b> are illustrated for purposes of clarity, each successive magnet in the plurality of magnets will produce similar flux lines. Thus, the magnetic flux forces for each successive magnet in the plurality of magnets <b>106</b> tend to follow these illustrative flux lines or patterns <b>112</b> for each successive magnetic disc in the plurality of magnets <b>106</b> until the magnets at the open ends <b>114</b> or <b>116</b> of the magnetic cylinder <b>100</b> are reached.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Magnets on the opposing side of the cylinder <b>100</b>, such as magnet <b>106</b><i>c </i>tend to generate flux lines <b>112</b><i>c </i>from the magnet <b>106</b><i>c </i>on the exterior wall <b>102</b> which tends to flow from the north pole of the magnet in a perpendicular manner from the face around the interior cavity <b>124</b> of the cylinder <b>100</b>, through the iron core <b>110</b>, exiting through an open end <b>116</b> into the open space <b>115</b>, then flow around the exterior of the cylinder <b>100</b>, and back to an exterior face of the magnet <b>106</b><i>c </i>containing its south pole. Although only a few flux lines <b>112</b> on the opposing side of the cylinder <b>100</b> are illustrated for purposes of clarity, each successive magnet in the plurality of magnets will produce similar flux lines. As discussed above, in yet other embodiments, the iron core <b>110</b> is not necessary. In embodiments without an iron core, the flux lines will generally flow in a similar manner, but may not be as concentrated as embodiments with an iron core. Thus, in certain embodiments, the iron core may act as a flux concentrator.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In certain embodiments, the interior wall <b>104</b> also produces flux lines, such as exemplary flux lines <b>118</b>. For instance, the flux line <b>118</b><i>a </i>from the magnet <b>108</b><i>a </i>on the interior wall <b>104</b> tends to flow from the north pole in a perpendicular manner from the face of the magnet, around the interior cavity <b>124</b> of the cylinder <b>100</b>, through the iron core <b>110</b>, out the open end <b>114</b> and into the open space <b>115</b>, then back through the center space <b>123</b> formed by the interior wall <b>104</b> to the face of the magnet <b>108</b><i>a </i>containing its south pole. Similarly, the flux line <b>118</b><i>b </i>from the magnet <b>108</b><i>b </i>on the interior wall <b>104</b> tends to flow from the north pole in a perpendicular manner from the face of the magnet, around the interior wall <b>104</b> through the iron core <b>110</b>, out the open end <b>116</b> and into the open space <b>115</b>, then back through the center space <b>123</b> formed by the interior wall <b>104</b>, then back to the face of the magnet <b>108</b><i>b </i>containing its south pole.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The magnetic flux forces for each successive magnet in the plurality of magnets <b>108</b> tend to follow these illustrative flux lines or patterns <b>118</b> for each successive magnet in the plurality of magnets <b>108</b> until the open ends <b>114</b> or <b>116</b> of the magnetic cylinder <b>100</b> are reached. Thus, the flux produced by the magnets of the interior wall <b>104</b> of the partial cylinder <b>100</b> have an unobstructed path to exit through one of the open ends of the cylinder and return to its opposing pole on the exterior or interior of the cylinder.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments, the magnetic flux lines <b>112</b> and <b>118</b> will tend to develop a stacking effect and the configuration of the exterior magnetic cylinder manipulates the flux lines <b>101</b> of the magnets in the magnetic cylinder <b>100</b> such that most or all of the flux lines <b>110</b> flows out of the open ends <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> of the cylinder <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In conventional configurations, the opposing poles of the magnets are usually aligned longitudinally. Thus, the field flux lines will &#x201c;hug&#x201d; or closely follow the surface of the magnets. So, when using conventional power generating/utilization equipment, the clearances must usually be extremely tight in order to be able to act on these lines of force. By aligning like magnetic poles radially with respect to the center <b>120</b> of the partial cylinder <b>100</b>, the magnetic flux lines <b>112</b> and <b>118</b> tend to stack up as they pass through the center of the magnetic cylinder <b>110</b> and radiate perpendicularly from the surface of the magnets. This configuration allows for greater tolerances between coils and the magnetic cylinder <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In certain embodiments, the iron core <b>110</b> is positioned concentrically about the center <b>120</b> of the magnetic cylinder <b>100</b> such that the iron core is an equidistant radially from the interior wall <b>104</b>, generating a representative flux pattern <b>101</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The flux fields or lines are drawn to the iron core <b>110</b> and compressed or concentrated as it approaches the iron core. The flux fields may then establish what can be visualized as a series of &#x201c;flux walls&#x201d; surrounding the iron core which extend throughout the partial cylinder <b>100</b> and the exit open ends <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>. Collectively, the partial toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>100</b> generates a partially circular magnetic field <b>125</b> which is the cumulation of individual flux fields from each magnet. Correspondingly, there will be an open area <b>115</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the angle &#x3b1; between the open face <b>114</b> of the partial magnetic cylinder <b>110</b> and the open face <b>116</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to be approximately 60 degrees. In other embodiments, the angle &#x3b1; may be between 180 degrees to approaching 0 degrees. Obviously, when the angle is at 180 degrees the open area <b>115</b> is larger. When the angle approaches zero, the open area <b>114</b> is much smaller. The angle &#x3b1; cannot be zero, however, or the magnetic field <b>125</b> would collapse upon itself.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As discussed above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a two dimensional section view cut at an angle which is transverse to a longitudinal axis <b>176</b> of the center <b>120</b> (or center shaft). In addition to the cylindrical walls <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>, there may also be side walls which are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The side walls join the exterior cylindrical wall <b>104</b> to the interior cylindrical wall <b>104</b>. In certain embodiments, the side walls may be made of a plurality of side wall magnets which contribute to the cumulative magnetic field <b>125</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>, there is presented is a conceptual isometric view of the toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>100</b> having the central iron core <b>110</b> partially positioned within the interior cavity <b>124</b> of the partial toroidal magnetic cylinder. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>, there is the exterior cylindrical wall <b>102</b>, the interior cylindrical wall <b>104</b>, a side wall <b>170</b>, and an opposing side wall <b>172</b>. In embodiments, where the side wall <b>170</b> and side wall <b>172</b> are formed from a plurality of magnets, each magnet in the plurality of magnets have a common magnetic pole with cylindrical walls <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> which also face the interior cavity <b>124</b>. For instance, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the common magnetic pole (i.e., the north pole) of each magnet of the magnetic cylindrical walls <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> each point radially towards the interior cavity <b>124</b> of the partial toroidal cylinder <b>100</b>. Consequently, each magnet in the side walls <b>170</b> and <b>172</b> would also have their north poles facing the interior cavity <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The magnets forming the side walls <b>170</b> and <b>172</b> also produce flux lines. The flux line from the magnets of the side walls <b>170</b> and <b>172</b> tends to flow from the north pole interior facing pole of the magnetic in a perpendicular manner, around the interior cavity <b>124</b> of the partial cylinder <b>100</b>, through the iron core <b>110</b>, out either the open end <b>114</b> or the open end <b>116</b> and into the open space <b>115</b>, then back around the relevant side wall to south pole on the face of the originating magnet of the side wall. Thus, the side wall magnets also contribute to the flux field <b>125</b> generated by the magnets forming the cylinder walls <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>is a detailed partial view of the partial toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>100</b> illustrating the planar magnetic fields or &#x201c;flux walls&#x201d; <b>122</b> generated within the interior cavity <b>124</b> of the magnetic cylinder <b>100</b> in conjunction with the iron core <b>110</b>.

Although the shapes and number of the individual magnets of the partial toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>650</b> are different than the shape and number of individual magnets of the partial toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>100</b>, the flux lines and magnetic fields are conceptually similar.

Such flux line action is described in detail with reference to the partial toroidal magnetic cylinder <b>100</b> described above.

In open space, flux forces from the magnet <b>674</b> tend to flow directly around the magnet from the north to the south pole.
