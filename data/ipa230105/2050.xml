A payload suspension system, as provided, comprises a number of features that will become apparent with reference to the appended figures and associated description.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The techniques described herein are directed to techniques for simulating a low, zero, or near zero (low- or micro-gravity) conditions using a suspended payload that can be used in a variety of scenarios. The suspended payload may be positioned within a cargo hold of a terrestrial aircraft that performs a parabolic flight maneuver. Normal aircraft operations may produce acceleration-related stresses and disturbances that may degrade a low- or micro-gravity environment experienced by the payload. The systems and techniques described herein may be used to reduce acceleration-related stresses and disturbances and other movements that may affect a low- or micro-gravity environment.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Generally, parabolic flight maneuvers may be performed by an aircraft to simulate a micro-gravity or a low-gravity environment. As described herein, the low- or micro-gravity environment created during a parabolic flight may be referred to as a low- or micro-gravity condition or state and typically corresponds to a gravity condition in which the contents of the aircraft (passengers and cargo) experience less than 1 g (e.g., less than the acceleration due to Earth's gravitational field) or less.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As the term is used herein, low-gravity environments may be used to refer to a gravitational condition, as produced during a particular parabolic flight maneuver, of less than 1 g. In some implementations, low-gravity environments may refer to environments associated with gravitational conditions of less than 0.9 g and/or gravitational conditions of less than 0.5 g. Low-gravity environments may approximate gravitational forces on celestial bodies, including celestial bodies within the Solar System. As the term is used herein, a micro-gravity environment may be used to refer to a gravitational condition, as produced during a particular parabolic flight maneuver, of less than 0.1 g. In some implementations, micro-gravity environments may refer to environments associated with gravitational conditions of less than 0.05 g and/or of approximately 0.01 g. In some cases, micro-gravity environments may approximate gravitational forces as experienced in space. It is noted that, as the term is used herein, micro-gravity environments be a form of low-gravity environments and the phrase &#x201c;micro-gravity or low-gravity environment,&#x201d; as used herein, may refer to low-gravity environments, some environments of which may be micro-gravity environments. As used herein, a micro-gravity condition or environment may correspond to a gravity range of less than 10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>g. In some cases, the micro-gravity condition or environment may correspond to a gravity range of less than 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>g. In some cases, the a micro-gravity condition or environment may correspond to a gravity range of less than 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>g. In some cases, a micro-gravity condition or environment may also be referred to as a simulated zero-gravity condition or environment.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Low- or micro-gravity conditions created during parabolic flight maneuvers can be used to simulate conditions in space or celestial bodies in order to provide a low- or micro-gravity experience for the passengers or for scientific experiments conducted on the aircraft. For example, a gravitational value of approximately 0.38 g may correspond to Martian gravity, a gravitational value of approximately 0.16 g may correspond to a Lunar gravity, and a gravitational value of approximately 0 g (e.g., approximately 0.01 g) may correspond to gravity in space. In some cases, negative gravitational values may be produced during parabolic flight.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some cases, the payload suspension systems described herein can be used for flight maneuvers that are performed at different altitudes. For example, the payload suspensions system can be used for parabolic flight maneuvers performed at common flight altitudes that would include altitudes approximately ranging from 20,000 feet to 40,000 feet. In other cases, the payload suspension system described herein can be used for flight maneuvers performed at sub-orbital flights, for example, flights that include altitudes of approximately 300,000 feet or greater. Additionally or alternatively, the payload suspension system described herein can be used for suborbital, orbital or deep space flights, for example, a parabolic flight occurring at the moon or other planet. In some cases, the payload suspension system described herein can be used in orbital space craft to remove impulses, or other sudden movements, which could include movements to avoid space debris.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">During a parabolic flight maneuver, due to normal operation of an aircraft, acceleration-related stresses and disturbances may be generated, which may transmit through the aircraft fuselage and may be transmitted to the cargo hold and/or passenger cabin. These acceleration-related stresses and disturbances may disrupt or degrade the low- or micro-gravity condition, which may impact the experience of the passengers or affect low- or micro-gravity experiments being conducted on the airplane. In some cases, the acceleration-related stresses and disturbances may resonate or otherwise compound due to cargo or other payloads that are structurally coupled to the fuselage or other structural component of the aircraft. The systems and techniques described herein may be used to reduce the acceleration-related stresses and disturbances experienced by a payload (which may contain an experiment), or as experienced by passengers or equipment positioned in a cabin of an aircraft, and to enhance a quality of a low- or micro-gravity profile as experienced by passengers or equipment.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Embodiments described herein generally reference payload suspension systems. An example payload suspension system may include a suspended payload container suspended within an internal cavity defined by a frame of the payload suspension system. The suspended payload may be suspended by a set of tensile members which may, in some cases, be affixed to each corner of the suspended payload container on one end and may be affixed to the frame on the other end. The payload suspension system may isolate the suspended payload container such that acceleration-related stresses and disturbances produced during a parabolic flight maneuver, such as acceleration-related stresses and disturbances caused by aircraft engines and/or turbulence, do not affect, or reduce, a low- or micro-gravity quality experienced by the suspended payload container. Additionally, acceleration-related stresses and disturbances produced by the suspended payload container (e.g., during experimentation) may be isolated from external acceleration-related stresses and disturbances. Other aspects of the provided disclosure are additionally provided herein.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A payload suspension system may, as discussed above, include a set of tensile members, which may be formed from a cable, rope, wire, high tensile strength string, or other similar structural element. During a payload installation process, each tensile member of the set of tensile members may be adjusted to provide a particular length that allows the payload container to be suspended within a frame or other structure. For example, in some cases, the tension or slack in each tensile member is adjusted such that each tensile member both supports a payload weight and provides minimal, or no, sway or rotation allowance for the payload container. The tension in each tensile member may also prevent the payload container from contacting or impacting the surrounding frame or other structural elements.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some implementations, the payload container may be secured where some of the tensile members have a certain degree of slack or play. While the payload container may be suspended, the slack or play in some of the tensile members allows the payload container to float during a low- or micro-gravity condition created by the parabolic maneuver. For example, when an aircraft is flying under gravitational conditions at or around 1 g, the top tensile members may be taut, to suspend the payload container, while the bottom tensile members are loose. During a parabolic maneuver (e.g., less than 1 g conditions), the payload may &#x201c;float&#x201d; such that all tensile members have some degree of slack. As described herein, a transition between gravitational states within the aircraft may be detected using an on-board sensing system that can sense transitions in the flight conditions of a parabolic flight maneuver.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some implementations, a set of tension adjustment mechanisms may be provided to actively adjust or vary the tension in one or more tensile members depending on sensed conditions of the flight. For example, a tension adjustment mechanism may be coupled to a tensile member and may be used to apply tension to the tensile member during normal or greater than 1 g conditions and may reduce or remove tension applied the tensile member during low- or micro-gravity conditions. A tension adjustment mechanism may be provided for each tensile member such that each tensile member is individually controllable. In some cases, only some tensile members are provided with a respective tension adjustment mechanism. As described herein, a tension adjustment mechanism may include a movable pulley, a motor-driven spool, a linear cylinder, an eccentric cam, or other types of mechanism.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some cases, the tension adjustment mechanisms are communicatively coupled to a controller that is adapted to control the tension adjustment mechanisms in accordance with one or more sensors of a sensing system that monitor flight conditions or a gravitational state of a payload or payload suspension system. For example, an accelerometer may be used to detect an acceleration value of an aircraft on which the payload suspension system is provided. The accelerometer may be able to detect transitions or a state of the aircraft performing a parabolic maneuver, and the output from the accelerometer may be used to control tension in one or more of the tensile members. The sensors may detect either a transition into (or out of) a low- or micro-gravity condition or may be used to detect a sustained low- or micro-gravity condition.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The sensing system may include one or more of a variety of sensors including, for example, an accelerometer, which may be adapted to detect changes in accelerations or forces acting on the system. The sensing system may include a gravimeter that may be used to detect a gravitational force (e.g., a g-force) and may monitor a gravitational condition on an aircraft during a parabolic maneuver. In some cases, an altimeter is used to detect an altitude of an aircraft, where an altitude may correspond to what state an aircraft is in during a parabolic maneuver. Any number, and type, of sensor(s) may be used including gyroscopes, microelectromechanical system (MEMS) inertial sensors, or other types of sensors that are able to detect changes in acceleration, gravity, or inertial condition.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The payload suspension system described herein can be utilized for a variety of different types of experiments. For example, the payload suspension system can be used for physical science experiments, including but not limited to, physics/motion (e.g., particle physics, aggregation, plasma physics, etc.), materials sciences (e.g., polymer properties, processes and/or microstructures), fluid and combustion physics, chemistry, dynamic systems, and so on. In other examples, the payload suspension system can be used for technology experiments and life science research (e.g., human research, biology, and so on) or any other suitable types of experiments that can be conducted within the payload containers described herein.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Additional details of a payload suspension system are provided herein. Through the use of such a payload suspension system, a quality of a low- or micro-gravity condition, with respect to a payload, may be improved. In some implementations, the suspended payload system may prevent acceleration-related stresses and disturbances produced within the payload from affecting flight of the aircraft itself. Furthermore, the suspended payload system may isolate the payload from a passenger area and/or from other containers as may be provided in a cargo bay. As discussed herein, the payload suspension systems may have any number of shapes and may be formed from any number of materials. A suspended payload container may be provided within any number of frames in accordance with aspects of the provided disclosure.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">These and other embodiments are discussed below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>9</b></figref>.

A parabolic flight maneuver (discussed in further detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) includes the rapid rise and fall of the aircraft <b>10</b>. Due to physical principles, parabolic flight maneuvers may result in changing g-forces as experienced within the aircraft <b>10</b>. For example, while the aircraft <b>10</b> is quickly ascending or descending in altitude, a perceived gravitational force may increase. Likewise, at the top of a parabolic flight maneuver, a perceived gravitational force may decrease. This may result in people or objects experiencing periods of full- or partial-weightlessness or periods where people or objects experience heavier-than-normal weights.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Parabolic flight maneuvers may be performed for entertainment and/or research purposes. For example, passengers on the aircraft <b>10</b> performing a parabolic flight maneuver may experience full or partial weightlessness at certain points during a parabolic flight (e.g., a low- or micro-gravity condition) and may enjoy moving around a cabin area <b>14</b> of the aircraft <b>10</b> under altered gravitational perceptions.

In some cases, a payload may be jostled by the acceleration-related stresses and disturbances and a quality of the experiment may be degraded.

As such, acceleration-related stresses and disturbances caused by, for example, engine functions or turbulence may be prevented from traveling to the payload container <b>108</b> due to the isolated structure of the payload container. Yet further, acceleration-related stresses and disturbances produced from a payload within a payload container <b>108</b> may be prevented from affecting a low- or micro-gravity quality of a cabin area <b>14</b>, which may increase a low- or micro-gravity quality with respect to passengers aboard the aircraft <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The aircraft <b>10</b> may be any aircraft and may, in some cases, be a BOEING <b>767</b> aircraft, though any aircraft may be used in accordance with the provided disclosure.

In other cases, payload suspension system <b>700</b> may receive communications from an aircraft or other systems that indicate a transition to a parabolic flight maneuver (or other transition in flight parameters) or a transition between different stages of a flight maneuver. For example, the sensor <b>720</b> may detect that the aircraft is experiencing gravitational conditions (e.g., gravity at about 1G prior to performing a parabolic flight procedure) and cause each tensile members <b>710</b> to be in a taught configuration such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> to stabilize the payload container.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">As the parabolic flight procedure is performed, the sensor <b>720</b> may detect a change in the gravitational conditions and cause the tension adjustment mechanism <b>714</b> to adjust tension in one or more of the tensile members <b>710</b>.

In some cases, as the aircraft exits the parabolic flight, the controller <b>724</b> may cause an increase in tension in some or all of the tensile members <b>710</b> to stabilize the payload container <b>708</b> as the aircraft begins to experience an increase in gravitational forces. In some cases, determining changes in the gravitational conditions may include comparing the sensed conditions to one or more defined criteria.

For example, a transition to a micro-gravity state may trigger a testing script that causes one or more sensors associated with the experiment to collect data or indicate that the parabolic flight maneuver has been initiated. In some cases, a first sensing protocol may be performed prior to the flight maneuver and a second sensing protocol may be performed during the flight maneuver (e.g., higher sampling rate, modifying one or more testing conditions, initiating an experimental process, and so on). In some cases, the payload suspension system <b>700</b> may trigger one or more actions in response to detecting or determining an exit from a flight maneuver, such as a parabolic flight maneuver. For example, the process <b>720</b> may cause one or more sensors to stop collecting data and/or download and transmit data to one or more remote sources (e.g., for analysis).

Additionally or alternatively, the system may determine a position of the payload container within the frame and adjust one or more of the tensile members to adjust the location of the payload container with respect to the frame. For example, the system may monitor a deployed length of each tensile member to determine the location of the payload container within the frame and adjust the length of each tensile member to position the payload container within a defined location.

For example, the payload support system may include sensors that measure a gravitational force of the environment and detect transitions between gravitational conditions (e.g., change from positive gravitational position to micro- or zero-gravitational conditions). The sensors may transmit the gravitational measurements to the control unit, which may control the tensile members in response to the measured conditions, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In some cases, the environment sensing may be used to control the payload support container during different simulated gravitational conditions. For example, an aircraft may perform multiple different flight maneuvers that simulate different gravitational conditions such as micro- or zero-gravity conditions which may be experienced in some orbital conditions and/or low gravity conditions, which may be experiences in planetary or lunar orbital conditions. For example, an aircraft may perform a first parabolic flight procedure that simulates a zero-gravity condition and subsequently perform a second parabolic flight procedure that simulates low gravity, such as gravity that may be experienced in a lunar orbit.

The first threshold may be a defined decrease in gravitational conditions such as a change from earth gravity to a low gravity state. In some cases, the first threshold may be set to gravitational conditions in which the payload support container may still require some support to prevent it from contacting the frame, but that may occur in some types of simulate and/or orbital conditions. For example, the first threshold can be set for low gravity simulated flights, which may simulate lunar or planter orbits, and where the gravitational forces would still be high enough to cause the payload support container to drop within the frame or move in other undesirable ways. In response to the system determining that the measured gravitational forces are below the first threshold, the process <b>800</b> may progress to operation <b>808</b> and in response to the system determining that the measured gravitational forces are above the first threshold, the process <b>800</b> may continue to sense environmental conditions at operation <b>804</b>.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">At operation <b>808</b>, the process <b>800</b> can include determining if the sensed gravitational forces remain below the first threshold for a duration threshold. This process may be used to differentiate from transient changes in gravity (e.g., due to turbulence) and a transition to a longer-term low gravity state such as experienced during a parabolic flight, suborbital flight and/or orbital flight, as described herein. In some cases, the duration may be a predefined value. The duration threshold may be based on particular flight parameters, for example, a parabolic flight may have a first threshold duration and a orbital flight may have the same or different threshold duration. In some cases, the duration threshold may be dynamically determined, such as analyzed as a time averaged value. Additionally or alternatively, the duration threshold may be based on the measured gravitational conditions.

For example, the gravitational forces experiences by the box at the first threshold (and above the second threshold) may cause the payload container to contact the frame if unsupported. The second threshold may define a set of gravitational conditions where the payload container may be unsupported within the frame.

In a non-limiting example, a tension of the tensile members may be decreased so as to increase a movement/rotational ability of the payload container.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">At operation <b>908</b>, the method <b>900</b> (e.g., a controller performing the method <b>900</b>) may utilize sensors to detect a transition of the aircraft out of a low- or micro-gravity state. For example, this operation <b>908</b> may correspond to whether an aircraft is within the recovery transitional period <b>205</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, where the aircraft transitions from a low- or micro-gravity state to a non-microgravity state. For example, if an acceleration value increases by a threshold amount (e.g., 50 m/s<sup>2</sup>), the aircraft may be determined to be in a non-microgravity state. To determine whether the flight is in a non-microgravity state absolute values (e.g., absolute g-forces) or relative values (e.g., corresponding to a threshold change) may be monitored. For example, when a measured gravitational value meets or falls above a certain threshold value (e.g., a value at or above 0.38 g), the flight may be determined to be in a non-microgravity state. Any manner of determining whether an aircraft is in a non-microgravity state may be used in accordance with the provided disclosure. As another example, when an altitude reaches a certain value, the aircraft may be determined to be in a non-microgravity state in accordance with a known flight plan.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Operation <b>910</b> may occur after a transition into a non-microgravity state has been detected at operation <b>908</b>. At operation <b>910</b>, a tension or one or more tensile members suspending a payload container may be varied and/or adjusted. In a non-limiting example, a tension of the tensile members may be increased so as to decrease a movement/rotational ability of the payload container.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">The method <b>900</b>, as discussed above, may prioritize security during a standard and/or hyper-gravity state so that a payload and/or payload container is prevented from rotating and/or swaying. This may reduce the amount of risk of damage of the payload and/or payload container. During the standard and/or hyper-gravity state, the tensile members may be taut or in-tension in order to reduce or eliminate such movement. That is, at operation <b>910</b>, a tension of the one or more tensile members may be reverted to the tension established at an initial securement.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">The method <b>900</b> may prioritize proving a high-quality low- or micro-gravity state while the aircraft is at the peak of a parabolic flight. For example, at the peak of a parabolic flight, environmental test conditions may become more desirable than securement considerations. To cultivate a high-quality low- or micro-gravity state, the tensile members may loosen so that the payload and/or payload container has an increased movement/rotational ability and may move, unencumbered and/or minimally restrained, under microgravity conditions. The payload, therefore, may experience high-quality low- or micro-gravity conditions which may improve a quality of an associated experiment. In accordance with aspects of the provided disclosure, any acceleration-related stresses and disturbances value corresponding to less than 1/100<sup>th </sup>of 1 g may be considered noise and may be ignored.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts an example electrical block diagram of a payload suspension system <b>1000</b>, such as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>B</figref>.
