Mobile terminals may also be classified as handheld terminals or vehicle mounted terminals according to whether or not a user can directly carry the terminal.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A display device is a device having a function of receiving, processing, and displaying a video that a user may watch. For example, the display device receives a broadcast selected by the user from broadcast signals transmitted from a broadcasting station, separates a video signal from the received signals, and displays the separated video signal on a display.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, because of a development of a broadcasting technology and a network technology, functions of the display device have also been considerably diversified, and a performance of the device has been improved accordingly. That is, the display device has been developed to provide not only broadcast contents but also various other contents to the user. For example, the display device may provide game play, music listening, internet shopping, user customized information, and the like using various applications as well as programs received from the broadcasting station. In order to perform such extended functions, the display device may be basically connected to other devices or networks using various communication protocols, and may provide the user with an ubiquitous computing environment. In other words, the display device has evolved into a smart device that enables connectivity to a network and continuous computing.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, a flexible display, which has sufficient elasticity, and thus, be able to be deformed largely, has been developed. A size of the mobile terminal may be varied using a deforming property of the flexible display. In the mobile terminal having such a variable structure, a change in the structure of the mobile terminal must be performed stably.

The sub-pixel refers to a minimum unit for implementing one color.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The flexible display unit <b>151</b> may be in a curved state (e.g., a vertically or horizontally curved state) rather than a flat state in the basic state. In this case, when the external force is applied to the flexible display unit <b>151</b>, the flexible display unit <b>151</b> may be deformed into the flat state (or a less curved state) or more curved state.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The flexible display unit <b>151</b> may be combined with a touch sensor to implement a flexible touch screen. When a touch is made on the flexible touch screen, the controller <b>180</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may perform control corresponding to such touch input. The flexible touch screen may be configured to detect the touch input in the deformed state as well as in the basic state.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The touch sensor detects the touch (or touch input) applied on the touch screen using at least one of various touch schemes such as a resistive film scheme, a capacitance scheme, an infrared scheme, an ultrasonic wave scheme, a magnetic field scheme, and the like.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As an example, the touch sensor may be configured to convert a change in pressure applied on a specific portion of the touch screen, capacitance generated at the specific portion, or the like into an electrical input signal. The touch sensor may be configured such that a touch object applying a touch on the touch screen may detect touched position and area on the touch sensor, a pressure during the touch, a capacitance during the touch, and the like.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Further, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may have a deformation detection means for detecting the deformation of the flexible display unit <b>151</b>. Such deformation detection means may be included in the sensing unit <b>140</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The deformation detection means may be disposed in the flexible display unit <b>151</b> or a case (first to second frames <b>101</b> to <b>102</b> to be described later) to detect information related to the deformation of the flexible display unit <b>151</b>. In this connection, the information related to the deformation may include a direction in which the flexible display unit <b>151</b> is deformed, a degree of the deformation, a deformed position, a deformed time, an acceleration at which the deformed flexible display unit <b>151</b> is restored, and the like. In addition, the information related to the deformation may be various information that may be detected due to the bending of the flexible display unit <b>151</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition, the controller <b>180</b> may change information displayed on the flexible display unit <b>151</b> or generate a control signal for controlling a function of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> based on the information related to the deformation of the flexible display unit <b>151</b> detected by the deformation detection means.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The state conversion (first or second state) of the flexible display unit <b>151</b>, i.e., the size change at the front and rear faces of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> of the display unit <b>151</b> based on the size change of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may be performed manually by a force applied by the user, but may be not limited to such manual scheme. For example, when the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or the flexible display unit <b>151</b> is in the first state, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or the flexible display unit <b>151</b> may be converted into the second state by the user or an application command without the external force applied by the user. As such, in order for the flexible display unit <b>151</b> to be automatically deformed without the external force, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may include a driving unit <b>200</b> to be described later.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The flexible display unit <b>151</b> of the present disclosure is bent 180 degrees while being rolled on a side of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> in the first direction. Thus, a portion of the display unit <b>151</b> is disposed on the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> based on such side, and the other portion thereof is disposed on the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. A portion of the display unit <b>151</b> located on the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may be fixed to the front face so as not to move. Further, the other portion thereof located on the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may be movable to the rear face.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In addition, the display unit <b>151</b> may be rolled on or released from the side. Accordingly, the portion disposed on the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> moves, so that the size of the portion disposed on the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may be adjusted. Since the area of the flexible display unit <b>151</b> is determined and the flexible display unit <b>151</b> is formed of one continuous body, an area of the portion on the rear face decreases as an area of the portion on the front face increases. Such a display unit <b>151</b> may be rolled in a second frame <b>102</b>, which is movable relative to a first frame <b>101</b> to be described later, more correctly, on one of sides of the second frame <b>102</b>. The display unit <b>151</b> may be withdrawn or pulled out from or inserted or pushed into the second frame <b>102</b> while being rolled in the second frame <b>102</b> along a moving direction of the second frame <b>102</b> to adjust the area of the display unit <b>151</b> on the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. Such operation will be described in more detail below along with other relevant components of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Typically, an antenna is disposed in the body frame of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, but a portion where the antenna is installed in the body frame may be limited because of the flexible display unit <b>151</b> that covers not only the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> but also the rear face thereof. For this reason, the antenna may be implemented on the flexible display unit <b>151</b>. An antenna on display (AOD) is an antenna in which a transparent film is formed by stacking an electrode layer and a dielectric layer that have patterns engraved thereon, respectively. The antenna on display may be implemented thinner than an antenna implemented using a laser direct structuring (LDS) technology using a conventional copper nickel plating scheme, so that the antenna on display may not be exposed to the outside without affecting a thickness. In addition, the antenna on display may transmit and receive a signal directly to or from the display unit <b>151</b>. Accordingly, the antenna on display may be used in the mobile terminal <b>100</b> in which the display unit <b>151</b> is located on the both faces of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> as in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The mobile terminal <b>100</b> of the present disclosure includes frames <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> in which components are mounted, and the frames <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> of the present disclosure may vary in size in the first direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

The frame may include the first frame <b>101</b> and the second frame <b>102</b> moving in the first direction with respect to the first frame <b>101</b>. The first frame <b>101</b> and the second frame <b>102</b> include front portions, a rear portions, and side portions, respectively, and are coupled to each other. Thus, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may have a hexahedral outer shape by such coupled first and second frames <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">First, the first frame <b>101</b> corresponds to a main body of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, and may have a space therein for accommodating various components.

More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the first frame <b>101</b> may include a first front portion <b>1011</b> disposed at a front portion of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> and supporting the front face of the display unit <b>151</b> and a first rear portion <b>1012</b> disposed at a rear portion of the mobile terminal and on which various components are mounted.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The first front portion <b>1011</b> and the first rear portion <b>1012</b> may be spaced apart from each other at a predetermined spacing to define a predetermined space therebetween, and may be connected to each other by a side portion <b>1014</b>. The side portion <b>1014</b> may be integrally formed with the first rear portion <b>1012</b> or the first front portion <b>1011</b>. The camera <b>121</b>, the audio output module <b>152</b>, and the input/output terminal <b>161</b>, the controller <b>180</b>, and the power supply unit <b>190</b> may be accommodated as components of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> in the space in the first frame <b>101</b>. For example, the controller <b>180</b> may be a circuit board <b>181</b> including a processor and an electronic circuit for controlling the operation of the mobile terminal, and the power supply unit <b>190</b> may be a battery <b>191</b> and related components. In addition, the driving unit <b>200</b> that controls the slide movement of the second frame <b>102</b>, which will be described later, may also be accommodated in the first frame <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">As described above, the display unit <b>151</b> has the continuous body, and thus, may be disposed on both the front face and the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> while being rolled in the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. The display unit <b>151</b> may include the front face positioned at the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, the rear face positioned at the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, and the side face positioned between the front face and the rear face thereof and surrounding the side face of the mobile terminal. The front face and the rear face of the display unit <b>151</b> are flat, and the side face of the display unit <b>151</b> may form a curved face. When the flexible display unit <b>151</b> may be damaged when being bent. Thus, the flexible display unit <b>151</b> may be formed to be bent with a predetermined curvature.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The display unit <b>151</b> may be divided into a fixed portion and a variable portion. The fixed portion means a portion fixed to the frame. Because of being fixed to the frame, the fixed portion maintains a constant shape without changing a bending degree. On the other hand, the variable portion means a portion in which a bending angle or a position of the bent portion changes. The variable portion in which the position or bending angle of the bent portion changes requires a structure for supporting a rear face of the variable portion in response to the change.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The fixed portion is coupled to the first frame of the display unit and is always positioned on the front face of the display unit to form a portion of the front face of the display unit. The variable portion includes a side face located at a side portion of the mobile terminal, and a position of the side face varies depending on the position of the second frame. Based on a side face, an area of a portion disposed on the front face of the display unit and an area of a portion disposed on the rear face of the display unit vary. That is, a portion of the variable portion may be the front face and another portion of the variable portion may be the rear face based on the first and second states. The variable portion is positioned in the first direction with respect to the fixed portion relative to the mobile terminal, and an end of the variable portion is bent toward the rear face of the mobile terminal and slides on the rear face of the second frame.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The end of the variable portion of the display unit is coupled with a slide frame that guides the variable portion to slide move on the rear face of the second frame, and the slide frame moves in the first direction at the same time as the second frame moves in the first direction. As a result, a moving distance of the slide frame with respect to the first frame is twice as a moving distance of the second frame with respect to the first frame. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the first rear portion <b>1012</b> of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> includes an exposed rear portion <b>1013</b> that is exposed to the outside without being covered by the display unit <b>151</b> even in the first state. The physical input unit <b>120</b> for the manipulation of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> such as various buttons, switches, the camera <b>121</b>, and a flash, and the sensing unit <b>140</b> such as the proximity sensor <b>141</b> or a fingerprint sensor may be arranged on the exposed rear portion <b>1013</b>. The first rear portion <b>1012</b> except for the exposed rear portion <b>1013</b> may be covered by the display unit <b>151</b> in the first state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, and may be exposed rearwardly in the second state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">In a conventional bar-shaped terminal, a display unit is provided only on a front face of the terminal. Therefore, a main camera is placed on a rear face of the terminal in order for the user to capture an object at an opposite side while looking through the display unit. On the other hand, an additional auxiliary camera is required to be disposed on the front face of the terminal in order for the user to capture himself or herself while viewing himself or herself through the display unit.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">However, the display unit <b>151</b> is positioned both the front face and the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> of the present disclosure. Therefore, when the user captures himself or herself, a display unit on the same face as the camera <b>121</b>, that is, the portion of the display <b>151</b> on the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> in the drawing may be used. Further, when the user captures the object on the opposite side of the user, a display unit on the opposite face of the camera <b>121</b>, that is, the portion of the display unit <b>151</b> on the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> in the drawing may be used. For this reason, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may capture the object on the opposite side of the user and capture the user using the single camera <b>121</b>. The camera may include a plurality of cameras having different angles of view, such as wide angle, super wide angle, and telephotographic cameras. In addition to the camera, a proximity sensor, the audio output module, and the like may be positioned on the exposed rear portion <b>1013</b>, and an antenna <b>116</b> may be installed on the exposed rear portion <b>1013</b>. In order to protect the camera, the sensor, and the like of the exposed rear portion <b>1013</b> and in consideration of a design of an outer shape thereof, an exposed decor <b>1013</b> may be attached on the exposed rear portion <b>1013</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The side portion <b>1014</b> may extend along edges of the first front portion <b>1011</b> and the first rear portion <b>1012</b> to surround the first frame <b>101</b>, and may form the outer shape of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. However, as mentioned above, since the second frame <b>102</b> is accommodated in the first frame <b>101</b> and is movably coupled thereto, in order to allow the movement of the second frame <b>102</b> relative to the first frame <b>101</b>, a portion of the first frame <b>101</b> needs to be opened. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, as an example, the second frame <b>102</b> is movably coupled to one of both side portions of the first frame <b>101</b>, so that the side portion <b>1014</b> may not be formed on the side portion in the first direction, and thus, the portion of the first frame <b>101</b> may be opened. Accordingly, the first frame <b>101</b> may include a substantially closed first side portion <b>101</b><i>a </i>and a second side portion <b>101</b><i>b</i>, which is disposed to be opposite to the first side portion <b>101</b><i>a </i>and is opened. The side portion <b>1014</b> is exposed to the outside of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, so that an interface unit <b>160</b> for connecting a supply port or an ear jack, the user input unit <b>120</b> such as a volume button, or the like may be disposed on the side portion <b>1014</b>. When containing a metal material, the side portion <b>1014</b> may serve as an antenna.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The second frame <b>102</b> may include a second front portion <b>1021</b> disposed at the front portion of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> and a second rear portion <b>1022</b> disposed at the rear portion of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. Like the first front portion <b>1011</b> and the first rear portion <b>1012</b> of the first frame <b>101</b>, the second front portion <b>1021</b> and the second rear portion <b>1022</b> may be formed of plate-shaped members that are generally flat. In addition, the second frame <b>102</b> also accommodates various components, and must not interfere with the components accommodated in the first frame <b>101</b> during the movement. Accordingly, the second front portion <b>1021</b> and the second rear portion <b>1022</b> may be coupled to each other in a state of being spaced apart from each other to define a predetermined space therebetween, and may have shapes that do not interfere with the components in the first frame <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In addition, the display unit <b>151</b> may be bent 180 degrees while being rolled in the second frame <b>102</b> to be disposed on both the front face and the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. For such an arrangement of the display unit <b>151</b>, the second frame <b>102</b> may include a roller <b>1028</b> rotatably disposed therein. The roller <b>1028</b> may be disposed at any position inside the second frame <b>102</b>. However, the display unit <b>151</b> should be spread flat on the front face and the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> to provide a good quality screen to the user. Further, for such spread, a proper tension must be provided on the display unit <b>151</b>. In order to provide the proper tension, the roller <b>1028</b> may be disposed at a first directional end of the second frame <b>102</b>. The roller <b>1028</b> may extend in the third direction, and may be rotatably coupled to the second frame <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The display unit <b>151</b> may be rolled around the roller <b>1028</b> while being gently bent with a predetermined curvature.

The roller <b>1028</b> may be installed to rotate freely in the second frame <b>102</b> while being in contact with the inner face of the display unit <b>151</b>. Accordingly, the roller <b>1028</b> may actually move the display unit <b>151</b> in a lateral direction of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, that is, in a direction perpendicular to a longitudinal direction. As will be described later, when the second frame <b>102</b> slides, because of the tension applied by the second frame <b>102</b>, the display unit <b>151</b> moves to the front face or the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> in different directions (i.e., the first direction D<b>1</b> or the second direction D<b>2</b>) relative to the second frame <b>102</b>. The roller <b>1028</b> may guide such movement while rotating.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In addition, the roller <b>1028</b> is disposed on a first side portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>of the second frame <b>102</b>, and the first side portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>actually corresponds to an outermost side portion of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. When the first side portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>of the second frame <b>102</b> is exposed, the display unit <b>151</b> rolled on the roller <b>1028</b> may be damaged.

In addition, the second frame <b>102</b> may include a second side portion <b>102</b><i>b </i>that is disposed opposite the first side portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>to minimize interference with the components within the first frame <b>101</b> during the movement, and is opened.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Such a second frame <b>102</b> is movably coupled to the first frame <b>101</b>, and thus may slide in the predetermined first or second direction D<b>1</b> or D<b>2</b> relative to the first frame <b>101</b>. More specifically, the second frame <b>102</b> may be movably coupled to the first frame <b>101</b> through the side portion of the first frame <b>101</b>, more precisely, through the opened second side portion <b>101</b><i>b</i>, as shown. More specifically, the second side portion <b>102</b><i>b </i>of the second frame is disposed relatively adjacent to the first side portion <b>101</b><i>a </i>of the first frame <b>101</b> which is closed. Accordingly, the first side portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>of the second frame may be disposed to be opposite to the first side portion <b>101</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, the second side portion <b>102</b><i>b </i>is inserted into the first frame <b>101</b> through the side portion of the first frame, that is, the second side portion <b>101</b><i>b </i>thereof. The first side portion <b>102</b><i>a </i>is not inserted into the first frame <b>101</b> but is always located outside the first frame <b>101</b>, thereby forming the outer shape of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> as described above. However, when necessary, such first side portion <b>102</b><i>b </i>of the second frame <b>102</b> may also be inserted into the first frame <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Because of such positional relationship, the second frame <b>102</b> may extend from or contract to the first frame <b>101</b> in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or the first frame <b>101</b>. That is, the first and second directions D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> may basically be directions perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or the first frame <b>101</b>. Further, the first and second directions D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b> may also be described as the lateral direction or the horizontal direction of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or the first frame <b>101</b>. In addition, during the movement in the first direction D<b>1</b>, the second frame <b>102</b> extends from the first frame <b>101</b>. Accordingly, the first direction D<b>1</b> may be a direction in which the second frame <b>102</b> moves away from the first frame <b>101</b>, that is, moves outwardly of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or the first frame <b>101</b>. On the other hand, during the movement in the second direction D<b>2</b>, the second frame <b>102</b> contracts to the first frame <b>101</b>. Thus, the second direction D<b>2</b> is a direction opposite to the first direction D<b>1</b>, so that the second direction D<b>2</b> may be a direction in which the second frame <b>102</b> moves to become closer to the first frame <b>101</b>, that is, moves inwardly of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or the first frame <b>101</b>. When being moved in the first direction D<b>1</b>, such second frame <b>102</b> extends and applies a force to the portion of the display unit <b>151</b> disposed on the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, so that the portion of the display unit <b>151</b> may be disposed on the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, and a region for such additional arrangement may be defined. Thus, the second frame <b>102</b> may convert the mobile terminal <b>100</b> into the second state with the display unit <b>151</b> with the relatively extended front face by moving in the first direction D<b>1</b>. On the other hand, when being moved in the second direction D<b>2</b>, the second frame <b>102</b> contracts into an original state thereof, and applies a force to the portion of the display unit <b>151</b> disposed on the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> to return to the rear face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> again. Thus, the second frame <b>102</b> may convert the mobile terminal <b>100</b> into the first state with the display unit <b>151</b> with the relatively contracted front face by moving in the second direction D<b>2</b>. Accordingly, the second frame <b>102</b> selectively exposes the display unit <b>151</b> to the front face of the mobile terminal <b>100</b> depending on the moving direction (i.e., the first or second direction D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>). Accordingly, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> may be converted into the first or second state defined above.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">During the expansion and the contraction in such first and second directions D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>, the second frame <b>102</b> may overlap the first frame <b>101</b>, more precisely, the first front portion <b>1011</b> and the first rear portion <b>1012</b> thereof so as not to interfere with the first frame <b>101</b>. More specifically, the display unit <b>151</b> may be coupled to and supported by the first front portion <b>1011</b> of the first frame <b>101</b>, as described above. Accordingly, the display unit <b>151</b> does not need to be additionally supported by the second front portion <b>1021</b> of the second frame <b>102</b>. Rather, when the second front portion <b>1021</b> is interposed between the first front portion <b>1011</b> and the display unit <b>151</b>, the display unit <b>151</b> may be deformed or damaged because of friction with the second front portion <b>1021</b>, which is repeatedly moved. Thus, the second front portion <b>1021</b> may be disposed below the first front portion <b>1011</b>, or may be interposed between two first front portions <b>1011</b>. The second rear portion <b>1022</b> of the second frame <b>102</b> may be disposed rearward of the first rear portion <b>1012</b> of the first frame <b>101</b>.
