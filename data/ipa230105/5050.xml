Reference to various embodiments does not limit the scope of the claims attached hereto. Additionally, any examples set forth in this specification are not intended to be limiting and merely set forth some of the many possible embodiments for the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In general, the subject matter of the present disclosure relates to providing a personalized online experience for users. One way to personalize the user's experience with an enterprise application includes gathering contextual information related to the user over multiple sessions and using the contextual information to provide auto-complete suggestions, search results, filter options, product listings, etc. that are personalized to the user's needs. Providing search result, product, and filter options that are personalized to the user's needs increases user engagement.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some examples, the enterprise may include a retailer that is selling products or services online through a webpage or application. The enterprise application can include an online retailer's website or application with a user interface through which a user may be able to conduct economic transactions. However, the disclosed system and methods may be implemented for other types of enterprises and enterprise applications as well.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The disclosed context-based personalization system captures user affinity signals during user sessions. In some examples, a user session may include a period of time the user is interacting with the enterprise application. The user affinity signals are inferences made about the user and the user's preferences based on an analysis of the collected user events, including an analysis of the selections made by the user on the enterprise application in the same or previous sessions. The user affinity signals may include any selections that the user makes on the enterprise application that indicate the user's preference. In one example, user affinity signals include clothing sizes, shoes sizes, age, dietary preferences, type of product or service, brand preferences, price sensitivity, gifting preferences, fulfillment affinity, preferences for trends, store trip history, etc.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example. user affinity signals are captured when the user is performing one or more events on the enterprise application. For example, events may include clicks, searches, adds to cart, purchases, browsing history, etc. An event handler may be used to capture and store all user events. In some examples, the captured user events may be analyzed and user affinity signals may be extracted from the user events.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some examples, the captured user affinity signals may be used to discern the user context and elevate facets based on which facets the user engages with the most. For example, the captured user affinity signals are stored in association with the user's identifier and analyzed to predict user's interests and preferences. Based on the predictions, the auto-complete suggestions, search results, product listings, etc. may be tailored to the user's needs.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one example, based on past orders and browsing patterns, the disclosed context-based personalization system may discern that the user wears (or at least has a browsing preference for) a size 7 shoe. The next time the user searches for &#x201c;running shoes&#x201d; on a search box within the enterprise application, the search result &#x201c;running shoes size 7&#x201d; may be elevated as the top result. In another example, based on previously captured user affinity signals, the products listing page following a search for &#x201c;shoes&#x201d; may include women's running shoes as the top results based on the captured affinity signals indicating that the user is a woman and typically only shops for running shoes. This may be the case despite the user not previously searching for running shoes of a particular size, but is instead based on previous browsing of dress shoes or other footwear having a size 7.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition to elevating product listing based on the captured user affinity signals, the disclosed context-based personalization system may also provide personalized filter options in addition to the generic filter options, wherein the personalized filter options include options based on the user's preferences from various categories. For example, typically, when the user searches for &#x201c;shoes,&#x201d; a search result page with a listing of products associated with the search term is displayed along with a panel of filter options for the user to select from to filter the search results. Typical filter options include size, color, gender, brand, price range, product type, etc. With the disclosed personalization application, an additional filter option may be provided that lists the user's usual preferences across various categories. For example, in addition to the usually available filter options, an additional filter option may be presented that lists: Size: 7, Color: Blue, Brand: Nike, Price: $100-$150. Having the user's preferred options across different categories listed together, and optionally grouped into a single convenient selectable filter, makes it easier for the user to make selection quickly and to be presented with relevant product listings quickly.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some examples, the disclosed context-based personalization system is configured to receive and store guest events. The stored events may be analyzed, and user affinity signals may be extracted from the user events. In some examples, a data model may be used to predict the user's preferences across various categories based on the user affinity signals and stored data events. The predictions may be used to filter, re-order and personalize various user options on the enterprise application.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example context-based personalization system <b>100</b> that supports the context-based personalization of an application. The context-based personalization system <b>100</b> includes a user electronic computing device <b>102</b>, a network <b>104</b>, server computers <b>106</b>, <b>110</b> and one or more datastores <b>114</b>. In some examples, the server computer <b>106</b> may include a context-based personalization module <b>108</b> and the server computer <b>110</b> may include an enterprise application <b>112</b>. In other examples, the context-based personalization module <b>108</b> and the enterprise application <b>112</b> may both be hosted by the same server computer of the enterprise. More, fewer or different modules can be used.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some examples, user electronic computing device <b>102</b> is an electronic computing device of the user. In some examples, the electronic computing device can be a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a mobile electronic computing device such as a smartphone or a tablet computer. The electronic computing device permits the user to access the server computer <b>106</b> over a network <b>104</b>. In some examples, the users of the electronic computing device may include users and customers of an enterprise that is configured to provide e-commerce services. Although a single user electronic computing device <b>102</b> is shown, the example context-based personalization system <b>100</b> may allow hundreds, thousands, or more computing devices to connect to the server computer <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some examples, the user electronic computing device <b>102</b> may display an enterprise application user interface <b>103</b> using a display screen associated with the user electronic computing device <b>102</b>. The enterprise application <b>112</b> (described below in detail) may be hosted by a server computer <b>110</b> and the user interface generated during the execution of the enterprise application <b>112</b> may be displayed on the user electronic computing device. For example, the enterprise application user interface <b>103</b> may interface with a user of the user electronic computing device <b>102</b> and receive inputs from the user and display information for the user.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some examples, the network <b>104</b> is a computer network, such as the Internet. The user on user electronic computing device <b>102</b> can access the server computer <b>106</b> via the network <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a preferred example, the server computers <b>106</b> and <b>110</b> are server computers of an enterprise or organization that is an online retailer of goods. However, the server computers <b>106</b>, <b>110</b> may include server computers of other types of enterprises as well. Although a single server is shown, in reality, the server computers <b>106</b>, <b>110</b> can be implemented with multiple computing devices, such as a server farm or through cloud computing. Many other configurations are possible.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one example, the context-based personalization module <b>108</b> collects and stores user events. As discussed in more detail later herein, the context-based personalization module <b>108</b> may analyze the collected user events to extract user affinity signals and based on the extracted user affinity signal and stored user events, use a machine learning data model to predict the user's preferences. The context-based personalization module <b>108</b> is configured to elevate search results, product listings or customize the filter options based on the data model's predictions regarding the user's preferences. The context-based personalization module <b>108</b> is described in further detail in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one example, the enterprise application <b>112</b> may include a website or mobile application associated with the enterprise that showcases the enterprises' products and services. The enterprise application <b>112</b> may be executed on the server computer <b>110</b>. The execution of the enterprise application <b>112</b> may result in the generation and display of the enterprise application user interface <b>103</b> as described above. In a preferred example, the enterprise may be an online retailer of products and services and the enterprise application <b>112</b> may be a website or mobile application detailing the products and services for sale.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Although the context-based personalization module <b>108</b> and the enterprise application <b>112</b> are shown to be hosted by two separate server computers <b>106</b>, <b>110</b> in the disclosed example from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the context-based personalization module <b>108</b> and the enterprise application <b>112</b> may be hosted by the same server computer of the enterprise or third-party associated with the enterprise.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The example datastore(s) <b>114</b> may include one or more electronic databases that can store one or more data tables that includes data associated with the enterprise. The context-based personalization module <b>108</b> may store and retrieve data in the datastore(s) <b>114</b> via the network <b>104</b>. The datastore <b>114</b> may be maintained by the enterprise or organization itself or be maintained by one or more external, third-parties associated with the enterprise. The datastore <b>114</b> can be accessed by the server computer <b>106</b> to retrieve relevant data.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example configuration of the context-based personalization module <b>108</b>. As detailed in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the server computer <b>106</b> includes the context-based personalization module <b>108</b>, which in turn may be implemented using one or more sub-modules.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some examples, the disclosed context-based personalization module <b>108</b> may be configured to analyze user events, predict user preferences and ultimately customize the enterprise application <b>112</b> for each user. In some examples, the context-based personalization module <b>108</b> may include an event handler sub-module <b>202</b>, a context analyzer sub-module <b>204</b>, a preferences predictor sub-module <b>206</b> and a personalization sub-module <b>208</b>. More or fewer sub-modules may be used to implement the context-based personalization module <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some examples, the event handler sub-module <b>202</b> is configured to receive one or more user events. For example, a user may interface with an enterprise's webpage or application <b>112</b> in many ways. Each action the user performs in interfacing with the enterprise's webpage or application <b>112</b> may be considered a user event. For example, events may include clicks, swipes, toggles, typed texts, search query terms, selection of user options, adds to cart, products or services purchased, browsing pattern, etc. The example event handler sub-module <b>202</b> may receive the user events and process the events. The event handler sub-module <b>202</b> may further record the user events for further analysis.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples, user events are stored in a datastore, such as datastore <b>114</b>. The event handler sub-module <b>202</b> may associate the received events to the particular user's profile or identifier. The stored events may then be analyzed by the context analyzer sub-module <b>204</b> as described below. In some examples, a commercially available event handler application, such as Apache Kafka can be used to receive and process the user events.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some examples, the context analyzer sub-module <b>204</b> is configured to receive user events from datastore <b>114</b> and analyze the data events to extract user affinity signals. For example, the user affinity signals may be extracted based on user events that may be collected over one session or several user sessions.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A user session may include a discrete period of time the user is interacting with the enterprise application <b>112</b>. When a user interfaces with the enterprise's webpage or application <b>112</b> over multiple sessions, user events from each of the sessions are collected and stored in datastore <b>114</b> and associated with the user's profile or identifier. The example context analyzer sub-module <b>204</b> may the retrieve all or a subset of the stored user events for analysis and extraction of user affinity signals.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The user affinity signals may include any selections that the user makes on the enterprise application <b>112</b> that indicates information about the user as a person and/or the user's preference. In one example, user affinity signals include clothing sizes, shoe sizes, age, gender, dietary preferences, type of product, brand preferences, price sensitivity, gifting preferences, fulfillment affinity, preferences for trends, store trip history, delivery preferences, etc.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, a user event where the user has selected a size of 7 when purchasing a shoe may trigger the context analyzer sub-module <b>204</b> to extract and tag the user' size selection as a user affinity signal. The example context analyzer sub-module <b>204</b> may further organize the user affinity signals into a plurality of sub-categories, wherein each sub-category relates to a type of user affinity signal, such as size, price, etc.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some examples, the preference predictor sub-module <b>206</b> may be configured to use a machine learning data model to use the extracted user affinity signals and the stored user events to identify and predict user preferences regarding one or more user options associated with the enterprise's webpage or application <b>112</b>. For example, user options may include search terms, filter options, product listings, user selectable options associated with a product or purchase such as size, color, gender, delivery options, pickup options, etc. In some implementations, the preference predictor sub-module <b>206</b> may be configured to use a logistic regression data model in making the predictions. Other types of data models may also be used.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some examples, the personalization sub-module <b>208</b> is configured to customize user options associated with the enterprise's webpage or application <b>112</b> based on the predictions made by the data model in the preference predictor sub-module <b>206</b>. In one example, during search queries, the personalization sub-module <b>208</b> may elevate autocomplete search term options based on the user's predicted preferences. In another example, the personalization sub-module <b>208</b> may reorganize product listings based on the user's predicted preferences. In yet another example, the order of facets listed on product filters may be re-ordered based on the user's predicted preferences. In yet another example, new custom filter options that draws from multiple filter facets may be added to the product filter option. In yet another example, the user selectable options such as size, payment, delivery/pickup options may be auto-filled based on the user's predicted preferences.
