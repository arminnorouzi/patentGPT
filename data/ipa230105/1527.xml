Accordingly, there is a problem that the structure of the loading device is increased in size, and a long movement cycle time for a workpiece is also required.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, JP-A-10-193237 discloses a machine tool provided with an on-machine loading device for reversing and delivering a workpiece to a first NC lathe, that performs processing on the front surface of the workpiece, and to a second NC lathe that performs processing on the rear surface of the workpiece. The on-machine loading device includes a rail portion disposed to extend across the upper portions of two NC lathes, and a hand unit that travels along the rail portion. The hand unit includes a loading hand and an unloading hand, and a workpiece is reversed and delivered between the loading hand and the unloading hand. Accordingly, the loading hand and the unloading hand are moved to approach or separate each other.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in this loading device, because of the reversing and delivering of a workpiece to be performed, it is necessary to move the loading hand and the unloading hand to approach or separate each other. Accordingly, the loading device per se is increased in size. Further, the machine tool that includes this loading device is configured such that the hand unit travels along the rail portion disposed to extend across the upper portions of the two NC lathes so that the structure is increased in size. Further, to deliver a workpiece between the first NC lathe and the second NC lathe, the workpiece is reversed and transferred between the loading hand and the unloading hand, thus causing a problem that the workpiece delivery cycle is long.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view illustrating an example of a machine tool that includes a loading device according to the present disclosure therein;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrate an example of the structure of a loader, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a view illustrating a pivot state of a pivoting portion, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a view illustrating a state where an arm portion extends in the pivot state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> are views illustrating an example where a first hand and a second hand provided to a hand portion are pivoted so as to switch to a usable state;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a view illustrating a state where the loader is positioned at a stocker portion for a workpiece;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a view illustrating a state where the loader is loading the workpiece;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a view illustrating a state where the loader takes a finished product P<sub>2 </sub>from a second main spindle;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a view illustrating a state where the loader moves toward a first main spindle;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a view illustrating a state where the second main spindle takes a semi-processed product P<sub>1 </sub>from the first main spindle;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a view illustrating a state where the loader delivers a workpiece W, that is a material, to the first main spindle;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a view illustrating a state where the loader moves a finished product to the stocker portion; and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a view illustrating a state where the loader unloads the finished product to the stocker portion.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the provided subject matter.
