The first signal is amplified by the output oscillation loop to form an emitting signal, the output oscillation loop transmits the emitting signal to the emitting antenna for emitting. Because when the input amplification circuit receives other frequencies of the radio-frequency signals, the input amplification circuit can also respond to the first control signal and form the input oscillation loop matched with other frequencies of the radio-frequency signals using several other electronic devices in the plurality of electronic devices, and the reconfigurable high-integration radio-frequency amplifier can form the oscillation loop corresponding to this frequency of the radio-frequency signal according to the frequency of the radio-frequency signal by the control circuit, and then amplify the radio-frequency signal. Therefore, the amplification of radio-frequency signal can be realized only by integrating one amplification circuit including a plurality of oscillation loops in a radio frequency front end chip, thereby reducing the area of the radio frequency front end chip and improving the packaging utilization rate of the radio frequency front end chip.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a radio-frequency front end chip in some implementations;</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a structural diagram <b>1</b> of a reconfigurable high-integration radio-frequency amplifier provided by an embodiment of this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a structural diagram <b>2</b> of a reconfigurable high-integration radio-frequency amplifier provided by an embodiment of this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a structural diagram <b>3</b> of a reconfigurable high-integration radio-frequency amplifier provided by an embodiment of this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a structural diagram <b>4</b> of a reconfigurable high-integration radio-frequency amplifier provided by an embodiment of this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a structural diagram <b>5</b> of a reconfigurable high-integration radio-frequency amplifier provided by an embodiment of this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a structural diagram <b>6</b> of a reconfigurable high-integration radio-frequency amplifier provided by an embodiment of this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a structural diagram <b>7</b> of a reconfigurable high-integration radio-frequency amplifier provided by an embodiment of this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a structural diagram <b>8</b> of a reconfigurable high-integration radio-frequency amplifier provided by an embodiment of this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a structural diagram <b>9</b> of a reconfigurable high-integration radio-frequency amplifier provided by an embodiment of this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a structural diagram <b>10</b> of a reconfigurable high-integration radio-frequency amplifier provided by an embodiment of this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a chip provided by an embodiment of this disclosure;</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a structural diagram <b>11</b> of a reconfigurable high-integration radio-frequency amplifier provided by an embodiment of this disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a structural diagram of a stage-1 matching circuit provided by an embodiment of this disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In order to make the purpose, technical scheme and advantages of this disclosure clearer, the technical scheme of this disclosure is described in detail in some embodiments below in combination with the drawings and embodiments.
