After the liquid substrate is stored in the liquid storage space, the liquid substrate liquid seals the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">When an outer air pressure changes or the balance between an air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> and the outer air pressure is lost due to inhalation, for example, when the air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> is excessively large, the liquid substrate may leak between the mounting base <b>20</b> and an inner wall of the vaporization sleeve <b>10</b>, or the liquid substrate may leak from the vaporization core <b>30</b>, or the liquid substrate may leak from a joint between the vaporization core <b>30</b> and the mounting base <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Alternatively, when the air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> is excessively low, due to the influence of air pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b>, liquid flowing of the liquid substrate may be not smooth, and the vaporization core <b>30</b> may generate a burnt flavor during operation due to insufficient liquid supplying, leading to poor inhalation experience to the user.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Therefore, when the air pressure inside and outside the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> is imbalanced, the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> adaptively adjust an amount of the liquid substrate stored therein or supply air to the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> according to the air pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b>, to further adjust the air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b>, so that the air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> maintains dynamic balance with a normal air pressure.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">It should be noted that, a size of the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> is relatively small. When the liquid substrate is located in the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b>, a surface of the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> has surface tension on the liquid substrate, and the liquid substrate liquid seals the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> from the inside of the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b>, so that a part that is not filled by the liquid substrate in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> form a confined space. An air pressure in the confined space and the surface tension of the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> on the liquid substrate enable the liquid substrate not to directly leak from the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> to some extent, so that the liquid substrate is not lost, and a possibility that the liquid substrate leaks out of the vaporizer is also reduced.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Further, the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> is circuitously provided at a periphery of the liquid inlet cavity <b>21</b>, and a channel length of the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> may be set to a relatively great value to store the liquid substrate as much as possible, thereby facilitating to reduce a risk that liquid substrate leaks from the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b>, and facilitating the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> to adaptively adjust the air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Therefore, when the air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> and the normal air pressure are imbalanced, and the air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> is greater than a balanced air pressure, the liquid substrate in the liquid storage cavity enters the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> due to the air pressure difference, so that the air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> is reduced until a state of air pressure balance between the inside and the outside is restored. When the air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> is imbalanced, and the air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> is less than the balanced air pressure, the liquid substrate stored in the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> enters the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> again due to the air pressure difference, and further, airflow enters the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> from the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b>, to increase the air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> until the state of air pressure balance between the inside and the outside is restored. Therefore, the amount of the liquid substrate stored in the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> may adaptively adjust due to the air pressure difference between the inside and the outside, and external airflow may further enter the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> through the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b>, so that the air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> and the normal air pressure maintain dynamic balance, thereby effectively reducing risks of liquid leakage and non-smooth liquid flowing of the vaporizer <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The balanced air pressure is an air pressure value when the air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> and the normal air pressure are balanced.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this embodiment of this application, the vaporization sleeve <b>10</b> is configured to have the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b>, and the mounting base <b>20</b> is disposed in the vaporization sleeve <b>10</b> to block the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b>, and the liquid inlet cavity <b>21</b> provided on the mounting base <b>20</b> guides the liquid substrate in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> to the vaporization core <b>30</b>, so that the vaporization sleeve <b>10</b>, the mounting base <b>20</b>, and the vaporization core <b>30</b> form a liquid storage space. The first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> provided on the mounting base <b>20</b> is in communication with air, after the liquid substrate liquid seals the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b>, the amount of the liquid substrate stored in the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> adaptively adjusts according to the air pressure difference between the air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> and the normal air pressure. In addition, the external airflow may further enter the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> through the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> due to the air pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b>, so that the air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> and the normal air pressure maintain dynamic balance, and occurrence of liquid leakage or non-smooth liquid flowing caused by the excessively large air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> may be avoided, thereby effectively improving the performance of the vaporizer and improving the quality of the vaporizer.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some implementations, the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> may be a channel inside the mounting base <b>20</b>, an inlet of the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> is located on one end of the mounting base <b>20</b> facing the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b>, and an outlet of the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> is located on one end of the mounting base <b>20</b> away from the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> is provided on a surface of the side wall of the mounting base <b>20</b>, and the first pressure regulating channel <b>22</b> includes a liquid inlet groove <b>220</b>, a liquid storage groove <b>221</b>, and a vent groove <b>223</b> that are in communication with each other sequentially.
