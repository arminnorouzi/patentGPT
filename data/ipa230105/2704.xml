In advantageous embodiments, the invention is a substrate in the form of a nonwoven fabric material loaded with a hypochlorous acid (HOCl) solution for sanitizing and disinfecting a hard surface.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Many facilities, including hospitals, nursing homes, prisons and schools, are highly susceptible to multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs), commonly referred to as infectious bacteria and viruses. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) estimates that infections acquired from healthcare and food service facilities kill more individuals each year than vehicle accidents, breast cancer or AIDS. Consequently, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prescribe effective cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting products and procedures to be used in facilities that provide healthcare services and/or food services. In response, hospitals, nursing homes, prisons and schools have instituted detailed cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting protocols along with intensive training programs for environmental services personnel to ensure that areas accessed by patients, staff and the public are clean, hygienic and free of infectious bacteria and viruses.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The aforementioned facilities, especially healthcare facilities, have historically utilized a variety of high, medium and low level cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting solutions, including formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, chlorine-releasing agents (CRAs), such as sodium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, etc., iodophores, phenols and bis-phelols solutions. More recently, solutions of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) have been introduced as an efficacious and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional sanitizers and disinfectants. HOCl is a weak acid formed when chlorine dissolves in water and partially dissociates. As a result, HOCl acts as an oxidizer and a primary sanitizing and disinfecting agent in a chlorine solution. The beneficial characteristics attributed to HOCl include that it is a highly effective mechanism for destroying infectious bacteria and viruses, most notably <i>C. diff, E. coli</i>, MRSA (Staph), <i>Salmonella, Tuberculosis</i>, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Despite being highly effective, HOCl is relatively harmless to humans at concentrations suitable for sanitizing and disinfecting. Thus, HOCl solutions are approved for use as sanitizing and disinfecting agents in hospitals, nursing homes, prisons and schools (collectively referred to herein as &#x201c;institutional facilities&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Other sanitizing and disinfecting agents commonly used in institutional facilities are not as environmentally friendly and efficacious as HOCl in destroying harmful bacteria and viruses. As a result, it is not uncommon for individuals to contract serious illnesses from the bacteria and viruses at institutional facilities that are treated with other sanitizers and disinfectants. The inability of other sanitizers and disinfectants to destroy infectious organisms increases healthcare costs and causes physical harm to individuals that would have been prevented with the use of a more effective HOCl sanitizing and disinfecting solution. The recent COVID 19 pandemic has increased awareness for cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting hard surfaces in commercial businesses, public areas and private spaces in addition to the institutional facilities that are already utilizing highly effective HOCl solutions to combat harmful bacteria and viruses.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Despite being highly effective, HOCl has a limited lifespan of effectiveness, commercially referred to as &#x201c;shelf life.&#x201d; Over time HOCl decomposes to chloric acid, hydrochloric acid, and oxygen; none of which separately exhibits the same desirable sanitizing and disinfecting properties as a full strength HOCl solution. The shelf life for a HOCl solution as a sanitizing and disinfecting agent is limited from the time it is produced based on its free available chlorine (FAC) concentration measured in parts per million (ppm). As used herein, the term &#x201c;free available chlorine&#x201d; or &#x201c;FAC&#x201d; is intended to mean the portion of total chlorine in the solution that is present as HOCl or hypochlorite ion (OCl&#x2014;). Consequently, it is imperative to take steps to ensure that an effective HOCl solution is being used in a recommended cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting protocol at institutional facilities, commercial businesses, public areas and private spaces. Specifically, it is essential that the HOCl solution is used within its shelf life acceptable for effective cleaning, sanitizing or disinfecting.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Unfortunately, due to its limited shelf-life, HOCl is not presently commercially available in a convenient and stable form for effective sanitizing and disinfecting. HOCl solution is typically generated in bulk by electrolysis using a relatively expensive and time consuming Electrochemically Activated Water (EAW) process. A portion of the HOCl solution is then transferred into a smaller container for sanitizing and disinfecting, such as a spray cart, spray bottle or liquid dispenser. The production date of the HOCl solution is noted on the smaller container to confirm that the HOCl solution is within its effective shelf life. The HOCl solution should be applied directly onto a hard surface and allowed to dry for a predetermined dwell time for effective sanitizing and disinfecting. Oftentimes, the HOCl solution is sprayed or poured onto the hard surface and then wiped with a cloth or towel to apply the solution evenly over the hard surface. It would be more convenient and less labor intensive if the cloth or towel were pre-moistened with the HOCl solution&#x2014;similar to a conventional alcohol wipe. However, until now there has been no substrate material known to be suitable for providing a HOCl solution in a more convenient form, and particularly, in the form of a pre-moistened cloth, towel or wipe loaded with a stable HOCl solution.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is likely that no suitable substrate material has been found to date because the HOCl solution does not adequately wet most synthetic substrates, such as a plastic material made from polymers such as polyester (PET), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinylchloride (PVC), nylon, etc. Consequently, the cloth, towel, wipe or the like is not an acceptable carrier and applicator for the HOCl solution. In addition, the HOCl solution tends to attack and denigrate most organic substrates and/or any pulp, filler, binder, adhesive or similar agent applied to the synthetic or organic substrate material. Furthermore, a cloth, towel, wipe or the like (collectively referred to herein as an &#x201c;applicator&#x201d;) loaded with an effective HOCl solution needs to be stored within and subsequently dispensed from a container that retains the shelf life of the HOCl solution until the applicator is removed from the container and used for sanitizing and/or disinfecting a hard surface. Previous attempts to provide a suitable substrate material loaded with an effective HOCl solution for sanitizing and disinfecting a hard surface in the form of an applicator have proven unsuccessful, primarily due to the inherent chemistry of HOCl solutions that are not stable over an acceptable shelf-life. A system and method for producing a stable HOCl solution for effective sanitizing and disinfecting using, for example, a conical cell technology is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17/344,951, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the foregoing, it is apparent a need exists for improved sanitizing and disinfecting substrates loaded with an effective sanitizing and disinfecting solution. A specific need exists for sanitizing and disinfecting substrates that are loaded with a stable HOCl solution for sanitizing and/or disinfecting a hard surface. Such a substrate would provide a more convenient form of an applicator for effectively sanitizing and disinfecting hard surfaces in institutional facilities, commercial businesses, public areas and private spaces with a stable HOCl solution having an acceptable shelf-life.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Certain aspects, objects, features and advantages of the invention will be made apparent, or will be readily understood and appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art, with reference to the exemplary embodiments of the invention described herein and shown in the accompanying drawing figures.

The exemplary embodiments described and shown herein are directed to improved sanitizing and disinfecting substrates loaded with an effective sanitizing and disinfecting solution. Advantageous exemplary embodiments described and shown herein are sanitizing and disinfecting substrates loaded with a stable HOCl solution that are stored within and dispensed from a container that maintains an acceptable shelf-life of the HOCl solution. Various aspects, objects, features and advantages of the invention are illustrated by exemplary embodiments of suitable substrates loaded with an effective HOCl solution and disposed within suitable containers for storing and dispensing the substrates. In a particularly advantageous embodiment, a substrate according to the invention comprises a multi-layer, nonwoven fabric material loaded with a stable HOCl solution for effectively sanitizing and/or disinfecting a hard surface, as will be described in greater detail hereafter.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic cross-section of an exemplary embodiment of a substrate <b>10</b> according to the invention. The substrate <b>10</b> is useful, by way of example and not limitation, for effectively sanitizing and/or disinfecting hard surfaces in institutional facilities, commercial businesses, public areas and private spaces with a stable HOCl solution having an acceptable shelf-life. In one aspect, a suitable substrate <b>10</b> comprises a nonwoven fabric material. Substrate <b>10</b> may be a synthetic nonwoven material comprising one or more layers of plastic fibers, such as high molecular weight polymers like polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polyester (PET), polyethylene terephthalate (PETE), polyurethane (PUR) and polyamides. Conversely, in another embodiment substrate <b>10</b> may be an organic nonwoven material made from cellulosic fibers, such as wood pulp, cotton and linen. As will be readily appreciated by those having ordinary skill in the art, synthetic fabrics are generally more hydrophobic than hydrophilic, as compared with organic fabrics. While being less hydrophilic, synthetic fabrics made of plastic fibers are more resistant to degradation from caustic chemicals, such as chlorine, and in the present case, from the FAC in an HOCl sanitizing and disinfecting solution.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> by way of example and not limitation, the substrate <b>10</b> may be a tri-ply laminate synthetic nonwoven fabric comprising a first outer layer <b>12</b> of a Spunbond polymer and a second outer layer <b>14</b> of a Spunbond polymer, with an inner layer <b>16</b> of a Meltblown polymer disposed between the first and second outer layers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. As such, the synthetic nonwoven fabric substrate <b>10</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is typically referred to as Spunbond Meltblown Spunbond (SMS) fabric. In one embodiment, substrate <b>10</b> may comprise a first outer (top) layer <b>12</b> of Spunbond polypropylene and/or polyester, a second outer (bottom) layer <b>14</b> of Spunbond polypropylene and/or polyester, with an inner (middle) layer <b>16</b> of Meltblown polypropylene and/or polyester between the first and second outer layers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. If desired, the outer surfaces of the first and second outer layers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> may have a soft calendar pattern.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another embodiment, the substrate <b>10</b> may be a synthetic nonwoven fabric formed from a hydroentanglement bonding process by carding, air-laying or wet-laying synthetic fibers. A suitable substrate <b>10</b> is a synthetic nonwoven fabric commercially available from Berry Global, Inc. of Evansville, Ind., USA, under the tradename Spinlace&#xae;. The Spinlace&#xae; nonwoven fabric is formed from Spunbond or SMS synthetic fibers, such as polypropylene (PP) and/or polyester (PET), imaged via a proprietary Apex&#xae; technology that is specially designed and formulated for premium applications in the healthcare, hygiene, household cleaning, food service, and industrial wipes markets. By way of example and not limitation, the nonwoven fabric may be a tri-ply laminate comprising first and second outer layers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> of hydroentangled Spunbond polypropylene (PP) and an inner layer <b>16</b> of pulp, such as RISI fluff pulp. In another example, the first and second outer layers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> may be Spunbond polypropylene (PP) and the inner layer <b>16</b> may be polyester (PET). In yet another example, the first and second outer layers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> may be Spunbond polyester (PET) and the inner layer <b>16</b> may be pulp, such as RISI fluff pulp.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another embodiment, the substrate <b>10</b> may be a synthetic nonwoven material formed from one or more layers of polyester (PET) fibers. In general, it is believed that a substrate <b>10</b> comprising such a synthetic nonwoven material is particularly well suited for use with HOCl solutions due to the relatively inert nature of the polyester (PET) fibers. In certain embodiments, the synthetic nonwoven material may comprise polyester (PET), wettable PET, or both, with or without a binder system. In one embodiment, the synthetic nonwoven material comprises 50% PET and 50% wettable PET and is commercially known as Spunlace available from Berry Global, Inc. The basis weight may range from about 25 grams per square meter (gsm) to about 80 grams per square meter (gsm) with absorbency capacity of at least 500% and with a hand feel more comparable to a viscose semi-synthetic material than a PET material when wet or otherwise activated. In preferred embodiments, the basis weight of the synthetic nonwoven material is between about 25 gsm and about 50 gsm. In a more preferred embodiment, the basis weight of the synthetic nonwoven material is about 46 gsm. An outer surface of the synthetic nonwoven material may have a soft calendar pattern.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In yet another embodiment, the substrate <b>10</b> may be a nonwoven material comprising one or more layers of synthetic fibers and/or organic fibers. As previously mentioned, nonwoven materials made of organic fibers are more hydrophilic than nonwoven materials made of synthetic fibers but are more susceptible to environmental and chemical degradation. Consequently, a substrate <b>10</b> formed of a nonwoven material made from synthetic fibers and/or organic fibers, such as cellulosic fibers, may further comprise an optional coating of an additive, such as a surfactant, and/or may be infused with the additive to isolate the organic fibers of the substrate <b>10</b> from the caustic FAC present in HOCl solutions. If the substrate <b>10</b> is formed as a laminate comprising a plurality of layers of synthetic and/or organic nonwoven material, a suitable water-resistant binding agent or adhesive may be utilized to bond together the individual layers of the substrate <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the individual layers of the substrate <b>10</b> may be bonded together chemically or thermally, for example by ultrasonic welding, or alternatively by hydroentanglement. In any event, the substrate <b>10</b> must be constructed in a manner that sufficiently retains (i.e. holds, carries, or the like) the HOCl solution on the substrate <b>10</b>, while not permitting the FAC present in the HOCl solution to degrade the structural integrity of the substrate <b>10</b>. By way of example and not limitation, the outer surfaces of the substrate <b>10</b> may have a soft calendar pattern or the like believed to provide surface tension for a liquid solution, such as a sanitizing and/or disinfecting solution as described herein.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Regardless, the substrate <b>10</b> is loaded with a sanitizing and/or disinfecting solution, indicated generally at <b>18</b>, and more particularly, a stable HOCl solution. As used herein, the term &#x201c;loaded&#x201d; is intended to refer to any suitable means or method for applying the sanitizing and/or disinfecting solution onto the substrate <b>10</b>. By way of example and not limitation, the sanitizing and/or disinfecting solution <b>18</b> may be applied onto the substrate <b>10</b> by spraying, coating, dipping, soaking, moistening, pre-moistening or the like. The sanitizing and/or disinfecting solution <b>18</b> may be applied onto the substrate <b>10</b> during manufacture, or alternatively, may be applied by a user following manufacture and prior to use. As used herein, the term &#x201c;loaded&#x201d; is further intended to mean that the substrate <b>10</b> is pre-moistened with the HOCl solution <b>18</b> during manufacture, or alternatively, the substrate <b>10</b> is moistened with the HOCl solution <b>18</b> by the end user prior to use. In either case, the substrate <b>10</b> is typically moistened up to the saturation point of the nonwoven fabric material such that the substrate <b>10</b> retains the HOCL solution <b>18</b> on the exposed surfaces of the substrate <b>10</b> and thereby acts as an applicator for the HOCL solution <b>18</b>. By way of example and not limitation, the HOCl solution <b>18</b> may be produced by the Electrochemically Activated Water (EAW) system and method utilizing a generator comprising an electrolysis cell as disclosed in the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17/344,951. However, the HOCl solution <b>18</b> may be made by any suitable process that produces a stable sanitizing and disinfecting solution at a desired potential of hydrogen (pH) and concentration of FAC over an acceptable shelf-life.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art, HOCl solutions <b>18</b> used to sanitize and disinfect are driven by an inversely proportional relationship between FAC concentration and dwell time. In other words, as the FAC increases the required dwell time decreases, and vice versa. Therefore, effective and stable concentrations of FAC for sanitizing and disinfecting can reasonably range between about 25 parts per million (ppm) and about 750 parts per million (ppm). Furthermore, different concentrations of FAC can be formulated to produce effective HOCl solutions <b>18</b>, and thus, substrates loaded with an effective HOCl solution having a desired shelf-life. Consequently, it is desirable to be able to load the substrate <b>10</b> with HOCl solutions <b>18</b> having a FAC concentration from about 25 ppm to about 750 ppm to provide for various levels of sanitizing and disinfecting. For example, a FAC concentration of from about 250 ppm to about 600 ppm may be preferred for an effective sanitizing and disinfecting HOCl solution <b>18</b>, while a FAC concentration of from about 400 ppm to about 550 ppm may be more preferred. Likewise, a potential of hydrogen (pH) of from about 4.5 pH to about 7.5 pH may be suitable for an effective HOCl solution <b>18</b>, while from about 5.0 pH to about 7.0 may be preferred and 5.5 pH may be more preferred.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In another aspect, a container is provided for a sanitizing and disinfecting applicator according to the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of an embodiment of a first container <b>20</b> for storing and subsequently dispensing sanitizing and disinfecting substrates <b>10</b> loaded with an effective HOCl solution <b>18</b>.
