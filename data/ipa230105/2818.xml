More specifically, this disclosure includes embodiments in which patterned conductive nanojunctions are created in nanogaps using DNA as a scaffold or a template.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An electronic nanodevice has great potential for biosensing in the point of care at a low cost. While a 7 nm resolution has achieved by Interference lithography,<sup>1 </sup>the traditional top-down semiconductor fabrication process used in industry is approaching its limits. On the other hand, DNA is one of the most promising and suitable materials for integrating a biological operating system to the nanoelectronics with the angstrom precision. First, DNA can be programmed to form predictable nanometer-sized structures in both two and three dimensions by self-assembly, such as 2D DNA arrays, DNA-truncated octahedrons, DNA origamis, and 3D DNA.<sup>2 </sup>Plus, sophisticated nucleic acid chemistry allows us to tune and modify DNA as well as create new DNA based materials. Thus, DNA has become a choice for the &#x201c;bottom-up&#x201d; construction of nanomachines.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">DNA molecules could conduct electrons through overlapping 7c-orbitals of adjacent base pairs longitudinally. It has been observed that long native DNA wires are not conductive when deposited on a hard substrate,<sup>3,4 </sup>and short DNA molecules allow charge transport through them (&#x3c;15 base pairs).<sup>5 </sup>In general, an AT sequence is less conductive than its GC counterpart in DNA.<sup>6 </sup>The AT base pair is considered a tunneling barrier, and the GC base pair a hopping site for the charge transfer.

Thus, the nanogaps can be fabricated with high yields and low cost. To bridge the nanogap with a molecular wire, a bottom-up molecular lithograph is applied to complete the whole process of the nanodevice assembly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the nanogap comprises two electrodes, the distance between which is in a range of 3 nm to 1000 nm, preferably 5 nm to 100 nm, and most preferably 5 nm to 30 nm. The end surfaces of the electrodes are substantially rectangular with a width in the range of 3 nm to 1 um, preferably 5 nm to 30 nm, and a height in the range of 3 nm to 100 nm, preferably 5 nm to 30 nm. The said electrodes comprise noble metals, for example, platinum (Pt), gold (Au), silver (Ag), palladium (Pd), rhodium (Rd), ruthenium (Ru), osmium (Os), iridium (Ir), or other metals, such as copper (Cu), rhenium (Re), titanium (Ti), Niobium (Nb), Tantalum (Ta), and their derivatives, such as TiN, and TaN, etc.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the nanogap is formed by two electrodes which are in different planes separated by an insulation layer, see FIG. 6 (ref. U.S. 62/994,712). The thickness of the insulation layer is in the range of 2 nm to 1000 nm, preferably 5 nm to 30 nm. The insulation material is selected from, but not limited to, the group consisting of SiNx, SiOx, HfOx, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, other metal oxides, and any dielectrics used in the semiconductor industry.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, a nanojunction is formed by bridging the nanogap with a nanowire, and then a sensing molecule is attached at a predefined location. The said nanowire comprises a semiconductive DNA duplex segment flanked by two metalized or conductive polymer conjugated nanowire segments. A sensing molecule is attached to the DNA duplex in the middle. The attached sensing molecule and the semiconductive DNA duplex constitute a force effect transistor, referred as to &#x201c;FET&#x201d;. The sensing molecule changes its conformation when interacting with its receptors or substrates. This will exert a force on DNA and disturb its base stacking, resulting in fluctuation of electrical current flowing through the nanowire. The current signal, representing responses to the molecular events, is then recorded and the molecular interactions or reactions are deduced. For example, when the sensing molecule is a DNA polymerase, it can monitor the process of polymerase incorporating nucleotides into a DNA primer by recording the electric signals. When an antibody is used as the sensing molecule, an antigen can be detected utilizing this nanojunction device, or vice versa. Similarly, a receptor is used as a sensing molecule, and its ligands in a sample can be determined, or vice versa.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> delineates the process of fabricating a nanogap comprising two electrodes separated by sub-20 nm distance using the top-down semiconductor fabrication approach. A platinum wire (<b>101</b>) is fabricated on a silicon substrate (<b>103</b>) coated with a silicon nitride insulation layer (<b>102</b>) by EBL, and then a dielectric CAP layer (<b>104</b>) deposited, followed by a hard mask (HM) layer (<b>105</b>). A nanogap is fabricated by EBL patterning on a photoresist (<b>106</b>), followed by HM RIE, CAP, Pt RIE, and HM removal.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> delineates a bottom-up approach for the assembling of a nanojunction with the said nanogap. First, DNA anchors (<b>201</b>) are attached to the sidewalls of two electrodes (<b>207</b>) that define a nanogap (<b>206</b>). Then, a DNA wire (<b>202</b>) is hybridized to the DNA anchors to bridge the nanogap to form a nanojunction composed of double-stranded DNA having two nicks (<b>208</b>). The nicks are closed by a ligation reaction, resulting in a semiconductive DNA duplex segment (<b>209</b>). Then, a protein filament (<b>205</b>) is added to mask the middle section (<b>210</b>), followed by the deposition of metal particles on the flank segments to generate conductive wires (<b>211</b>) at the two ends of the semiconductive segment. After removing the protein filament, the semiconductive DNA duplex segment is exposed for attaching the sensing molecules, such as, an enzyme, a polymerase, or an antibody (<b>212</b>). This process provides a method to create a biomolecular sensing nanodevice.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, the said DNA anchor <b>201</b> is a set of short oligonucleotides <b>201</b>-<i>a </i>and <b>201</b>-<i>b </i>with their sequence matching to the DNA wire <b>202</b> at different ends. The probe (anchor) oligo <b>201</b>-<i>a </i>matches to both <b>202</b>-<i>a </i>and a part of <b>202</b>-<i>b</i>. In the same way, <b>201</b>-<i>b </i>matches to both <b>202</b>-<i>c </i>and a part of <b>202</b>-<i>d</i>. The sequences for the probe oligos <b>201</b>-<i>a </i>and <b>201</b>-<i>b </i>are either the same or different. When each of them is respectively attached to those individual electrodes constituting a nanogap, they capture the DNA wire <b>202</b> to form a duplex containing nicks. After a ligating reaction, a perfect duplex forms, the middle of which comprises a semiconductive segment (<b>209</b>) and the rest of which can be either conductive, semiconductive or non-conductive. Due to the complementary requirement for the hybridization (capture) of <b>202</b> to <b>201</b>, it requires the nanogap size to match the length of the assembled molecular wire <b>209</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another embodiment, the DNA anchor <b>201</b> is hybridized to the DNA wire <b>202</b> first, forming a DNA duplex with nicks to be filled by ligation, and then attaching to the two electrodes to form the nanojunction. In order to increase the success rate of junction formation, the ends of the electrodes can be tapered as a reverse trapezoidal geometry, see illustration in FIG. 5 (ref.
