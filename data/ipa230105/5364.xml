The embodiments transmit traffic sign messages targeted to the active traffic signs from radio broadcast stations using various radio broadcast technologies. The traffic sign message can be configured to target a particular active traffic sign or set of active traffic signs. A targeted traffic sign is configured to receive and then decode its own (targeted) traffic sign message. The radio broadcast technologies may include a Radio Broadcast Data System (RBDS) or Radio Data System (RDS) over analog FM radio broadcast, IBOC all-digital radio broadcast, and IBOC hybrid radio broadcast, described below. The embodiments advantageously leverage the publicly accessible, ubiquitous, and low-cost nature of FM radio broadcast coverage. Presently, there are approximately 10,811 FM radio stations across the US (6715 commercial and 4096 non-profit or educational stations) reaching approximately 97% of the population daily. Using the FM band offers a relatively inexpensive way of controlling active traffic signs as it leverages existing infrastructure mostly.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The RBDS (also known as RDS) augments analog FM radio broadcast with a data service, i.e., the RBDS data service, which supports transmission of limited bit rate data per second alongside an analog FM radio channel. A goal of the RBDS is to deliver limited information about the station, program, artist, and song in the limited bit rate data alongside an FM carrier frequency of the radio channel. The RBDS standard leaves room for expansion to user defined applications, as exploited herein. Specifically, embodiments presented herein extend the RBDS to deliver protected (i.e., secure or encrypted) traffic sign messages, configured to program targeted active traffic signs, to the targeted active traffic signs. To this end, the RBDS offers a low-cost global solution for controlling the active traffic signs in regional areas using real-time data transmissions.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an illustration of an example analog FM broadcast radio spectrum <b>100</b> for an FM radio channel augmented with a transmission spectrum for the RBDS, which may be encoded with one or more secure traffic sign messages. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, RBDS uses 55 kHz-59 kHz. RBDS uses Phase Shift Keying (PSK) modulation having a modulation data rate of 1187.5 bits per second (bps). RBDS employs error detection and correction within an RBDS message payload, which reduces the effective rate of transmission to 731 bps. The RBDS standard in the United States (US) defines various standard and custom data fields for an RBDS data message, including:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0023">a.

The custom data fields may include one or more secure traffic sign messages described below.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0024" num="0028">The RBDS Data Link Layer (DLL) sends the data in the form of groups which are 104 bits wide. Each group has 4 blocks each 26 bits wide, with 16 bits of data and 10 bits of error correction. The overall raw data rate is 1187.5 bps or 11.4 groups per second. Removal of overhead for error correction reduces the data rate to 731 bps or 91 bytes per second. The effective rate for custom application is 6.2 groups per second or 99.2 bps of actual data.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0029">As an alternative to the RBDS, digital radio broadcasting technology delivers digital audio and data services to radio receivers using existing radio bands. One type of digital radio broadcasting, referred to as in-band on-channel (IBOC) digital radio broadcasting, transmits a digital radio broadcast signal and an analog radio broadcast signal simultaneously on the same frequency using digitally modulated subcarriers or sidebands to multiplex digital information on an amplitude modulation (AM) or frequency modulation (FM) analog modulated carrier signal. HD Radio&#x2122; technology, developed by iBiquity Digital Corporation, is one example of an IBOC implementation for simulcast digital radio broadcasting and reception.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0030">With IBOC digital radio broadcasting, signals can be transmitted as: a hybrid radio broadcast signal (also referred to as a &#x201c;hybrid waveform&#x201d;) including an analog modulated carrier (also referred to as an &#x201c;analog signal&#x201d;) in combination with a plurality of digitally modulated carriers (also referred to as a &#x201c;digital signal&#x201d; and a &#x201c;digital waveform&#x201d;); or an all-digital radio broadcast signal (also referred to as an all-digital waveform) from which the analog signal is absent, and only the digital signal is present. Embodiments presented herein may encode the above-mentioned secure traffic sign messages onto the digitally modulated carriers of the IBOC all-digital radio broadcast signal or the IBOC hybrid radio broadcast signal using HD Radio technology, for example. An advantage of using IBOC radio broadcast signals is the relative high data rates that they support for messaging, e.g., approximately 192 kbps, although other data rates are available.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an illustration of an example power spectrum <b>200</b> for an example IBOC hybrid radio broadcast signal (also referred to as a &#x201c;hybrid signal&#x201d;) centered on an FM radio channel that may carry an analog FM broadcast radio signal (also referred to as an &#x201c;analog FM signal&#x201d;). A center portion of power spectrum <b>200</b> comprises the analog FM signal, while upper and lower portions or sidebands (SBs) of the spectrum comprise a digital signal.
