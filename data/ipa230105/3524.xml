In particular, the energy consumption for &#x201c;Internet of things&#x201d; applications or portable applications plays an important role in the end customer sector. A gyroscope that is in operation typically has high energy consumption. To reduce the energy consumption, the gyroscope is often switched off when it is not in use or when its measured data are not needed. However, this requires a long startup time in the case that the gyroscope is to once again deliver measured data, since its seismic mass must first be brought back into appropriate oscillation. To take this into account, conventional, the readout circuit is switched off when the gyroscope is not in use, but the driver circuit for the oscillation of the seismic mass is left activated.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A gyroscope system including a MEMS gyroscope that is connected to a driver system and a sensing system is descried in U.S. Pat. No. 9,506,757 B2. The driver system maintains the MEMS gyroscope in a state of oscillation, and maintains the sensing system in a state for receiving, amplifying, and demodulating an output signal of the MEMS gyroscope that indicates the rotation rate of the MEMS gyroscope. The gyroscope system additionally includes a phase-locked loop (PLL for short) that receives a reference clock signal (REFCLK) from the driver system and provides a system clock signal (CLK). The gyroscope system further includes a control device that is operated with the aid of the system clock signal, and that sets an operating state of the driver system and of the sensing system, and that likewise controls the operating state of the PLL. One or more system state parameters are maintained in an essentially unchangeable state during a so-called protection mode, which allows rapid transitions between a low-energy operating mode and a normal operating mode of the gyroscope system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one specific example embodiment, the present invention provides a phase-locked loop for a driver circuit for operating a MEMS gyroscope, including a seismic mass that is excitable into oscillations, comprising an input interface for receiving position signals that represent the present position of the oscillating seismic mass of the MEMS gyroscope, a phase detector for ascertaining the phase and frequency of the present oscillation movement of the seismic mass, based on the received position signals, at least two oscillators that are alternatively activatable, the alternatively activatable oscillators having different energy consumptions and/or different noise properties, and at least one output interface for outputting a signal that is provided by the oscillator that is presently activated.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a further specific example embodiment, the present invention provides a circuit arrangement for operating a MEMS gyroscope, including a seismic mass that is excitable into oscillations. The circuit arrangement includes a sensing unit that is connected to the MEMS gyroscope, and via which a useful signal of the MEMS gyroscope is providable. In addition, the circuit arrangement according to the present invention includes an amplitude control unit for outputting a control signal for exciting and maintaining a defined oscillation movement of the seismic mass of the MEMS gyroscope, based on position signals that represent the present position of the oscillating seismic mass of the MEMS gyroscope, and a phase-locked loop according to the present invention, at least one output interface of the phase-locked loop being connected to the amplitude control unit. Lastly, the circuit arrangement according to the present invention also includes an energy control unit that is connected to the sensing unit. One of multiple predefined operating modes of the MEMS gyroscope is specifiable with the aid of the energy control unit. In addition, the energy control unit is designed to activate one of the at least two oscillators and to deactivate the remaining oscillators as a function of the predefined operating mode.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a further specific example embodiment, the present invention provides a MEMS gyroscope sensor system, including a MEMS gyroscope and a circuit arrangement according to the present invention, the MEMS gyroscope being connected on the one hand to an input interface of the sensing unit, and on the other hand to an input interface of the phase-locked loop and to an input interface and an output interface of the amplitude control device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further specific example embodiment, the present invention provides a method for operating a MEMS gyroscope sensor system that includes a circuit arrangement according to the present invention, one of at least two predefined operating modes of the MEMS gyroscope sensor system being specified, and one of the at least two oscillators of the phase-locked loop being activated as a function of the predefined operating mode, while the remaining oscillators of the phase-locked loop are deactivated.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">One of the advantages thus achieved is that the power consumption for the MEMS gyroscope circuit arrangement may be significantly lowered, while the oscillation movement of the seismic mass of the gyroscope is maintained regardless of its operating mode, so that a long startup time during changing of the operating state of the gyroscope does not have be waited for until reliable measured data of the gyroscope are available. The oscillator of the phase-locked loop of the drive circuit typically has comparatively high energy consumption compared to the other components of the MEMS gyroscope circuit arrangement, since the oscillator is also intended to provide a signal with low phase noise for demodulation of the sensing channel. This stringent requirement does not exist when the seismic mass of the gyroscope is merely to be kept in motion, but no measuring signal is detected and the sensing unit is switched off. The requirements for the quality of the oscillator may then be significantly reduced, and an oscillator with higher noise but with particularly low energy consumption may be used. In other words, via specific embodiments of the present invention, a phase-locked loop is provided that may be alternatively operated using at least two oscillators of different quality. One of the two oscillators is designed, for example, for operation with low noise in order to achieve a defined drive frequency for the seismic mass and enable reliable demodulation of the measuring signal, whereas the other oscillator is designed for low energy consumption in order to maintain a drive of the seismic mass of the MEMS gyroscope with low energy consumption when its sensing unit is switched off, i.e., no measured values of the gyroscope are detected.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further features, advantages, and additional specific embodiments of the present invention are described below or are thus made apparent.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to one advantageous refinement of the present invention, the phase-locked loop according to the present invention is equipped with a loop filter for applying at least one transfer function. This loop filter includes at least two outputs, each output of the loop filter being connected to one of the at least two oscillators, and an independent transfer function being associated with each output of the loop filter. The flexibility is thus increased, since different transfer functions may be provided by the loop filter at the same time.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a further advantageous refinement of the present invention, at least one of the at least two oscillators of the phase-locked loop according to the present invention has a voltage-controlled or current-controlled design. Simple control of at least one oscillator is thus made possible by use of electrical voltage signals or current signals.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a further advantageous refinement of the present invention, an energy control unit is provided which is designed to activate one of the at least two oscillators and to deactivate the remaining oscillators. The energy control unit is also connected to a switch element for actuation thereof. By appropriate activation and actuation of the switch element, in this specific embodiment of the present invention the respectively activated oscillator is incorporated into the signal path of the phase-locked loop, and the phase-locked loop is thus closed. In this specific embodiment of the present invention, the energy control unit does not just determine the operating mode of the phase-locked loop by activating one of the oscillators and deactivating the other oscillators. By use of the switch element, the energy control unit also incorporates the respectively activated oscillator into the phase-locked loop via circuitry.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a further advantageous refinement of the present invention, the activatable switch element includes a multiplexer. Simple implementation of a selection circuit is made possible with the aid of a multiplexer.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a further advantageous refinement of the present invention, at least one frequency divider is situated between the outputs of the at least two oscillators and the at least one output interface. The advantage is that the frequency of the signal at the output of the respective oscillator may be reduced in a certain whole-number division ratio.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a further advantageous refinement of the present invention, a separate frequency divider is associated with each oscillator. The advantage is increased flexibility, since due to the different frequencies of the different oscillators, it is likewise possible to use different frequency dividers. When the at least two oscillators have the same center frequency, it is also possible to merely use one shared frequency divider, which is then situated downstream from the selection circuit using signal technology.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one advantageous refinement of the circuit arrangement according to the present invention for operating a MEMS gyroscope, the energy control unit is designed to specify, as an operating mode of the MEMS gyroscope, either an active sensing operating mode in which sensor signals are detected and preprocessed, or at least one standby mode in which no sensor signals are detected and/or preprocessed, the oscillator of the at least two oscillators that has lower noise and/or is more frequency-stable being used for the active sensing operating mode, while the more energy-saving oscillator of the at least two oscillators is used for the at least one standby mode. In other words, one of the at least two oscillators is designed or operated to be particularly low in noise and/or frequency-stable, and the other of the at least two oscillators is designed to be particularly energy-saving.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An advantage is that the power consumption for the MEMS gyroscope circuit arrangement may be lowered considerably without reducing the accuracy of measured data of the MEMS gyroscope.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a further advantageous refinement of the circuit arrangement according to the present invention, a switch element is provided that is activatable by the energy control unit in such a way that the output signal of the respectively activated oscillator is supplied to the amplitude control unit, and the phase-locked loop is thus closed. This allows a simple central option for controlling the selection of the oscillator to be activated for closing the phase-locked loop.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to one advantageous refinement of the method according to the present invention for operating a MEMS gyroscope sensor system, a switchover is made between an active sensing operating mode in which sensor signals are detected and preprocessed, and at least one standby mode in which no sensor signals are detected and/or preprocessed. For this purpose, for the active sensing operating mode the lower-noise and/or more frequency-stable oscillator of the at least two oscillators is activated or used, and for the at least one standby mode the more energy-saving oscillator of the at least two oscillators is activated or used, while the respective other oscillator is deactivated. The advantage is that the power consumption for the MEMS gyroscope circuit arrangement may be lowered considerably without performance losses during measuring operation, i.e., in the sensing operating mode.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a further advantageous refinement of the method, a switchover between the predefined operating modes of the MEMS gyroscope sensor system is individually initiated. This allows flexible switching over between the operating modes as needed.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a further advantageous refinement of the method, a switchover is automatically made between the predefined operating modes of the MEMS gyroscope sensor system with a specifiable frequency. Measured values of the MEMS gyroscope may thus be provided essentially continuously or at least regularly, at the same time with lower energy consumption.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">It is understood that the features stated above and to be explained below may be used not only in the particular stated combination, but also in other combinations or alone without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferred embodiments and specific example embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in the figures and explained in greater detail in the following description; similar or functionally equivalent components or elements are denoted by the same reference numerals.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows the circuit diagram of a MEMS gyroscope sensor system according to one specific embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows steps of a method for operating a MEMS gyroscope sensor system according to one specific embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a MEMS gyroscope sensor system <b>1</b> in detail. MEMS gyroscope sensor system <b>1</b> includes a MEMS gyroscope sensor element <b>3</b> with a seismic mass that is excitable into oscillations, and a circuit arrangement <b>100</b> that includes a sensing unit <b>5</b>, also referred to as a sensing front end <b>5</b>, with a driver circuit and an energy control unit <b>2</b>. The driver circuit, which is not separately denoted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, is made up here of an amplitude control unit <b>4</b> and a phase-locked loop <b>10</b>. Phase-locked loop <b>10</b> includes an input interface <b>20</b> that is connected to MEMS gyroscope sensor element <b>3</b>. Phase-locked loop <b>10</b> receives position signals <b>101</b>, which represent the particular present position of the oscillating seismic mass of MEMS gyroscope <b>3</b>, via this input interface <b>20</b>. These position signals <b>101</b> are supplied to a phase detector <b>11</b> of phase-locked loop <b>10</b>, which is connected to a loop filter <b>12</b> via further signal technology. Loop filter <b>12</b> includes two outputs <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>that are connected to an oscillator <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, respectively. According to the present invention, the two oscillators <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b </i>differ in their energy consumption and/or in their noise properties. Thus, oscillator <b>13</b><i>a </i>may have a higher, in particular much higher, quality than oscillator <b>13</b><i>b</i>, which in turn may have lower, in particular much lower, energy consumption than oscillator <b>13</b><i>a</i>, as explained in greater detail below. Oscillators <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b </i>are further connected to a frequency divider <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, respectively. The output signals <b>101</b><i>a</i>, <b>101</b><i>b </i>respectively provided by the two frequency dividers <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>are supplied to a switch element <b>15</b> in the form of a multiplexer, which provides either signal <b>101</b><i>a </i>or signal <b>101</b><i>b </i>of respective oscillator <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b </i>as signal <b>102</b> to amplitude control unit <b>4</b> via an output interface <b>22</b>. Energy control unit <b>2</b> is connected both to sensing unit <b>5</b> and to the two oscillators <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b </i>and to switch element <b>15</b>. Energy control unit <b>2</b> specifies the operating mode of MEMS gyroscope sensor system <b>1</b>. The energy control unit may select between a sensing operating mode in which sensor signals are detected and preprocessed, and a standby mode in which no sensor signals are detected and/or preprocessed. For selecting the sensing operating mode, energy control unit <b>2</b> activates sensing unit <b>5</b> via signal path <b>105</b>, and activates lower-noise oscillator <b>13</b><i>a </i>via signal path <b>121</b><i>a</i>. The more energy-saving oscillator <b>13</b><i>b </i>is deactivated via signal path <b>121</b><i>b</i>. In addition, energy control unit <b>2</b> activates switch element <b>15</b> via signal path <b>120</b> in such a way that oscillator <b>13</b><i>a </i>is switched into phase-locked loop <b>10</b>, and phase-locked loop <b>10</b> is thus closed by lower-noise oscillator <b>13</b><i>a</i>. For switching over into the standby operating mode, energy control unit <b>2</b> deactivates sensing unit <b>5</b> via signal path <b>105</b>. Lower-noise oscillator <b>13</b><i>a </i>is likewise deactivated via signal path <b>121</b><i>a</i>. Instead, the more energy-saving oscillator <b>13</b><i>b </i>is now activated via signal path <b>121</b><i>b</i>. In addition, energy control unit <b>2</b> activates switch element <b>15</b> via signal path <b>120</b> in such a way that oscillator <b>13</b><i>b </i>is now switched into phase-locked loop <b>10</b>, and phase-locked loop <b>10</b> is thus closed by the more energy-saving oscillator <b>13</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the two oscillators <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b </i>are thus also switched on or off via corresponding control signals <b>121</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>b </i>of energy control unit <b>2</b> as a function of the selected operating mode of MEMS gyroscope sensor system <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The position signals <b>101</b> are also supplied to amplitude control unit <b>4</b>. The amplitude control unit generates a driver signal <b>103</b> for MEMS gyroscope sensor element <b>3</b>, based on position signals <b>101</b> and output signal <b>102</b> of phase-locked loop <b>10</b>. This driver signal <b>103</b> is generated regardless of the operating mode of MEMS gyroscope sensor system <b>1</b>, and is used to maintain the oscillation movement of the seismic mass of MEMS gyroscope sensor element <b>3</b>, regardless of the operating mode of MEMS gyroscope sensor system <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the sensing operating mode, measuring signals <b>104</b> detected by MEMS gyroscope sensor element <b>3</b> are read out by activated sensing unit <b>5</b> and demodulated with the aid of output signal <b>101</b><i>a </i>of lower-noise oscillator <b>13</b><i>a </i>in order to provide a rotation rate sensor signal as a useful signal <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Phase-locked loop <b>10</b> is a closed system that ascertains the phase and frequency of an input signal, in the present case a position data signal of MEMS gyroscope <b>3</b>. As discussed above, phase-locked loop <b>10</b> here includes a phase detector <b>11</b>, a loop filter <b>12</b>, and two controllable oscillators <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>, in particular in the form of voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), and a downstream frequency divider <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, respectively, having the respective factors 1/N1 and 1/N2. In the present case in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, loop filter <b>12</b> includes two output interfaces <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>that may apply and provide various transfer functions to the respective input signal. Each of the signals to which the particular transfer function has been applied is then respectively provided to one of the two oscillators <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b</i>. One of oscillators <b>13</b><i>a </i>is designed to provide low (phase) noise, which requires a correspondingly high frequency, and thus high energy consumption. In contrast, the other oscillator <b>13</b><i>b </i>is designed for particularly low energy consumption, optionally with a lower frequency than first oscillator <b>13</b><i>a</i>, and with greater noise.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Due to the oscillation frequencies of oscillators <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b </i>which are possibly different, it is likewise possible, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, to use two different frequency dividers <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>having different coefficients 1/N1 or 1/N2, respectively. If the two oscillators <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b </i>have the same center frequency, phase-locked loop <b>10</b> or MEMS gyroscope circuit arrangement <b>1</b> as a whole may be operated using a single divided frequency divider. This frequency divider is then situated downstream from switch element <b>15</b>, using signal technology. Switch element <b>15</b> is controlled outside phase-locked loop <b>10</b> by energy control unit <b>2</b>. Energy control unit <b>2</b> then selects which of the two oscillators <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b </i>provides the signal for the control loop to be closed. In particular, only one oscillator <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b </i>is activated in each case. The signal path of the oscillator having lower noise (oscillator <b>13</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is connected to sensing front end <b>5</b>, which reads out the rotational speed of MEMS gyroscope <b>3</b> and which requires a corresponding demodulation signal <b>105</b> from phase-locked loop <b>10</b>. Amplitude control unit <b>4</b> instead reads out the position of MEMS gyroscope sensor element <b>3</b> and provides a driver signal <b>103</b> in order to keep the amplitude of MEMS gyroscope sensor element <b>3</b> constant. For this purpose, amplitude control unit <b>4</b> likewise requires a driver signal <b>102</b> from phase-locked loop <b>10</b> in order to detect the amplitude movement and to provide a suitable driver signal <b>103</b> at the resonant frequency of MEMS gyroscope sensor element <b>3</b>. The operating mode of MEMS gyroscope sensor system <b>1</b> is specified with the aid of energy control unit <b>2</b>. If sensing front end <b>5</b> is switched on, oscillator <b>13</b><i>a </i>of phase-locked loop <b>10</b> that is designed for lower noise is used. If sensing front end <b>5</b> is switched off, a switchover is made to second oscillator <b>13</b><i>b </i>having lower energy consumption. The respective oscillator <b>13</b><i>a</i>, <b>13</b><i>b </i>that is not used is then switched off to save energy.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The method according to the present invention for operating a MEMS gyroscope sensor system <b>1</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, is explained below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The method includes the following steps.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">One of at least two predefined operating modes of MEMS gyroscope sensor system <b>1</b> is specified in a first step S<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">One of the at least two oscillators of the phase-locked loop is activated in a further step S<b>2</b> as a function of the predefined operating mode.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The remaining oscillators of the phase-locked loop are deactivated in a further step S<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a further optional step S<b>4</b>, a switchover between the predefined operating modes of MEMS gyroscope sensor system <b>1</b> is individually initiated, and/or the switchover between the predefined operating modes of the MEMS gyroscope sensor system takes place automatically with a specifiable frequency.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-01-15" num="01-15"><claim-text><b>1</b>-<b>15</b>.
