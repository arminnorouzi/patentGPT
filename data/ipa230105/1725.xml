In addition, when an image is recorded on an ink low-absorbing recording medium (such as art paper or coated paper) or an ink non-absorbing recording medium (such as a plastic film), in view of global environmental protection, safety for human being, and the like, as the ink, the use of a water-based ink jet ink composition (hereinafter, also called &#x201c;water-based ink&#x201d;, &#x201c;ink composition&#x201d;, or &#x201c;ink&#x201d; in some cases) containing a fixing resin has also been investigated.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, JP-A-2018-154014 has disclosed that in order to prevent drying of an ink composition, propylene glycol which is an organic solvent functioning as a moisturizing agent is contained in the ink composition.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, when the water-based ink as described above is used, the ink has an inferior conformability to a recording medium, that is, the ink is not likely to wet-spread on the recording medium, and hence for example, a problem in that a sufficient color development property is not obtained may arise.

The following embodiments will describe examples of the present disclosure. The present disclosure is not limited at all to the following embodiments and includes variously changed and/or modified embodiments to be performed without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. In addition, all the components to be described below are not always required to be essential components of the present disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">1. INK JET INK COMPOSITION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">An ink jet ink composition according to one embodiment of the present disclosure is a water-based ink which includes a colorant; a surfactant; a fixing resin; and an organic solvent. In this ink jet ink composition, the surfactant includes a silicone-based surfactant having an HLB value of 10.5 or less, the fixing resin includes an acrylic-based resin having a glass transition temperature of 35&#xb0; C. to 95&#xb0; C., and the organic solvent includes a 1,2-alkanediol having 4 carbon atoms or less and an alkanediol having diols at both terminals and 3 to 5 carbon atoms.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the structure described above, an ink jet ink composition having an excellent conformability to a recording medium and also having excellent clogging resistance and adhesion can be provided.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In recording on a recording medium, when an ink conformability to the recording medium is not superior, that is, when an ink is not likely to wet-spread on the recording medium, for example, a problem such that a sufficient color development property is not obtained may arise. In particular, in recording to be performed on a low-absorbing or a non-absorbing recording medium (in particular, a film), the problem described above tends to become serious.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In these days, when a silicone-based surfactant having a predetermined HLB value or less is contained in an ink, even if recording is performed on a low-absorbing or a non-absorbing recording medium, the ink is likely to wet-spread, and hence, a sufficient color development property is obtained.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">On the other hand, the silicone-based surfactant having a relatively low HLB value equal to or lower than a predetermined value tends to dissolve or swell an acrylic-based fixing resin when the ink is dried. That is, in the state in which water contained in the ink is evaporated and in which a solid content, such as the fixing resin or the like, and/or an organic solvent is condensed, the silicone-based surfactant having a relatively low HLB value tends to dissolve or swell the fixing resin. Accordingly, when the ink is dried in a recording head, the fixing resin is welded to cause clogging in some cases. That is, although an ink containing a silicone-based surfactant having a predetermined HLB value or less and an acrylic-based fixing resin having a glass transition temperature in a predetermined range has an excellent conformability to a recording medium, when the ink is dried, the fixing resin is liable to be welded in a recording head, and as a result, a clogging problem may occur.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, in order to prevent the clogging caused by this drying, when a content of an organic solvent functioning as a moisturizing agent is increased, and/or when an organic solvent having a high moisture retaining property is contained, a drying property of the ink is degraded, and as a result, the adhesion thereof is degraded. As described above, in the past, the clogging resistance and the adhesion were difficult to obtain at the same time.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In order to obtain the clogging resistance, the use of an organic solvent in the ink is considered. As the organic solvent, a 1,2-alkanediol having 4 carbon atoms or less may be mentioned.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As a moisturizing agent used for the ink, a 1,2-alkanediol having 4 carbon atoms or less has an excellent drying property in a drying step to complete the recording, and the adhesion between the ink and a recording medium is likely to be made preferable thereby; however, since the moisturizing property thereof may not be sufficient so as to prevent the dissolution and/or the swelling of an acrylic-based fixing resin caused by a silicone-based surfactant having a relatively low HLB value, the fixing resin is swelled, and the clogging is generated.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">On the other hand, in order to secure the moisture retaining property, when a content of an organic solvent functioning as a moisturizing agent is simply increased, and/or when an organic solvent having a high moisture retaining property is simply contained, the drying property of the ink is degraded, and as a result, the adhesion to a recording medium is degraded.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Through intensive research carried out by the present inventor, it was found that when a 1,2-alkanediol having 4 carbon atoms or less and an alkanediol having diols at both terminals and 3 to 5 carbon atoms are used in combination, the drying property and the moisture retaining property can be obtained at the same time. That is, although having not a sufficient moisture retaining property so as to prevent the dissolution and/or the swelling of a fixing resin caused by a silicone-based surfactant having a relatively low HLB value, the 1,2-alkanediol having 4 carbon atoms or less has an excellent drying property. On the other hand, although having a more excellent moisture retaining property and being capable of securing a sufficient clogging resistance, the alkanediol having diols at both terminals and 3 to 5 carbon atoms is inferior in terms of the drying property and the adhesion. When the two types of alkanediols described above were used in combination, the clogging resistance and the adhesion could be obtained at the same time.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Hereinafter, the components which are contained in the ink jet ink composition according to this embodiment and components which may be contained therein will be described.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">1.1.

As the colorant, at least one of a pigment and a dye may be used.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Pigment</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">When the pigment is used as the colorant, a light resistance of the ink composition can be improved.

As the pigment, for example, there may be mentioned a color pigment, such as a cyan, a yellow, a magenta, or a black pigment, or a special color pigment, such as a white pigment or a bright pigment.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As the organic pigment, for example, there may be mentioned a quinacridone-based pigment, a quinacridone quinone-based pigment, a dioxane-based pigment, a dioxazine-based pigment, a phthalocyanine-based pigment, an anthrapyrimidine-based pigment, an anthanthrone-based pigment, an indanthrone-based pigment, a flavanthrone-based pigment, a perylene-based pigment, a diketopyrrolopyrrole-based pigment, a perinone-based pigment, a quinophthalone-based pigment, an anthraquinone-based pigment, a thioindigo-based pigment, a benzimidazolone-based pigment, a thioindigo-based pigment, an isoindolinone-based pigment, an azomethine-based pigment, a dye chelate, a dye lake, a nitro-based pigment, a nitroso-based pigment, an aniline black, or an azo pigment, such as an insoluble azo pigment, a condensed azo pigment, an azo lake, or a chelate azo pigment.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As a concrete example of the organic pigment, the following may be mentioned.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As the cyan pigment, for example, C.I. Pigment Blue 1, 2, 3, 15:3, 15:4, 16, 22, or 60, or C.I. Vat Blue 4 or 60 may be mentioned, and one selected from the group consisting of C.I. Pigment Blue 15:3, 15:4, and 60 or a mixture of at least two thereof is preferable.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As the magenta pigment, for example, C.I. Pigment Red 5, 7, 12, 48(Ca), 48(Mn), 57(Ca), 57:1, 112, 122, 123, 168, 184, 202, or 209, or C.I. Pigment Violet 19 may be mentioned, and one selected from the group consisting of C.I. Pigment Red 122, 202, and 209, and C.I. Pigment Violet 19 or a mixture of at least two thereof is preferable.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As the yellow pigment, for example, C.I.

Pigment Yellow 74, 109, 110, 128, and 138 or a mixture of at least two thereof is preferable.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As the orange pigment, for example, C.I. Pigment Orange 36 or 43 or a mixture thereof may be mentioned.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As the green pigment, for example, C.I. Pigment Green 7 or 36 or a mixture thereof may be mentioned.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As the black pigment, for example, a furnace black, a lamp black, an acetylene black, or a channel black (C.I. Pigment Black 7) may be mentioned, and as a commercially available product thereof, for example, there may be mentioned No. 2300, No. 900, MCF88, No. 20B, No. 33, No. 40, No. 45, No. 52, MA7, MA8, MA100, or No. 2200B (trade name, manufactured by Mitsubishi chemical Co., Ltd.); Color Black FW1, FW2, FW2V, FW18, FW200, S150, S160, or S170, Printex 35, U, V, or 140U, or Special Black 6, 5, 4A, 4, or 250 (trade name, manufactured by Degussa AG.); Conductex SC, Raven 1255, 5750, 5250, 5000, 3500, 1255, or 700 (trade name, manufactured by Columbia Carbon Inc.); or Regal 400R, 330R, or 660R, Mogul L, Monarch 700, 800, 880, 900 1000, 1100, 1300, or 1400, or Elftex 12 (trade name, manufactured by Cabot Corporation). Those carbon blacks may be used alone, or at least two types thereof may be used as a mixture.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Although the bright pigment is not particularly limited as long as having a bright property when being adhered to a medium, for example, there may be mentioned metal particles (also called a metal pigment) of one selected from the group consisting of aluminum, silver, gold, platinum, nickel, chromium, tin, zinc, indium, titanium, copper, and an alloy containing at least two of those mentioned above or a pearl pigment having pearly glossiness. As a representative example of the pearl pigment, for example, a pigment, such as titanium dioxide-coated mica, argentine, or bismuth oxychloride, having pearly glossiness or interference glossiness may be mentioned. In addition, the bright pigment may be surface-treated in order to suppress a reaction with water.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, as the white pigment, for example, a metal oxide or a metal compound, such as barium sulfate or calcium carbonate, may be mentioned. As the metal oxide, for example, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, silica, alumina, or magnesium oxide may be mentioned. In addition, as the white pigment, particles each having a hollow structure may also be used.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The pigments mentioned above may be used alone, or at least two types thereof may be used in combination. In view of a storage stability, such as a light resistance, a weather resistance, or a gas resistance, the pigment is preferably an organic pigment.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Dispersion Method</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the pigment is used as the colorant, the pigment is preferably added to the water-based ink composition in the form of a pigment dispersion liquid which is obtained by dispersing the pigment in water using a dispersant, by dispersing in water, a self-dispersible surface-treated pigment in which a hydrophilic group is introduced on surfaces of pigment particles using a chemical reaction, or by dispersing a polymer-coated pigment in water.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Although the dispersant is not particularly limited, for example, a high molecular weight dispersant or a surfactant may be mentioned. Although the high molecular weight dispersant is not particularly limited, for example, there may be mentioned a protein, such as a glue, a gelatin, a casein, or an albumin; a natural rubber, such as a gum arabic or a gum tragacanth; a glucoside such as a saponin; an alginic-acid fermented material of propylene glycol alginate, triethanolamine alginate, or ammonium alginate; a cellulose derivative, such as a methyl cellulose, a carboxymethyl cellulose, or an ethyl hydroxycellulose; a poly(vinyl alcohol), a polypyrrolidone, an acrylic-based resin, such as a polyacrylic acid, an acrylic acid-acrylonitrile copolymer, a potassium acrylate-acrylonitrile copolymer, a vinyl acetate-acrylate ester copolymer, or an acrylic acid-acrylate ester copolymer; a styrene-acrylic-based copolymer, such as a styrene-acrylic acid copolymer, a styrene-methacrylic acid copolymer, a styrene-methacrylic acid-acrylate ester copolymer, or a styrene-m-methylstyrene-acrylic acid copolymer; a styrene-maleic acid copolymer, a styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer, a vinylnaphthalene-acrylic acid copolymer, a vinyl acetate-based copolymer, such as a vinyl acetate-ethylene copolymer, a vinyl acetate-fatty acid vinyl-ethylene copolymer, a vinyl acetate-maleate ester copolymer, a vinyl acetate-crotonic acid copolymer, or a vinyl acetate-acrylic acid copolymer; or a salt of each of those materials mentioned above. Although the surfactant is not particularly limited, for example, an anionic surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, or an amphoteric surfactant may be mentioned.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The above self-dispersible surface-treated pigment in which a hydrophilic group is introduced is configured to be dispersed or dissolved in water without using a dispersant by a surface treatment performed such that a carboxy group and/or its salt is directly bonded to the surface of the pigment. In more particular, by a physical treatment using vacuum plasma or a chemical treatment using sodium hypochlorite or ozone as an oxidant, when functional groups or molecules having functional groups are grafted on the surface of the pigment, the above self-dispersible surface-treated pigment can be obtained.

That is, since the ink is not likely to be dried on a low-absorbing recording medium or a non-absorbing recording medium as compared to on an absorbing recording medium, the adhesion and the drying property are liable to be degraded; however, by the ink jet ink composition according to this embodiment, even if the recording medium as described above is used, the clogging resistance, the adhesion, and the drying property can be made preferable at the same time. Hence, the ink jet ink composition according to this embodiment is preferably used for recording on a low-absorbing recording medium or a non-absorbing recording medium.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0139">The low-absorbing recording medium or the non-absorbing recording medium indicates a recording medium hardly absorbing a liquid, such as an ink composition, or a recording medium absorbing no liquid, respectively.

In addition, the recording surface includes neither an absorbing layer nor a receiving layer to absorb an ink. For example, there may be mentioned a recording medium in which a plastic is coated on a substrate such as paper, a recording medium in which a plastic film is adhered to a substrate such as paper, or a plastic film having neither an absorbing layer nor a receiving layer. The plastic described above indicates, for example, a poly(vinyl chloride), a poly(ethylene terephthalate), a polycarbonate, a polystyrene, a polyurethane, a polyethylene, or a polypropylene.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0142">In addition, as the low-absorbing recording medium, a recording medium, so-called coated paper, having a coated layer as a surface layer may be mentioned. For example, as a recording medium using paper as a substrate, printing paper, such as art paper, coated paper, or matte paper, may be mentioned. When the substrate is a plastic film, there may be mentioned a recording medium in which a hydrophilic polymer or the like is coated on a surface of a poly(vinyl chloride), a poly(ethylene terephthalate), a polycarbonate, a polystyrene, a polyurethane, a polyethylene, a polypropylene, or the like or a recording medium in which particles of silica, titanium, or the like are coated with a binder on the surface mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0143">The ink jet ink composition according to this embodiment may also be preferably used for recording on a flexible package film.

When being adhered to the film described above, an ink composition is more unlikely to be fixed thereto as compared to the case in which a plastic film having an ordinary thickness is used, and even if being fixed, the ink composition is not likely to appropriately correspond and conform to the flexibility of the film, and as a result, peeling of the ink is liable to occur. However, the ink jet ink composition according to this embodiment also tends to have an excellent adhesion to the flexible package film.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0144">As a material forming a recording surface of the flexible package film, a material containing at least one selected from an olefin-based resin, such as a polyethylene or a polypropylene, an ester-based resin such as a polyester, a vinyl chloride-based resin such as a poly(vinyl chloride), and an amide-based resin such as a polyamide may be used. As a film substrate including the recording surface of the flexible package film, those resins mentioned above each may be used after being processed into a film shape or a sheet shape. In the case of a film or a sheet formed from the resin, a non-stretched film or a stretched film stretched in one axial direction or biaxial directions may be used, and a film stretched in biaxial directions is preferably used.

As the sign graphic recording medium, for example, many various types of materials, such as a banner, coated paper, matte paper, wallpaper, a cloth, and a plastic film, such as a PET or a PVC film, have been widely used, and in particular, the ink jet ink composition according to this embodiment may be preferably used on a transparent or a semi-transparent plastic film to be used for a window display, a car wrapping, or the like. Those films described above each have a substrate formed from a polyolefin, a PET, a PVC, or the like having flexibility and are frequently used after an adhesive layer is provided on a surface of the substrate opposite to a recording surface thereof, and after the printing is performed, the films are each adhered to a window glass, a car body, or the like with an adhesive surface. When being adhered to this film, an ink is more unlikely to be fixed thereto, and even if being fixed, the ink is not likely to appropriately correspond and conform to the flexibility of this film, so that peeling is liable to occur.

However, in order to prevent the clogging caused by this drying, when a content of an organic solvent functioning as a moisturizing agent is increased, and/or when an organic solvent having a high moisture retaining property is contained, the drying property of the ink is degraded, and as a result, the adhesion is degraded. As described above, in the past, the clogging resistance and the adhesion are difficult to obtain at the same time.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0151">Through intensive research carried out by the present inventor, it was found that by using an ink containing a 1,2-alkanediol having 4 carbon atoms or less and an alkanediol having diols at both terminals and 3 to 5 carbon atoms in combination in a recording method, the clogging resistance and the adhesion can be obtained at the same time. That is, since a 1,2-alkanediol having 4 carbon atoms or less which has an excellent drying property but has not a sufficient moisture retaining property so as to prevent a silicone-based surfactant having a relatively low HLB value from dissolving or swelling an acrylic-based fixing resin and an alkanediol having diols at both terminals and 3 to 5 carbon atoms which has an excellent moisture retaining property and which can secure a sufficient drying property are used in combination, the clogging resistance and the adhesion can be obtained at the same time.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0152">Hereinafter, an ink jet recording apparatus which can be used for the recording method according to this embodiment will be described, and individual steps of the recording method according to this embodiment will be described.</p><heading id="h-0035" level="2">2.1.

The recording head <b>2</b> is mounted on the carriage <b>9</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The recording head <b>2</b> is scanned a plurality of times in the main scanning direction relative to the recording medium M by the operation of the carriage transfer mechanism <b>13</b> to transfer the carriage <b>9</b> in a medium width direction of the recording medium M. The medium width direction is the main scanning direction of the recording head <b>2</b>. The scanning in the main scanning direction is also called a main scanning.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0156">In addition, the main scanning direction is a direction in which the carriage <b>9</b> mounting the recording head <b>2</b> is transferred. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the main scanning direction is a direction intersecting a sub-scanning direction which is a transport direction of the recording medium M shown by an arrow SS. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the width direction of the recording medium M, that is, a direction represented by S<b>1</b>-S<b>2</b>, is a main scanning direction MS, and a direction represented by T<b>1</b>&#x2192;T<b>2</b> is a sub-scanning direction SS. In addition, by one scanning, the scanning is performed in the main scanning direction, that is, in one direction represented by an arrow S<b>1</b> or an arrow S<b>2</b>. In addition, since the main scanning of the recording head <b>2</b> and the sub-scanning which is the transport of the recording medium M are repeatedly performed at least two times, the ink is recorded on the recording medium M.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0157">The cartridge <b>12</b> to supply the ink to the recording head <b>2</b> includes a plurality of independent cartridges. The cartridge <b>12</b> is detachably fitted to the carriage <b>9</b> mounting the recording head <b>2</b>. In the cartridges, different types of ink jet ink compositions may be filled, and the ink jet ink compositions are supplied to respective nozzles from the cartridge <b>12</b>. In addition, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, although the case in which the cartridge <b>12</b> is fitted to the carriage <b>9</b> is shown by way of example, the cartridge <b>12</b> is not limited thereto and may be provided at a position other than the carriage <b>9</b> so that the ink jet ink compositions are supplied to the respective nozzles by supply tubes not shown.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0158">For the ejection from the recording head <b>2</b>, a known method may be used. In this embodiment, a method to eject a liquid droplet using vibration of a piezoelectric element, that is, an ejection method to form an ink droplet by a mechanical deformation of a piezoelectric element, is used.</p><heading id="h-0038" level="2">2.1.3. Primary Heating Mechanism</heading><p id="p-0162" num="0159">The ink jet recording apparatus <b>1</b> may include a primary heating mechanism to heat the recording medium M when the ink is ejected from the recording head <b>2</b> and is adhered to the recording medium. As the primary heating mechanism, for example, a conduction method, a ventilation method, or a radiation method may be used. The conduction method conducts heat to a recording medium from a member in contact therewith. For example, a platen heater may be mentioned. The ventilation method dries an ink or the like by sending an ordinary temperature wind or a hot wind to a recording medium. For example, a ventilation fan may be mentioned. The radiation method heats a recording medium by emitting radiation rays generating heat thereto. For example, an IR radiation may be mentioned. In addition, although not shown in the drawing, a heater similar to the platen heater <b>4</b> may also be provided right downstream thereof in a SS direction. Those primary heating mechanisms mentioned above may be used alone, or at least two methods thereof may be used in combination. For example, as the primary heating mechanism, the IR heater <b>3</b> and the platen heater <b>4</b> may be provided.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0160">In addition, when the IR heater <b>3</b> is used, by radiation of infrared rays from a recording head <b>2</b> side, the recording medium M can be heated by a radiation method. Accordingly, although the recording head <b>2</b> is also liable to be simultaneously heated, compared to the case in which heating is performed from a rear surface of the recording medium M by the platen heater <b>4</b> or the like, the temperature can be increased without receiving the influence of the thickness of the recording medium M. In addition, various types of fans (such as the ventilation fan <b>8</b>) may also be provided to dry the ink on the recording medium M by supplying a hot wind or a wind having the same temperature as that in the environment to the recording medium M.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0161">The platen heater <b>4</b> is able to heat the recording medium M at a position facing the recording head <b>2</b> with the platen <b>11</b> interposed therebetween. The platen heater <b>4</b> is able to heat the recording medium M by a conduction method and may be used if needed in the recording method.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0162">The ink jet recording apparatus <b>1</b> may also include the pre-heater <b>7</b> to heat the recording medium M in advance before the ink is adhered to the recording medium M.</p><heading id="h-0039" level="2">2.1.4.

Since the heating heater <b>5</b> heats the recording medium M on which an image is recorded, moisture and the like contained in the ink are rapidly evaporated and/or scattered, and hence, an ink film is formed by a resin contained in the ink. As described above, the ink film is tightly fixed or adhered onto the recording medium M, that is, an excellent film forming property is obtained, and hence, an image having an excellent high image quality can be obtained in a short time.</p><heading id="h-0040" level="2">2.1.5.

A CPU <b>102</b> is an arithmetic processing device to control the entire ink jet recording apparatus <b>1</b>. A memory <b>103</b> (MEM) is to secure, for example, a region in which a program of the CPU <b>102</b> is stored and an operation region thereof. The CPU <b>102</b> controls individual units by a unit control circuit <b>104</b> (UCTRL). In addition, the status in the ink jet recording apparatus <b>1</b> is monitored by a detector group <b>121</b> (DS), and based on the detection result thereof, the control portion CONT controls the individual units.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0168">A transport unit <b>111</b> (CONVU) controls the sub-scanning (transport) of the ink jet recording and in particular, controls a transport direction and a transport rate of the recording medium M.

For example, when the nozzle of the recording head <b>2</b> is driven by a piezoelectric element, the operation of the piezoelectric element of each nozzle is controlled. By the head unit <b>113</b>, for example, a timing of each ink adhesion and a dot size of the ink are controlled. In addition, by combination of controls of the carriage unit <b>112</b> and the head unit <b>113</b>, an adhesion amount of the ink per one scanning is controlled.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0171">A drying unit <b>114</b> (DU) controls the temperatures of various types of heaters, such as the IR heater <b>3</b>, the pre-heater <b>7</b>, the platen heater <b>4</b>, and the heating heater <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0172">In the ink jet recording apparatus <b>1</b> described above, an operation in which the carriage <b>9</b> mounting the recording head <b>2</b> is transferred in the main scanning direction and a transport operation (sub-scanning) are alternately repeated. In this step, when each pass is performed, the control portion CONT controls the carriage unit <b>112</b> to transfer the recording head <b>2</b> in the main scanning direction and also controls the head unit <b>113</b> to eject a liquid droplet of the ink from a predetermined nozzle hole of the recording head <b>2</b> so as to adhere the liquid droplet of the ink to the recording medium M. In addition, the control portion CONT controls the transport unit <b>111</b> so that in the transport operation, the recording medium M is transported by a predetermined transport amount (feed amount) in the transport direction.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0173">In the ink jet recording apparatus <b>1</b>, since the main scanning (pass) and the sub-scanning (transport operation) are repeatedly performed, a recording region to which liquid droplets are adhered is gradually transported. Subsequently, by the heating heater <b>5</b>, the liquid droplets adhered to the recording medium M are dried, so that an image is completed. Next, the recorded matter thus completed may be wound into a roll shape by a winding mechanism or may be transported by a flatbed mechanism.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0174">Hereinafter, the individual steps of the recording method according to this embodiment will be described.</p><heading id="h-0042" level="2">2.2. Ink Adhesion Step</heading><p id="p-0178" num="0175">The recording method according to this embodiment includes a step (ink adhesion step) to eject the ink jet ink composition described above by an ink jet method so as to be adhered to a recording medium. In addition, the &#x201c;ink jet method&#x201d; is a method to eject a liquid droplet using an ink jet head.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0176">An adhesion amount of the ink which is defined as an adhesion mass of the ink composition per unit area of a recording region of a recording medium is preferably 3 mg/inch<sup>2 </sup>or more, more preferably 5 mg/inch<sup>2 </sup>or more, further preferably 7 mg/inch<sup>2 </sup>or more. In addition, an upper limit of the ink adhesion amount is preferably 15 mg/inch<sup>2 </sup>or less, more preferably 12 mg/inch<sup>2 </sup>or less, and further preferably 9 mg/inch<sup>2 </sup>or less. By the recording method according to this embodiment, when the ink adhesion amount is in the range described above, the conformability is excellent, and the clogging resistance and the adhesion tend to be improved.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0177">The maximum adhesion amount of the ink composition per unit area of the recording region of the recording medium in the recording is also preferably set in the range describe above.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0178">The recording medium is similar to a recording medium which can be used for the ink jet ink composition described above, and a low-absorbing recording medium or a non-absorbing recording medium is preferable. Since the ink is not likely to be dried on a low-absorbing recording medium or a non-absorbing recording medium as compared to on an absorbing recording medium, the adhesion and the drying property of the ink are liable to be degraded; however, by the recording method according to this embodiment, even if the recording medium as described above is used, the clogging resistance, the adhesion, and the drying property can be made preferable at the same time.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0179">In addition, in the recording method according to this embodiment, the recording is performed by a plurality of main scannings, and the number of main scannings performed on the same scanning region is preferably 10 times or less, more preferably 9 times or less, even more preferably 7 times or less, further preferably 5 times or less, and particularly preferably 4 times or less. Although the number of main scannings is at least one time, and a lower limit thereof is not particularly limited, the number of main scannings is preferably at least 3 times or more.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0180">In the case in which a resolution which is the number of dots (number of ink droplets) per unit area is fixed, when the number of main scannings is small, since the number of dots to be simultaneously ejected is increased, the ink droplets tend to be gathered together, and as a result, the conformability tends to be degraded. In a recording method using an ink containing a silicone-based surfactant having a predetermined HLB value or less, although the conformability to a recording medium may be improved in some cases, the clogging is liable to occur; hence in order to overcome the clogging, the adhesion is also required to be overcome at the same time. In addition, when the number of main scannings is small, since a drying time in the primary heating step which will be described below is shortened, the drying is liable to be insufficient, and the adhesion tends to be degraded. In addition, when the number of main scannings is small, a recording rate is fast, and a time in which the same portion of the recording medium stays in the post-heating mechanism may also be shortened in some cases.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0181">However, by the recording method according to this embodiment, even when the number of main scannings is small, a preferable conformability can be secured, and in addition, the clogging resistance and the adhesion tend to be made preferable at the same time.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0182">In addition, the number of main scannings performed on the same scanning region indicates a total number of main scannings in the case in which after one main scanning is performed in a scanning region on a recording medium by a recording head, a main scanning is again performed so as to be overlapped with at least a part of the scanning region described above. For example, when a distance by one sub-scanning is shorter than a sub-scanning direction length of a nozzle line to eject the ink, a scanning is again performed on the scanning region scanned by one main scanning. For example, when the distance by one sub-scanning is one eighth of the sub-scanning direction length of the nozzle line to eject the ink, the main scanning is performed 8 times on the same scanning region. In the case described above, the number of main scannings is regarded as 8 times.</p><heading id="h-0043" level="2">2.3. Primary Heating Step</heading><p id="p-0186" num="0183">The recording method according to this embodiment includes a primary heating step to heat the above ink jet ink composition adhered to a recording medium, and a surface temperature of the recording medium in the primary heating step is preferably 40&#xb0; C. or more.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0184">In addition, the surface temperature of the recording medium in the primary heating step is preferably 50&#xb0; C. or less, more preferably 47&#xb0; C. or less, even more preferably 45&#xb0; C. or less, and particularly preferably 43&#xb0; C. or less. In addition, the surface temperature of the recording medium in the primary heating step is preferably 28&#xb0; C. or more, more preferably 33&#xb0; C. or more, even more preferably 38&#xb0; C. or more, and particularly preferably 45&#xb0; C. or more.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0185">Since being more excellent in drying property, the recording method having the structure as described above is able to further improve the adhesion of the recorded matter. On the other hand, the wet-spreadability of an ink on a recording medium tends to be degraded, and the conformability is liable to be degraded. Hence, in order to improve the conformability, when an ink containing a silicone-based surfactant having a predetermined HLB value or less is used, the clogging is liable to occur; hence, in order to overcome the clogging, the adhesion is also required to be overcome at the same time. However, by the recording method according to this embodiment, even if the structure as described above is provided, a preferable conformability can be secured, and in addition, the clogging resistance and the adhesion tend to be made preferable at the same time.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0186">The primary heating step is a step to heat and dry the ink adhered to the recording medium at an early stage. The primary heating step is a heating step to dry at least a part of a solvent component of the ink so as to at least decrease the fluidity of the ink adhered to the recording medium. The primary heating step may be performed so that the ink is adhered to a heated recording medium or so that the ink is heated at an early stage after the ink adhesion. Heating in the primary heating step is preferably started within 0.5 seconds at the latest after an ink droplet lands on the recording medium.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0187">The primary heating step is preferably performed by an IR heater, radiation of microwaves, a platen heater, or a hot wind blown to the recording medium by a fan.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0188">The heating in the primary heating step may be performed before the ink adhesion step described above, at the same time as the ink adhesion, or at an early stage after the ink adhesion and is preferably performed at the same time as the ink adhesion. By the heating order as described above, the ink adhesion step can be performed.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0189">In addition, in the case in which the ink is adhered to a heated recording medium, the heating temperature in the primary heating step is a surface temperature of the recording medium at the ink adhesion, and in the case in which the heating is performed at an early stage after the ink adhesion, the heating temperature in the primary heating step is a surface temperature of the recording medium when the heating is performed. In addition, the heating temperature is the maximum temperature during the heating in the primary heating step.</p><heading id="h-0044" level="2">2.4. Post-Heating Step</heading><p id="p-0193" num="0190">The recording method according to this embodiment preferably includes a post-heating step to heat the recording medium to which the ink jet ink composition described above is adhered. By this post-heating step, the drying property is further improved, and a recorded matter having a more excellent adhesion preferably tends to be obtained.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0191">The post-heating step is a heating step to sufficiently perform heating so as to complete the recording and so that the recorded matter can be used. The post-heating step is a heating step to sufficiently dry the solvent component of the ink and to heat the resin contained in the ink so as to flatten a coating film of the ink. The post-heating step is preferably started more than 0.5 seconds after the ink is adhered to the recording medium. For example, the heating is preferably started to the region described above more then 0.5 seconds after the ink adhesion is all completed to the recording region of the recording medium. In addition, a preferable temperature in the primary heating step described above is preferably different from a preferable temperature in the post-heating step.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0192">For example, when the ink jet recording apparatus is used, the heating of the recording medium in the post-heating step may be performed by an appropriate heating device. In addition, besides the heating device equipped in the ink jet recording apparatus, the heating may be performed by an appropriate heating device.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0193">In addition, a surface temperature of the recording medium in this case is preferably 60&#xb0; C. or more, more preferably 70&#xb0; C. or more, even more preferably 80&#xb0; C. or more, and further preferably 85&#xb0; C. or more.

During ink jet recording, as a primary heating mechanism, a platen heater was operated, and a surface temperature (maximum temperature in the recording) of a recording medium at a recording side located to face a recording head is shown as a primary drying temperature (primary heating temperature) in the following Table 3. In addition, in the ink jet printer used in Examples and Comparative Examples, downstream of the primary heating mechanism, a secondary heater was provided as a post-heating mechanism. As the secondary heater, an IR heater was used, the maximum surface temperature (maximum temperature in the post-heating step) of the recording medium at a recording side was set to 70&#xb0; C., and a secondary heating was performed.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0231">Printing Conditions</p><p id="p-0229" num="0232">Ink to be used: shown in the following Table 3<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li
