Also, the term &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;have,&#x201d; or &#x201c;having&#x201d; when used in this disclosure specifies the presence of the stated elements, but do not preclude the presence or addition of other elements.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">When multiple housing panels of a housing for an electronic device are fastened together, inconsistent gaps or other visible artifacts may be present if a fastening mechanism used does not form a tight fit between the housing panels. An inconsistent gap between housing panels can refer to a gap that is wider in some sections than other sections of the gap. Other visible artifacts can include a portion of an edge of a housing panel being visible when it should not, warping of a portion of a housing panel, and so forth.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with some implementations of the present disclosure, an internal fastening mechanism is employed to tightly fasten housing panels of a housing of an electronic device. In some examples, the electronic device can include an electronic device containing an audio speaker, which is an output device to play audio. In other examples, the electronic device can be a different type of electronic device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The internal fastening mechanism includes multiple spring-loaded clips provided on a first housing panel, which are able to engage respective pockets on a second housing panel. When the spring-loaded clips are inserted into the pockets of the second housing panel, the first and second housing panels can be shifted relative to one another against a biasing force of the spring-loaded clips to allow for alignment of further fasteners on the first and second housing panels. Once the further fasteners are aligned, the biasing force applied by the spring-loaded clips in the pockets can cause the fasteners to engage.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of a housing <b>100</b> for an electronic device, according to some examples. The housing <b>100</b> includes a first housing panel <b>102</b> and a second housing panel <b>104</b> that are to be fastened together to define an inner chamber between the housing panels <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. The inner chamber can contain various electronic components of the electronic device. For example, the first housing panel <b>102</b> can be a speaker grill, which includes small openings (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) through which audio can be output from an audio speaker contained in the inner chamber. The second housing panel <b>104</b> can include a back cover of the electronic device to which the speaker grill is to be fastened.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example in which the housing <b>100</b> includes two housing panels, it is noted that in other examples, the housing <b>100</b> can include more than two housing panels that are to be fastened together using fastening mechanisms according to some implementations of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some examples, an internal fastening mechanism is employed to fasten the first housing panel <b>102</b> to the second housing panel <b>104</b>. An internal fastening mechanism can refer to a fastening mechanism that is not visible to a user from outside the housing <b>100</b> once the first and second housing panels <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> are fastened together.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The internal fastening mechanism includes multiple spring-loaded clips <b>106</b> that are attached to an inner surface <b>108</b> of the first housing panel <b>102</b>. The inner surface <b>108</b> of the first housing panel <b>102</b> is the surface that faces the inner chamber of the housing <b>100</b> once the first and second housing panels <b>102</b> and <b>104</b> are fastened together.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A &#x201c;spring-loaded clip&#x201d; can refer to a fastener that is deformable and applies a biasing force in a given direction when deformed. The spring-loaded clip can have any of various different shapes, including those shown in various examples in the remaining figures.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The spring-loaded clips <b>106</b> can be initially separate from the first housing panel <b>102</b> and can be attached to the first housing panel <b>102</b>.

The fasteners <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are able to slidingly engage when one fastener <b>112</b> can slide relative to another fastener <b>114</b> from an initial un-fastened state to a fastened state. In the un-fastened state, the fasteners <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are disengaged from one another. In the fastened state, the fasteners <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> are engaged physically together.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows just one fastener on the inner surface <b>108</b> of the first housing panel <b>102</b>, in other examples, multiple fasteners <b>112</b> can be provided on the inner surface <b>108</b> of the first housing panel <b>102</b>.

If there are multiple fasteners <b>112</b> on the first housing panel <b>102</b>, these multiple fasteners <b>112</b> can engage with the elongated fastener <b>114</b>. In other examples, the fastener <b>114</b> on the second housing panel <b>104</b> is a shorter fastener to engage a respective fastener <b>112</b> on the first housing panel <b>102</b>.
