The liner is manufactured by combining a metal boss and a knob to a plastic material such as polyolefin-based resin or polyamide-based resin. The composite material layer is formed by winding a composite fiber in which a carbon fiber or a glass fiber is mixed with a polymer resin such as an epoxy resin on the surface of the liner.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the case of a high-pressure tank of a one port type, a port that is a head boss to which a valve for an entry of gas such as hydrogen is coupled is formed on one side, and a knob that is a tail boss for the purpose of fixing the tank is formed on the other side. A method in which a metallic knob cap is externally coupled to the knob has been conventionally used.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The knob cap serves to be coupled to a fixing shaft and fix the tank in order to prevent the tank from shaking during a filament winding process. Since the entire knob cap is made of metal, the knob cap became a factor hindering a weight reduction of the high-pressure tank.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR TECHNICAL DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">(Patent Document 1) Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 1998-332082 (Dec. 15, 1998)</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been made in an effort to provide a knob cap for a high-pressure tank having advantages of enabling a weight reduction and securing a structural stability.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides a knob cap for a high-pressure tank having advantages of installing a reinforcing cap having impact resistance so as to improve a protective effect against an external impact.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another embodiment of the present invention provides a knob cap for a high-pressure tank including a coupling groove portion corresponding to a knob of a liner of the high-pressure tank formed in a lower surface of a body; a peripheral wing portion extending outward in a lower end of an outer circumferential surface of the body to be in contact with a surface of the liner; and a thickness conversion portion formed in the outer circumferential surface of the body to change a thickness between a center line and the outer circumferential surface.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present invention, a metal insert formed of a metal material coupled to the knob may be inserted into the coupling groove portion of the body.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the present invention, the metal insert may be formed in the shape of a cup having a hollow in which a thread is formed on an inner circumferential surface.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the present invention, one or more inner grooves extending downward from an upper surface of the body may be formed in the body.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the present invention, a reinforcing cap including a coupling protrusion coupled to the inner groove and in a shape of a disc with a hollow may be coupled to the upper surface of the body.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present invention, the metal material of the metal insert may include aluminum, and the body may be formed of fiber-reinforced plastic reinforced with a glass fiber or a carbon fiber.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the present invention, the thickness conversion portion may be in the form of stairs in which a step is formed.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the present invention, in the thickness conversion portion, the outer circumferential surface may be in the form of an inclined surface in which a thickness of the body decreases toward an upper side, or in the form of a curved groove or a V-shaped groove concave toward a center line.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the present invention, in a center of the upper surface of the body, a hollow fixing groove to which a fixing shaft is able to be coupled when performing a filament winding process may be formed.

The plurality of inner grooves <b>230</b> surround a center line of the body <b>201</b> and are arranged in an annular shape, are spaced at equal intervals in a circumferential direction, and arranged to be spaced in a radial direction.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The inner groove <b>230</b> functions to prevent shrinkage from occurring when demolded from a mold after injection molding. That is, when the knob cap is demolded from the mold after molding, shape deformation may occur as an amount of cooling shrinkage in the central portion is relatively increased, and a plurality of inner grooves <b>230</b> function to prevent the shape deformation due to the shrinkage.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to the present invention, a reinforcing material may be mounted on the inner groove <b>230</b>. That is, when there is concern about deterioration in physical properties due to the inner groove <b>230</b>, the reinforcing material having a shape, for example, a cylindrical shape, corresponding to the inner groove <b>230</b>, may be inserted into the inner groove <b>230</b> to prevent deterioration in physical properties.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to the present invention, in the center of the upper surface of the body <b>201</b> of the knob cap <b>200</b>, a fixing groove <b>240</b> in the form of a hollow for fixing a fixing shaft (not shown) required for a filament winding process is formed. In the fixing groove <b>240</b>, a metal bushing <b>250</b> is installed inside to increase a bonding force with the fixing shaft.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The metal bushing <b>250</b> applied to the fixing groove <b>240</b> serves to strengthen the bonding force with the fixing shaft and to prevent damage due to strong tension during a filament winding operation.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a thickness conversion portion <b>260</b> is formed on the outer circumferential surface of the body <b>201</b> of the knob cap <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The thickness conversion portion <b>260</b> changes a thickness of the body defined between the center line and the outer circumferential surface so that the outer circumferential surface has a different thickness at least in part in a height direction. The center line is a line passing through the center of the knob cap in the height direction. The thickness conversion portion <b>260</b> improves a bearing capacity with respect to an internal stress.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to an embodiment of the present invention, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the thickness conversion portion <b>260</b> formed on the outer circumferential surface of the body <b>201</b> of the knob cap <b>200</b> may be in the shape of stairs in which a step <b>262</b> is formed. Since the thickness conversion portion <b>260</b> has the step <b>262</b>, the thickness conversion portion <b>260</b> has a reduction outer diameter portion <b>261</b> with a relatively reduced thickness on an upper end of the outer circumferential surface.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> illustrate that one step is formed, but the thickness may be reduced in such a way that steps are continuously formed.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The thickness conversion portion <b>260</b> formed on the outer circumferential surface of the knob cap <b>200</b> allows the composite material layer <b>120</b> to be reinforced when the high-pressure tank is manufactured.

Therefore, the inclined surface is located with an upper end close to a center line and a lower end relatively far from the center line. When the thickness conversion portion <b>260</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>a</i>)</figref> is formed, at full height on the outer peripheral surface, the body has a trapezoidal cross section with a narrow upper end and a wide lower end.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>(<i>b</i>)</figref>, the thickness conversion portion <b>260</b> may be formed in the shape of a curved groove.
