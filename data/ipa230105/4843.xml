Fields of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of big data analysis technology, more specifically, a large volume of data related script-based event response decision making and management system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Descriptions of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Currently, in an era when electronics, network, and information are blooming, big data have been widely used in applications. The big data analysis technology has been adopted in the fields of transportation, finance, politics, social media, medical and healthcare to form a large database by collecting various information through remote devices and conducting data analysis in order to understand the level of traffic congestion, trends of global finance, user or consumer behaviors. Therefore, the response strategy and management can be further arranged or improved based on the results of big data analysis.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. In general, a conventional analysis and decision making system <b>9</b> that is commonly available applies the following steps for the decision making process. When the &#x201c;feature&#x201d; has developed into an &#x201c;event&#x201d; that occurs, personnel will immediately &#x201c;assess&#x201d; the status of the event based on the standard operating procedures (SOP) then access the computer system via manual operation to conduct query and retrieval of relevant data; personnel finally decide to personally call relevant departments/organizations to proceed with the event processing. However, it will take about 20 minutes from the time when of the event occurs to the time of finalizing the strategy.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, the conventional analysis and decision making system <b>9</b> is set up as a type of equipment maintenance system, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. When the personnel learn that the operational status of a set of remote device <b>91</b> has formed a feature <b>92</b>, which further develops an event <b>93</b>, the personnel finally decide a response processing based on the event <b>93</b> and the SOP. For example, when an equipment of a closed-circuit television (CCTV) system has the feature of &#x201c;black screen&#x201d;, it means the equipment of the &#x201c;CCTV system&#x201d; is at fault. Therefore, a dispatch for processing the &#x201c;CCTV system&#x201d; is needed. A second example is that when the CCTV system has a black screen and the network does not respond to ping, it is a &#x201c;network outage&#x201d; event that requires &#x201c;network engineers&#x201d; to handle the event. If the CCTV system has a black screen but the network is responding to ping requests successfully, then this is an &#x201c;equipment&#x201d; event and &#x201c;hardware engineers&#x201d; should be dispatched to handle the event.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, the operational process of the aforementioned conventional analysis and decision making system <b>9</b> not only consumes much more time, but also produces a rigid and less flexible response strategy based on the SOP process conducted by the personnel. Such response strategy has less automation efficiency compared to that of AI intelligence, resulting in the personnel unable to quickly handle the event comprehensively.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of this, the inventor of the present invention develops a big data related script-based decision management system and method thereof. The main objective of the present invention is to provide an intelligent analysis that utilizes the Internet of Thing (IoT) technology and big data to generate better strategic management and effectively maintain remote devices, so that unexpected and complex incidents can be quickly managed when occur.

The present invention relates to a big data related script-based decision management system and method thereof that utilizes the Internet of Thing (IoT) technology and mainly collects the operational statuses of the remote devices <b>7</b> equipped with edge computing or without edge computing. After the operational statuses of the remote devices <b>7</b> are converted to digitized program data structures and all the program data structures are further integrated and undergo intelligent analysis by python, C++ software programs, a strategy result of the response method for the remote devices <b>7</b> is generated.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The architecture of the big data related script-based decision management system A includes setting up a big data database. The big data database stores a plurality of data <b>1</b> collected by a plurality of remote devices <b>7</b>, wherein the data <b>1</b> consists of a feature <b>2</b> extracted from the operational statuses of a plurality of remote devices <b>7</b> and stored in the big data database; an event <b>3</b> that is formed by analyzing the feature <b>2</b> and stored in the big data database; a script <b>4</b> that stores the response strategy created based on the event <b>3</b>; and a unit of analysis <b>5</b> that produces a strategy result by comparing and analyzing the event and the script.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, the composition elements of the architecture of the present invention all adopt an open type program data structure to enhance the applicability and flexibility of the present invention. For example, the present invention is applicable to decision management in the fields of transportation, finance, politics, social media, medical and healthcare; in other words, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the present invention can apply manual or artificial intelligence (AI) based intelligent automatic method to define the new data <b>1</b><i>a, </i>new features <b>2</b><i>a, </i>new events <b>3</b><i>a, </i>and new scripts <b>4</b><i>a </i>of program data structures.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The remote device <b>7</b> further provides a program data structure <b>71</b> that comprises a number D<b>1</b>, a latitude and longitude D<b>2</b>, and a type D<b>3</b>. The program data structure <b>71</b> is comparatively better for having integrated IoT data file formats including web pages (xml format), text files (text format), image files (png format), streaming video files (stream format). The present operational status of the remote device <b>7</b> is the feature <b>2</b>; the feature <b>2</b> can have a textual or graphical program data structure <b>71</b> wherein the program data structure <b>71</b> can be web pages or files in statement style. When the present operational status of the remote device <b>7</b> has an unexpected failure, an event is formed and occurs.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The event <b>3</b> further comprises an indexing and automatic classification function. The indexing and automatic classification function generates a program data structure <b>31</b> containing a classification P<b>1</b>, a text P<b>2</b>, a location P<b>3</b>, and a latitude and longitude P<b>4</b>, for the occurrence of the event, wherein the event classification further comprises a program data structure <b>32</b> containing an event level, an equipment status, a block, an obstacle, and a failure detection.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The script <b>4</b> is set as the linkages between each event group, including personnel and equipment, and comprises a program data structure <b>41</b> containing a major strategic item C<b>1</b>, a strategic/recommended text C<b>2</b>, and a strategy keyword C<b>3</b>. Last, the program data structure <b>31</b>, generated by the indexing and automatic classification of the event <b>3</b>, and the aforementioned script <b>4</b> are compared and analyzed by the unit of analysis <b>5</b> to produce a strategy result, wherein the strategy result comprises a program data structure <b>51</b> containing an equipment management and scheduling, an event diagnosis, and an event pool <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is worth mentioning that the event diagnosis grants access to an administrator <b>6</b> to input opinions thereof; the event pool <b>30</b> also grants access to the administrator <b>6</b> to create scripts of the event pool. In addition, a response condition <b>8</b> is set up to filter the event pool <b>30</b>, that is, when the response condition <b>8</b> is met, an event response is generated to issue an emergency notice to external relevant units to handle the condition of the remote device <b>7</b> together. The response condition <b>8</b> comprises a program data structure consisting of event scale, event level, and scope of impact. For example, the fire detection remote devices <b>7</b> in the computer room and the chairman's office detect a fire at the scene. Since the chairman's office belongs to the first level of importance plus the fire alarm is also an event of the first level of danger, the system automatically determines this event as a fire of a specific scale. Therefore, the system will not only automatically contact the chairman or staff, but also coordinate to notify the fire department for support.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Thus, the present invention has a comparatively better solution of a big data related script-based decision management system. Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The present invention mainly uses the unit of analysis <b>5</b> to conduct comparison and analysis of the event <b>3</b> and the script <b>4</b>. The text comparison and analysis further comprises a first text analysis <b>52</b>, a second text analysis <b>53</b>, and a strategy result <b>54</b> presented after matching. In other words, the first text analysis <b>52</b> generates the latitude and longitude (D<b>2</b>) as a matching result by the comparison between the classification (P<b>1</b>) and the text (P<b>2</b>), and between the major strategic item (C<b>1</b>) and the strategic/recommended text (C<b>2</b>). After the latitude and longitude (D<b>2</b>) undergoes the second text analysis <b>53</b> with the number (D<b>1</b>) and the type (D<b>3</b>), the remote device <b>7</b> is obtained. Next, the remote device <b>7</b> and the strategic/recommended text (C<b>2</b>) undergo a matching process to obtain the strategy result <b>54</b> to be applied to subsequent processing of the remote device <b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The big data related script-based decision management method B can be derived from the summary of the big data related script-based decision management system A, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, and comprises the following steps: a data collection step a that collects data of operational statuses of a plurality of remote devices <b>7</b> and further integrates data formats thereof and stores the data in a big data database; a feature annotation and labeling step b that analyzes data, annotates and labels data with the feature and stores the data in the big data database; an event construction step c that analyzes the features of data to form the event and stores the event in the big data database; a script construction step d that constructs a script to store the response strategy created based on the event and stores the script in the big data database; and an analysis and processing step e that constructs a unit of analysis to produce a strategy result by comparing and analyzing the module and the script.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For instance, the present invention can be implemented to a traffic and road decision management system C, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, having data <b>1</b> collected by the remote device <b>7</b> that comprises at least a CCTV system (including the monitor), at least a road test equipment equipped with a gyroscope.
