Photolithography may be used to form components on a chip. Generally the process of photolithography involves forming a photoresist layer on a substrate. The photoresist layer may be formed by, for example, spin-coating. The photoresist layer may include a resist resin and a photoacid generator. The photoacid generator, upon exposure to electromagnetic radiation in the subsequent exposure stage, alters the solubility of the photoresist in the development process. The electromagnetic radiation may have any suitable wavelength, such as a wavelength in the extreme ultra violet region, and can be from any suitable source, e.g., a 193 nm ArF laser, an electron beam, an ion beam, or other source. Excess solvent may then be removed in a pre-exposure bake process.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">During an exposure stage, a photomask or reticle may be used to selectively expose certain regions of a photoresist layer disposed on the substrate to electromagnetic radiation. Other exposure methods may be maskless exposure methods. Exposure to light may decompose the photoacid generator, which generates acid and results in a latent acid image in the resist resin. After exposure, the substrate may be heated in a post-exposure bake process. During the post-exposure bake process, the acid generated by the photoacid generator reacts with the resist resin in the photoresist layer, changing the solubility of the resist of the photoresist layer during a subsequent development process.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">After the post-exposure bake, the substrate and the photoresist layer are developed and rinsed. Subsequently, a patterned photoresist layer is then formed on the substrate. Openings are defined within the patterned photoresist layer, after the development and rinse processes, exposing the underlying target material for etching to transfer features onto a target material. Factors such as inaccurate control or low resolution of the lithography exposure process, or resilience of the patterned layer, may cause poor critical dimension of the patterned photoresist layer, resulting in unacceptable line width roughness (LWR). Large line width roughness (LWR) of the patterned photoresist layer may result in inaccurate feature transfer to the target material, which can eventually lead to premature device failure and yield loss.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is a need for improved patterned photoresist layer.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Examples of the present disclosure relate to methods for forming metal-oxides in a photoresist to improve profile control.

The methods disclosed herein are directed to formation or infiltration of a metal oxide into a photoresist layer.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a conventional resist layer, a material of the resist is selected from a polymer in order to control parameters, such as selectivity and line width roughness, when a film stack, in which the resist layer is formed, is exposed to an etchant, and vias or trenches are formed in an underlayer of the film stack. However, when the resist layer is selected from a polymer, and the underlayer is formed from complex metallic or amorphous compounds, undercuts can form at the interface of the resist layer and the underlayer. Conventional approaches to improving selectivity may involve multiple depositions of the resist layer, or improvements to the structure of the polymer of each of the resist layers. The conventional approach method, however, may require changes to the composition of the photoresist depending on the size of a feature intended to be patterned.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the methods disclosed herein, a metal oxide is formed in patterned photoresist layer. A methyl-containing material is introduced into a semiconductor processing chamber having a film stack disposed therein. The methyl-containing material can also include one of aluminum, hafnium or zirconium. The film stack, in one example, includes a substrate, an underlayer disposed on the substrate, and the patterned photoresist layer disposed on the underlayer. The film stack, and thus the patterned photoresist layer is heated, and the methyl-containing material is absorbed into the patterned photoresist layer. Subsequently, the processing environment is purged, and the film stack is exposed to an oxidizing agent, such as H<sub>2</sub>O. The oxidizing agent is heated under pressure and may form water or water vapor on the film stack. The oxidizing agent is absorbed into the patterned photoresist layer and oxidizes the absorbed methyl-containing material. Upon oxidation, the methyl-containing material forms a metal oxide in the patterned photoresist layer. When the methyl-containing material is a tri-methylaluminum (TMA) precursor that is introduced into the processing environment, and subsequently purged and pumped, H<sub>2</sub>O is introduced into the processing environment in a single pre-etch process, i.e., without repeatedly introducing TMA prior to oxidizing and etching the film stack. The pre-etch process includes any one or all of the processes of the disclosed method (discussed in detail below) prior to etching of the film stack. Beneficially, a single pre-etch process enables the metal oxide to infiltrate into the photoresist layer between about 20 nm and about 40 nm. Furthermore, the metal oxide is cross-linked throughout the entire thickness of patterned photoresist. Repeating one or all of the pre-etch processes, prior to etching the film stack, halts the infiltration of the methyl-containing material, and thus halts the infiltration of the metal oxide throughout the thickness of the photoresist layer. In some examples disclosed herein, the entire method, i.e., a full cycle that includes the pre-etch process and etching of the film stack, can then be repeated.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The method disclose herein is independent of feature size. Advantageously, infiltration of the metal oxide into the underlayer can achieve a change in critical dimension of less than 1 nm, and the line width roughness is changed by less than 0.4 nm. Accordingly, the method of infiltration of the metal oxide into the polymer ensures that the metal oxide does not infiltrate into the underlayer, by controlling the properties of the photoresist layer, including density, with respect to the properties of the underlayer. For example, the photoresist can be selected from a low density carbonyl group material, and the uderlayer selected from a high density material, such as silicon, geramium, gallium, or derivatives thereof, including each of the materials disclosed in paragraph [0040], infra.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic sectional view of a processing chamber <b>100</b>, such as dual load lock chamber.

One example of the processing chamber that may be adapted to benefit from the disclosure is a CENTRIS&#xae; Sym3&#x2122; etching processing chamber, available from Applied Materials, Inc., located in Santa Clara, Calif. The processing chamber can also be configured for deposition, particularly atomic layer deposition (ALD). One example of an ALD tool is an iSprint&#x2122; ALD/CVD SSW chamber configured with the Centura&#xae;, or Endura&#xae; systems.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The processing chamber <b>100</b> includes an upper chamber volume <b>120</b> for transferring and processing a substrate <b>138</b>, and a lower chamber volume <b>110</b> for transferring a substrate <b>138</b>.

Each of the lower and upper chamber volumes <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> may be selectively connectable to two adjacent external environments (i.e., a factory interface and transfer chamber, both not shown) through two openings configured for substrate transferring.

The ESC <b>134</b> is configured to perform in the temperature range desired by the thermal budget of the device being fabricated on the substrate <b>138</b>. For example, the ESC <b>134</b> may be configured to maintain the substrate <b>138</b> at a temperature of about &#x2212;25 degrees Celsius to about 150 degrees Celsius, such as between about 50 degrees Celsius and about 100 degrees Celsius.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The cooling base <b>136</b> is provided to assist in controlling the temperature of the substrate <b>138</b>.

The methyl-containing material is provided to the processing volume (e.g., upper chamber volume <b>120</b>) at a high pressure. In one example, the methyl-containing material <b>306</b> is a gas that includes tri-methylaluminum (TMA). Alternatively, the methyl-containing material <b>306</b> can be provided as a vapor or liquid, which can be provided to the processing volume. In one example, the vapor or liquid includes (TEMAZr) or (TEMAHf). The methyl-containing material <b>306</b> is provided to the upper chamber volume <b>120</b> at a predetermined temperature, pressure, and time. The methyl-containing material <b>306</b> includes aluminum atoms <b>308</b>, hydrogen atoms <b>310</b>, and carbon atoms <b>312</b>. In one example, methyl-containing material <b>306</b> is provided to the upper chamber volume <b>120</b> at the high pressure for a predetermined time and temperature. For example, the pressure can be from about 100 mTorr to about 10 Torr, such as about 1 Torr to about 10 Torr, or between about 3 Torr and about 7 Torr. The predetermined time is between about 1 second to about 45 seconds, such as between about 10 seconds and 30 seconds.

For example, the heat provided into the upper chamber volume <b>120</b> enables the methyl-containing material <b>306</b> to diffuse into the patterned layers <b>304</b> of the photoresist layer <b>302</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>. The heat also enables gaps or space to be formed between polymers <b>314</b> which the methyl-containing material <b>306</b> infiltrates when under pressure. For simplicity, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> only illustrates one patterned layer <b>304</b> in the film stack <b>300</b>. Polymers <b>314</b> within the photoresist layer <b>302</b> are sufficiently dispersed to enable the methyl-containing material <b>306</b> to diffuse through a top surface <b>316</b> of the photoresist layer <b>302</b>, enabling the methyl-containing material <b>306</b> to occupy space between polymers <b>314</b>.

Accordingly, the methyl-containing material <b>306</b> is confined between the top surface <b>316</b> and a bottom surface <b>318</b> of the photoresist layer <b>302</b>. Otherwise stated, the methyl-containing material <b>306</b> is absorbed and evenly dispersed throughout a thickness of the photoresist layer <b>302</b>, the thickness defined as a distance between the top surface <b>316</b> and a bottom surface <b>318</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The processing volume is purged of the methyl-containing material at operation <b>206</b>. For example, a purge gas is introduced into the upper chamber volume <b>120</b> for about 20 seconds. After about 20 seconds, the flow of the purge gas is stopped and the purge gas, along with any residual methyl-containing material <b>306</b>, is evacuated from the upper chamber volume <b>120</b> using one or more dedicated vacuum pumps for about 20 seconds. The one or more dedicated vacuum pumps (not shown) are part of a vacuum pump system (not shown), in one example. The purge gas is a non-reactive gas, which can be N<sub>2 </sub>in one example. In another example, the purge gas is a chemically inert gas, such as Ar or He Purging enables a top surface <b>316</b> of the photoresist layer <b>302</b> to be substantially free of the methyl-containing material <b>306</b> in preparation for oxidation at operation <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>D-<b>3</b>E</figref> illustrate oxidation of the film stack, as described in operation <b>208</b>. An oxidizing agent <b>320</b>, containing oxygen atoms <b>322</b> and hydrogen atoms <b>310</b>, is introduced into the upper chamber volume <b>120</b>. In one example, the oxidizing agent <b>320</b> is water, which can be provided to the upper chamber volume <b>120</b> as a liquid or gas, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>.

The by-product gas <b>328</b> diffuses out of the photoresist layer <b>302</b> passing through the surfaces of the pattered layers <b>304</b>, including the top surface <b>316</b>. There is substantially no diffusion of the by-product gas <b>328</b> through the underlayer <b>301</b>, since the top surface <b>316</b> of the photoresist layer <b>302</b> is in contact with the upper chamber volume <b>120</b>, and a material included in the underlayer <b>301</b> is denser than any gases within the upper chamber volume <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the methyl-containing material <b>306</b> is TMA, alumina (AlO<sub>x</sub>) is the metal oxide <b>324</b> created, and the by-product gas <b>328</b> is methane. In one example, the AlO<sub>x </sub>can be Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O, AlO<sub>2</sub>, or AlO. Alternatively, if the methyl-containing material <b>306</b> is TEMAZr, oxidation causes the metal oxide <b>324</b> to form as ZrOx, such as ZrO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO, in the photoresist layer <b>302</b>. When the methyl-containing material <b>306</b> is TEMAHf, oxidizing the methyl-containing material <b>306</b> produces HfOx, such as is HfO<sub>2</sub>, in the photoresist layer <b>302</b>. A concentration of the metal oxide <b>324</b> is between about 30 percent and about 60 percent of the volume of the photoresist layer <b>302</b>. TEMAZr and TEMAHf infiltrate photoresist layer <b>302</b>, but do not infiltrate throughout the thickness of the photoresist layer <b>302</b>, as compared to TMA. TEMAZr and TEMAHf infiltrate closer to the top surface <b>316</b> of the photoresist layer <b>302</b>, forming a crust-like layer having TEMAZr and/or TEMAHf along with polymer <b>314</b> proximate the top surface <b>316</b>, and a layer of polymer <b>314</b> proximate the bottom surface <b>316</b>. For example, TEMAZr and TEMAHf can infiltrate into the photoresist layer <b>302</b> from about 0.05 nm to about 2 nm, such as about 1 nm or about 1.5 nm. As such, polymer <b>314</b> is formed throughout the remaining thickness of the photoresist layer <b>302</b>.

The oxidizing agent <b>320</b> is provided under pressure to the processing volume of the processing chamber, at the high pressure. For example, the oxidizing agent <b>320</b> can be provided to the upper chamber volume <b>120</b> (i.e., a processing volume) at a pressure between about 100 mTorr to about 10 Torr, such as about 1 Torr to about 10 Torr, or between about 3 Torr and about 7 Torr. A temperature at which the oxidizing agent <b>320</b> is provided to the processing volume is between about 50 C and about 100 C, such as between about 75 C and about 100 C.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one example, the predetermined time at which the oxidizing agent <b>320</b> is provided to the upper chamber volume <b>120</b> is between about 1 second and about 400 seconds, in one example. A hydrolysis reaction oxidizes the methyl-containing material in the photoresist layer for the predetermined time. In another example, the predetermined time is between about 240 seconds and about 350 seconds, such as about 270 second, or about 300 seconds, or about 330 seconds. The predetermined time ensures that the oxidation process <b>326</b> occurs between the entirety of the photoresist layer <b>302</b>, enabling metal oxide <b>324</b> to form uniformly dispersed between the top surface <b>316</b> and the bottom surface <b>318</b>. If the photoresist layer <b>302</b> is exposed to an oxidizing source for less than the predetermined time, a layer of alumina may form near the top surface <b>316</b> of the photoresist layer <b>302</b> without forming throughout the photoresist layer <b>302</b>, thus creating a layer of polymer <b>314</b> proximate the bottom surface <b>318</b>. If the photoresist layer <b>302</b> is exposed to an oxidizing source, such as oxidizing agent <b>320</b>, for less than the predetermined time, metal oxide <b>324</b> can concentrate at the top surface <b>316</b> of the mask creating a crust, despite the methyl-containing material <b>306</b> extending through a thickness of the photoresist layer <b>302</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref>, the metal oxide <b>324</b> formed at operation <b>208</b>, includes metal atoms <b>332</b> and oxygen atoms <b>322</b>.

Alternatively, when the methyl-containing material <b>306</b> is TEMAZr, the metal atoms <b>332</b> are zirconium, such that the metal oxide <b>324</b> formed is zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>x</sub>). In yet another example, when TEMAHf is the methyl-containing material <b>306</b>, the metal oxide <b>324</b> formed is hafnium oxide (HfO<sub>x</sub>), and the metal atoms <b>332</b> are hafnium.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">At operation <b>210</b>, the film stack having a treated patterned photoresist layer is etched. For example, the film stack <b>300</b> is exposed to etchants <b>330</b>, which can be a dry etch or a wet etch. In one example, the film stack <b>300</b> is exposed to etchants <b>330</b> from a plasma formed from any of the processing gases discussed above in paragraph [0033], such as a fluorine-containing gas, or a carbon-fluorine containing gas. When exposed to plasma, constituents from the processing gases, including ions, neutrons, protons, and radicals are created when the processing gases are disassociated by the application of an electric field created by the RF generator or DC power source, as detailed above.
