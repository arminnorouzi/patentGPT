The complement system is also involved in the maintenance of homeostasis by clearing immune complexes and apoptotic cells from the body. Complement components perform these functions by interacting in a cascading series of enzymatic processes and membrane binding events. The end result of these processes is the generation of products with lytic, immunoregulatory, and opsonic functions.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is widely known that the complement system can be divided into three distinct pathways: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway. Although the initiation of each pathway is distinct, all three pathways converge and share the same terminal complement components (C5 through C9), which is ultimately responsible for the destruction of the target cell.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The C1 complex is a large protein complex which functions as the key initiator of the classical pathway cascade. The C1 complex consists of three components, C1q, C1r and C1s, which are in molar ratio of 1:2:2 respectively (Non Patent Literature 1). The classical pathway is initiated when the C1 complex binds to a target that is bound by antibodies. C1q, which has 6 globular heads, mediates the binding of C1 complex to the antibodies by avidity interaction with the Fc regions. Once tightly bound to the target, C1r within the C1 complex autoactivates and become enzymatically active. The activated C1r then cleaves and activates proenzyme C1s within the C1 complex (Non Patent Literature 2). Subsequently, active C1s cleave its substrates complement component C2 and C4 into C2a/C2b, and C4a/C4b fragments respectively. This leads to the assembly of C4b2a, a C3 convertase, on the target surface which cleaves C3 to form C3b. C3b in turn cleaves C5 to initiate the formation of the terminal membrane attack complex, C5b, C6, C7, C8 and C9, which lyses the target via pore formation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">C1s forms homodimers in a calcium dependent manner (Non Patent Literature 3). It is reported that at 1 mM calcium ion concentration, the majority of C1s is in a dimeric state, whereas at 1 nM calcium concentration, it is mainly in monomeric state (Non Patent Literature 4). Within the circulation, C1s and C1r are mostly bound together as a calcium dependent C1r2s2 heterotetramer, which in turn reversibly binds to C1q at 1:1 ratio to form the C1 complex. In the absence or at low concentrations of calcium, the C1r2s2 tetramer dissociates into one C1r dimer and two C1s monomers (Non Patent Literature 5). C1s is a 79 kDa glycoprotein, with 5 to 6% of its mass attributable to glycosylation (Non Patent Literature 6). The concentration of C1s in serum is reported to be approximately 55 micro g/mL (0.7 micro M) (Non Patent Literature 7).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">While a properly functioning complement system defends the host against pathogens, dysregulation or inappropriate activation of the classical pathway results in a variety of complement-mediated disorders such as, and not limited to, autoimmune hemolytic anemias (AIHA), Behcet's disease, Bullous Pemphigus (BP), immune thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) etc. Therefore, inhibition of excessive or uncontrolled activation of the classical pathway can provide clinical benefit to patients with such disorders.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Antibodies are highly attractive pharmaceuticals as they are stable in plasma, highly specific for their target, and generally exhibit good pharmacokinetic profiles. However, due to their large molecular size, the dosage of therapeutic antibodies is usually high. In the case of targets that exist in high abundance, the required therapeutic dose of antibodies is even higher. As a result, methods that improve antibody pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antigen binding properties are attractive ways to reduce the dosage and high production costs associated with therapeutic antibodies.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Several prior reports have described anti-C1s antibodies. For example, Matsumoto et al. (1986) (Non Patent Literature 8) described three antibodies which bound to distinct epitopes on C1s. One clone exhibited preferential binding for the active form of C1s, whereas the other two bound to both proenzyme and active C1s. Of these two clones, only one was able to inhibit C2 and C4 cleavage by C1s. Patent Literature 1 described an antibody which inhibited C1s mediated cleavage of C4 but not C2. Additionally, Patent Literature 2 described several antibodies which bound to a conformational epitope on C1s with selectivity to active C1s compared to its proenzyme form. Patent Literature 3 described two clones of anti-C1s antibodies which were able to block C4 cleavage.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The affinity of an antibody for its antigen determines how efficiently the antibody can neutralize its target. Various affinity maturation methods (Non Patent Literature 9) are used to increase antibody affinity to reduce the required dose for therapeutic effect. However, the limitation is that one antibody molecule typically has two binding sites, and thus can only neutralize two targets (one antigen per binding site) after administration. Even if the antibody can bind the target with infinite affinity by covalent interaction, the maximum number of targets neutralized by the antibody remains capped at two.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It has been reported that antibodies that bind to an antigen in a pH-dependent manner (herein below also referred to as &#x201c;pH-dependent antibody&#x201d; or &#x201c;pH-dependent-binding antibody&#x201d;) enables a single antibody molecule to neutralize multiple antigen molecules (Non Patent Literature 10, Patent Literature 4). The pH-dependent antibody binds strongly to its antigen at neutral pH conditions in the plasma, but dissociates from the antigen under the acidic pH condition within the endosome of a cell. Once dissociated from the antigen, the antibody is recycled back to the plasma by FcRn receptors whereas the dissociated antigens are degraded within the lysosome of the cell. The recycled antibody is then free to bind to and neutralize antigen molecules again and this process continues to be repeated as long as the antibody remains in circulation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0011">[PTL 1] WO2014/071206</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0012">[PTL 2] WO2014/066744</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0013">[PTL 3] WO2014/186599</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0014">[PTL 4] WO2009/125825</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Non Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0015">[NPL 1] Wang et. al.

DEFINITIONS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0078">Unless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Singleton et al., Dictionary of Microbiology and Molecular Biology 2nd ed., J. Wiley &#x26; Sons (New York, N.Y. 1994), and March, Advanced Organic Chemistry Reactions, Mechanisms and Structure 4th ed., John Wiley &#x26; Sons (New York, N.Y. 1992), provide one skilled in the art with a general guide to many of the terms used in the present application. All references cited herein, including patent applications and publications, are incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0079">For purposes of interpreting this specification, the following definitions will apply and whenever appropriate, terms used in the singular will also include the plural and vice versa. It is to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting. In the event that any definition set forth below conflicts with any document incorporated herein by reference, the definition set forth below shall control.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0080">An &#x201c;acceptor human framework&#x201d; for the purposes herein is a framework comprising the amino acid sequence of a light chain variable domain (VL) framework or a heavy chain variable domain (VH) framework derived from a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework, as defined below. An acceptor human framework &#x201c;derived from&#x201d; a human immunoglobulin framework or a human consensus framework may comprise the same amino acid sequence thereof, or it may contain amino acid sequence changes. In some embodiments, the number of amino acid changes are 10 or less, 9 or less, 8 or less, 7 or less, 6 or less, 5 or less, 4 or less, 3 or less, or 2 or less. In some embodiments, the VL acceptor human framework is identical in sequence to the VL human immunoglobulin framework sequence or human consensus framework sequence.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0081">&#x201c;Affinity&#x201d; refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, &#x201c;binding affinity&#x201d; refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd or KD). Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Specific illustrative and exemplary embodiments for measuring binding affinity are described in the following. The term &#x201c;binding activity&#x201d; refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single or more binding sites of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Herein, binding activity is not strictly limited to an activity which reflects a 1:1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). When members of a binding pair can bind to each other in the manner of both monovalent and multivalent binding, binding activity is the strength of the sum total of these bindings. The binding activity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (KD). Alternatively, the association and dissociation rates (Kon and Koff) may be used for the assessment of binding. Binding activity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Specific illustrative and exemplary embodiments for measuring binding affinity are described in the following.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0082">An &#x201c;affinity matured&#x201d; antibody refers to an antibody with one or more alterations in one or more hypervariable regions (HVRs), compared to a parent antibody which does not possess such alterations, such alterations resulting in an improvement in the affinity of the antibody for antigen.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0083">The terms &#x201c;anti-C1s antibody&#x201d; and &#x201c;an antibody that binds to C1s&#x201d; refer to an antibody that is capable of binding Cis with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic agent in targeting C1s. In one embodiment, the extent of binding of an anti-C1s antibody to an unrelated, non-Cis protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to Cis as measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that binds to Cis has a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1 micro M or less, 100 nM or less, 10 nM or less, 1 nM or less, 0.1 nM or less, 0.01 nM or less, or 0.001 nM or less (e.g. 10<sup>&#x2212;8 </sup>M or less, e.g. from 10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup>M to 10<sup>&#x2212;13 </sup>M, e.g., from 10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>M to 10<sup>&#x2212;13 </sup>M). In certain embodiments, an anti-C1s antibody binds to an epitope of Cis that is conserved among C1s from different species.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0084">The term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; herein is used in the broadest sense and encompasses various antibody structures, including but not limited to monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g., bispecific antibodies), and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired antigen-binding activity.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0085">An &#x201c;antibody fragment&#x201d; refers to a molecule other than an intact antibody that comprises a portion of an intact antibody that binds the antigen to which the intact antibody binds. Examples of antibody fragments include but are not limited to Fv, Fab, Fab&#x2032;, Fab&#x2032;-SH, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules (e.g. scFv); and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0086">An &#x201c;antibody that binds to the same epitope&#x201d; as a reference antibody refers to an antibody that blocks binding of the reference antibody to its antigen in a competition assay by 50% or more, and conversely, the reference antibody blocks binding of the antibody to its antigen in a competition assay by 50% or more. An exemplary competition assay is provided herein.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0087">The term &#x201c;chimeric&#x201d; antibody refers to an antibody in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is derived from a particular source or species, while the remainder of the heavy and/or light chain is derived from a different source or species.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0088">The &#x201c;class&#x201d; of an antibody refers to the type of constant domain or constant region possessed by its heavy chain. There are five major classes of antibodies: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM, and several of these may be further divided into subclasses (isotypes), e.g., IgG<sub>1</sub>, IgG<sub>2</sub>, IgG<sub>3</sub>, IgG<sub>4</sub>, IgA<sub>1</sub>, and IgA<sub>2</sub>. The heavy chain constant domains that correspond to the different classes of immunoglobulins are called alpha, delta, epsilon, gamma, and mu, respectively.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0089">The term &#x201c;cytotoxic agent&#x201d; as used herein refers to a substance that inhibits or prevents a cellular function and/or causes cell death or destruction. Cytotoxic agents include, but are not limited to, radioactive isotopes (e.g., <sup>211</sup>At, <sup>131</sup>I, <sup>125</sup>I, <sup>90</sup>Y, <sup>186</sup>Re, <sup>188</sup>Re, <sup>153</sup>Sm, <sup>212</sup>Bi, <sup>32</sup>P, <sup>212</sup>Pb and radioactive isotopes of Lu); chemotherapeutic agents or drugs (e.g., methotrexate, adriamycin, <i>vinca </i>alkaloids (vincristine, vinblastine, etoposide), doxorubicin, melphalan, mitomycin C, chlorambucil, daunorubicin or other intercalating agents); growth inhibitory agents; enzymes and fragments thereof such as nucleolytic enzymes; antibiotics; toxins such as small molecule toxins or enzymatically active toxins of bacterial, fungal, plant or animal origin, including fragments and/or variants thereof; and the various antitumor or anticancer agents disclosed below.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0090">&#x201c;Effector functions&#x201d; refer to those biological activities attributable to the Fc region of an antibody, which vary with the antibody isotype. Examples of antibody effector functions include: C1q binding and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC); Fc receptor binding; antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC); phagocytosis; down regulation of cell surface receptors (e.g. B cell receptor); and B cell activation.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0091">An &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; of an agent, e.g., a pharmaceutical formulation, refers to an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary, to achieve the desired therapeutic or prophylactic result.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0092">The term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; includes any determinant capable of being bound by an antibody. An epitope is a region of an antigen that is bound by an antibody that targets that antigen, and includes specific amino acids that directly contact the antibody. Epitope determinants can include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl or sulfonyl groups, and can have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, and/or specific charge characteristics. Generally, antibodies specific for a particular target antigen will preferentially recognize an epitope on the target antigen in a complex mixture of proteins and/or macromolecules.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0093">The term &#x201c;Fc region&#x201d; herein is used to define a C-terminal region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain that contains at least a portion of the constant region. The term includes native sequence Fc regions and variant Fc regions. In one embodiment, a human IgG heavy chain Fc region extends from Cys226, or from Pro230, to the carboxyl-terminus of the heavy chain. However, the C-terminal lysine (Lys447) or glycine-lysine (residues 446-447) of the Fc region may or may not be present. Unless otherwise specified herein, numbering of amino acid residues in the Fc region or constant region is according to the EU numbering system, also called the EU index, as described in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., 1991.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0094">&#x201c;Framework&#x201d; or &#x201c;FR&#x201d; refers to variable domain residues other than hypervariable region (HVR) residues. The FR of a variable domain generally consists of four FR domains: FR1, FR2, FR3, and FR4. Accordingly, the HVR and FR sequences generally appear in the following sequence in VH (or VL): FR1-H1(L1)-FR2-H2(L2)-FR3-H3(L3)-FR4.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0095">The terms &#x201c;full length antibody,&#x201d; &#x201c;intact antibody,&#x201d; and &#x201c;whole antibody&#x201d; are used herein interchangeably to refer to an antibody having a structure substantially similar to a native antibody structure or having heavy chains that contain an Fc region as defined herein.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0096">The terms &#x201c;host cell,&#x201d; &#x201c;host cell line,&#x201d; and &#x201c;host cell culture&#x201d; are used interchangeably and refer to cells into which exogenous nucleic acid has been introduced, including the progeny of such cells. Host cells include &#x201c;transformants&#x201d; and &#x201c;transformed cells,&#x201d; which include the primary transformed cell and progeny derived therefrom without regard to the number of passages. Progeny may not be completely identical in nucleic acid content to a parent cell, but may contain mutations. Mutant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened or selected for in the originally transformed cell are included herein.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0097">A &#x201c;human antibody&#x201d; is one which possesses an amino acid sequence which corresponds to that of an antibody produced by a human or a human cell or derived from a non-human source that utilizes human antibody repertoires or other human antibody-encoding sequences. This definition of a human antibody specifically excludes a humanized antibody comprising non-human antigen-binding residues.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0098">A &#x201c;human consensus framework&#x201d; is a framework which represents the most commonly occurring amino acid residues in a selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH framework sequences. Generally, the selection of human immunoglobulin VL or VH sequences is from a subgroup of variable domain sequences. Generally, the subgroup of sequences is a subgroup as in Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Edition, NIH Publication 91-3242, Bethesda Md. (1991), vols. 1-3. In one embodiment, for the VL, the subgroup is subgroup kappa I as in Kabat et al., supra. In one embodiment, for the VH, the subgroup is subgroup III as in Kabat et al., supra.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0099">A &#x201c;humanized&#x201d; antibody refers to a chimeric antibody comprising amino acid residues from non-human HVRs and amino acid residues from human FRs. In certain embodiments, a humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the HVRs (e.g., CDRs) correspond to those of a non-human antibody, and all or substantially all of the FRs correspond to those of a human antibody. A humanized antibody optionally may comprise at least a portion of an antibody constant region derived from a human antibody.

In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations, which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. Thus, the modifier &#x201c;monoclonal&#x201d; indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including but not limited to the hybridoma method, recombinant DNA methods, phage-display methods, and methods utilizing transgenic animals containing all or part of the human immunoglobulin loci, such methods and other exemplary methods for making monoclonal antibodies being described herein.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0111">A &#x201c;naked antibody&#x201d; refers to an antibody that is not conjugated to a heterologous moiety (e.g., a cytotoxic moiety) or radiolabel.

For example, native IgG antibodies are heterotetrameric glycoproteins of about 150,000 daltons, composed of two identical light chains and two identical heavy chains that are disulfide-bonded. From N- to C-terminus, each heavy chain has a variable region (VH), also called a variable heavy domain or a heavy chain variable domain, followed by three constant domains (CH1, CH2, and CH3). Similarly, from N- to C-terminus, each light chain has a variable region (VL), also called a variable light domain or a light chain variable domain, followed by a constant light (CL) domain. The light chain of an antibody may be assigned to one of two types, called kappa and lambda, based on the amino acid sequence of its constant domain.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0113">The term &#x201c;package insert&#x201d; is used to refer to instructions customarily included in commercial packages of therapeutic products, that contain information about the indications, usage, dosage, administration, combination therapy, contraindications and/or warnings concerning the use of such therapeutic products.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0114">&#x201c;Percent (%) amino acid sequence identity&#x201d; with respect to a reference polypeptide sequence is defined as the percentage of amino acid residues in a candidate sequence that are identical with the amino acid residues in the reference polypeptide sequence, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve the maximum percent sequence identity, and not considering any conservative substitutions as part of the sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the skill in the art, for instance, using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN, Megalign (DNASTAR) software, or GENETYX (registered trademark) (Genetyx Co., Ltd.). Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for aligning sequences, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0115">The ALIGN-2 sequence comparison computer program was authored by Genentech, Inc., and the source code has been filed with user documentation in the U.S. Copyright Office, Washington D.C., 20559, where it is registered under U.S. Copyright Registration No. TXU510087.

The ALIGN-2 program should be compiled for use on a UNIX operating system, including digital UNIX V4.0D. All sequence comparison parameters are set by the ALIGN-2 program and do not vary. In situations where ALIGN-2 is employed for amino acid sequence comparisons, the % amino acid sequence identity of a given amino acid sequence A to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B (which can alternatively be phrased as a given amino acid sequence A that has or comprises a certain % amino acid sequence identity to, with, or against a given amino acid sequence B) is calculated as follows:</p><p id="p-0056" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>100 times the fraction X/Y<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0057" num="0000">where X is the number of amino acid residues scored as identical matches by the sequence alignment program ALIGN-2 in that program's alignment of A and B, and where Y is the total number of amino acid residues in B.

For example, antibodies with the above-described property can be obtained by producing a large number of antibodies whose sequences are different from each other by a hybridoma method or an antibody library method, and measuring their antigen binding activities at different ion concentrations. The B cell cloning method is one of examples of methods of screening for such antibodies. Furthermore, as described below, at least one distinctive amino acid residue that can confer an antibody with the property of having an antigen-binding activity that changes according to the ion concentration is specified, to prepare as a library of a large number of antibodies that have different sequences while sharing the distinctive amino acid residues as a common structure. Such a library can be screened to efficiently isolate antibodies that have the property described above.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0330">In one aspect, the invention provides an antibody that binds to C1s with a higher affinity at neutral pH than at acidic pH.

This is due to the recycling of the antigen-antibody complex by FcRn through the endosomal pathway in cell (Roopenian and Akilesh (2007) Nat Rev Immunol 7(9): 715-725). However, an antibody with pH-dependent binding characteristics, which binds to its antigen in neutral extracellular environment while releasing the antigen into acidic endosomal compartments following its entry into cells, is expected to have superior properties in terms of antigen neutralization and clearance relative to its counterpart that binds in a pH-independent manner (Igawa et al (2010) Nature Biotechnol 28(11); 1203-1207; Devanaboyina et al (2013) mAbs 5(6): 851-859; International Patent Application Publication No: WO 2009/125825).</p><p id="p-0132" num="0336">In one aspect, the invention provides an antibody that binds to C1s with a higher affinity under a high calcium concentration condition than under a low calcium concentration condition.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0337">In the present invention, preferred metal ions include, for example, calcium ion. Calcium ion is involved in modulation of many biological phenomena, including contraction of muscles such as skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscles; activation of movement, phagocytosis, and the like of leukocytes; activation of shape change, secretion, and the like of platelets; activation of lymphocytes; activation of mast cells including secretion of histamine; cell responses mediated by catecholamine alpha receptor or acetylcholine receptor; exocytosis; release of transmitter substances from neuron terminals; and axoplasmic flow in neurons. Known intracellular calcium ion receptors include troponin C, calmodulin, parvalbumin, and myosin light chain, which have several calcium ion-binding sites and are believed to be derived from a common origin in terms of molecular evolution. There are also many known calcium-binding motifs. Such well-known motifs include, for example, cadherin domains, EF-hand of calmodulin, C2 domain of Protein kinase C, Gla domain of blood coagulation protein Factor IX, C-type lectins of acyaroglycoprotein receptor and mannose-binding receptor, A domains of LDL receptors, annexin, thrombospondin type 3 domain, and EGF-like domains.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0338">In the present invention, when the metal ion is calcium ion, it is desirable that the antigen-binding activity is lower under a low calcium ion concentration condition than under a high calcium ion concentration condition. Meanwhile, the intracellular calcium ion concentration is lower than the extracellular calcium ion concentration. Conversely, the extracellular calcium ion concentration is higher than the intracellular calcium ion concentration. In the present invention, the low calcium ion concentration is preferably 0.1 micromolar (micro M) to 30 micro M, more preferably 0.5 micro M to 10 micro M, and particularly preferably 1 micro M to 5 micro M which is close to the calcium ion concentration in the early endosome in vivo. Meanwhile, in the present invention, the high calcium ion concentration is preferably 100 micro M to 10 micro M, more preferably 200 micro M to 5 mM, and particularly preferably 0.5 mM to 2.5 mM which is close to the calcium ion concentration in plasma (in blood). In the present invention, it is preferable that the low calcium ion concentration is the calcium ion concentration in endosomes, and the high calcium ion concentration is the calcium ion concentration in plasma. When the level of antigen-binding activity is compared between low and high calcium ion concentrations, it is preferable that the binding of antibodies of the present invention is stronger at a high calcium ion concentration than at a low calcium ion concentration. In other words, it is preferable that the antigen-binding activity of an antibody of the present invention is lower at a low calcium ion concentration ion than at a high calcium ion concentration. When the level of binding activity is expressed with the dissociation constant (KD), the value of KD (low calcium ion concentration)/KD (high calcium ion concentration) is greater than 1, preferably 2 or more, still more preferably 10 or more, and yet more preferably 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 200, 400, 1000, 10000 or more. The upper limit of the value of KD (low calcium ion concentration)/KD (high calcium ion concentration) is not particularly limited, and may be any value such as 100, 400, 1000, or 10000, as long as it can be produced with the techniques of skilled artisans. It is possible to use the dissociation rate constant (kd) instead of KD. When it is difficult to calculate the KD value, the activity may be assessed based on the level of binding response in Biacore when analytes are passed at the same concentration. When antigens are passed over a chip immobilized with antigen-binding molecules of the present invention, the binding response at a low calcium concentration is preferably &#xbd; or less of the binding response at a high calcium concentration, more preferably &#x2153; or less, still more preferably &#x2155; or less, and particularly preferably 1/10 or less. It is known that in general the in vivo extracellular calcium ion concentration (for example, in plasma) is high, and the intracellular calcium ion concentration (for example, in the endosome) is low. Thus, in the present invention, it is preferable that the extracellular condition is a high calcium ion concentration, and the intracellular condition is a low calcium ion concentration. When the property that the antigen-binding activity is lower under an intracellular calcium ion concentration condition than under an extracellular calcium ion concentration condition is conferred to an antigen-binding molecule (e.g., an antibody) of the present invention, antigens that have bound to the antigen-binding molecule of the present invention outside of the cell dissociate from the antigen-binding molecule of the present invention inside the cell, thereby enhancing antigen incorporation into the cell from the outside of the cell. Such antibodies, when administered to the living body, can reduce antigen concentration in plasma and reduce the physiological activity of antigens in vivo. Thus, antibodies of the present invention are useful. Methods of screening for antigen-binding domains or antibodies having a lower antigen-binding activity under a low calcium ion concentration condition than under a high calcium ion concentration condition include, for example, the method described in WO2012/073992 (for example, paragraphs 0200-0213). Methods for conferring antigen-binding domains of the present invention with the property of binding more weakly to antigens under a low calcium ion concentration condition than under a high calcium ion concentration condition are not particularly limited, and may be carried out by any methods. Specifically, the methods are described in Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-218006 and include, for example, methods for substituting at least one amino acid residue in an antigen-binding domain with an amino acid residue having metal chelating activity, and/or inserting into an antigen-binding domain at least one amino acid residue having metal chelating activity. Antigen-binding molecules of the present invention in which at least one amino acid residue of the antigen-binding domain has been substituted with an amino acid residue having metal chelating activity and/or at least one amino acid residue having metal chelating activity has been inserted into the antigen-binding domain are a preferred embodiment of antigen-binding molecules of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0339">Amino acid residues having metal chelating activity preferably include, for example, serine, threonine, asparagine, glutamine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid. Furthermore, amino acid residues that change the antigen-binding activity of antigen binding domains according to the calcium ion concentration preferably include, for example, amino acid residues that form a calcium-binding motif. Calcium-binding motifs are well known to those skilled in the art, and have been described in detail (for example, Springer et al., (Cell (2000) 102, 275-277); Kawasaki and Kretsinger (Protein Prof. (1995) 2, 305-490); Moncrief et al., (J.

The location of such amino acid residues in the antigen-binding domain is not particularly limited, and they may be located at any position as long as the antigen binding activity changes according to the calcium ion concentration. Meanwhile, such amino acid residues may be contained alone or in combination of two or more, as long as the antigen binding activity changes according to the calcium ion concentration. The amino acid residues preferably include, for example, serine, threonine, asparagine, glutamine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid. When an antigen-binding domain is an antibody variable region, the amino acid residues may be contained in the heavy chain variable region and/or the light chain variable region. In a preferred embodiment, the amino acid residues may be contained in the CDR3 of the heavy chain variable region, more preferably at positions 95, 96, 100a, and/or 101 according to Kabat numbering in the CDR3 of the heavy chain variable region.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0341">In another preferred embodiment, the amino acid residues may be contained in the CDR1 of the light chain variable region, more preferably at positions 30, 31, and/or 32 according to Kabat numbering in the CDR1 of the light chain variable region.

The KD of an antibody refers to the equilibrium dissociation constant of an antibody-antigen interaction. The greater the KD value is for an antibody binding to its antigen, the weaker its binding affinity is for that particular antigen. Accordingly, as used herein, the expression &#x201c;higher affinity at neutral pH than at acidic pH&#x201d; (or the equivalent expression &#x201c;pH-dependent binding&#x201d;) means that the KD of the antibody at acidic pH is greater than the KD of the antibody at neutral pH. For example, in the context of the present invention, an antibody is considered to bind to C1s with higher affinity at neutral pH than at acidic pH if the KD of the antibody binding to C1s at acidic pH is at least 2 times greater than the KD of the antibody binding to C1s at neutral pH. Thus, the present invention includes antibodies that bind to C1s at acidic pH with a KD that is at least 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 200, 400, 1000, 10000, or more times greater than the KD of the antibody binding to C1s at neutral pH.

An increase in kd value signifies weaker binding of an antibody to its antigen.

In certain embodiments, such an antibody refers to an antibody with one or more alterations in one or more hypervariable regions (HVRs), compared to a parent antibody which does not possess such alterations, such alterations resulting in an improvement in the ECM binding activity of the antibody for antigen, i.e. reducing the ECM binding activity.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0362">The method for measuring &#x201c;extracellular matrix-binding&#x201d; is not particularly limited, and measurements can be carried out using an ELISA system that detects binding between a polypeptide and extracellular matrix by adding the polypeptide to an extracellular matrix-immobilized plate, and adding a labeled antibody against the polypeptide. In particular, a measurement method using the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) method is preferred since it enables detection of extracellular matrix-binding ability with higher sensitivity. Specifically, a mixture of polypeptide and ruthenium antibody is added to an extracellular matrix-immobilized plate, and the binding between the polypeptide and extracellular matrix can be measured using an ECL system that measures the electrochemiluminescence of ruthenium. The concentration of polypeptide added can be arbitrarily set, and it is preferable to add high concentrations to increase the detection sensitivity of extracellular matrix binding. While the extracellular matrix used in the present invention may be plant-derived or animal-derived as long as it contains glycoproteins such as collagen, proteoglycans, fibronectin, laminin, entactin, fibrin, and perlecan, animal-derived extracellular matrix is preferred in the present invention; and for example, extracellular matrix derived from animals such as humans, mice, rats, monkeys, rabbits, and dogs can be used. In particular, for monitoring the improvement of plasmacokinetics in humans, naturally-occurring human extracellular matrices derived from humans are preferred. Furthermore, the condition for evaluating the binding of polypeptides to extracellular matrix is desirably in a neutral range near pH 7.4 (physiological condition), but it does not necessarily have to be in the neutral range, and evaluation may also be performed in the acidic range (near pH 6.0). Furthermore, when evaluating the binding of a polypeptide to extracellular matrix, an antigen molecule bound by the polypeptide can be made to coexist for evaluation of the binding of the polypeptide/antigen molecule complex to the extracellular matrix.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0363">In some embodiments, whether or not non-specific binding activity at acidic pH of the antibody will be reduced, can be measured by using, for example, ELISA or ECL. In further embodiments, in an isolated anti-C1s antibody of the present invention, the value of ECM binding may be compared between the parent antibody (i.e., the original antibody before D, E, K, R and/or Q substitution) and an antibody into which one or more amino acid substitutions (D, E, K, R and/or Q) have been introduced with respect to the original (parent) antibody, provided that the antibody comprises at least one histidine in the variable region. The original (parent) antibody may be any known or newly isolated antibody as long as it specifically binds to C1s. Thus, in one aspect, in an isolated anti-C1s antibody of the present invention, the value of the ECM binding of the substituted antibody is at least 1.2 times, 1.4 times, 1.6 times, 1.8 times, 2 times, 2.5 times, 3 times, 3.5 times, 4 times, 5 times, 8 times, 10 times lower than the value of the ECM bindng of the original (parent) antibody.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0364">Without being bounded by a particular theory, a histidine residue in the antibody can interact with various residues surrounding the histidine residue in the antibody. Such interaction can affect the structure of the antibody or the conformation of the CDRs. Histidine becomes protonated and positively charged at the acidic pH. Introduction of positively charged residue, such as arginine or lysine, at the position surrounding the histidine can cause repulsion between the positively charged residue and the protonated histidine at acidic pH, and thus induce structural or conformational change of the antibody or the CDRs. Similarly, introduction of negatively charged residue, such as aspartic acid or glutamic acid, at the position surrounding the histidine can cause interaction between the negatively charged residue and the protonated histidine at acidic pH, and thus induce structural or conformational change of the antibody or the CDRs. These structural or conformational changes of the antibody or the CDRs that occur at acidic pH can affect the antigen binding of the antibody, and reduce the binding affinity of the antibody to an antigen at acidic pH. In summary, introduction of charged residue (such as arginine, lysine, aspartic acid or glutamic acid) at the position surrounding the histidine residue in an antibody can reduce the binding affinity of the antibody to the antigen at acidic pH, and thus improve the pH dependency of antibody-antigen interaction in a unique mechanism.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0365">In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for increasing the ratio of the KD value for antigen-binding activity of an antibody at acidic pH to the KD value for antigen-binding activity at neutral pH (KD(acidic pH)/KD(neutral pH)), comprising<ul id="ul0027" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0027-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0028" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0028-0001" num="0366">1) providing an antibody with pH dependency comprising at least one histidine in the variable region,</li>        <li id="ul0028-0002" num="0367">2) substituting at least one amino acid at the variable region of the antibody with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of D, E, K, R, Q and H.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0158" num="0368">In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for enhancing the clearance of (or removing) an antigen from plasma, comprising<ul id="ul0029" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0029-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0030" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0030-0001" num="0369">1) providing an antibody with pH dependency comprising at least one histidine in the variable region,</li>        <li id="ul0030-0002" num="0370">2) substituting at least one amino acid at the variable region of the antibody with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of D, E, K, R, Q and H.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0159" num="0371">In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for facilitating antigen-binding molecule-mediated antigen uptake into a cell, comprising<ul id="ul0031" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0031-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0032" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0032-0001" num="0372">1) providing an antibody with pH dependency comprising at least one histidine in the variable region,</li>        <li id="ul0032-0002" num="0373">2) substituting at least one amino acid at the variable region of the antibody with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of D, E, K, R, Q and H.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0160" num="0374">In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for increasing the number of antigens to while a single antigen-binding molecule can bind, comprising<ul id="ul0033" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0033-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0034" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0034-0001" num="0375">1) providing an antibody with pH dependency comprising at least one histidine in the variable region,</li>        <li id="ul0034-0002" num="0376">2) substituting at least one amino acid at the variable region of the antibody with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of D, E, K, R, Q and H.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0161" num="0377">In one aspect, the present invention provides a method for augmenting the ability of an antigen-binding molecule to eliminate an antigen from plasma, comprising<ul id="ul0035" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0035-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0036" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0036-0001" num="0378">1) providing an antibody with pH dependency comprising at least one histidine in the variable region,</li>        <li id="ul0036-0002" num="0379">2) substituting at least one amino acid at the variable region of the antibody with an amino acid selected from the group consisting of D, E, K, R, Q and H.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0162" num="0380">In certain embodiments, in the above-mentioned method of the present invention, the distance between the histidine residue comprised at the variable region and the substituted amino acid (i.e, D, E, K, R, Q, or H) is less than 20 angstrom, 18 angstrom, 16 angstrom, 14 angstrom, 12 angstrom, 10 angstrom, 8 angstrom, 6 angstrom, 4 angstrom, or 2 angstrom.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0381">In one aspect, the invention provides a method of enhancing the clearance of C1s from plasma in an individual.

In one embodiment, an RIA is performed with the Fab version of an antibody of interest and its antigen. For example, solution binding affinity of Fabs for antigen is measured by equilibrating Fab with a minimal concentration of (<sup>125</sup>I)-labeled antigen in the presence of a titration series of unlabeled antigen, then capturing bound antigen with an anti-Fab antibody-coated plate (see, e.g., Chen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881(1999)). To establish conditions for the assay, MICROTITER (registered trademark) multi-well plates (Thermo Scientific) are coated overnight with 5 micro g/ml of a capturing anti-Fab antibody (Cappel Labs) in 50 mM sodium carbonate (pH 9.6), and subsequently blocked with 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for two to five hours at room temperature (approximately 23 degrees C.). In a non-adsorbent plate (Nunc #269620), 100 pM or 26 pM [<sup>125</sup>I]-antigen are mixed with serial dilutions of a Fab of interest (e.g., consistent with assessment of the anti-VEGF antibody, Fab-12, in Presta et al., Cancer Res. 57:4593-4599 (1997)). The Fab of interest is then incubated overnight; however, the incubation may continue for a longer period (e.g., about 65 hours) to ensure that equilibrium is reached. Thereafter, the mixtures are transferred to the capture plate for incubation at room temperature (e.g., for one hour). The solution is then removed and the plate washed eight times with 0.1% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20 (registered trademark)) in PBS. When the plates have dried, 150 micro L/well of scintillant (MICROSCINT-20&#x2122;; Packard) is added, and the plates are counted on a TOPCOUNT&#x2122; gamma counter (Packard) for ten minutes. Concentrations of each Fab that give less than or equal to 20% of maximal binding are chosen for use in competitive binding assays.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0434">According to another embodiment, Kd is measured using a BIACORE (registered trademark) surface plasmon resonance assay. For example, an assay using a BIACORE (registered trademark)-2000 or a BIACORE(registered trademark)-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) is performed at 25 degrees C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at approximately 10 response units (RU). In one embodiment, carboxymethylated dextran biosensor chips (CM5, BIACORE, Inc.) are activated with N-ethyl-N&#x2032;-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) according to the supplier's instructions. Antigen is diluted with 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, to 5 micro g/ml (approximately 0.2 micro M) before injection at a flow rate of 5 micro L/minute to achieve approximately 10 response units (RU) of coupled protein. Following the injection of antigen, 1 M ethanolamine is injected to block unreacted groups. For kinetics measurements, two-fold serial dilutions of Fab (0.78 nM to 500 nM) are injected in PBS with 0.05% polysorbate 20 (TWEEN-20&#x2122;) surfactant (PBST) at 25 degrees C. at a flow rate of approximately 25 micro L/min. Association rates (k<sub>on</sub>) and dissociation rates (koff) are calculated using a simple one-to-one Langmuir binding model (BIACORE (registered trademark) Evaluation Software version 3.2) by simultaneously fitting the association and dissociation sensorgrams. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) is calculated as the ratio k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>. See, e.g., Chen et al., J. Mol. Biol. 293:865-881 (1999). If the on-rate exceeds 10<sup>6 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>s<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>by the surface plasmon resonance assay above, then the on-rate can be determined by using a fluorescent quenching technique that measures the increase or decrease in fluorescence emission intensity (excitation=295 nm; emission=340 nm, 16 nm band-pass) at 25 degrees C. of a 20 nM anti-antigen antibody (Fab form) in PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of increasing concentrations of antigen as measured in a spectrometer, such as a stop-flow equipped spectrophotometer (Aviv Instruments) or a 8000-series SLM-AMINCO&#x2122; spectrophotometer (ThermoSpectronic) with a stirred cuvette.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0435">In some enbodiments, the binding affinity of each histidine-substituted variant of the instant invention at pH 7.4 and pH 5.8 is determined at 37 degrees C. using Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare).

Human antibodies can be produced using various techniques known in the art. Human antibodies are described generally in van Dijk and van de Winkel, Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 5: 368-74 (2001) and Lonberg, Curr. Opin. Immunol. 20:450-459 (2008).</p><p id="p-0212" num="0451">Human antibodies may be prepared by administering an immunogen to a transgenic animal that has been modified to produce intact human antibodies or intact antibodies with human variable regions in response to antigenic challenge. Such animals typically contain all or a portion of the human immunoglobulin loci, which replace the endogenous immunoglobulin loci, or which are present extrachromosomally or integrated randomly into the animal's chromosomes. In such transgenic mice, the endogenous immunoglobulin loci have generally been inactivated. For review of methods for obtaining human antibodies from transgenic animals, see Lonberg, Nat. Biotech. 23:1117-1125 (2005). See also, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,075,181 and 6,150,584 describing XENOMOUSE&#x2122; technology; U.S. Pat.

Human variable regions from intact antibodies generated by such animals may be further modified, e.g., by combining with a different human constant region.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0452">Human antibodies can also be made by hybridoma-based methods. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines for the production of human monoclonal antibodies have been described. (See, e.g., Kozbor J. Immunol., 133: 3001 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, pp. 51-63 (Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1987); and Boerner et al., J. Immunol., 147: 86 (1991).) Human antibodies generated via human B-cell hybridoma technology are also described in Li et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 103:3557-3562 (2006). Additional methods include those described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,189,826 (describing production of monoclonal human IgM antibodies from hybridoma cell lines) and Ni, Xiandai Mianyixue, 26(4):265-268 (2006) (describing human-human hybridomas). Human hybridoma technology (Trioma technology) is also described in Vollmers and Brandlein, Histology and Histopathology, 20(3):927-937 (2005) and Vollmers and Brandlein, Methods and Findings in Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology, 27(3):185-91 (2005).</p><p id="p-0214" num="0453">Human antibodies may also be generated by isolating Fv clone variable domain sequences selected from human-derived phage display libraries.

Library-Derived Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0215" num="0454">Antibodies of the invention may be isolated by screening combinatorial libraries for antibodies with the desired activity or activities. For example, a variety of methods are known in the art for generating phage display libraries and screening such libraries for antibodies possessing the desired binding characteristics. Such methods are reviewed, e.g., in Hoogenboom et al. in Methods in Molecular Biology 178:1-37 (O'Brien et al., ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J., 2001) and further described, e.g., in the McCafferty et al., Nature 348:552-554; Clackson et al., Nature 352: 624-628 (1991); Marks et al., J.

Rev. Immunol., 12: 433-455 (1994). Phages typically display antibody fragments, either as single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments or as Fab fragments. Libraries from immunized sources provide high-affinity antibodies to the immunogen without the requirement of constructing hybridomas. Alternatively, the naive repertoire can be cloned (e.g., from human) to provide a single source of antibodies to a wide range of non-self and also self antigens without any immunization as described by Griffiths et al., EMBO J, 12: 725-734 (1993). Finally, naive libraries can also be made synthetically by cloning unrearranged V-gene segments from stem cells, and using PCR primers containing random sequence to encode the highly variable CDR3 regions and to accomplish rearrangement in vitro, as described by Hoogenboom and Winter, J. Mol. Biol., 227: 381-388 (1992). Patent publications describing human antibody phage libraries include, for example: U.S. Pat.

Multispecific Antibodies</heading><p id="p-0218" num="0457">In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is a multispecific antibody, e.g. a bispecific antibody. Multispecific antibodies are monoclonal antibodies that have binding specificities for at least two different sites. In certain embodiments, one of the binding specificities is for C1s and the other is for any other antigen. In certain embodiments, bispecific antibodies may bind to two different epitopes of C1s. Bispecific antibodies may also be used to localize cytotoxic agents to cells which express C1s. Bispecific antibodies can be prepared as full length antibodies or antibody fragments.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0458">Techniques for making multispecific antibodies include, but are not limited to, recombinant co-expression of two immunoglobulin heavy chain-light chain pairs having different specificities (see Milstein and Cuello, Nature 305: 537 (1983)), WO 93/08829, and Traunecker et al., EMBO J. 10: 3655 (1991)), and &#x201c;knob-in-hole&#x201d; engineering (see, e.g., U.S. Pat.

Multi-specific antibodies may also be made by engineering electrostatic steering effects for making antibody Fc-heterodimeric molecules (WO 2009/089004A1); cross-linking two or more antibodies or fragments (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,676,980, and Brennan et al., Science, 229: 81 (1985)); using leucine zippers to produce bi-specific antibodies (see, e.g., Kostelny et al., J.

For example, it may be desirable to improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody. Amino acid sequence variants of an antibody may be prepared by introducing appropriate modifications into the nucleotide sequence encoding the antibody, or by peptide synthesis. Such modifications include, for example, deletions from, and/or insertions into and/or substitutions of residues within the amino acid sequences of the antibody. Any combination of deletion, insertion, and substitution can be made to arrive at the final construct, provided that the final construct possesses the desired characteristics, e.g., antigen-binding.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0462">a) Substitution, Insertion, and Deletion Variants</p><p id="p-0224" num="0463">In certain embodiments, antibody variants having one or more amino acid substitutions are provided.

Generally, the resulting variant(s) selected for further study will have modifications (e.g., improvements) in certain biological properties (e.g., increased affinity, reduced immunogenicity) relative to the parent antibody and/or will have substantially retained certain biological properties of the parent antibody. An exemplary substitutional variant is an affinity matured antibody, which may be conveniently generated, e.g., using phage display-based affinity maturation techniques such as those described herein. Briefly, one or more HVR residues are mutated and the variant antibodies displayed on phage and screened for a particular biological activity (e.g. binding affinity).</p><p id="p-0228" num="0473">Alterations (e.g., substitutions) may be made in HVRs, e.g., to improve antibody affinity. Such alterations may be made in HVR &#x201c;hotspots,&#x201d; i.e., residues encoded by codons that undergo mutation at high frequency during the somatic maturation process (see, e.g., Chowdhury, Methods Mol. Biol. 207:179-196 (2008)), and/or residues that contact antigen, with the resulting variant VH or VL being tested for binding affinity. Affinity maturation by constructing and reselecting from secondary libraries has been described, e.g., in Hoogenboom et al. in Methods in Molecular Biology 178:1-37 (O'Brien et al., ed., Human Press, Totowa, N.J., (2001).) In some embodiments of affinity maturation, diversity is introduced into the variable genes chosen for maturation by any of a variety of methods (e.g., error-prone PCR, chain shuffling, or oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis). A secondary library is then created. The library is then screened to identify any antibody variants with the desired affinity. Another method to introduce diversity involves HVR-directed approaches, in which several HVR residues (e.g., 4-6 residues at a time) are randomized. HVR residues involved in antigen binding may be specifically identified, e.g., using alanine scanning mutagenesis or modeling. CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 in particular are often targeted.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0474">In certain embodiments, substitutions, insertions, or deletions may occur within one or more HVRs so long as such alterations do not substantially reduce the ability of the antibody to bind antigen. For example, conservative alterations (e.g., conservative substitutions as provided herein) that do not substantially reduce binding affinity may be made in HVRs. Such alterations may, for example, be outside of antigen contacting residues in the HVRs. In certain embodiments of the variant VH and VL sequences provided above, each HVR either is unaltered, or contains no more than one, two or three amino acid substitutions.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0475">A useful method for identification of residues or regions of an antibody that may be targeted for mutagenesis is called &#x201c;alanine scanning mutagenesis&#x201d; as described by Cunningham and Wells (1989) Science, 244:1081-1085. In this method, a residue or group of target residues (e.g., charged residues such as arg, asp, his, lys, and glu) are identified and replaced by a neutral or negatively charged amino acid (e.g., alanine or polyalanine) to determine whether the interaction of the antibody with antigen is affected. Further substitutions may be introduced at the amino acid locations demonstrating functional sensitivity to the initial substitutions. Alternatively, or additionally, a crystal structure of an antigen-antibody complex may be analyzed to identify contact points between the antibody and antigen. Such contact residues and neighboring residues may be targeted or eliminated as candidates for substitution. Variants may be screened to determine whether they contain the desired properties.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0476">Amino acid sequence insertions include amino- and/or carboxyl-terminal fusions ranging in length from one residue to polypeptides containing a hundred or more residues, as well as intrasequence insertions of single or multiple amino acid residues. Examples of terminal insertions include an antibody with an N-terminal methionyl residue. Other insertional variants of the antibody molecule include the fusion of an enzyme (e.g. for ADEPT) or a polypeptide which increases the plasma half-life of the antibody to the N- or C-terminus of the antibody.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0477">b) Glycosylation Variants</p><p id="p-0233" num="0478">In certain embodiments, an antibody provided herein is altered to increase or decrease the extent to which the antibody is glycosylated. Addition or deletion of glycosylation sites to an antibody may be conveniently accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence such that one or more glycosylation sites is created or removed.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0479">Where the antibody comprises an Fc region, the carbohydrate attached thereto may be altered. Native antibodies produced by mammalian cells typically comprise a branched, biantennary oligosaccharide that is generally attached by an N-linkage to Asn297 of the CH2 domain of the Fc region. See, e.g., Wright et al. TIBTECH 15:26-32 (1997). The oligosaccharide may include various carbohydrates, e.g., mannose, N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc), galactose, and sialic acid, as well as a fucose attached to a GlcNAc in the &#x201c;stem&#x201d; of the biantennary oligosaccharide structure. In some embodiments, modifications of the oligosaccharide in an antibody of the invention may be made in order to create antibody variants with certain improved properties.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0480">In one embodiment, antibody variants are provided having a carbohydrate structure that lacks fucose attached (directly or indirectly) to an Fc region. For example, the amount of fucose in such antibody may be from 1% to 80%, from 1% to 65%, from 5% to 65% or from 20% to 40%. The amount of fucose is determined by calculating the average amount of fucose within the sugar chain at Asn297, relative to the sum of all glycostructures attached to Asn 297 (e. g. complex, hybrid and high mannose structures) as measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, as described in WO 2008/077546, for example. Asn297 refers to the asparagine residue located at about position 297 in the Fc region (EU numbering of Fc region residues); however, Asn297 may also be located about +/&#x2212;3 amino acids upstream or downstream of position 297, i.e., between positions 294 and 300, due to minor sequence variations in antibodies. Such fucosylation variants may have improved ADCC function. See, e.g., US Patent Publication Nos. US 2003/0157108 (Presta, L.); US 2004/0093621 (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd). Examples of publications related to &#x201c;defucosylated&#x201d; or &#x201c;fucose-deficient&#x201d; antibody variants include: US 2003/0157108; WO 2000/61739; WO 2001/29246; US 2003/0115614; US 2002/0164328; US 2004/0093621; US 2004/0132140; US 2004/0110704; US 2004/0110282; US 2004/0109865; WO 2003/085119; WO 2003/084570; WO 2005/035586; WO 2005/035778; WO2005/053742; WO2002/031140; Okazaki et al. J. Mol. Biol. 336:1239-1249 (2004); Yamane-Ohnuki et al. Biotech. Bioeng. 87: 614 (2004). Examples of cell lines capable of producing defucosylated antibodies include Lec13 CHO cells deficient in protein fucosylation (Ripka et al. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 249:533-545 (1986); US Pat Appl No US 2003/0157108 A1, Presta, L; and WO 2004/056312 A1, Adams et al., especially at Example 11), and knockout cell lines, such as alpha-1,6-fucosyltransferase gene, FUT8, knockout CHO cells (see, e.g., Yamane-Ohnuki et al. Biotech. Bioeng. 87: 614 (2004); Kanda, Y. et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng., 94(4):680-688 (2006); and WO2003/085107).</p><p id="p-0236" num="0481">Antibodies variants are further provided with bisected oligosaccharides, e.g., in which a biantennary oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region of the antibody is bisected by GlcNAc. Such antibody variants may have reduced fucosylation and/or improved ADCC function. Examples of such antibody variants are described, e.g., in WO 2003/011878 (Jean-Mairet et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,684 (Umana et al.); and US 2005/0123546 (Umana et al.). Antibody variants with at least one galactose residue in the oligosaccharide attached to the Fc region are also provided. Such antibody variants may have improved CDC function. Such antibody variants are described, e.g., in WO 1997/30087 (Patel et al.); WO 1998/58964 (Raju, S.); and WO 1999/22764 (Raju, S.).</p><p id="p-0237" num="0000">c) Fc region variants</p><p id="p-0238" num="0482">In certain embodiments, one or more amino acid modifications may be introduced into the Fc region of an antibody provided herein, thereby generating an Fc region variant. The Fc region variant may comprise a human Fc region sequence (e.g., a human IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4 Fc region) comprising an amino acid modification (e.g. a substitution) at one or more amino acid positions.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0483">In certain embodiments, the invention contemplates an antibody variant that possesses some but not all effector functions, which make it a desirable candidate for applications in which the half life of the antibody in vivo is important yet certain effector functions (such as complement and ADCC) are unnecessary or deleterious. In vitro and/or in vivo cytotoxicity assays can be conducted to confirm the reduction/depletion of CDC and/or ADCC activities. For example, Fc receptor (FcR) binding assays can be conducted to ensure that the antibody lacks Fc gamma R binding (hence likely lacking ADCC activity), but retains FcRn binding ability. The primary cells for mediating ADCC, NK cells, express Fc gamma RIII only, whereas monocytes express Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII. FcR expression on hematopoietic cells is summarized in Table 3 on page 464 of Ravetch and Kinet, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 9:457-492 (1991). Non-limiting examples of in vitro assays to assess ADCC activity of a molecule of interest is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,500,362 (see, e.g. Hellstrom, I. et al. Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 83:7059-7063 (1986)) and Hellstrom, I et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 82:1499-1502 (1985); 5,821,337 (see Bruggemann, M. et al., J. Exp. Med. 166:1351-1361 (1987)). Alternatively, non-radioactive assays methods may be employed (see, for example, ACT1&#x2122; non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay for flow cytometry (CellTechnology, Inc. Mountain View, Calif.; and CytoTox 96 (registered trademark) non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega, Madison, Wis.). Useful effector cells for such assays include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and Natural Killer (NK) cells. Alternatively, or additionally, ADCC activity of the molecule of interest may be assessed in vivo, e.g., in an animal model such as that disclosed in Clynes et al. Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 95:652-656 (1998). C1q binding assays may also be carried out to confirm that the antibody is unable to bind C1q and hence lacks CDC activity. See, e.g., C1q and C3c binding ELISA in WO 2006/029879 and WO 2005/100402. To assess complement activation, a CDC assay may be performed (see, for example, Gazzano-Santoro et al., J. Immunol. Methods 202:163 (1996); Cragg, M. S. et al., Blood 101:1045-1052 (2003); and Cragg, M. S. and M. J. Glennie, Blood 103:2738-2743 (2004)). FcRn binding and in vivo clearance/half life determinations can also be performed using methods known in the art (see, e.g., Petkova, S. B. et al., Int'l.

The screening methods may comprise any process by which an antibody having pH-dependent binding characteristics is identified within a population of antibodies specific for a particular antigen. In certain embodiments, the screening methods may comprise measuring one or more binding parameters (e.g., KD or kd) of individual antibodies within an initial population of antibodies both at acidic pH and neutral pH. The binding parameters of the antibodies may be measured using, e.g., surface plasmon resonance, or any other analytic method that allows for the quantitative or qualitative assessment of the binding characteristics of an antibody to a particular antigen. In certain embodiments, the screening methods may comprise identifying an antibody that binds to an antigen with an acidic KD/neutral KD ratio of 2 or greater. Alternatively, the screening methods may comprise identifying an antibody that binds to an antigen with an acidic kd/neutral kd ratio of 2 or greater.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0501">In another embodiment, the mutagenesis methods may comprise incorporating a deletion, substitution, or addition of an amino acid within the heavy and/or light chain of the antibody to enhance the pH-dependent binding of the antibody to an antigen. In certain embodiments, the mutagenesis may be carried out within one or more variable domains of the antibody, e.g., within one or more HVRs (e.g., CDRs). For example, the mutagenesis may comprise substituting an amino acid within one or more HVRs (e.g., CDRs) of the antibody with another amino acid. In certain embodiments, the mutagenesis may comprise substituting one or more amino acids in at least one HVR (e.g., CDR) of the antibody with histidine. In certain embodiments, &#x201c;enhanced pH-dependent binding&#x201d; means that the mutated version of the antibody exhibits a greater acidic KD/neutral KD ratio, or a greater acidic kd/neutral kd ratio, than the original &#x201c;parent&#x201d; (i.e., the less pH-dependent) version of the antibody prior to mutagenesis. In certain embodiments, the mutated version of the antibody has an acidic KD/neutral KD ratio of 2 or greater. Alternatively, the mutated version of the antibody has an acidic kd/neutral kd ratio of 2 or greater.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0502">Polyclonal antibodies are preferably raised in animals by multiple subcutaneous (sc) or intraperitoneal (ip) injections of the relevant antigen and an adjuvant. It may be useful to conjugate the relevant antigen to a protein that is immunogenic in the species to be immunized, e.g., keyhole limpet hemocyanin, serum albumin, bovine thyroglobulin, or soybean trypsin inhibitor using a bifunctional or derivatizing agent, for example, maleimidobenzoyl sulfosuccinimide ester (conjugation through cysteine residues), N-hydroxysuccinimide (through lysine residues), glutaraldehyde, succinic anhydride, SOCl<sub>2</sub>, or R1N&#x2550;C&#x2550;NR, where R and R1 are different alkyl groups.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0503">Animals (usually non-human mammals) are immunized against the antigen, immunogenic conjugates, or derivatives by combining, e.g., 100 micro g or 5 micro g of the protein or conjugate (for rabbits or mice, respectively) with 3 volumes of Freund's complete adjuvant and injecting the solution intradermally at multiple sites. One month later the animals are boosted with &#x2155; to 1/10 the original amount of peptide or conjugate in Freund's complete adjuvant by subcutaneous injection at multiple sites. Seven to 14 days later the animals are bled and the serum is assayed for antibody titer. Animals are boosted until the titer plateaus. Preferably, the animal is boosted with the conjugate of the same antigen, but conjugated to a different protein and/or through a different cross-linking reagent. Conjugates also can be made in recombinant cell culture as protein fusions. Also, aggregating agents such as alum are suitably used to enhance the immune response.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0504">Monoclonal antibodies are obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations and/or post-translational modifications (e.g., isomerizations, amidations) that may be present in minor amounts. Thus, the modifier &#x201c;monoclonal&#x201d; indicates the character of the antibody as not being a mixture of discrete antibodies.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0505">For example, the monoclonal antibodies may be made using the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al., Nature 256(5517):495-497 (1975). In the hybridoma method, a mouse or other appropriate host animal, such as a hamster, is immunized as hereinabove described to elicit lymphocytes that produce or are capable of producing antibodies that will specifically bind to the protein used for immunization. Alternatively, lymphocytes may be immunized in vitro.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0506">The immunizing agent will typically include the antigenic protein or a fusion variant thereof. Generally either peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) are used if cells of human origin are desired, or spleen cells or lymph node cells are used if non-human mammalian sources are desired. The lymphocytes are then fused with an immortalized cell line using a suitable fusing agent, such as polyethylene glycol, to form a hybridoma cell (Goding, Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice, Academic Press (1986), pp. 59-103).</p><p id="p-0264" num="0507">Immortalized cell lines are usually transformed mammalian cells, particularly myeloma cells of rodent, bovine and human origin. Usually, rat or mouse myeloma cell lines are employed. The hybridoma cells thus prepared are seeded and grown in a suitable culture medium that preferably contains one or more substances that inhibit the growth or survival of the unfused, parental myeloma cells. For example, if the parental myeloma cells lack the enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT or HPRT), the culture medium for the hybridomas typically will include hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and thymidine (HAT medium), which are substances that prevent the growth of HGPRT-deficient cells.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0508">Preferred immortalized myeloma cells are those that fuse efficiently, support stable high-level production of antibody by the selected antibody-producing cells, and are sensitive to a medium such as HAT medium. Among these, preferred are murine myeloma lines, such as those derived from MOPC-21 and MPC-11 mouse tumors available from the Salk Institute Cell Distribution Center, San Diego, Calif. USA, and SP-2 cells (and derivatives thereof, e.g., X63-Ag8-653) available from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. USA. Human myeloma and mouse-human heteromyeloma cell lines also have been described for the production of human monoclonal antibodies (Kozbor et al. J. Immunol. 133(6):3001-3005 (1984); Brodeur et al., Monoclonal Antibody Production Techniques and Applications, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, pp. 51-63 (1987)).</p><p id="p-0266" num="0509">Culture medium in which hybridoma cells are growing is assayed for production of monoclonal antibodies directed against the antigen. Preferably, the binding specificity of monoclonal antibodies produced by hybridoma cells is determined by immunoprecipitation or by an in vitro binding assay, such as radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Such techniques and assays are known in the art. For example, binding affinity may be determined by the Scatchard analysis of Munson, Anal. Biochem. 107(1):220-239 (1980).</p><p id="p-0267" num="0510">After hybridoma cells are identified that produce antibodies of the desired specificity, affinity, and/or activity, the clones may be subcloned by limiting dilution procedures and grown by standard methods (Goding, supra). Suitable culture media for this purpose include, for example, D-MEM or RPMI-1640 medium. In addition, the hybridoma cells may be grown in vivo as tumors in a mammal.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0511">The monoclonal antibodies secreted by the subclones are suitably separated from the culture medium, ascites fluid, or serum by conventional immunoglobulin purification procedures such as, for example, protein A-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite chromatography, gel electrophoresis, dialysis, or affinity chromatography.</p><heading id="h-0023" level="2">C.

In certain embodiments, when such a competing antibody is present in excess, it blocks (e.g., reduces) the binding of a reference antibody to C1s by at least 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75% or more. In certain embodiments, such a competing antibody binds to the same epitope (e.g., a linear or a conformational epitope) that is bound by any anti-C1s antibody described herein. Detailed exemplary methods for mapping an epitope to which an antibody binds are provided in Morris (1996) &#x201c;Epitope Mapping Protocols,&#x201d; in Methods in Molecular Biology vol. 66 (Humana Press, Totowa, N.J.).

The second antibody may be present in a hybridoma supernatant. As a control, immobilized C1s is incubated in a solution comprising the first labeled antibody but not the second unlabeled antibody. After incubation under conditions permissive for binding of the first antibody to C1s, excess unbound antibody is removed, and the amount of label associated with immobilized C1s is measured. If the amount of label associated with immobilized C1s is substantially reduced in the test sample relative to the control sample, then that indicates that the second antibody is competing with the first antibody for binding to C1s. See Harlow and Lane (1988) Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual ch. 14 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.).</p><p id="p-0273" num="0516">In another aspect, an antibody that binds to the same epitope as an anti-C1s antibody provided herein or that competes for binding C1s with an anti-C1s antibody provided herein may be identified using sandwich assays. Sandwich assays involve the use of two antibodies, each capable of binding to a different immunogenic portion, or epitope, of the protein to be detected. In a sandwich assay, the test sample analyte is bound by a first antibody which is immobilized on a solid support, and thereafter a second antibody binds to the analyte, thus forming an insoluble three part complex. See David &#x26; Greene, U.S. Pat. No. 4,376,110. The second antibody may itself be labeled with a detectable moiety (direct sandwich assays) or may be measured using an anti-immunoglobulin antibody that is labeled with a detectable moiety (indirect sandwich assay). For example, one type of sandwich assay is an ELISA assay, in which case the detectable moiety is an enzyme. An antibody which simultaneously binds to C1s with an anti-C1s antibody provided herein can be determined to be an antibody that binds to a different epitope from the anti-C1s antibody. Therefore, an antibody which does not simultaneously bind to C1s with an anti-C1s antibody provided herein can be determined to be an antibody that binds to the same epitope as the anti-C1s antibody or that competes for binding C1s with the anti-C1s antibody.</p><heading id="h-0025" level="2">2.
