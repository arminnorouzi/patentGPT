This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein. In the description, details of well-known features and techniques may be omitted to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the presented embodiments.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments of the present invention relate to the field of computing, and more particularly to digital twin creation and maintenance. The following described exemplary embodiments provide a system, method, and program product to, among other things, identify commercialization opportunities for digital twin artifacts captured on a mobile device. Therefore, the present embodiment has the capacity to improve the technical field of digital twin creation and maintenance by providing an enhanced method of identifying gaps where a digital twin lacks content pertaining to a physical asset, alerting a user that digital content created by the user could fill the gap in content pertaining to the physical asset, and provide prompting and commercial incentives for the user to upload the content to a digital twin content store, thereby adding to the body of resources comprising the digital twin and improving the fidelity, accuracy, and completeness of the digital twin.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">As previously described, a digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical object which is maintained and updated regularly using sensor data and human observation such that the virtual object is an up-to-date and accurate copy of its physical counterpart; the virtual object can therefore be accessed to ascertain the properties and states of the corresponding physical asset at any given moment in time, making the digital twin concept extremely useful in product design, asset maintenance, asset monitoring, diagnostics, et cetera. Digital twin content stores, such as the IBM Digital Twin Exchange, allow manufacturers to provide digital resources to owners and operators of their assets. These digital resources help companies more intelligently operate their business. However, often times companies are not aware that their teams generate digital twin resources that could be commercialized and made available for sale on a digital twin exchange. Often, these digital twin resources are created in the field by technicians and used solely by the organization within an Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) tool like IBM Maximo. What is needed is a way to highlight to technicians that the digital content they are creating might be possible to make available on a digital twin exchange to generate revenue for their organizations.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to one embodiment, the invention is a system and method to cross reference available digital twin resources within a digital twin content store with digital content pertaining to the physical asset captured by a technician in the field to determine revenue potential and resource opportunities for content publication.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The physical asset, as referred to herein, may be a physical object represented virtually by a digital twin, which may be a virtual facsimile of the physical object. The physical asset may be any machine, device, object, system, et cetera, so long as it is tangible and physical, such as a vehicle, industrial equipment, sensor installation, architectural element, et cetera. In some embodiments, a digital twin may represent an entire class of similar physical assets, such as a production model truck, a certain model of washing machines, et cetera, and the term &#x2018;physical asset&#x2019; may herein be referring to the class of similar physical assets.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present invention may be a system, a method, and/or a computer program product at any possible technical detail level of integration. The computer program product may include a computer readable storage medium (or media) having computer readable program instructions thereon for causing a processor to carry out aspects of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The computer readable storage medium can be a tangible device that can retain and store instructions for use by an instruction execution device. The computer readable storage medium may be, for example, but is not limited to, an electronic storage device, a magnetic storage device, an optical storage device, an electromagnetic storage device, a semiconductor storage device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing. A non-exhaustive list of more specific examples of the computer readable storage medium includes the following: a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), a static random access memory (SRAM), a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), a digital versatile disk (DVD), a memory stick, a floppy disk, a mechanically encoded device such as punch-cards or raised structures in a groove having instructions recorded thereon, and any suitable combination of the foregoing. A computer readable storage medium, as used herein, is not to be construed as being transitory signals per se, such as radio waves or other freely propagating electromagnetic waves, electromagnetic waves propagating through a waveguide or other transmission media (e.g., light pulses passing through a fiber-optic cable), or electrical signals transmitted through a wire.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Computer readable program instructions described herein can be downloaded to respective computing/processing devices from a computer readable storage medium or to an external computer or external storage device via a network, for example, the Internet, a local area network, a wide area network and/or a wireless network. The network may comprise copper transmission cables, optical transmission fibers, wireless transmission, routers, firewalls, switches, gateway computers and/or edge servers. A network adapter card or network interface in each computing/processing device receives computer readable program instructions from the network and forwards the computer readable program instructions for storage in a computer readable storage medium within the respective computing/processing device.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Computer readable program instructions for carrying out operations of the present invention may be assembler instructions, instruction-set-architecture (ISA) instructions, machine instructions, machine dependent instructions, microcode, firmware instructions, state-setting data, configuration data for integrated circuitry, or either source code or object code written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as Smalltalk, C++, or the like, and procedural programming languages, such as the &#x201c;C&#x201d; programming language or similar programming languages.

It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer readable program instructions.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">These computer readable program instructions may be provided to a processor of a computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks. These computer readable program instructions may also be stored in a computer readable storage medium that can direct a computer, a programmable data processing apparatus, and/or other devices to function in a particular manner, such that the computer readable storage medium having instructions stored therein comprises an article of manufacture including instructions which implement aspects of the function/act specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The computer readable program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other device to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer, other programmable apparatus or other device to produce a computer implemented process, such that the instructions which execute on the computer, other programmable apparatus, or other device implement the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The flowchart and block diagrams in the Figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods, and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present invention. In this regard, each block in the flowchart or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of instructions, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). In some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the blocks may occur out of the order noted in the Figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be accomplished as one step, executed concurrently, substantially concurrently, in a partially or wholly temporally overlapping manner, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved. It will also be noted that each block of the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts or carry out combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The following described exemplary embodiments provide a system, method, and program product to identify commercialization opportunities for digital twin artifacts captured on a mobile device.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an exemplary networked computer environment <b>100</b> is depicted, according to at least one embodiment.

The digital twin commercialization program <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B may be located on client computing device <b>102</b> or server <b>112</b> or on any other device located within network <b>114</b>. Furthermore, digital twin commercialization program <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B may be distributed in its operation over multiple devices, such as client computing device <b>102</b> and server <b>112</b>. The digital twin commercialization method is explained in further detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an operational flowchart illustrating a digital twin commercialization process <b>200</b> is depicted according to at least one embodiment. At <b>202</b>, the digital twin commercialization program <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B receives digital content pertaining to a physical asset from a user performing a selected work order. The digital content may be any content acquired by the user via sensor <b>118</b> that is measuring some property of the physical asset and/or properties associated with some condition or state associated with the physical asset. The digital content may be recorded during or in connection with the work order. The digital content may include, for example, new imagery, for example the user may capture images of the asset such as representation of the asset in an error or failed state; acoustic evidence, such as sounds produced by the physical asset in a particular state of operation; and/or generation of new failure modes for the asset.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">At <b>204</b>, the digital twin commercialization program <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B identifies the physical asset with which the digital content is associated based on the work order. The digital twin commercialization program <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B may identify the physical asset to which the digital content corresponds by consulting the work order on the asset management program <b>108</b>. In some embodiments, digital twin commercialization program <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B may determine contextual data for the digital content, where the contextual data is further information regarding the digital content that would assist digital twin commercialization program <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B in ascertaining whether the digital content is present within a digital twin content store <b>116</b>, such as a state or condition of the physical asset at the time the digital content was ascertained. For example, contextual data could include whether digital content comprising acoustic models represent the sounds produced by the physical asset during a particular mode of operation, and/or whether the acoustic models represent the sounds produced by the physical asset that is experiencing an error state. The contextual data may be ascertained from the description of the work order, for example where the work order identifies that the physical asset is experiencing a particular error state, may be ascertained from accessible resources associated with the physical asset such as sensor data, direct communications with or from the physical asset in embodiments where the physical asset is a computing device, existing digital twin resources which may have been recently uploaded, et cetera, and/or may be ascertained from the user in response to a prompt, for example a graphical window or text field presented on a display associated with the user's client computing device <b>102</b>. The contextual data may comprise metadata such as a tag or series of tags associated with the digital content providing, for example, additional description of the digital content, a class or category to which the digital content belongs (acoustic model, acoustic model during failure mode, image, video, et cetera), and/or the context within which the digital content was ascertained (for example, mode of operation such as failure mode, normal operation, low power mode, et cetera; rainy weather, poor maintenance history, et cetera). In some embodiments of the invention, the digital twin commercialization program <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B may prompt the user to confirm whether contextual data ascertained by digital twin commercialization program <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B is correct.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">At <b>206</b>, the digital twin commercialization program <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B determines whether there is a gap in a digital twin content store <b>116</b> for the digital content.

The digital twin commercialization program <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B may search through each item of digital twin resources associated with the physical asset, or a subset of items of the digital twin resources associated with the physical asset such as the digital twin resources that are of the same class as the digital content, to find a match. The digital twin commercialization program <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B may identify a match if the digital content and a digital twin resource associated with the physical asset are of a similarity value that exceeds a threshold level of similarity, wherein the threshold level of similarity represents a value of similarity between a digital twin resource and the digital content above which the digital content is considered to be so similar to the digital twin resource that no commercialization opportunity exists. The threshold value may be pre-provided or determined via machine learning. The digital twin commercialization program <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B may assess similarity by assigning a similarity value to a digital twin resource based on comparing the digital twin resource with and the digital content. For example, the digital twin commercialization program <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B may compare the digital twin resource's acoustic signature to the digital content's acoustic signature, or may use image recognition to compare the digital twin resource's imagery with the digital content imagery, and assign and/or modify a similarity value.

However, if the level of similarity between the digital content and any of the digital twin resources associated with the physical asset fails to exceed the threshold value of similarity, the digital twin commercialization program <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B will determine that there is a gap in the digital twin content store <b>116</b> for the digital content, as well as a commercial opportunity to upload the digital content and a chance to further improve the completeness and accuracy of the digital twin. If the digital twin commercialization program <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B determines that there is a such a gap in a digital twin content store (step <b>206</b>, &#x201c;YES&#x201d; branch), the digital twin commercialization program <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B may continue to step <b>210</b> to prompt the user to make the digital content available on the digital twin store.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">At <b>208</b>, the digital twin commercialization program <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B shows the user existing content on the digital twin content store that is associated with the physical asset.

Rather, embodiments of the present invention are capable of being implemented in conjunction with any other type of computing environment now known or later developed.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Cloud computing is a model of service delivery for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. networks, network bandwidth, servers, processing, memory, storage, applications, virtual machines, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or interaction with a provider of the service. This cloud model may include at least five characteristics, at least three service models, and at least four deployment models.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Characteristics are as follows:</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">On-demand self-service: a cloud consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with the service's provider.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Broad network access: capabilities are available over a network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, laptops, and PDAs).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Resource pooling: the provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the consumer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Rapid elasticity: capabilities can be rapidly and elastically provisioned, in some cases automatically, to quickly scale out and rapidly released to quickly scale in. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be purchased in any quantity at any time.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Measured service: cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Service Models are as follows:</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Software as a Service (SaaS): the capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through a thin client interface such as a web browser (e.g., web-based e-mail). The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration settings.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Platform as a Service (PaaS): the capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming languages and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including networks, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly application hosting environment configurations.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): the capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, deployed applications, and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Deployment Models are as follows:</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Private cloud: the cloud infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on-premises or off-premises.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Community cloud: the cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on-premises or off-premises.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Public cloud: the cloud infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Hybrid cloud: the cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load-balancing between clouds).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">A cloud computing environment is service oriented with a focus on statelessness, low coupling, modularity, and semantic interoperability.
