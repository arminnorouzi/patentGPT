The system may be used as a city planning tool, for example, by allowing city planners to view the effects of road and/or construction projects and/or other changes on selected streets and neighborhoods. More specifically, the traffic reports may allow city planners to determine whether a particular construction project achieved its intended effect, and may also be used to predict the effects (e.g., on city traffic) of future construction projects.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some aspects, the system may receive a set of inputs specifying at least a geographical region, a first period of time, and a second period of time. For example, the geographical region may correspond to an area in which a construction project took place. The first period of time may correspond to a sample duration before the construction began, and the second period of time may correspond to a sample duration after the construction was completed. The system may identify one or more streets within at least a threshold proximity of the specified geographical region and aggregate traffic information for the one or more streets over the first period of time and the second period of time, respectively. For example, the traffic information may include sensor data received from one or more vehicles associated with a transport service. The system may then generate a traffic report for the geographical region based at least in part on a comparison of the aggregated traffic information for the first period of time with the aggregated traffic information for the second period of time.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to some examples, the traffic information may include an average speed of the one or more vehicles (e.g., of the transport service) while driving on the one or more streets. In some aspects, the traffic report may include a graphical display comparing the average speed on each of the one or more streets during the first period of time with the average speed on each of the one or more streets during the second period of time. In other aspects, the traffic report may include a map display of the geographical region highlighting, for each of the one or more streets, a degree of change in the average speed form the first period of time to the second period of time. Still further, the map display may indicate, for each of the one or more streets, whether the average speed increased or decreased from the first period of time to the second period of time.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Further, according to some examples, the traffic information may include acceleration information for the one or more vehicles while driving on the one or more streets. In some aspects, the system may determine a safety level for each of the one or more streets based at least in part on the acceleration information. For example, &#x201c;hard braking&#x201d; statistics (e.g., deceleration &#x3e;7 mph/s) may be used to estimate an occurrence and/or probability of accidents on the one or more streets. Thus, a greater occurrence of hard-braking may correlate with a lower safety level. The traffic report may indicate, for each of the one or more streets, whether the safety level increased or decreased form the first period of time to the second period of time.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some aspects, the one or more streets may include streets that are located within the specified geographical region and/or streets neighboring streets that may otherwise be affected by changes in the traffic patterns of the streets located within the specified geographical region. For example, the system may identify a first subset of streets that are located within the geographical region. The system may further determine a set of alternate routes for the first subset of streets. The set of alternate routes may include streets that intersect or run parallel to streets in the first subset (e.g., and may thus be used to route traffic around the area directly affected by construction and/or other changes). The system may then identify a second subset of streets that belong to the set of alternate routes.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Among other benefits and advantages, examples as described may provide valuable insight into the actual effects on city traffic caused by a particular road construction project. For example, by leveraging vehicle sensor data from actual vehicles used by an on-demand transport service, the traffic reports may highlight any changes in the traffic patterns (e.g., average speeds, probability of accidents, etc.) of streets that are directly and/or indirectly affected by construction projects in a particular geographical region.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, a &#x201c;driver,&#x201d; a &#x201c;provider,&#x201d; a &#x201c;service provider,&#x201d; a &#x201c;supplier,&#x201d; or a &#x201c;vendor,&#x201d; are invariably used to refer to individuals or entities that can provide an on-demand service. Also, as used herein, a &#x201c;client device,&#x201d; a &#x201c;user device,&#x201d; and/or a &#x201c;computing device&#x201d; refer to devices corresponding to desktop computers, cellular devices or smartphones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), laptop computers, tablet devices, television (IP Television), etc., that can provide network connectivity and processing resources for communicating with a transport arrangement system and/or traffic report generating system over a network. A driver device can also correspond to other devices of a transit object, such as an in-vehicle computing system, or custom hardware, etc. The driver device can also operate a designated service application that is configured to communicate with the on-demand service system and/or the transport personalization system. Still further, while some examples described herein relate to transport services, the systems described herein can be used to provide other on-demand services, such as a food truck service, a delivery service, an entertainment service, etc.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">One or more examples described herein provide that methods, techniques, and actions performed by a computing device are performed programmatically, or as a computer-implemented method. Programmatically, as used herein, means through the use of code or computer-executable instructions. These instructions can be stored in one or more memory resources of the computing device. A programmatically performed step may or may not be automatic.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">One or more examples described herein can be implemented using programmatic modules, engines, or components. A programmatic module, engine, or component can include a program, a sub-routine, a portion of a program, or a software component or a hardware component capable of performing one or more stated tasks or functions. As used herein, a module or component can exist on a hardware component independently of other modules or components. Alternatively, a module or component can be a shared element or process of other modules, programs or machines.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Some examples described herein can generally require the use of computing devices, including processing and memory resources. Examples described herein may be implemented, in whole or in part, on computing devices such as servers, desktop computers, cellular or smartphones, personal digital assistants (e.g., PDAs), laptop computers, printers, network equipment (e.g., routers) and tablet devices.

Additionally, examples may be implemented in the form of computer-programs, or a computer usable carrier medium capable of carrying such a program.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="2">System Description</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example system <b>100</b> for generating traffic reports in connection with an on-demand service. Depending on implementation, one or more components of the system <b>100</b> can be implemented on a computing device, such as a server, laptop, PC, etc., or on multiple computing devices that can communicate with a client device <b>160</b> and one or more provider devices <b>170</b> over one or more networks. In some examples, a computing device can operate or execute an application to perform one or more of the processes described by the various components of the system <b>100</b>. The system <b>100</b> can also be implemented through other computer systems in alternative architectures (e.g., peer-to-peer networks, etc.).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As described herein, the system <b>100</b> can be a part of or communicate with an on-demand service system, such as a transport arrangement system of the on-demand service system. Examples of an on-demand service can include a transport service, a food truck service, a delivery service, a traveling entertainment service, etc. A transport arrangement system for a transport service, for example, can receive requests from users operating requesting devices and arrange for transport services to be provided to the users by service providers (e.g., drivers).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In example implementations, the system <b>100</b> includes a client interface <b>101</b>, provider interface <b>102</b>, street selector <b>110</b>, traffic report generator <b>120</b>, sensor data filter <b>130</b>, aggregator <b>140</b>, and data store <b>150</b>. The system <b>100</b> may generate and provide customized traffic reports <b>163</b> to the client device <b>160</b> based at least in part on provider data <b>171</b> received from one or more provider devices <b>170</b>. Depending on implementation, one or more components of the system <b>100</b> can be implemented on network-side resources, such as one or more servers. As an addition or an alternative, some or all of the components of the system <b>100</b> can be implemented on client devices, such as through applications that operate on the client device <b>160</b>. For example, a client application can execute to perform one or more of the processes described by the various components of the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The system <b>100</b> can communicate, over one or more networks (e.g., wirelessly or via a wired connection), with the provider devices <b>170</b> using the provider interface <b>102</b>. In some examples, the provider devices <b>170</b> can individually operate an application that can interface with the provider interface <b>102</b> to communicate with the system <b>100</b>. According to some examples, the applications can include or use an application programming interface (API), such as an externally facing API, to communicate data with the provider interface <b>102</b>. The externally facing API can provide access to the system <b>100</b> via secure access channels over the network through any number of methods, such as web-based forms, programmatic access via restful APIs, Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), remote procedure call (RPC), scripting access, etc., while also providing secure access methods including key-based access to ensure the system <b>100</b> remains secure and only authorized users, service providers, and/or third parties can gain access to the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The system <b>100</b> can receive provider updates <b>171</b>, via the provider interface <b>102</b>, from a plurality of provider device <b>170</b>. The provider updates <b>171</b> can provide current information about the respective devices and/or their respective users. For example, for each provider device <b>170</b>, the provider update <b>171</b> can include identification information of the service provider or the provider device, the type of vehicle the service provider drives, the service that the service provider provides, the service provider's availability status (e.g., indicating that the service provider is available for service, is off-duty, or is currently servicing other users), and/or sensor data indicating the current state of the provider device <b>170</b>. For example, each provider device <b>170</b> may include, or may otherwise be coupled to, one or more sensors (e.g., global positioning satellite (GPS), inertial measurement unit (IMU), accelerometers, altimeters, photosensors, etc.) to detect the current state and/or status of the service provider's vehicle.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some examples, provider updates <b>171</b> can be received when a service provider launches or starts a service application on a respective provider device <b>170</b>. In other examples, provider updates <b>171</b> can be received when the service provider performs certain actions using the service application (e.g., the service provider notifies that he or she is available for providing services or has just completed one or more activities related to the on-demand service). The provider interface <b>102</b> can also receive provider updates <b>171</b> periodically, at different instances in time, or based on a set schedule, after the service provider launches or starts the service application. Still further, a provider device <b>170</b> can transmit provider updates <b>171</b> during a duration of time when the provider is traveling in the course of performing a transport service (e.g., while traveling to a pickup location and/or a destination location of a requesting user). By periodically receiving provider updates <b>171</b>, for example, the system <b>100</b> may determine real-time traffic information for at least the streets and/or routes traveled by the service providers.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The sensor data filter <b>130</b> may receive the provider updates <b>171</b> form the provider interface <b>102</b>, and parse the provider updates <b>171</b> for sensor data <b>131</b>.

Thus, it may appear from the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> that the construction project achieved the desired effect of slowing down vehicle traffic (e.g., by &#x2dc;4 mph) on Castro Street.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> shows an example user interface <b>620</b> comparing the average speeds of vehicular traffic in the neighborhood surrounding the selected geographical region, before and after the construction took place. More specifically, the user interface <b>620</b> includes a number of bar graphs showing the weighted average speed (e.g., in MPH) of vehicle traffic on Castro Street and neighboring streets (e.g., Diamond, Collingwood, Hartford, and Noe) that run parallel to Castro Street. As described above, the neighboring streets may serve as alternative routes (e.g., between 17th, 18th, and 19th Streets) that may be taken in lieu of Castro Street.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the example shown with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, there was an overall reduction in the average speeds on each of the neighboring streets (e.g., in addition to Castro Street) after the construction took place. For example, the average speed on Diamond was reduced by &#x2dc;2 mph, the average speed on Collingwood was reduced by &#x2dc;1 mph, the average speed on Hartford was reduced by &#x2dc;2 mph, and the average speed on Noe was reduced by &#x2dc;1 mph. Thus, it may appear from the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> that the construction project caused an increase in vehicle traffic on the neighboring streets that run parallel to Castro Street (e.g., possibly as a result of people attempting to detour around Castro Street to avoid even greater delays).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> shows an example user interface <b>630</b> comparing hourly changes in average speed of vehicular traffic in the selected geographical region, before and after the construction took place. More specifically, the user interface <b>630</b> includes a line chart showing the weighted average speed (e.g., in MPH) of vehicle traffic on Castro Street over time. Although the results show a spike a vehicle speeds (e.g., after the construction took place) between the hours of 3 AM to 6 AM, the general trend of the line chart supports the conclusion that the construction project caused an overall decrease in average vehicle speeds on Castro Street. The most significant reduction in vehicle speeds occurred between the hours of 10 AM and 10 PM (e.g., during which the greatest number of pedestrians are likely to be out on the street). Thus, it may appear from the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> that the construction project achieved the desired effect of increasing pedestrian safety on Castro Street.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref> shows an example user interface <b>640</b> comparing the average speeds of northbound and southbound vehicular traffic in the neighborhood surrounding the selected geographical region, before and after the construction took place. More specifically, the user interface <b>640</b> includes a number of line charts showing the weighted average speed (e.g., in MPH) of vehicle traffic on neighboring streets (e.g., Market, 18th, 19th, 20th, Liberty, 21st, Hill, 22nd, Alvarado, 23rd, Elizabeth, 24th, Jersey, 25th, Clipper, 26th, Cesar Chavez, and 27th) that intersect or otherwise run perpendicular to Castro Street.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The chart on the left shows the average northbound traffic on each of the neighboring streets before and after the construction took place.

Greyed out areas <b>642</b> and <b>644</b> on the left-hand side of the northbound and southbound charts, respectively, represent the geographical region <b>512</b> in which the construction took place. For example, Market Street, 18th Street, and 19th Street pass through the geographical region <b>512</b> directly affected by construction. Street names listed further from the greyed out areas <b>642</b> and <b>644</b> are in turn further away from the geographical region <b>512</b> directly affected by construction.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the example shown with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>, the average speeds of northbound vehicle traffic remained relatively unchanged after the construction took place. On the other hand, there was a noticeable reduction in the average speeds of southbound vehicle traffic on the same streets. The most significant reductions in the speeds of southbound traffic occurred between Market and Hill street (e.g., those closest to the geographical region <b>512</b>), whereas streets south of 22nd Street experienced little or no change in average speed. Thus, it may appear from the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref> that the construction project caused an increase in vehicle traffic on some of the neighboring streets that intersect or otherwise run perpendicular to Castro Street (e.g., possibly as a result of people attempting to detour around Castro Street to avoid even greater delays).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E</figref> shows an example user interface <b>650</b> highlighting the degrees of change in average speeds of vehicular traffic in the neighborhood surrounding the selected geographical region as a result of the construction project. More specifically, the user interface <b>650</b> includes a map of the neighborhood surrounding the geographical region <b>512</b> (e.g., Castro Street). Each street may be highlighted (e.g., shaded or colored) in a particular way to reflect the degree of change in average speed from before to after the construction took place. For example, with reference to the key <b>652</b>, each statistically-significant change in speed may by highlighted by a different color, shade, and/or pattern. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E</figref>, speed increases on the order of 0.1 mph may be deemed statistically significant, whereas speed decreases on the order of 0.5 mph may be deemed statistically significant. This reflects the user's goal of reducing, rather than increasing, average speeds in the neighborhood (e.g., to increase the safety of pedestrians).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the example shown with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E</figref>, the segment of Castro Street bounded by 17th and 19th experienced the greatest overall reduction in average speed (e.g., 2.5-3 mph reduction), whereas the remaining portion of Castro Street (e.g., south of 19th Street) experienced an overall increase in average speed (e.g., 0.2 0.3 mph increase). On the other hand, the average speeds on Collingsworth and 19th Street remained relatively unchanged as a result of the construction. Diamond and Hartford Streets both experienced moderate speed decreases (e.g., 1.5-2 mph decrease), while Noe Street experienced a more subtle speed decrease (e.g., 1-1.5 mph decrease). 20th Street experienced the greatest overall increase in average speed (e.g., &#x3e;0.5 mph increase), followed by 18th Street (e.g., 0.3-0.4 mph increase).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Hardware Diagrams</heading><p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a block diagram that illustrates a computer system <b>700</b> upon which examples described herein may be implemented.
