Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to the field of massage appliances. More particularly, this invention relates to the field a massage appliance having a motor that is mounted such that the motor floats relative to the handle and main body of the device, thus isolating the handle from most of the vibration created by the motor.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electric hand-held massage appliances provide massage to targeted parts of the body. Massage appliances include both vibration type and percussive type massagers.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One drawback of massage appliances is that the mechanism that creates the vibration, which is usually an electric motor having an eccentric weight attached thereto, causes vibration not only at the massage head where the vibration is desired, but also in the handle where vibration is not desired. The vibration in the handle can cause discomfort, fatigue, and/or cramping in the person holding the device, or even carpal tunnel syndrome in extreme cases of prolonged use.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention is of a massage appliance having a motor that is mounted such that the motor floats relative to the handle of the device, thus isolating the handle from most of the vibration created by the motor.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the invention employs a flexible diaphragm with the vibration motor(s) mounted to one face of a central portion of the diaphragm and the massage head or node mounted to the other face of the central portion. The central portion which carries the massage node, which is the part that contacts the subject being massaged and applies the massage, is relatively free to move in all of the x-, y-, and z-directions due to the presence of one or more flexible contours surrounding the central portion such as folds, bends, or curves. The flexible contour(s) can be thought of as bellows and perform a similar function as bellows, allowing the central portion to move freely relative to the massager housing. In this way, the massage head and the vibration motor are free to vibrate, with only a small portion of the vibrational energy created by the vibration motor being transmitted to other parts of the device including the user handle. In this aspect, the diaphragm includes the following parts: a central portion to which the massage node and the motor are mounted, a flexible portion surrounding the central portion, and a mounting portion by which the diaphragm is mounted to the body or housing of the massage appliance. In this regard, the phrase &#x201c;flexible diaphragm&#x201d; means that at least a portion of the overall diaphragm structure is flexible.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Considered from a different viewpoint, the massage node is carried by a vibration plate to which a vibration motor is mounted. The massage node may be a brush which may be integrally formed with the vibration plate. The vibration plate is mounted to a flexible membrane, which in turn is mounted to the body of the massage appliance such as at the lip of an aperture within the massage appliance. The flexible membrane can contain one or more contours such as folds, bends, or curves. Those contour(s) allow the vibration plate and the vibration motor mounted thereto to move freely relative to the body of the massage appliance, such that the vibration plate vibrates freely, with only a small portion of the vibrational energy created by the vibration motor being transmitted to other parts of the device including the user handle. In this aspect, the vibration plate and the flexible membrane considered together correspond to the flexible diaphragm disclosed in the preceding paragraph.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Exemplary embodiments of the invention will be further described below with reference to the drawings, in which like numbers refer to like parts. The drawing figures might not be to scale, and certain components may be shown in generalized or schematic form and identified by commercial designations in the interest of clarity and conciseness.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an oblique view of a massage appliance according to a first exemplary embodiment of the invention.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an oblique cutaway view of the massage appliance of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a simplified, exploded view of the massage appliance of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an oblique bottom view of the top housing <b>72</b>, flexible membrane <b>42</b>, motor <b>50</b>, and vibration plate <b>30</b> of the massage appliance of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a top plan view of the components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cutaway view of the components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, taken along section line <b>6</b>-<b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a cutaway view of the components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, taken along section line <b>7</b>-<b>7</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a closeup view of area C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an exploded view of the area shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a closeup view of area C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, illustrating the parts vibrating in operation.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is an oblique bottom view of a second embodiment of an exemplary massage appliance of the invention in which the massager has two motors.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an oblique view of a massage appliance according to a first exemplary embodiment of the invention. Massage appliance <b>10</b> and other embodiments can be used to provide massage to a subject, who may be human or animal. In this particular embodiment the massage node or massage head which comprises a plurality of nubs <b>36</b>, is a brush <b>37</b> that can be used on dogs and other pets. The inventors have discovered that many dogs enjoy receiving a massage via a vibrating brush <b>37</b> such as in the embodiment illustrated. The invention, however, can be used with any vibrating massage appliance for application to any subject.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In this exemplary embodiment, massage appliance <b>10</b> includes a handle portion <b>12</b> having a grip <b>14</b> by which a user holds the device, a distal portion <b>70</b> that is distal to the handle portion <b>12</b>, and a user control <b>16</b> which can be a single ON/OFF switch, a discrete or variable speed control, and could include similar two or more controls for two or more vibration motor as will be discussed later.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Distal portion <b>70</b> carries the massage head or massage node, which in this case is a plurality of nubs <b>36</b> which form massage brush <b>37</b>. Many other shapes and configurations of massage nodes could be used in place of nubs <b>36</b>, as is well known. Vibration plate <b>30</b> could carry a mount such that a variety of different massage nodes can be interchangeably installed onto and removed from the massager as desired by the user. In this embodiment, nubs <b>36</b> are integrally formed with, and define a unitary part with, vibration plate <b>30</b> having top surface <b>32</b>. Vibration plate <b>30</b> is mounted to, and carried by, flexible membrane <b>42</b> which in this embodiment completely surrounds the periphery of vibration plate <b>30</b>. Vibration plate <b>30</b> is thus suspended via flexible membrane <b>42</b>. In this embodiment vibration plate <b>30</b> including its top face <b>32</b> and nubs <b>36</b> are made of a relatively rigid plastic, but they could also be made of different materials including a firm but not rigid rubber or other elastomer. These parts could be made of virtually any material and take a variety of different shapes as desired or needed for the intended massage type. Vibration plate <b>30</b> and top face <b>32</b> with its nubs <b>36</b> could also be formed of different materials, and could be attached and thus integrated together via a variety of manufacturing techniques including without limitation co-molding, insert molding, sonic welding, compression, and/or adhesive.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Flexible membrane <b>42</b> surrounds vibration plate <b>30</b> which contacts the user. Flexible membrane <b>42</b> allows vibration plate <b>30</b> including massaging nubs <b>36</b> to move at least partially isolated from the rest of the device <b>10</b> including handle <b>12</b>, minimizing and dampening vibration to those parts.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an oblique cutaway view of the massage appliance of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Electric motor <b>50</b> is mounted to the underside, or inward face, or bottom face, of vibration plate <b>30</b>. Motor <b>50</b> is rotatably coupled to, and drives, eccentric weight <b>52</b>. Together motor <b>50</b> and eccentric weight <b>52</b> define a vibration motor or vibration generator.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Massage appliance top housing <b>72</b> has an aperture <b>74</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) formed therein, and a lip <b>76</b> surrounding and defining the aperture. In this embodiment aperture <b>74</b> and vibration plate <b>30</b> have generally round shapes, specifically oval shapes, although other shapes are possible. Flexible membrane <b>42</b> preferably comprises an elastomer such as thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), nitrile rubber (NBR), or neoprene. Elastomeric materials are sometimes referred to generically as &#x201c;rubber.&#x201d; Flexible membrane <b>42</b> includes three portions: a first mounting portion <b>44</b> such as a lip or edge by which it is mounted to lip <b>76</b> surrounding aperture <b>74</b> of the main housing, a flexible portion <b>46</b>, and a second mounting portion <b>48</b> such as a lip or edge by which vibration plate <b>30</b> is mounted to flexible membrane <b>42</b>. The mounting portions may be attached to housing <b>72</b> and vibration plate <b>30</b> by any suitable method including but not limited to co-molding, insert molding, sonic welding, compression, and/or adhesive. The flexible portion <b>46</b> allows vibration plate <b>30</b> to move in the x- y-, and z-directions relatively freely, relative to housing <b>72</b> and handle <b>12</b>. That is, flexible portion <b>46</b> allows three degrees of freedom for vibration plate <b>30</b>. Flexible membrane <b>42</b> is preferably integrally formed as a unitary piece of material, although it could be constructed of different pieces having different material properties. For example, mounting portions <b>44</b>, <b>48</b> could be, or could have co-molded therein, metal strips, with the metal strips affixed to housing <b>72</b> and vibration plate <b>30</b> by any suitable method. One advantage of the flexible membrane being unitarily formed of a rubber or rubber-like material is that such a construction can provide a hermetic seal that prevents water or other liquids from entering housing <b>72</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The construction seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> stands in contrast to prior art hand-held massagers in which the vibration motor was rigidly attached, either directly or indirectly, to the rigid housing of the device, thus transmitting vibrations substantially unattenuated to the handle and the rest of the device. The present construction therefore provides substantial vibration isolation and attenuation over such prior art devices. In the embodiment shown a vibration motor clamp or bracket <b>54</b> is integrally molded with vibration plate <b>30</b> and cradles vibration motor <b>50</b> to hold it such as by vibration motor <b>50</b> snapping into place into clamp <b>54</b>, such that clamp <b>54</b> also functions as a cradle. Alternatively, vibration motor <b>50</b> could be secured to vibration plate <b>30</b> by a number of different means such as an elastomeric band, or by clamp <b>54</b> being secured to vibration plate <b>30</b> by mechanical fasteners such as screws including screws that extend into, or are molded into, some of the nubs <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a simplified, exploded view of the massage appliance of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, revealing top housing <b>72</b> having lip <b>76</b>, bottom housing <b>78</b>, battery <b>80</b>, handle portion <b>12</b>, flexible membrane <b>42</b>, vibration plate <b>30</b>, and motor <b>50</b>. As in other figures, the electrical connections which are conventional have been omitted for clarity of illustration. As perhaps seen best in this view, flexible membrane <b>42</b> and vibration plate <b>30</b> considered together can be considered to define a diaphragm <b>40</b>, with vibration plate <b>30</b> defining a central and floating portion of diaphragm <b>40</b>. In an alternate construction diaphragm <b>40</b> could be integrally formed of an elastomer with diaphragm <b>40</b> completely filling aperture <b>74</b>, and with a separate vibration node or relatively rigid vibration plate <b>30</b> affixed to the central and moving portion of diaphragm <b>40</b>.

Generally speaking, the softer and thinner the material of flexible portion <b>46</b>, and the more folds or bends such as bend <b>41</b>, the less force that will be necessary to move vibration plate <b>30</b> a given distance, and thus the less vibration force that will be transmitted to housing <b>72</b> and thus to handle portion <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In this embodiment curved surface <b>47</b> of flexible membrane <b>42</b> transitions smoothly to and matches with curved surface <b>33</b> of vibration plate <b>30</b>, and boundary edge <b>45</b> of vibration member <b>42</b> abuts against boundary edge <b>35</b> of vibration plate <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>), providing a graceful and elegant appearance as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a closeup view of area C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, illustrating the parts vibrating in operation.

Distance s represents the maximum left-to-right horizontal travel distance of the parts during vibration. Due to the floating or vibration-isolating action of the invention, the vibration at the vibration plate and massage node will be substantially uncoupled from the handle portion <b>12</b>. &#x201c;Substantially uncoupled&#x201d; can mean that horizontal travel distance experienced at the handle when the handle portion is unconstrained such as being suspended by a string for testing purposes, is less than 20% at the horizontal travel distance as measured at the vibration plate and the massage node. That is, the horizontal travel distance at the vibration plate and massage node will be at least five times as great as the horizontal travel distance experienced at the handle portion <b>12</b>. &#x201c;Substantially uncoupled&#x201d; can mean that no more than 20% of the total vibrational energy created by the vibration motor(s) will be transmitted to the handle portion, or that no more than 10% of the total vibrational energy created by the vibration motor(s) will be transmitted to the handle portion and thus felt by the user of the device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is an oblique bottom view of a second embodiment of an exemplary massage appliance of the invention in which the massage appliance includes two motors <b>50</b> and <b>60</b> which are mounted proximate respectively opposite ends of vibration plate <b>30</b>, the two motors having respective eccentric weights <b>52</b> and <b>62</b>, respectively. These two (or more) motors operating together can be used to spread or focus vibrational force depending the desired effect. In this embodiment, the user controls <b>16</b> can include separate ON/OFF and speed (intensity) controls for the separate motors. An electronic control unit could automatically vary the power applied to the separate motors over time, such as in coordinated rhythmic or pulsing patterns. In this embodiment both motors <b>50</b>, <b>60</b> rotate about the same axis, in this case providing primarily up-and-down (z-dimension) and side-to-side (y-dimension) vibration. In other embodiments, the different motors could be mounted in different orientations to provide different vibrational motions, such as first motor <b>50</b> providing y-z motion and second motor <b>60</b> providing x-y motion. Depending on the number, type, speed, and orientation of the motors used, the vibration plate <b>30</b> can be made to rock and move in various patterns depending on the desired vibration effect. Such movement patterns may be beneficial for some users.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The invention thus achieves a massager in which vibration at the massage node has been substantially isolated or uncoupled from the handle, significantly reducing a source of potential discomfort, fatigue, and/or even injury of the user.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It will be understood that the terms &#x201c;generally,&#x201d; &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; &#x201c;about,&#x201d; and &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; as used within the specification and the claims herein allow for a certain amount of variation from any exact dimensions, measurements, and arrangements, and that those terms should be understood within the context of the description and operation of the invention as disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">All features disclosed in the specification, including the claims, abstract, and drawings, and all the steps in any method or process disclosed, may be combined in any combination, except combinations where at least some of such features and/or steps are mutually exclusive.
