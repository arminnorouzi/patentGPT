file named 18923806501SEQ, created on May 30, 2022, with a size of 364 kilobytes. The Sequence Listing is incorporated herein by reference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to methods of treating subjects having a cerebrovascular disease with Neurogenic Locus Notch Homolog Protein 3 (NOTCH3) agents, and methods of identifying subjects having an increased risk of developing a cerebrovascular disease.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cerebrovascular disease includes any abnormality of the brain resulting from a pathologic process of a blood vessel. A pathologic process of a blood vessel includes any one or more of the following: an occlusion of a blood vessel lumen by thrombus or embolus, a rupture of a blood vessel, an altered permeability of a blood-vessel wall, and increased viscosity or other change in the quality of blood. Cerebrovascular disease is typically readily diagnosable because of how it manifests. Cerebrovascular disease typically manifests as a stroke. A stroke can be characterized as a sudden nonconvulsive, focal neurologic deficit. That is, stroke can be characterized as the death of brain tissue that results from lack of blood flow and insufficient oxygen to the brain. After heart disease and cancer, stroke is the leading cause of death in the United States. In the United States, there are approximately 500,000 cases of stroke annually. And these 500,000 cases give rise to about 175,000 fatalities.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) or CADASIL syndrome, is the most common form of hereditary stroke disorder. The most common clinical manifestations are migraine headaches and transient ischemic attacks or strokes, which usually occur between 40 and 50 years of age, although MRI is able to detect signs of the disease years prior to clinical manifestation of disease. The underlying pathology of CADASIL is progressive hypertrophy of the smooth muscle cells in blood vessels. No specific treatment for CADASIL is available. While most treatments for CADASIL patients' symptoms&#x2014;including migraine and stroke&#x2014;are similar to those without CADASIL, these treatments are almost exclusively empiric, as data regarding their benefit to CADASIL patients is limited.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Neurogenic Locus Notch Homolog Protein 3 (NOTCH3) is a receptor for membrane-bound ligands Jagged1, Jagged2, and Deltal to regulate cell-fate determination. Upon ligand activation through the released notch intracellular domain (NICD), it forms a transcriptional activator complex with RBPJ/RBPSUH and activates genes of the enhancer of split locus. NOTCH3 effects the implementation of differentiation, proliferation and apoptotic programs.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides methods of treating a subject having a cerebrovascular disease, the methods comprising administering a Neurogenic Locus Notch Homolog Protein 3 (NOTCH3) agent to the subject.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure also provides methods of treating a subject having a subcortical stroke, the methods comprising administering a NOTCH3 agent to the subject.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure also provides methods of treating a subject having an ischemic stroke, the methods comprising administering a NOTCH3 agent to the subject.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure also provides methods of treating a subject having a hemorrhagic stroke, the methods comprising administering a NOTCH3 agent to the subject.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure also provides methods of treating a subject having a parenchymal stroke, the methods comprising administering a NOTCH3 agent to the subject.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure also provides methods of treating a subject having cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), the methods comprising administering a NOTCH3 agent to the subject.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present disclosure also provides methods of treating a subject with a therapeutic agent that treats or inhibits a cerebrovascular disease, wherein the subject has a cerebrovascular disease, the methods comprising: determining whether the subject has a NOTCH3 missense variant nucleic acid molecule encoding a NOTCH3 predicted gain-of-function polypeptide by: obtaining or having obtained a biological sample from the subject;

In some embodiments, an isolated nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide is substantially free of other nucleic acid molecules or other polypeptides, particularly other nucleic acid molecules or polypeptides of animal origin. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide can be in a highly purified form, i.e., greater than 95% pure or greater than 99% pure.

One strand of a nucleic acid also refers to its complement.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As used herein, the term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; includes any animal, including mammals. Mammals include, but are not limited to, farm animals (such as, for example, horse, cow, pig), companion animals (such as, for example, dog, cat), laboratory animals (such as, for example, mouse, rat, rabbits), and non-human primates (such as, for example, apes and monkeys). In some embodiments, the subject is a human. In some embodiments, the subject is a patient under the care of a physician.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">A common variant SNP rs201680145 in the NOTCH3 gene in humans has been identified in accordance with the present disclosure to be associated with an increased risk of developing a cerebrovascular disease, such as CADASIL, subcortical stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or parenchymal stroke. For example, a genetic alteration that changes the cytosine at position 21,944 in the NOTCH3 reference genomic nucleic acid molecule (see, SEQ ID NO:1) to a thymine has been observed to indicate that the subject having such an alteration may have an increased risk of developing a cerebrovascular disease. It is believed that no variants of the NOTCH3 gene or protein have any known significant association, as shown by genome-wide analysis, with a cerebrovascular disease, such as subcortical stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or parenchymal stroke.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition, CADASIL was initially reported to be caused by autosomal dominant mutations of the NOTCH3 gene (Joutel et al., Nature, 1996, 383, 707-10), including rs201680145 (Singhal et al., Brain, 2004, 127, 2031-2038). These mutations were believed to lead to an abnormal accumulation of Notch 3 at the cytoplasmic membrane of vascular smooth muscle cells both in cerebral and extracerebral vessels (Joutel et al., J. Clin. Invest., 2000, 105, 597-605) seen as granular osmiophilic deposits on electron microscopy (Ruchoux et al., Acta Neuropathol., 1995, 89, 500-12). In addition, in many cases, leukoencephalopathy follows. All CADASIL pathogenic mutations in NOTCH3 share the common feature of adding or removing a Cys residue from one of 34 EGFR domains in the NOTCH3 extra-cellular domain, where each EGFR normally has 6 Cys residues that are highly conserved in human, mouse and zebrafish NOTCH3. Hundreds of such Cys-add-or-remove variants have been identified. However, the view that the NOTCH3 p.Arg1231Cys mutation is the causative of CADASIL was abandoned as incorrect because of the very high prevalence of this mutation (r5201680145) in South Asians, including, significantly surpassing the frequency that was expected based on CADASIL prevalence (Rutten et al., Ann. Clin. Transl. Neurol., 2016, 3, 844-853). Altogether, the genetic analyses described herein surprisingly indicate that the NOTCH3 gene and, in particular, a gain-of-function variant in the NOTCH3 gene, associates with an increased risk of developing a cerebrovascular disease, such as CADASIL, subcortical stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or parenchymal stroke. Therefore, subjects that have a NOTCH3 missense variant nucleic acid molecule encoding a NOTCH3 predicted gain-of-function polypeptide that have an increased risk of developing a cerebrovascular disease, such as CADASIL, subcortical stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or parenchymal stroke, may be treated such that the cerebrovascular disease is prevented, the symptoms thereof are reduced, and/or development of symptoms is repressed. Accordingly, the present disclosure provides methods of leveraging the identification of such NOTCH3 missense variant nucleic acid molecules in subjects to identify or stratify risk in such subjects of developing a cerebrovascular disease, such as CADASIL, subcortical stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or parenchymal stroke, or to diagnose subjects as having an increased risk of developing a cerebrovascular disease, such as CADASIL, subcortical stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, or parenchymal stroke, such that subjects at risk or subjects with active disease may be treated accordingly.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">For purposes of the present disclosure, any particular subject can be categorized as having one of three NOTCH3 genotypes: i) NOTCH3 reference; ii) heterozygous for a NOTCH3 missense variant nucleic acid molecule encoding a NOTCH3 predicted gain-of-function polypeptide; or iii) homozygous for a NOTCH3 missense variant nucleic acid molecule encoding a NOTCH3 predicted gain-of-function polypeptide. A subject is NOTCH3 reference when the subject does not have a copy of a NOTCH3 missense variant nucleic acid molecule encoding a NOTCH3 predicted gain-of-function polypeptide. A subject is heterozygous for a NOTCH3 missense variant nucleic acid molecule encoding a NOTCH3 predicted gain-of-function polypeptide when the subject has a single copy of a NOTCH3 missense variant nucleic acid molecule encoding a NOTCH3 predicted gain-of-function polypeptide. As used herein, a NOTCH3 missense variant nucleic acid molecule encoding a NOTCH3 predicted gain-of-function polypeptide is any NOTCH3 nucleic acid molecule (such as, a genomic nucleic acid molecule, an mRNA molecule, or a cDNA molecule) encoding a NOTCH3 polypeptide having a partial gain-of-function, a complete gain-of-function, a predicted partial gain-of-function, or a predicted complete gain-of-function. A subject who has a NOTCH3 polypeptide having a partial gain-of-function (or predicted partial gain-of-function) is hypomorphic for NOTCH3.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In any of the embodiments described herein, the NOTCH3 missense variant nucleic acid molecule encoding a NOTCH3 predicted gain-of-function polypeptide can be any nucleic acid molecule encoding a NOTCH3 Arg1178Cys, Arg1231Cys, or Arg1182Cys. In some embodiments, the NOTCH3 missense variant nucleic acid molecule encodes NOTCH3 Arg1178Cys, Arg1231Cys, or Arg1182Cys. A subject is homozygous for a NOTCH3 missense variant nucleic acid molecule encoding a NOTCH3 predicted gain-of-function polypeptide when the subject has two copies of a NOTCH3 missense variant nucleic acid molecule encoding a NOTCH3 predicted gain-of-function polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In any of the embodiments described herein, the NOTCH3 variant nucleic acid molecules can be any Cys-altering variant (they change from or to a cysteine residue). In some embodiments the Cys-altering variant is located within the 34 EGF-like repeats in the NOTCH3 extracellular domain (defined by Uniprot; see world wide web at &#x201c;uniprot.org/blast/? about=Q9UM47[1335-1373]&#x26;key=Domain)). In any of the embodiments described herein, the NOTCH3 variant nucleic acid molecules can be any of the variants listed in Table 1 (ENST00000263388).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0000"><tables

Briefly, the technology is based on oligonucleotides having phosphorothioate backbone linkages, wherein the backbone linkages comprise particular stereoisomers at particular positions. Inclusion of particular chiral structures at a particular location within an oligonucleotide can result in improvement in stability, activity, and specificity of cleavage of target nucleotides. The technology is based on chirally controlled (and/or stereochemically pure) oligonucleotide compositions comprising oligonucleotides defined by having: 1) a common base sequence and length; 2) a common pattern of backbone linkages; 3) a common pattern of backbone chiral centers; and 4) a common pattern of backbone P-modifications. Purity of a chirally controlled oligonucleotide composition can be controlled by stereoselectivity of each coupling step in its preparation process. The initial overall structure of stereochemically pure oligonucleotides (e.g., positioning and chirality of internucleotide linkages) is developed through rational design rules developed in structural studies of substrate-ligand complexes of interest, followed by screening of candidate oligonucleotides. The stereochemically pure preparations are generated in a solid support synthesis process, wherein the solid support is treated with various reagents in several synthesis cycles to achieve the stepwise elongation of a growing oligonucleotide chain with individual nucleotide units. The steps of each cycle include treatment with activating reagent, reaction with a chiral agent, stereospecific condensation, capping of unreacted &#x2014;OH groups with a protection group, a modification step used to install a modified internucleotidic linkage, and deblocking step to deprotect, for instance, a 5&#x2032;-OH group for subsequent cycle. The oligonucleotides can be antisense nucleic acid molecules, siRNAs, RNaseH guide sequences, etc. useful for a controlled cleavage of a target nucleic acid polymer, such as a transcript from an allele. The increased specificity for a particular sequence (e.g., allele or SNP) is achieved through overall reduction of cleavage sites targeted by chirally controlled oligonucleotides as compared to unmodified oligonucleotides.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0047">In some embodiments, the NOTCH3 agent comprises a nuclease agent that induces one or more nicks or double-strand breaks at a recognition sequence(s) or a DNA-binding protein that binds to a recognition sequence within a NOTCH3 genomic nucleic acid molecule. The recognition sequence can be located within a coding region of the NOTCH3 gene, or within regulatory regions that influence the expression of the gene. A recognition sequence of the DNA-binding protein or nuclease agent can be located in an intron, an exon, a promoter, an enhancer, a regulatory region, or any non-protein coding region. The recognition sequence can include or be proximate to the start codon of the NOTCH3 gene. For example, the recognition sequence can be located about 10, about 20, about 30, about 40, about 50, about 100, about 200, about 300, about 400, about 500, or about 1,000 nucleotides from the start codon. As another example, two or more nuclease agents can be used, each targeting a nuclease recognition sequence including or proximate to the start codon. As another example, two nuclease agents can be used, one targeting a nuclease recognition sequence including or proximate to the start codon, and one targeting a nuclease recognition sequence including or proximate to the stop codon, wherein cleavage by the nuclease agents can result in deletion of the coding region between the two nuclease recognition sequences. Any nuclease agent that induces a nick or double-strand break into a desired recognition sequence can be used in the methods and compositions disclosed herein. Any DNA-binding protein that binds to a desired recognition sequence can be used in the methods and compositions disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">Suitable nuclease agents and DNA-binding proteins for use herein include, but are not limited to, zinc finger protein or zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) pair, Transcription Activator-Like Effector (TALE) protein or Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease (TALEN), or Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems. The length of the recognition sequence can vary, and includes, for example, recognition sequences that are about 30 to about 36 bp for a zinc finger protein or ZFN pair, about 15 to about 18 bp for each ZFN, about 36 bp for a TALE protein or TALEN, and about 20 bp for a CRISPR/Cas guide RNA.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">In some embodiments, CRISPR/Cas systems can be used to modify a NOTCH3 genomic nucleic acid molecule within a cell. The methods and compositions disclosed herein can employ CRISPR-Cas systems by utilizing CRISPR complexes (comprising a guide RNA (gRNA) complexed with a Cas protein) for site-directed cleavage of NOTCH3 nucleic acid molecules.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">Cas proteins generally comprise at least one RNA recognition or binding domain that can interact with gRNAs. Cas proteins can also comprise nuclease domains (such as, for example, DNase or RNase domains), DNA binding domains, helicase domains, protein-protein interaction domains, dimerization domains, and other domains. Suitable Cas proteins include, for example, a wild type Cas9 protein and a wild type Cpf1 protein (such as, for example, FnCpf1). A Cas protein can have full cleavage activity to create a double-strand break in a NOTCH3 genomic nucleic acid molecule or it can be a nickase that creates a single-strand break in a NOTCH3 genomic nucleic acid molecule. Additional examples of Cas proteins include, but are not limited to, Cas1, Cas1B, Cast, Cas3, Cas4, Cas5, Cas5e (CasD), Cas6, Cas6e, Cas6f, Cas7, Cas8a1, Cas8a2, Cas8b, Cas8c, Cas9 (Csn1 or Csx12), Cas10, Cas10d, CasF, CasG, CasH, Csy1, Csy2, Csy3, Cse1 (CasA), Cse2 (Cas6), Cse3 (CasE), Cse4 (CasC), Csc1, Csc2, Csa5, Csn2, Csm2, Csm3, Csm4, Csm5, Csm6, Cmr1, Cmr3, Cmr4, Cmr5, Cmr6, Csb1, Csb2, Csb3, Csx17, Csx14, Csx10, Csx16, CsaX, Csx3, Csx1, Csx15, Csf1, Csf2, Csf3, Csf4, and Cu1966, and homologs or modified versions thereof. Cas proteins can also be operably linked to heterologous polypeptides as fusion proteins. For example, a Cas protein can be fused to a cleavage domain, an epigenetic modification domain, a transcriptional activation domain, or a transcriptional repressor domain. Cas proteins can be provided in any form. For example, a Cas protein can be provided in the form of a protein, such as a Cas protein complexed with a gRNA. Alternately, a Cas protein can be provided in the form of a nucleic acid molecule encoding the Cas protein, such as an RNA or DNA.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">In some embodiments, targeted genetic modifications of a NOTCH3 genomic nucleic acid molecules can be generated by contacting a cell with a Cas protein and one or more gRNAs that hybridize to one or more gRNA recognition sequences within a target genomic locus in the NOTCH3 genomic nucleic acid molecule. For example, a gRNA recognition sequence can be located within a region of SEQ ID NO:1. The gRNA recognition sequence can also include or be proximate to a position corresponding to position 21,944 according to SEQ ID NO:1. For example, the gRNA recognition sequence can be located about 1000, about 500, about 400, about 300, about 200, about 100, about 50, about 45, about 40, about 35, about 30, about 25, about 20, about 15, about 10, or about 5 nucleotides from a position corresponding to position 21,944 according to SEQ ID NO:1. The gRNA recognition sequence can include or be proximate to the start codon or the stop codon of a NOTCH3 genomic nucleic acid molecule. For example, the gRNA recognition sequence can be located about 10, about 20, about 30, about 40, about 50, about 100, about 200, about 300, about 400, about 500, or about 1,000 nucleotides from the start codon or the stop codon.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">The gRNA recognition sequences within a target genomic locus in a NOTCH3 genomic nucleic acid molecule are located near a Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence, which is a 2-6 base pair DNA sequence immediately following the DNA sequence targeted by the Cas9 nuclease. The canonical PAM is the sequence 5&#x2032;-NGG-3&#x2032; where &#x201c;N&#x201d; is any nucleobase followed by two guanine (&#x201c;G&#x201d;) nucleobases. gRNAs can transport Cas9 to anywhere in the genome for gene editing, but no editing can occur at any site other than one at which Cas9 recognizes a PAM. In addition, 5&#x2032;-NGA-3&#x2032; can be a highly efficient non-canonical PAM for human cells. Generally, the PAM is about 2 to about 6 nucleotides downstream of the DNA sequence targeted by the gRNA. The PAM can flank the gRNA recognition sequence. In some embodiments, the gRNA recognition sequence can be flanked on the 3&#x2032; end by the PAM. In some embodiments, the gRNA recognition sequence can be flanked on the 5&#x2032; end by the PAM. For example, the cleavage site of Cas proteins can be about 1 to about 10 base pairs, about 2 to about 5 base pairs, or 3 base pairs upstream or downstream of the PAM sequence. In some embodiments (such as when Cas9 from <i>S. pyogenes </i>or a closely related Cas9 is used), the PAM sequence of the non-complementary strand can be 5&#x2032;-NGG-3&#x2032;, where N is any DNA nucleotide and is immediately 3&#x2032; of the gRNA recognition sequence of the non-complementary strand of the target DNA. As such, the PAM sequence of the complementary strand would be 5&#x2032;-CCN-3&#x2032;, where N is any DNA nucleotide and is immediately 5&#x2032; of the gRNA recognition sequence of the complementary strand of the target DNA.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">A gRNA is an RNA molecule that binds to a Cas protein and targets the Cas protein to a specific location within a NOTCH3 genomic nucleic acid molecule. An exemplary gRNA is a gRNA effective to direct a Cas enzyme to bind to or cleave a NOTCH3 genomic nucleic acid molecule, wherein the gRNA comprises a DNA-targeting segment that hybridizes to a gRNA recognition sequence within the NOTCH3 genomic nucleic acid molecule that includes or is proximate to a position corresponding to position 21,944 according to SEQ ID NO:1. For example, a gRNA can be selected such that it hybridizes to a gRNA recognition sequence that is located about 5, about 10, about 15, about 20, about 25, about 30, about 35, about 40, about 45, about 50, about 100, about 200, about 300, about 400, about 500, or about 1,000 nucleotides from a position corresponding to position 21,944 according to SEQ ID NO:1. Other exemplary gRNAs comprise a DNA-targeting segment that hybridizes to a gRNA recognition sequence present within a NOTCH3 genomic nucleic acid molecule that includes or is proximate to the start codon or the stop codon.

In some embodiments, the vectors comprise any one or more of the nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein and a heterologous nucleic acid. The vectors can be viral or nonviral vectors capable of transporting a nucleic acid molecule. In some embodiments, the vector is a plasmid or cosmid (such as, for example, a circular double-stranded DNA into which additional DNA segments can be ligated). In some embodiments, the vector is a viral vector, wherein additional DNA segments can be ligated into the viral genome. Expression vectors include, but are not limited to, plasmids, cosmids, retroviruses, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses (AAV), plant viruses such as cauliflower mosaic virus and tobacco mosaic virus, yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs), Epstein-Barr (EBV)-derived episomes, and other expression vectors known in the art.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0191">Desired regulatory sequences for mammalian host cell expression can include, for example, viral elements that direct high levels of polypeptide expression in mammalian cells, such as promoters and/or enhancers derived from retroviral LTRs, cytomegalovirus (CMV) (such as, for example, CMV promoter/enhancer), Simian Virus 40 (SV40) (such as, for example, SV40 promoter/enhancer), adenovirus, (such as, for example, the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP)), polyoma and strong mammalian promoters such as native immunoglobulin and actin promoters. Methods of expressing polypeptides in bacterial cells or fungal cells (such as, for example, yeast cells) are also well known. A promoter can be, for example, a constitutively active promoter, a conditional promoter, an inducible promoter, a temporally restricted promoter (such as, for example, a developmentally regulated promoter), or a spatially restricted promoter (such as, for example, a cell-specific or tissue-specific promoter).</p><p id="p-0195" num="0192">Percent identity (or percent complementarity) between particular stretches of nucleotide sequences within nucleic acid molecules or amino acid sequences within polypeptides can be determined routinely using BLAST programs (basic local alignment search tools) and PowerBLAST programs (Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol., 1990, 215, 403-410; Zhang and Madden, Genome Res., 1997, 7, 649-656) or by using the Gap program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix, Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, Madison Wis.), using default settings, which uses the algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Adv.

In other words, the residue (such as, for example, nucleotide or amino acid) number or residue (such as, for example, nucleotide or amino acid) position of a particular polymer is designated with respect to the reference sequence rather than by the actual numerical position of the residue within the particular nucleotide or nucleotide sequence. For example, a particular nucleotide sequence can be aligned to a reference sequence by introducing gaps to optimize residue matches between the two sequences. In these cases, although the gaps are present, the numbering of the residue in the particular nucleotide or nucleotide sequence is made with respect to the reference sequence to which it has been aligned.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0195">For example, a nucleic acid molecule comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a NOTCH3 polypeptide, wherein the nucleotide sequence comprises a thymine at a position corresponding to position 21,944 according to SEQ ID NO:2 means that if the nucleotide sequence of the NOTCH3 genomic nucleic acid molecule is aligned to the sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, the NOTCH3 sequence has a thymine residue at the position that corresponds to position 21,944 of SEQ ID NO:2. The same applies for mRNA molecules comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a NOTCH3 polypeptide, wherein the nucleotide sequence comprises a uracil at a position corresponding to position 3,781 according to SEQ ID NO:8, and cDNA molecules comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a NOTCH3 polypeptide, wherein the nucleotide sequence comprises a thymine at a position corresponding to position 3,781 according to SEQ ID NO:18. In other words, these phrases refer to a nucleic acid molecule encoding a NOTCH3 polypeptide, wherein the genomic nucleic acid molecule has a nucleotide sequence that comprises a thymine residue that is homologous to the thymine residue at position 21,944 of SEQ ID NO:2 (or wherein the mRNA molecule has a nucleotide sequence that comprises a uracil residue that is homologous to the uracil residue at position 3,781 of SEQ ID NO:8, or wherein the cDNA molecule has a nucleotide sequence that comprises a thymine residue that is homologous to the uracil residue at position 3,781 of SEQ ID NO:18).</p><p id="p-0199" num="0196">As described herein, a position within a NOTCH3 genomic nucleic acid molecule that corresponds to position 21,944 according to SEQ ID NO:2, for example, can be identified by performing a sequence alignment between the nucleotide sequence of a particular NOTCH3 nucleic acid molecule and the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:2. A variety of computational algorithms exist that can be used for performing a sequence alignment to identify a nucleotide position that corresponds to, for example, position 21,944 in SEQ ID NO:2. For example, by using the NCBI BLAST algorithm (Altschul et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1997, 25, 3389-3402) or CLUSTALW software (Sievers and Higgins, Methods Mol.
