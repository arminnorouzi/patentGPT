To meet this requirement, development has been made of thin-film circuit boards that enable high-speed communication at a high frequency.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Realization of high-speed communication at high frequency requires an insulator with a high impedance that allows for the maintenance of electrical insulation even at high frequencies. With the relationship of inverse proportion of an impedance to the frequency and dielectric constant (Dk) formed in an insulator, as low a dielectric constant as possible is advantageous for maintaining insulation at high frequencies.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the case of general polyimides, however, their dielectric properties fall short of a level excellent enough to maintain sufficient insulation in high-frequency communication.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In addition, it has been reported that insulators with lower dielectric properties are more likely to reduce undesired stray capacitance and noise generation in a thin-film circuit board, thereby significantly removing causes of communication latency.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, a polyimide with low-dielectric properties is now accepted as an important factor above all else in the performance of a thin-film circuit board.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">During high-frequency communication, dielectric dissipation through polyimide inevitably occurs. Since dielectric dissipation factor (Df), which is a degree of electrical energy loss in a thin-film circuit board, closely correlates with the signal propagation delay that determines communication speed, maintenance of the dielectric dissipation factor at as low a level as possible is recognized as an important factor for the performance of a thin-film circuit board.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Currently used for polyimide synthesis is a general two-step method in which acid dianhydride monomers are reacted with diamine monomers to synthesize the precursor polyamic acid (PAA), followed by imidiziation of the polyamic acid.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this method, the preparation of polyamic acid is achieved through the ring opening polyaddition of acid dianhydride monomers with diamine monomers in a reaction solvent. The solvents mainly used for this reaction are accounted for by polar organic solvents such as N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, meta-cresol, etc.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the imidization step, thermal imidization, chemical imidization, or a combination thereof is applied to the polyamic acid prepared in the polyamic acid synthesis step.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Chemical imidization is a process in which a solution of the precursor polyamic acid is heated at 160&#xb0; C. or higher in the presence of a dehydrating agent represented by an acid anhydride such as acetic anhydride, etc. and an imidizing catalyst represented by tertiary amines.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Thermal imidization is accounted for by a process in which a solution of the precursor polyamic acid is applied to a substrate and the solvent is evaporated, followed by heating at 250 to 350&#xb0; C. in the absence of a chemical dehydrating agent and a catalyst.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As stated above, the conventional polyimide synthesis methods take the way of passing via polyamic acid. By contrast, a method for directly synthesizing a polyimide from monomers was also developed. In relation thereto, reference may be made to Advances in Polymer Science, 140: 1-22, 1999, which discloses the synthesis of polyimide by preparing salts of acid dianhydride monomers and diamine monomers and heating the salts.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">However, these methods adopt many synthesis steps which are somewhat cumbersome and give rise to an increase in production cost in addition to suffering from the disadvantage of generating waste heat due to a heating process at high temperatures.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Furthermore, the organic solvents used might produce environmental pollution.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">RELATED ART DOCUMENT</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0020" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0019">(Patent literature 1) 1.
