An electronic device with wireless communications capabilities has wireless communications circuitry that includes one or more antennas. Wireless transmitter circuitry in the wireless communications circuitry generates radio-frequency signals using a local oscillator. The antennas transmit the radio-frequency signals.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It can be challenging to form satisfactory wireless transmitter circuitry for an electronic device. If care is not taken in the wireless transmitter circuitry design, harmonics of the local oscillator can undesirably degrade the radio-frequency signals transmitted by the antennas.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An electronic device may include wireless circuitry for performing wireless communications. The wireless circuitry may include a baseband processor, a transmitter, and an antenna. The transmitter may include a local oscillator generator and a harmonic rejection mixer. The local oscillator generator may generate local oscillator (LO) waveforms. The harmonic rejection mixer may include a programmable delay line, a mixer array, an adjustable load, and a controller. The programmable delay line may generate a set of LO phases based on the LO waveforms. The harmonic rejection mixer may be operable in a transmit mode and in a calibration mode.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The mixer array may include a set of mixer circuits. Each mixer circuit may have a first input and a second input. The first input may receive a respective one of the LO phases. The second input may be coupled to an input path through an input switch. The second input may also be coupled to the first input of the next mixer circuit in the mixer array through an inter-mixer switch. The adjustable load may include a set of switches. In the transmit mode, the input switches in the mixer array may be closed, the inter-mixer switches in the mixer array may be open, and the set of switches in the adjustable load may be closed. The mixer array may generate radio-frequency signals on an output path based on input signals on the input path and the set of LO phases generated by the programmable delay line. The adjustable load may amplify the radio-frequency signals for transmission by an antenna.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the calibration mode, the input switches in the mixer array may be open, the inter-mixer switches in the mixer array may be closed, and the set of switches in the adjustable load may be open. The mixer array may act as a phase detector and generate a direct current (DC) voltage on the output path based on the LO phases generated by the programmable delay line. The programmable load may output the DC voltage. An analog-to-digital converter may generate a digital output based on the amplified DC voltage. The controller may store the digital output. The controller may sweep through different phase codes provided to the programmable delay line while gathering and storing the digital output. The controller may process the stored digital output to identify a zero crossing point of the DC voltage. The controller may identify a calibrated phase code associated with the zero crossing point and may provide the calibrated phase code to the programmable delay line. The programmable delay line may generate calibrated LO phases for the mixer array for use during subsequent radio-frequency signal transmission. This may allow the harmonic rejection mixer to cancel out harmonic interference from harmonic modes of the LO even as operating conditions for the device change over time.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An aspect of the disclosure provides an electronic device. The electronic device can have a mixer array. The mixer array can upconvert input signals on an input path to produce radio-frequency signals on an output path. The mixer array can have a first mixer circuit. The first mixer circuit can have a first input that receives a first local oscillator (LO) phase, a second input that receives the input signals, and a first output coupled to the output path. The mixer array can have a second mixer circuit. The second mixer circuit can have a third input that receives a second LO phase that is phase-delayed with respect to the first LO phase, a fourth input that receives the input signals, and a second output coupled to the output path. The mixer array can have an inter-mixer switch coupled between the second input of the first mixer circuit and the third input of the second mixer circuit.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An aspect of the disclosure provides a method for operating mixer circuitry. The method can include, with a programmable delay line, generating a first local oscillator (LO) phase, a second LO phase, and a third LO phase. The second LO phase can be phase-delayed with respect to the first LO phase. The third LO phase can be phase-delayed with respect to the second LO phase. The method can include, with a first mixer circuit in a mixer array, mixing the first LO phase with the second LO phase. The method can include, with a second mixer circuit in the mixer array, mixing the second LO phase with the third LO phase. The method can include, with the mixer array, outputting a direct current (DC) voltage onto an output path. The DC voltage can be produced by at least the first and second mixer circuits. The method can include, with an adjustable load coupled to the output path, amplifying the DC voltage to generate an amplified DC voltage. The method can include, with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) coupled to the output path, generating a digital output based on the amplified DC voltage. The method can include, with a controller coupled to the ADC, adjusting the first, second, and third LO phases based on the digital output.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An aspect of the disclosure provides an electronic device.

In this way, controller <b>54</b> may periodically or occasionally calibrate the operation of harmonic rejection mixer <b>38</b> so the harmonic rejection mixer can minimize EVM and spectral regrowth in the radio-frequency signals even as device temperature, operating frequency, or other device conditions change over time.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0081">In general, different zero-crossing points may be produced as the frequency of the radio-frequency signals changes over time. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a plot showing how different frequencies may produce different zero-crossing points that are used for calibrating harmonic rejection mixer <b>38</b>. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> plots the DC voltage V<sub>DC </sub>produced by mixer array <b>46</b> and adjustable load <b>50</b> (e.g., as identified by the digital outputs DO stored by controller <b>54</b> at each iteration of step <b>126</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) as a function of the phase code from the phase code sweep that produced the DC voltage V<sub>DC</sub>. Phase code is plotted on the horizontal axis as a phase code index, where each phase code index corresponds to a respective phase code from the sweep of phase codes performed while processing the steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> (e.g., a phase code of &#x201c;25&#x201d; represents the 25<sup>th </sup>phase code from the sweep, a phase code of &#x201c;50&#x201d; represents the 50<sup>th </sup>phase code from the sweep, etc.).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0082">Curve <b>144</b> plots the DC voltage V<sub>DC </sub>produced using a first frequency channel, curve <b>146</b> plots the DC voltage V<sub>DC </sub>produced using a second frequency channel, and curve <b>148</b> plots the DC voltage V<sub>DC </sub>produced using a third frequency channel. Curves <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, and <b>148</b> are shown as only having a single zero crossing point in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> for the sake of clarity (e.g., the 180 degree or 240 degree zero crossing point). As shown by curves <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>, and <b>148</b>, the particular frequency channel that is used will change the zero crossing point of DC voltage V<sub>DC</sub>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0083">In scenarios where curve <b>144</b> is produced, controller <b>54</b> may identify the corresponding zero crossing point <b>150</b> of DC voltage V<sub>DC </sub>(e.g., the point where curve <b>150</b> crosses a voltage of zero). Controller <b>54</b> may use the phase code corresponding to zero crossing point <b>150</b> to configure the adjustable capacitances <b>68</b> in programmable delay line <b>42</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, controller <b>54</b> may use the 25<sup>th </sup>phase code from the sweep to configure the adjustable capacitances <b>68</b> in programmable delay line <b>42</b>. This may configure programmable delay line <b>42</b> to generate the optimal LO phases LOi for mitigating harmonic interference while operating using the first frequency channel.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0084">Similarly, in scenarios where curve <b>146</b> is produced, controller <b>54</b> may identify the corresponding zero crossing point <b>152</b> of DC voltage V<sub>DC </sub>(e.g., the point where curve <b>146</b> crosses a voltage of zero). Controller <b>54</b> may use the phase code corresponding to zero crossing point <b>152</b> to configure the adjustable capacitances <b>68</b> in programmable delay line <b>42</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, controller <b>54</b> may use the 50<sup>th </sup>phase code from the sweep to configure the adjustable capacitances <b>68</b> in programmable delay line <b>42</b>. This may configure programmable delay line <b>42</b> to generate the optimal LO phases LOi for mitigating harmonic interference while operating using the second frequency channel.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0085">Likewise, in scenarios where curve <b>148</b> is produced, controller <b>54</b> may identify the corresponding zero crossing point <b>154</b> of DC voltage V<sub>DC </sub>(e.g., the point where curve <b>148</b> crosses a voltage of zero). Controller <b>54</b> may use the phase code corresponding to zero crossing point <b>154</b> to configure the adjustable capacitances <b>68</b> in programmable delay line <b>42</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, controller <b>54</b> may use the 75<sup>th </sup>phase code from the sweep to configure the adjustable capacitances <b>68</b> in programmable delay line <b>42</b>. This may configure programmable delay line <b>42</b> to generate the optimal LO phases LOi for mitigating harmonic interference while operating using the third frequency channel.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0086">The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is merely illustrative. In practice, curves <b>144</b>-<b>148</b> may have other shapes. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates how different zero crossing points and thus different optimal phase codes may be identified as operating frequency changes, the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> may be used to identify the optimal phase code as device temperature changes over time, as frequency changes, and/or as any other operating conditions change over time. This may serve to reduce the interference effects of harmonics of the LO on the radio-frequency signals output by transmitter <b>28</b> (e.g., radio-frequency signals RF&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) by as much as 10 dB or more, thereby optimizing the radio-frequency performance of device <b>10</b>. While the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b></figref> describe harmonic rejection mixer <b>38</b> as being formed in a wireless transmitter such as transmitter <b>28</b>, harmonic rejection mixer <b>38</b> may additionally or alternatively be formed in a wireless receiver (e.g., for performing harmonic rejection operations on signals received by antenna(s) <b>30</b>).</p><p id="p-0092" num="0087">Device <b>10</b> may gather and/or use personally identifiable information.
