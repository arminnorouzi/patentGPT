For energy detection based sensing, a basic unit for sensing is defined as a sensing slot. A channel with a duration of s sensing slot is declared as idle, if the transmitter senses the channel during the sensing slot duration and determines that the detected power for a given portion of the sensing slot duration is less than a sensing threshold X<sub>Thresh</sub>, or declared as busy otherwise.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In NR Rel-16, an operation with shared spectrum channel access has been supported for 5 GHz unlicensed band and 6 GHz unlicensed band. More precisely, for 5 GHz unlicensed band and 6 GHz unlicensed band, the sensing slot is defined as T<sub>s1</sub>=9 us, and the sensing threshold can be adapted according to a maximum energy detection threshold.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In a DL, a gNB accessing a channel on which transmission(s) are performed, may set the energy detection threshold (X<sub>Thresh</sub>) to be less than or equal to the maximum energy detection threshold X<sub>Thresh_max</sub>, wherein X<sub>Thresh_max </sub>is determined as shown in TABLE 1.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001"

One or more of the components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> can be implemented in specialized circuitry configured to perform the noted functions or one or more of the components can be implemented by one or more processors executing instructions to perform the noted functions.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0187">In this embodiment, the method <b>1500</b> is performed in a wireless communication system operating with shared spectrum channel access by a UE or BS, collectively referred to as &#x201c;the device.&#x201d; The method begins with the device determining whether an antenna configuration for channel sensing is omni-directional or directional (step <b>1505</b>). For example, in step <b>1505</b>, if the antenna configuration for channel sensing is determined to be directional, the device determines one or more beam directions for the antenna configuration and each beam direction is quasi-co-located (QCLed) with a reference signal. In some embodiments, the one or more beam directions for the antenna configuration for channel sensing are aligned with one or more beam directions for DL transmissions.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0188">The device then determines a channel sensing threshold (step <b>1510</b>). For example, in step <b>1510</b>, the device may determine the channel sensing threshold based on two parts of channel sensing threshold. A first part of the channel sensing threshold is common for omni-directional and directional antenna configurations. A second part of the channel sensing threshold is dependent on the antenna configuration. In some embodiments, the second part of the channel sensing threshold is zero, if the antenna configuration is determined to be omni-directional. Additionally, the second part of the channel sensing threshold may be greater than zero, if the antenna configuration is determined to be directional.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0189">Thereafter, the device performs a channel sensing procedure (step <b>1515</b>). For example, in step <b>1515</b>, the device performs a channel sensing procedure to determine whether the channel is idle based on the antenna configuration and the channel sensing threshold. In some embodiments, the channel is determined to be idle in the channel sensing procedure, if energy detection for each beam direction of the one or more beam directions is below the channel sensing threshold. The device then transmits DL data over the channel (step <b>1520</b>). For example, in step <b>1520</b>, the device transmits DL data over the channel if the channel is sensed as idle in the channel sensing procedure.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0190">The above flowcharts illustrate example methods that can be implemented in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure and various changes could be made to the methods illustrated in the flowcharts herein.
