The forming the substrate structure (S<b>130</b>), the forming the first redistribution structure (S<b>110</b>), and the forming the second redistribution structure (S<b>120</b>) may be independently and separately performed. That is, in some embodiments, the forming the substrate structure (S<b>130</b>), the forming the first redistribution structure (S<b>110</b>), and the forming the second redistribution structure (S<b>120</b>) may be performed in parallel. The independently and separately manufactured first and second redistribution structures may be coupled to the front and rear surfaces of the substrate structure, respectively, so as to be electrically connected to a semiconductor chip and/or a vertical connection conductor of the substrate structure, thereby manufacturing a semiconductor package. The semiconductor package may be a package-on-package (POP).</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A lower package of a package-on-package (POP) structure according to the related art may include a first redistribution conductor for connecting to a main substrate and a second redistribution conductor for electrically connecting to an upper package. Since the first and second redistribution conductors include redistribution layers and redistribution vias having a fine pitch, when the first and second redistribution conductors are formed in sequence (i.e., first the first redistribution conductor is formed and then the second redistribution conductor is formed on the first redistribution conductor), together with the substrate structure on which the semiconductor chip is molded, a considerable period of turnaround time (TAT) may be consumed. Here, the turnaround time (TAT) may be a total time required for manufacturing a semiconductor package from a semiconductor wafer on which an integrated circuit is formed. Also, in this case, since warpage, process errors, thermal deformation, or the like, occur during the multilayer sequential stacking process, it may be difficult to form the second redistribution conductor that is formed relatively later with a fine pitch.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In various example embodiments, the first and second redistribution structures including the redistribution layer with a fine pitch and the substrate structure on which the semiconductor chip is molded may be manufactured in parallel in independent manufacturing processes as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and the elements may be combined with each other to manufacture a semiconductor package, thereby reducing the turnaround time (TAT). Also, since the first and second redistribution structures are manufactured in independent manufacturing processes, the amount of distortion created during the multilayer stacking process may be reduced, and the first and second redistribution structures having the redistribution conductors and redistribution vias having a fine pitch may be manufactured. As described above, the turnaround time (TAT) may be a total time required for manufacturing a semiconductor package from a semiconductor wafer on which an integrated circuit is formed. Thus, by forming the first and second redistribution layers independently and separately, the TAT may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The forming the first redistribution structure (S<b>110</b>) may include forming a front redistribution structure including redistribution conductors and redistribution vias having a fine pitch. The front redistribution structure may refer to a redistribution structure disposed adjacent to a main substrate when the semiconductor package is surface-mounted on the main substrate. For example, in the forming the first redistribution structure (S<b>110</b>), a first redistribution structure including at least one first insulating layer, and a first redistribution conductor disposed in at least one first insulating layer, and having a first surface to which at least a portion of the first redistribution conductor is exposed may be formed.

The rear redistribution structure may refer to a redistribution structure disposed opposite to the front redistribution structure adjacent to the main substrate when the semiconductor package is surface-mounted on the main substrate. For example, in the forming the second redistribution structure (S<b>120</b>), a second redistribution structure including at least one second insulating layer, and a second redistribution conductor disposed in at least one second insulating layer, and having a second surface to which at least a portion of the second redistribution conductor is exposed may be formed.

For example, in the forming the substrate structure (S<b>130</b>), the substrate structure including the semiconductor chip having an active surface on which a connection terminal is disposed, the vertical connection conductor disposed around the semiconductor chip, and an encapsulant encapsulating at least a portion of the semiconductor chip and the vertical connection conductor, and having a front surface to which at least a portion of each of the connection terminal and the vertical connection conductor and a rear surface disposed opposite to the front surface, to which at least a portion of the vertical connection conductor is exposed.

That is, in some embodiments, the first redistribution structure may be attached to the front surface of the substrate structure using an anisotropic conductive film including conductive particles, and the second redistribution structure may be attached to the rear surface of the substrate structure using an anisotropic conductive film including conductive particles.
