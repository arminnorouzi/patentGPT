No. 5,858,165 A discloses a mechanism for retaining a bead with filler. The mechanism comprising: a ring body; a plurality of extending/retracting means which are separately provided at the ring body at equal intervals in the circumferential direction of the ring body and an arc-shaped retaining body which is provided at each of the plurality of the extending/retracting means and which can retain a bead with a filler. The retaining body is provided with a plurality of permanent magnets to retain a bead with a filler. The extending/retracting means further includes a pair of swing links which are separately disposed in the radial direction of the ring body, and the base end portions of the swing links being rotatably connected to the ring body; and a connecting link which is rotatably connected to each of the distal end portions of the pair of swing links. The retaining body is provided at the inner end portion of the connecting link such that, when the extending/retracting means is driven, all of the plurality of the retaining bodies are positioned on the same circle which centers around the central axis of the ring body.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Even if all of the retaining bodies slightly move from the predetermined positions in the radial direction of the ring body to the radial direction outer side or to the radial direction inner side, the line through the connecting link practically intersects the central axis of the ring body. Hence, beads with fillers having slightly different radii thus can be retained with the same retaining bodies. In a case in which the radius of the retaining bead with the filler is changed considerably, the retaining bodies are replaced by alternative retaining bodies having a radius of curvature that is closer to the radius of the bead to be retained.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A disadvantage of the known mechanism for retaining a bead is that the retaining body has a constant radius of curvature. This is fine when the radii of the beads to be retained only vary slightly. However, when the variation is relatively large, the radius of curvature no longer corresponds to the curvature of the bead to be retained. When the radius of curvature of the retaining body is too large or too small for the bead to be retained, the retaining body may extend radially inside the inner contour of the bead where it may interfere with the placement of the bead on a drum or it may only partially retain the bead along its retaining surface, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>B and <b>7</b>C</figref>. Consequently, only beads with a slightly different radius can be retained reliably.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to provide a bead retaining member, a bead retaining device comprising said bead retaining member and a bead handling assembly comprising said bead retaining device, wherein beads with different radii can be retained more reliably.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a first aspect, the invention provides a bead retaining member for retaining a bead in a retaining plane, wherein the bead retaining member comprises a body having a concave first concave edge extending in said retaining plane, wherein the bead retaining member further comprises one or more retaining elements which are distributed over the body along said first concave edge, for retaining a bead of a first size along a first retaining curve having a first retaining radius and for retaining a bead of a second size along a second retaining curve having a second retaining radius larger than the first retaining radius, wherein the first retaining curve intersects with the second retaining curve at a first intersection point and a second intersection point spaced apart from the first intersection point, wherein the first concave edge is non-circular and is located radially outside of the second retaining curve in a center region of the first concave edge between the first intersection point and the second intersection point and radially outside of the first retaining curve in a first lateral region of the first concave edge opposite the center region with respect to the first intersection point and a second lateral region of the first concave edge opposite to the center region with respect to the second intersection point.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The bead retaining member, together with a plurality of similar or identical bead retaining members, can be positioned at a radius corresponding to a bead to be retained. The non-circularity of the first concave edge enables the bead retaining member to retain beads of different radii. In particular, the bead retaining member is arranged for retaining a first bead with a first bead radius along the first retaining curve and for retaining a second bead with a second bead radius, larger than the first bead radius, along the second retaining curve. Both beads, and any bead with a radius between the first bead radius and the second bead radius, can be retained with the same bead retaining member, without requiring replacement of said bead retaining member by an alternative bead retaining member. In both cases, the body of the bead retaining member does not extend within the contour or the inner radius of the respective bead. Hence, interference with the tire building drum or other components of a bead handling assembly can be prevented. More specifically, as the first concave edge is located radially outside the first retaining curve in the lateral regions and radially outside the second retaining curve in the center region, the first concave edge does not extend inside of or radially inwards beyond the inner edge of the first bead or the second bead. Thus, damage to the tire building drum or tire components supported thereon can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment the first concave edge is at least partially concentric to the first retaining curve in the center region. Additionally or alternatively, the first concave edge is at least partially concentric to the second retaining curve in the first lateral region and/or the second lateral region. In this way, the first retaining curve can be as close as possible to or coincide with the first concave edge at the center region and/or the lateral regions. More in particular, the one or more retaining elements can be placed as close as possible to the first concave edge to reliably retain the bead along the first or second retaining curve as close as possible to the first concave edge.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further embodiment the second retaining radius is at least five percent larger than the first retaining radius, and preferably at least ten percent. The greater the difference in radii, the greater the range of beads that can be retained to said bead retaining member.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a further embodiment the first concave edge in the center region extends along the first retaining curve within a range of less than three millimeters from said first retaining curve. Additionally or alternatively, the first concave edge in the first lateral region and/or the second lateral region extends along the second retaining curve within a range of less than three millimeters from said second retaining curve. Again, in this way, the first retaining curve can be as close as possible to or coincide with the first concave edge at the center region and/or the lateral regions. More in particular, the one or more retaining elements can be placed as close as possible to the first concave edge to reliably retain the bead along the first or second retaining curve as close as possible to the first concave edge.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a further embodiment the first concave edge is symmetrical in the first lateral region and the second lateral region about a plane of symmetry in the center region. Because of the symmetry, the bead can be retained reliably and/or uniformly across the width of the bead retaining member.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a further embodiment the first retaining curve has a first middle ordinate, wherein the second retaining curve has a second middle ordinate that is in-line with the first middle ordinate. Preferably, the second middle ordinate only partially overlaps with the first middle ordinate. In other words, both retaining curves are aligned and/or centered with respect to each other.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further embodiment the body further comprises a second concave edge extending in the retaining plane. Preferably, the body is rotatable about an inverting axis perpendicular to the retaining plane such that the first concave edge and the second concave edge can interchange positions. The second concave edge may have retaining curves with different radii to retain beads with different bead radii. Hence, when the radii of the retaining curves are chosen correctly, the range of beads that can be retained to the same bead retaining member can be increased significantly.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a further embodiment the one or more retaining elements are magnets, preferably permanent magnets. The beads typically contain ferromagnetic material. Hence, the magnets can effectively retain the beads to the bead retaining member.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a second aspect, the invention provides a bead retaining device comprising a bead retaining member according to the embodiment of the first aspect of the invention that introduced the inverting axis, wherein the bead retaining device further comprises an annular frame extending circumferentially about a central axis perpendicular to the retaining plane, wherein the bead retaining device comprises a mounting member for receiving the bead retaining member at the frame in at least two orientations about the inverting axis, wherein the bead retaining member is movable between a fixed state in which the orientation of the bead retaining member about the inverting axis is fixed with respect to the mounting member and a partially loosened state in which the bead retaining member is rotatable about the inverting axis relative to the mounting member.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">By not loosening the fastener completely, the bead retaining member can remain connected to the mounting member and/or the frame while it is rotated into a different orientation. Hence, accidental release of the bead retaining members from the frame can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment thereof, the bead retaining member is movable with respect to the frame in a direction transverse to the retaining plane, wherein the bead retaining device further comprises one or more biasing members for biasing the bead retaining member away from the frame in a direction transverse to the retaining plane. Thus, when the bead retaining member encounters an obstacle, e.g. when the bead retaining member is misaligned with respect to a tire building drum, said bead retaining member can be displaced with respect to the frame. Hence, damage to the retaining member or the obstacle can be prevented. Preferably, a displacement sensor is placed between the biasing member and the frame. Thus, an excessive movement of one of the bead retaining member with respect to the frame can be detected and the movement of the beading retaining device can be interrupted automatically in response to said detection.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In a further embodiment the bead retaining device comprises a fastener for fixing and partially loosening the bead retaining member with respect to the mounting member. Preferably, the fastener is a bolt. The bead retaining member can thus be allowed to move into the partially loosened state by loosening the fastener, i.e. by partially unscrewing the bolt.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In alternative embodiment thereof the bead retaining device comprises a fastener for mounting the bead retaining member to the mounting member, wherein the bead retaining member is movable with respect to the fastener between the fixed state and the partially loosened state, wherein the bead retaining device further comprises a biasing member for biasing the bead retaining member into the fixed state. Preferably, the fastener is a bolt and/or the biasing member is a spring. An operator can conveniently move the bead retaining member relative to the mounting member against the force of the biasing member to allow for the reorientation of said bead retaining member. Once, the bead retaining member is correctly positioned, the operator can let go of the bead retaining member to allow the bead retaining member to return to the fixed state.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a third aspect, the invention provides a bead retaining device comprising a plurality of bead retaining members according to any of the aforementioned embodiments of the first aspect of the invention, wherein the bead retaining device further comprises an annular frame extending circumferentially about a central axis perpendicular to the retaining plane, wherein the frame has an inner frame edge that forms a frame opening for receiving a tire building drum, wherein the bead retaining members are movable in a radial direction perpendicular to the central axis between a first radial position at or inside the frame opening and a second radial position radially inward with respect to said first radial position, wherein the first retaining curve is concentric to the central axis in one radial position of the bead retaining members between the first radial position and the second radial position and the second retaining curve is concentric to the central axis in another radial position between the first radial position and the second radial position.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The retaining curves can thus be optimized for specific radial positions for retaining the first bead with the first bead radius, the second bead with the second bead radius and any beads with a bead radius between the first bead radius and the second bead radius.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment the bead retaining device further comprises a drive assembly for driving the plurality of bead retaining members relative to the frame in a radial direction. Preferably, the drive assembly comprises a plurality of linear actuators for driving the movement of each of the bead retaining members in the radial direction. More preferably, each of the linear actuators comprises a set of a pinion and a rack mounted between the frame and a respective one of the bead retaining members. Most preferably, the drive assembly further comprises a plurality of planet gears, each associated with a respective one of the pinions, and a ring gear for driving said planet gears. The interaction between the planet gears and the ring gear allows for the radial movement of the bead retaining members to be synchronized.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a fourth aspect, the invention provides a bead handling assembly comprising the bead retaining device according to any one of the embodiments according to the second aspect of the invention and a tire building drum that has an outer diameter, wherein the first radial position and the second radial position are both located in the frame opening inside the inner frame edge and outside the outer diameter. The bead retaining members can thus effectively retain a bead in the range from inner edge up to the outer diameter of the tire building drum.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Preferably, the bead handling assembly further comprises a bead loader for supplying the beads to the bead retaining device. The bead loader can effectively pick up the bead and/or bead-apex from an upstream bead-apex manufacturing station and transfer said picked up bead or bead-apex to the bead retaining device.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The various aspects and features described and shown in the specification can be applied, individually, wherever possible. These individual aspects, in particular the aspects and features described in the attached dependent claims, can be made subject of divisional patent applications.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The invention will be elucidated on the basis of an exemplary embodiment shown in the attached schematic drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a front view of a bead handling assembly comprising a bead loader, a first bead setter and a second bead setter according to a first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an isometric view of the first bead setter according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a front view of the first bead setter with a plurality of bead retaining members which are positioned in a first operational position;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the front view of the first bead retaining device according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in which the bead retaining members have been moved into a second operational position;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> show a detail of the first bead retaining device according to the circle V in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and the circle VI in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, respectively;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a rear view of the first bead retaining device;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref> show the interaction of a bead retaining member according to the prior art with beads of different radii;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref> show a front view of one of the bead retaining member according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a front view of an alternative, reversible bead retaining member according to a second embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows a section view of the alternative bead retaining member according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows a section view of a further alternative bead retaining member according to a third embodiment of the invention;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a front view of the bead loader according to the line XIII-XIII in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows a section view of the bead loader according to the line XIV-XIV in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a bead handling assembly <b>1</b> for handling beads or bead-apexes <b>91</b>-<b>93</b> of different radii or diameters according to an exemplary first embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The bead handling assembly <b>1</b> comprises a first bead setter or bead retaining device <b>10</b> and a second bead setter or bead retaining device <b>11</b> for retaining the beads <b>91</b>-<b>93</b>.
