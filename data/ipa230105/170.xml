An aerosol source for an aerosol provision system may thus comprise a heater having a heating element arranged to receive source liquid from the reservoir, for example through wicking/capillary action. While a user inhales on the device, electrical power is supplied to the heating element to vaporize source liquid in the vicinity of the heating element to generate an aerosol for inhalation by the user. Such devices are usually provided with one or more air inlet holes located away from a mouthpiece end of the system. When a user sucks on a mouthpiece connected to the mouthpiece end of the system, air is drawn in through the inlet holes and past the aerosol source. There is a flow path connecting between the aerosol source and an opening in the mouthpiece so that air drawn past the aerosol source continues along the flow path to the mouthpiece opening, carrying some of the aerosol from the aerosol source with it. The aerosol-carrying air exits the aerosol provision system through the mouthpiece opening for inhalation by the user.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Other aerosol provision devices generate aerosol from a solid material, such as tobacco or a tobacco derivative. Such devices operate in a broadly similar manner to the liquid-based systems described above, in that the solid tobacco material is heated to a vaporization temperature to generate an aerosol which is subsequently inhaled by a user.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A large number of aerosol provision systems are modular in that they include a reusable part and a consumable part, with the consumable part comprising or consisting of aerosol generating material. When such a consumable part is depleted of aerosol generating material in the sense of it not being able to generate satisfactory aerosol from the aerosol generating material, a user may typically dispose of the consumable part. However, trace amounts of certain constituents may be present in the consumable. In some instances, it may be necessary to dispose of the consumable part in specialist disposal locations to prevent certain constituents causing damage to the environment. This can be inconvenient to the user, particularly if the user is not always in the vicinity of a specialist disposal location.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Various approaches are described which seek to help address some of these issues.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect of certain embodiments there is provided a method of reducing the quantity of a first constituent in aerosol generating material using an aerosol generating device configured to deliver inhalable aerosol to a user, the method comprising: performing a first aerosolization process on a portion of the aerosol generating material comprising the first constituent to generate an aerosol for user inhalation;

In some such embodiments, the acid may be at least one of sulphuric acid, hydrochloric acid, boric acid and phosphoric acid. In some embodiments, the acid is levulinic acid. The inclusion of an acid is particularly preferred in embodiments in which the aerosol-generating material <b>44</b> comprises nicotine. In such embodiments, the presence of an acid may stabilise dissolved species in the slurry from which the aerosol-generating material <b>44</b> is formed. The presence of the acid may reduce or substantially prevent evaporation of nicotine during drying of the slurry, thereby reducing loss of nicotine during manufacturing. The amorphous solid may comprise a colorant. The addition of a colorant may alter the visual appearance of the amorphous solid. The presence of colorant in the amorphous solid may enhance the visual appearance of the amorphous solid and the aerosol-generating material <b>44</b>.

Natural or synthetic colorants, such as natural or synthetic dyes, food-grade colorants and pharmaceutical-grade colorants may be used. In certain embodiments, the colorant is caramel, which may confer the amorphous solid with a brown appearance. In such embodiments, the color of the amorphous solid may be similar to the color of other components (such as tobacco material) in an aerosol-generating material <b>44</b> comprising the amorphous solid. In some embodiments, the addition of a colorant to the amorphous solid renders it visually indistinguishable from other components in the aerosol-generating material <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The colorant may be incorporated during the formation of the amorphous solid (e.g. when forming a slurry comprising the materials that form the amorphous solid) or it may be applied to the amorphous solid after its formation (e.g. by spraying it onto the amorphous solid).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">An amorphous solid aerosolizable material offers some advantages over other types of aerosolizable materials commonly found in some electronic aerosol provision devices. For example, compared to electronic aerosol provision devices which aerosolize a liquid aerosolizable material, the potential for the amorphous solid to leak or otherwise flow from a location at which the amorphous solid is stored is greatly reduced. This means aerosol provision devices or articles may be more cheaply manufactured as the components do not necessarily require the same liquid-tight seals or the like to be used.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Compared to electronic aerosol provision devices which aerosolize a solid aerosolizable material, e.g., tobacco, a comparably lower mass of amorphous solid material can be aerosolized to generate an equivalent amount of aerosol (or to provide an equivalent amount of a constituent in the aerosol, e.g., nicotine). This is partially due to the fact that an amorphous solid can be tailored to not include unsuitable constituents that might be found in other solid aerosolizable materials (e.g., cellulosic material in tobacco, for example). For example, in some implementations, the mass per portion of amorphous solid is no greater than 20 mg, or no greater than 10 mg, or no greater than 5 mg. Accordingly, the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> can supply relatively less power to the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> and/or the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> can be comparably smaller to generate a similar aerosol, thus meaning the energy requirements for the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> may be reduced.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some embodiments, the amorphous solid comprises tobacco extract.

More specifically, the outer surface of a heating element <b>24</b> that is flush with the inner surface of the receptacle <b>25</b> is a surface of the heating element <b>24</b> that is heated (i.e., its temperature increases) when an electrical current is passed through the heating element <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The heating elements <b>24</b> are arranged such that, when the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> is received in the receptacle <b>25</b>, each heating element <b>24</b> aligns with a corresponding discrete portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>.

However, as discussed above, the number of heating elements <b>24</b> may be different in different implementations, for example there may be 8, 10, 12, 14, etc. heating elements <b>24</b>.

When a user inhales on the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> (i.e., inhales at mouthpiece end <b>26</b>), air is drawn into the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> through air inlet <b>27</b>, into the receptacle <b>25</b> where it mixes with the aerosol generated by heating the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, and then to the user's mouth via air outlet <b>28</b>.

Collectively, the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> and inhalation sensor <b>30</b> act as mechanisms for a receiving a user input to cause the generation of aerosol, and thus may more broadly be referred to as user input mechanisms. The received user input may be said to be indicative of a user's desire to generate an aerosol.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> may be a capacitive touch sensor and can be operated by a user of the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> placing their finger or another suitably conductive object (for example a stylus) on the touch-sensitive pane <b>291</b>. In the described implementation, the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> includes a region which can be pressed by a user to start aerosol generation. The control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to receive signaling from the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> and to use this signaling to determine if a user is pressing (i.e. activating) the region of the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b>. If the control circuitry <b>23</b> receives this signaling, then the control circuitry <b>23</b> is configured to supply power from the power source <b>22</b> to one or more of the heating elements <b>24</b>. Power may be supplied for a predetermined time period (for example, three seconds) from the moment a touch is detected, or in response to the length of time the touch is detected for.

The inhalation sensor <b>30</b> is located in fluid communication with the air flow pathway (that is, in fluid communication with the air flow path between air inlet <b>27</b> and air outlet <b>28</b>). In a similar manner as described above, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to receive signaling from the inhalation sensor <b>30</b> and to use this signaling to determine if a user is inhaling on the aerosol provision system <b>1</b>. If the control circuitry <b>23</b> receives this signaling, then the control circuitry <b>23</b> is configured to supply power from the power source <b>22</b> to one or more of the heating elements <b>24</b>.

The control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to only supply power to the heating element <b>24</b> when signaling from both the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> and inhalation sensor <b>30</b> are detected. This may help prevent inadvertent activation of the heating elements <b>24</b> from accidental activation of one of the user input mechanisms.

For example, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to supply power to a first heating element <b>24</b> of the plurality of heating elements <b>24</b> when the signaling is first detected (e.g., from when the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> is first switched on). When the signaling stops, or in response to the predetermined time from the signaling being detected elapsing, the control circuitry <b>23</b> registers that the first heating element <b>24</b> has been activated (and thus the corresponding discrete portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> has been heated). The control circuitry <b>23</b> determines that in response to receiving subsequent signaling from either one or both of the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> and inhalation sensor <b>30</b> that a second heating element <b>24</b> is to be activated. Accordingly, when the signaling from either one or both of the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> and inhalation sensor <b>30</b> is received by the control circuitry <b>23</b>, the control circuitry <b>23</b> activates the second heating element <b>24</b>.

The aerosol provision device <b>2</b> may prevent subsequent activation of the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> when the alert signal is being output. The alert signal may be switched off, and the control circuitry <b>23</b> reset, when the user replaces the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> and/or switches off the alert signal via a manual means such as a button (not shown).</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In more detail, in implementations where the sequential mode of activation is employed, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to count the number of times signaling from either one or both of the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> and inhalation sensor <b>30</b> is received during a period of usage, and once the count reaches a predetermined number, the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> is determined to have reached the end of its life. The predetermined number may be equal to, or different from, the number of portions. For example, for an aerosol provision article <b>4</b> comprising six discrete portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, the predetermined number may be six, twelve, eighteen, etc. depending on the exact implementation at hand.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In implementations where the simultaneous mode of activation is employed, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to count the number of times one or each of the discrete portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is heated. For example, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may count how many times a nicotine containing portion is heated, and when that reaches a predetermined number, determine an end of life of the aerosol provision article <b>4</b>. Alternatively, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to separately count for each discrete portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> when that portion has been heated. Each portion may be attributed with the same or a different predetermined number and when any one of the counts for each of the portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> reaches the predetermined number, the control circuitry <b>23</b> determines an end of life of the aerosol provision article <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In either of the implementations, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may also factor in the length of time the portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> has been heated for and/or the temperature to which the portion of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> has been heated. In this regard, rather than counting discrete activations, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to calculate a cumulative parameter indicative of the heating conditions experienced by each of the portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. The parameter may be a cumulative time, for example, whereby the temperature to which the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is heated is used to adjust the length of time added to the cumulative time. For example, a portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> heated at 200&#xb0; C. for three seconds may contribute three seconds to the cumulative time, whereas a portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> heated at 250&#xb0; C. for three seconds may contribute four and a half seconds to the cumulative time.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The above techniques for determining the end of life of the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> should not be understood as an exhaustive list of ways of determining the end of life of the aerosol provision article <b>4</b>, and in fact any other suitable way may be employed in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Each of the portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> described above generally has some constituent that is to be delivered in the aerosol for user inhalation when heated, for example nicotine. In some situations, during use of the aerosol provision article <b>4</b>, each and every discrete portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> may not be heated by a corresponding heating element <b>24</b> (e.g., in the simultaneous activation mode) and/or each and every discrete portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> may not be heated fully (e.g., in the sequential activation mode). In other words, when the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> determines that the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> has reached the end of its usable life according to whichever of the above criteria, some of the constituent that is to be delivered may remain within the portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. It should be appreciated that even during the sequential activation mode, in which each portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is heated at least once before the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> is determined to be at the end of its life, amounts of the constituent may remain. This may be in part due to the fact that the constituent is effectively &#x201c;trapped&#x201d; within the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, and requires heating to allow the constituent to be released from the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. However, to ensure a rapid release of a sufficient quantity of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> within the duration of a user inhalation, the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> may be provided with a higher concentration of the constituent than is actually delivered in an inhalation.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">Some of the constituents that remain after initial heating of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> may have a negative impact on the environment should the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> not be disposed of correctly. For example, nicotine is known to be toxic, and while the nicotine concentration within the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> may be provided at generally safe levels for human consumption, the remaining nicotine may cause harm to certain animals if it enters their food chain due to incorrect disposal of the aerosol provision article <b>4</b>. The same may be true of other constituents, such as flavorants, for example. While efforts can be made to ensure safe disposal of aerosol provision articles <b>4</b> after use, such methods may not be reliable due to a reliance on the user correctly disposing of the aerosol provision article <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Therefore, the inventor has devised an aerosol provision system <b>1</b> which aims to reduce the level of certain constituents within the remaining portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> of the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> after use of the aerosol provision article <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In particular, the inventor has devised a method of reducing the quantity of a first constituent (such as nicotine) in portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, the method comprising heating the portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> until the portions of aerosol generating material are substantially free of the first constituent.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow chart depicting an exemplary method in accordance with the above for reducing the quantity of a first constituent until the portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> are substantially free of the first constituent. In this regard, &#x201c;substantially free of the first constituent&#x201d; should be understood to mean that the first constituent is present in an amount which is deemed acceptable from the point of view of reliably disposing of the aerosol provision article <b>4</b>. This amount may vary depending on what the constituent is. For example, with nicotine as the first constituent, the level may be set such that after heating, the concentration of nicotine in the at least a portion of aerosol generating material is less than 0.05 mg/ml, or less than 0.02 mg/ml, when dissolved in 100 ml of solvent. To test the concentrations, a method of taking a sample of material of a fixed mass, such as 1 g, and mixing with 100 ml of solvent (such as ethanol). The mixture is agitated for 3 hours and then passed through a Gas Chromatography&#x2014;Flame Ionisation Detector (GC-FID) to identify the constituents and concentrations. Other comparative techniques for analysis may also be used in accordance with other implementations.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a method for reducing the quantity of a first constituent in one or more portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> of the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>C</figref> when the sequential activation method is used, and more specifically where each portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is heated once to generate aerosol for user inhalation.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">The method starts at step S<b>1</b>, where the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> receives signaling from either one or both of the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> and inhalation sensor <b>30</b> signifying a user's intention to inhale aerosol, as discussed above. The aerosol provision device <b>2</b> may already be in a &#x201c;stand-by&#x201d; state prior to step S<b>1</b> and as such the control circuitry <b>23</b> is in a state where it is monitoring for the signaling.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Once the control circuitry <b>23</b> has received the signaling at step S<b>1</b>, the control circuitry <b>23</b> is configured to heat a corresponding portion of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> in accordance with the sequential activation mode as discussed previously at step S<b>2</b>. In particular, in response to receiving a first signaling at step S<b>1</b>, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to cause heating of aerosol generating material portion <b>44</b><i>a</i>. The heating occurs in accordance with a heating profile for the portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. The heating profile may be selected for generating a suitable aerosol both in terms of quantity and also sensorial quality (that is, an aerosol that has sufficient quantity and quality to satisfy a user's requirement). The temperature that the portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is heated to may be determined in advance to give a certain desired aerosol, but for an amorphous solid aerosol generating material is found to be in the range of 120&#xb0; C. to 350&#xb0; C. depending on the precise formulation of the amorphous solid used. The duration of heating may be set in advance or may depend up on the length of the user's puff, as discussed previously. However, typically the duration of heating will be on the order of 2 to 5 seconds, and in most implementations will be no longer than 10 seconds. In some implementations where the length of heating is based on the user's puff duration, a cut-off may be implemented in which power to the heating elements <b>24</b> is stopped after 10 seconds of inhalation to prevent abuse of the aerosol provision system <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">When a single portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is to be heated under step S<b>2</b>, then the single portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> may be said to be heated at a first temperature for a first duration.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Once a heating phase has been performed (that is, once the heating element <b>24</b> has been activated and deactivated once), at step S<b>3</b> the control circuitry <b>23</b> determines whether an end of life condition of the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> has been met.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">If an end of life condition has not been met (i.e., NO at step S<b>3</b>), then the method proceeds to step S<b>4</b> where the control circuitry <b>23</b> monitors for subsequent signaling indicating a user's desire to generate aerosol once again.

In this example, the control circuitry <b>23</b> is configured to sequentially cause heating of portions <b>44</b><i>b</i>, <b>44</b><i>c</i>, <b>44</b><i>d</i>, <b>44</b><i>e</i>, and finally <b>44</b><i>f</i>. Assuming an end of life condition has not been detected, the method proceeds to loop between steps S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, and S<b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In this example implementation, the end of life condition is determined when a count of the number of instances of signaling received by the control circuitry <b>23</b> is greater than a threshold. In this example, the threshold is six, such that when six separate instances of signaling are detected at steps S<b>1</b> and S<b>4</b> combined, the control circuitry <b>23</b> determines that the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> has reached its end of life. That is, when this criteria is met, the control circuitry <b>23</b> determines that an end of life condition is met (i.e., YES at step S<b>3</b>). In other words, this can be considered one way of determining when a session of usage has completed, assuming that one aerosol provision article <b>4</b> is intended to be used for one session.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In response to an end of life condition being met, the control circuitry <b>23</b> is configured to activate a &#x201c;purge&#x201d; or &#x201c;burnout&#x201d; mode at step S<b>5</b>. This involves the control circuitry <b>23</b> causing heating of each of the portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> for a second duration and at a second temperature. The second duration and second temperature are selected such that after exposure to this phase of heating, the aerosol generating material is substantially free of a first constituent, e.g., nicotine.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In the case of a nicotine containing amorphous solid comprising 4.68 mg nicotine (in an 8&#xd7;8 mm square patch of gel, weighing 0.1 g total), after a heating period of three minutes at 170&#xb0; C., the concentration of nicotine was found to be less than 0.02 mg/ml, when dissolved in 100 ml of solvent, and analyzed using a Blend Analysis method. That is, after heating for a prolonged period of time, the nicotine is substantially removed from the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">However, it should be appreciated that, depending on the composition of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> and the constituent to be removed, different heating times (i.e., the second duration) and different maximum temperatures may be implemented. However, generally speaking, the greater the maximum temperature the shorter the heating time required to substantially remove the first constituent from the portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. Equally, the volatility of the first constituent may also play a part in determining the maximum temperature and heating period. The various heating times and maximum heating temperatures may be determined empirically or via computer simulation.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In some implementations, the heating time period/second duration may be greater than 60 seconds (one minute), or greater than 90 seconds (one and a half minutes), or greater than 120 seconds (two minutes), or greater than 150 seconds (two and a half minutes), or greater than 180 seconds (three minutes). That is, the heating time period may be substantially longer than the heating time period for generating aerosol for one user inhalation, where one user inhalation may be less than 10 seconds, for example between five times as long to thirty times as long. Providing a heating time period that is too short may lead to not all of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> being substantially free of the first constituent after the heating period, whereas providing a heating period that is too long will heat aerosol generating material <b>44</b> beyond the point at which the portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is free of the first constituent and thus energy from the power source <b>22</b> is used unnecessarily. The length of time of the heating period may be dependent on the thickness of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> to be heated during the heating period (e.g., a thicker material may lead require a longer heating period). The above durations may be particularly suitable for portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> having a thickness of between 400 &#x3bc;m to 1 mm.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">In some implementations, the maximum temperature is no greater than 350&#xb0; C., or no greater than 300&#xb0; C., or no greater than 250&#xb0; C. In some implementations, the maximum temperature may be selected from the range of 150&#xb0; C. to 220&#xb0; C. Providing a maximum temperature which is too low may lead to not all of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> being substantially free of the first constituent after the heating period, whereas providing a maximum temperature that is too high may lead to charring or burning of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> which may generate unwanted constituents that may be difficult to dispose of in an environmentally-friendly way. In some implementations, the maximum temperature employed in step S<b>5</b> may be the same as the maximum temperature employed in step S<b>3</b>. That is, the maximum temperature used to heat the portion of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> comprising the first constituent to generate an aerosol for user inhalation is substantially the same as the maximum temperature used to heat the at least the portion of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> until the at least the portion of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is substantially free of the first constituent. In other implementations, the maximum temperature used in step S<b>5</b> may be greater than the maximum temperature used in step S<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">Although not shown, optionally during step S<b>5</b>, the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> may be configured to output a signal using indicator <b>31</b> to signify to the user that the burnout mode is in progress. For example, the indicator <b>31</b> may be an LED and configured to output a flashing or blinking light during the heating period. Any other form of indicator unit which can output a signal to the user as described above may also be employed.

For example, suppose each heating element <b>24</b> is activated for 10 seconds, and it is found that for a fresh portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is to be heated for 90 seconds at 250&#xb0; C. to make the portion substantially free of the first constituent, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be programmed to heat the used portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> for the duration found to make a fresh portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> substantially free of the first constituent (e.g., 90 seconds) minus the total heater activation duration (e.g., 10 seconds if each portion is heated once, 20 seconds if each portion is heated twice, etc. in this example). In some implementations, where the maximum temperature used at step S<b>3</b> is not the same as that used at step S<b>5</b>, the total heater activation time may be modified by the maximum temperature used. For example, if the portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> are heated with a maximum temperature of 170&#xb0; C. during step S<b>3</b> for 10 seconds, it may be that this equates to an equivalent heating period of say 5 seconds at the maximum temperature of step S<b>5</b> (e.g., 250&#xb0; C.) in terms of the amount of nicotine released.

For example, a portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> which has half as much nicotine as another portion may be heated at 150&#xb0; C. for 60 seconds, whereas a portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> having twice as much nicotine may be heated at 200&#xb0; C. for 60 seconds to enable the burnout mode for each portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> to be completed at approximately the same time.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">At step S<b>16</b>, when the heating time period has elapsed, the indicator <b>31</b> may output a different signify to the user to indicate that the burnout mode has completed. For example, the indicator <b>31</b> may output a solid light to indicate that burnout mode is complete and that the user may remove the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> and dispose of the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> using conventional means (e.g., in a waste disposal bin). Again, the indicator <b>31</b> may be any type of indicator and output any type of signal as appropriate.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Regardless of the method used, providing a burnout mode may allow the user to remove unwanted constituents from aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, such that the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> containing the material can be safely disposed of. Although not shown, the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> may comprise a storage portion for storing the aerosol generated during the burnout process, so that the aerosol can be disposed of appropriately and at an appropriate time. In other implementations, the aerosol may deposit on the walls of the receptacle <b>25</b> and require a user to clean the receptacle <b>25</b> with an associated cleaning utensil. In either case, the user may dispose of the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> in any suitable or conventional manner (for example, when away from a suitable disposal facility), and then clean the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> at a time when it is more appropriate and when able to use a suitable disposal facility.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">While the implementations above have focused on removing a first constituent from an aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, it should be appreciated that multiple constituents may be removed either from the same portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> or different portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. For example, a burnout mode for removing a flavorant may also be employed. In these implementations, the burnout modes may be run in parallel. For portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> that have both constituents, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to select the longer and/or higher temperature burnout mode to be applied to that portion so as to ensure that both constituents are substantially removed from the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">While it has been described that the burnout mode (e.g., steps S<b>5</b> and S<b>15</b>) are implemented automatically, in other implementations, the user may be provided with the option to manually begin the burnout mode (that is, the user may manually select heating at least the portion of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> until the at least the portion of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is substantially free of the first constituent). In these implementations, the user may be provided with a warning/alert that the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> is approaching an end of life condition, e.g. using indicator <b>31</b>. The user may interact with the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> for example, to engage the burnout mode.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">It should be appreciated that, in some implementations, the burnout mode may be applied only to portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> that contain the first constituent (and any other selected constituents that are desired to be removed). In other words, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to selectively apply the burnout mode to selected portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">In some implementations, the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> may optionally include a blocking or flow restriction member <b>32</b>. The flow restriction member <b>32</b> may be any suitable component for selectively sealing the air flow path in the aerosol provision device <b>2</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the flow restriction member <b>32</b> is a flap which can be moved from a stowed position which permits airflow to a block position which substantially seals the airflow path. However, in other implementations, the flow restriction member may be a butterfly valve, or an iris structure, for example. The flow restriction member <b>32</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as being located toward the air outlet <b>28</b>, but could be located at any suitable position along the flow path downstream of the receptacle <b>25</b>. During steps S<b>5</b> and S<b>15</b> of the methods shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to actuate the flow restriction member <b>32</b> to thereby seal the airflow pathway. In this case, when the user inhales on the mouthpiece end <b>26</b> of the device <b>2</b>, the user is unable to inhale air which is located upstream of the flow restriction member <b>32</b>. In this way, safety may be improved as the user is unable to inhale when the burnout mode is activated.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view through a schematic representation of an aerosol provision system <b>200</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the disclosure.

Accordingly, in this described implementation, each aerosol generating component <b>224</b> comprises elements that are distributed between the aerosol provision article <b>204</b> and the aerosol provision device <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175">Induction heating is a process in which an electrically-conductive object, referred to as a susceptor, is heated by penetrating the object with a varying magnetic field. The process is described by Faraday's law of induction and Ohm's law. An induction heater may comprise an electromagnet and a device for passing a varying electrical current, such as an alternating current, through the electromagnet. When the electromagnet and the object to be heated are suitably relatively positioned so that the resultant varying magnetic field produced by the electromagnet penetrates the object, one or more eddy currents are generated inside the object. The object has a resistance to the flow of electrical currents. Therefore, when such eddy currents are generated in the object, their flow against the electrical resistance of the object causes the object to be heated. This process is called Joule, ohmic, or resistive heating.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">A susceptor is material that is heatable by penetration with a varying magnetic field, such as an alternating magnetic field. The heating material may be an electrically-conductive material, so that penetration thereof with a varying magnetic field causes induction heating of the heating material. The heating material may be magnetic material, so that penetration thereof with a varying magnetic field causes magnetic hysteresis heating of the heating material. The heating material may be both electrically-conductive and magnetic, so that the heating material is heatable by both heating mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">Magnetic hysteresis heating is a process in which an object made of a magnetic material is heated by penetrating the object with a varying magnetic field. A magnetic material can be considered to comprise many atomic-scale magnets, or magnetic dipoles. When a magnetic field penetrates such material, the magnetic dipoles align with the magnetic field. Therefore, when a varying magnetic field, such as an alternating magnetic field, for example as produced by an electromagnet, penetrates the magnetic material, the orientation of the magnetic dipoles changes with the varying applied magnetic field. Such magnetic dipole reorientation causes heat to be generated in the magnetic material.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0178">When an object is both electrically-conductive and magnetic, penetrating the object with a varying magnetic field can cause both Joule heating and magnetic hysteresis heating in the object. Moreover, the use of magnetic material can strengthen the magnetic field, which can intensify the Joule heating.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">In the described implementation, the susceptors <b>224</b><i>b </i>are formed from an aluminum foil, although it should be appreciated that other metallic and/or electrically conductive materials may be used in other implementations. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, the carrier component <b>242</b> comprises a number of susceptors <b>224</b><i>b </i>which correspond in size and location to the discrete portions of aerosol generating material <b>244</b> disposed on the surface of the carrier component <b>242</b>.

The induction work coils <b>224</b><i>a </i>are shown adjacent the receptacle <b>225</b>, and are generally flat coils arranged such that the rotational axis about which a given coil is wound extends into the receptacle <b>225</b> and is broadly perpendicular to the plane of the carrier component <b>242</b> of the aerosol provision article <b>204</b>. The exact windings are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and it should be appreciated that any suitable induction coil may be used.</p><p id="p-0183" num="0182">The control circuitry <b>223</b> comprises a mechanism to generate an alternating current which is passed to any one or more of the induction work coils <b>224</b><i>a</i>. The alternating current generates an alternating magnetic field, as described above, which in turn causes the corresponding susceptor(s) <b>224</b><i>b </i>to heat up. The heat generated by the susceptor(s) <b>224</b><i>b </i>is transferred to the portions of aerosol generating material <b>244</b> accordingly.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">As described above in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>C</figref>, the control circuitry <b>223</b> is configured to supply current to the work coils <b>224</b><i>a </i>in response to receiving signaling from the touch sensitive panel <b>229</b> and/or the inhalation sensor <b>230</b>. Any of the techniques for selecting which heating elements <b>24</b> are heated by control circuitry <b>23</b> as described previously may analogously be applied to selecting which work coils <b>224</b><i>a </i>are energized (and thus which portions of aerosol generating material <b>244</b> are subsequently heated) in response to receiving signaling from the touch sensitive panel <b>229</b> and/or the inhalation sensor <b>230</b> by control circuitry <b>223</b> to generate an aerosol for user inhalation.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0184">Although the above has described an induction heating aerosol provision system where the work coils <b>224</b><i>a </i>and susceptors <b>224</b><i>b </i>are distributed between the aerosol provision article <b>204</b> and aerosol provision device <b>202</b>, an induction heating aerosol provision system may be provided where the work coils <b>224</b><i>a </i>and susceptors <b>224</b><i>b </i>are located solely within the aerosol provision device <b>202</b>. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the susceptors <b>224</b><i>b </i>may be provided above the induction work coils <b>224</b><i>a </i>and arranged such that the susceptors <b>224</b><i>b </i>contact the lower surface of the carrier component <b>242</b> (in an analogous way to the aerosol provision system <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">Thus, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> describes a more concrete implementation where induction heating may be used in an aerosol provision device <b>202</b> to generate aerosol for user inhalation to which the techniques described in the present disclosure may be applied.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0186">In the implementations of the aerosol provision systems <b>1</b>, <b>201</b> described above, a plurality of (discrete) portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, <b>244</b> are provided which can be selectively aerosolized using the aerosol generating components <b>24</b>, <b>224</b> (e.g., heating elements). Such aerosol provision systems <b>1</b>, <b>201</b> offer advantages over other systems which are designed to heat a larger bulk quantity of material. In particular, for a given inhalation, only the selected portion (or portions) of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, <b>244</b> are aerosolized leading to a more energy efficient system overall.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0187">In heated systems, several parameters affect the overall effectiveness of the system at delivering a sufficient amount of aerosol to a user on a per puff basis. On the one hand, the thickness of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, <b>244</b> is important as this influences how quickly the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, <b>244</b> reaches an operational temperature (and subsequently generates aerosol). This may be important for several reasons, but may lead to more efficient use of energy from the power source <b>22</b>, <b>222</b> as the heating element <b>24</b>, <b>224</b> may not need to be active for as long compared with heating a thicker portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, <b>244</b>. On the other hand, the total mass of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, <b>244</b> that is heated affects the total amount of aerosol that can be generated, and subsequently delivered to the user. In addition, the temperature that the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, <b>244</b> is heated to may affect both how quickly the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, <b>244</b> reaches operational temperature and the amount of aerosol that is generated. The target temperature (which may also be referred to as the operational temperature) is a temperature that the control circuitry <b>23</b>, <b>223</b> causes the heating element <b>24</b>, <b>224</b> to reach to generate an aerosol. The operational temperature may therefore be one or more fixed values.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">Amorphous solids (e.g., as described above) are particularly suited to the above application, in part because the amorphous solids are formed from selected ingredients/constituents and so can be engineered such that a relatively high proportion of the mass is the useful (or deliverable) constituents (e.g., nicotine and glycerol, for example). As such, amorphous solids may produce a relatively high proportion of aerosol from a given mass as compared to some other aerosol generating materials (e.g., tobacco), meaning that relatively smaller portions of amorphous solid can output a comparable amount of aerosol. In addition, amorphous solids do not tend to easily flow (if at all) which means problems around leakage when using a liquid aerosol generating material, for example, are largely mitigated.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">Although the above has described a system in which an array of aerosol generating components <b>24</b> (e.g., heating elements <b>24</b>) are provided to energize the discrete portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, in other implementations, the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> and/or an aerosol generating component <b>24</b> may be configured to move relative to one another. That is, there may be fewer aerosol generating components <b>24</b> than discrete portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> provided on the carrier component <b>42</b> of the aerosol provision article <b>4</b>, such that relative movement of the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> and aerosol generating components <b>24</b> is required in order to be able to individually energize each of the discrete portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. For example, a movable heating element <b>24</b> may be provided within the receptacle <b>25</b> such that the heating element <b>24</b> may move relative to the receptacle <b>25</b>. In this way, the movable heating element <b>24</b> can be translated (e.g., in the width and length directions of the carrier component <b>42</b>) such that the heating element <b>24</b> can be aligned with respective ones of the discrete portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. This approach may reduce the number of carrier components <b>42</b> required while still offering a similar user experience.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">Although the above has described implementations where discrete, spatially distinct portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> are deposited on a carrier component <b>42</b>, it should be appreciated that in other implementations the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> may not be provided in discrete, spatially distinct portions but instead be provided as a continuous sheet of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. In these implementations, certain regions of the sheet of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> may be selectively heated to generate aerosol in broadly the same manner as described above. However, regardless of whether or not the portions are spatially distinct, the present disclosure describes heating (or otherwise aerosolizing) portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. In particular, a region (corresponding to a portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>) may be defined on the continuous sheet of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> based on the dimensions of the heating element <b>24</b> (or more specifically a surface of the heating element <b>24</b> designed to increase in temperature). In this regard, the corresponding area of the heating element <b>24</b> when projected onto the sheet of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> may be considered to define a region or portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. In accordance with the present disclosure, each region or portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> may have a mass no greater than 20 mg, however the total continuous sheet of aerosol generating material may have a mass which is greater than 20 mg.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">Although the above has described a &#x201c;burnout mode&#x201d; in which portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> are heated to reduce the concentrations of the constituents to a relatively low level, it should be appreciated that in some implementations, a different form of aerosolization may be used, e.g., a vibrating mesh. Accordingly, the principles described above may be applied to a method of reducing the quantity of a first constituent in aerosol generating material <b>44</b> using an aerosol provision device <b>2</b> configured to deliver inhalable aerosol to a user, the method comprising: performing a first aerosolization process on a portion of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> comprising the first constituent to generate an aerosol for user inhalation; and performing a second aerosolization process on at least the portion of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> until the at least the portion of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is substantially free of the first constituent. An aerosolization process should be understood as any suitable process which can generate aerosol from the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">Although the above has described implementations where the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> can be configured or operated using the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> mounted on the aerosol provision device <b>2</b>, the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> may instead be configured or controlled remotely. For example, the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be provided with a corresponding communication circuitry (e.g., Bluetooth) which enables the control circuitry <b>23</b> to communicate with a remote device such as a smartphone. Accordingly, the touch-sensitive panel <b>29</b> may, in effect, be implemented using an App or the like running on the smartphone. The smartphone may then transmit user inputs or configurations to the control circuitry <b>23</b>, and the control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to operate on the basis of the received inputs or configurations.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">Although the above has described implementations in which an aerosol is generated by energizing (e.g., heating) aerosol generating material <b>44</b> which is subsequently inhaled by a user, it should be appreciated in some implementations that the generated aerosol may be passed through or over an aerosol modifying component to modify one or more properties of the aerosol before being inhaled by a user. For example, the aerosol provision device <b>2</b>, <b>202</b> may comprise an air permeable insert (not shown) which is inserted in the airflow path downstream of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> (for example, the insert may be positioned in the outlet <b>28</b>). The insert may include a material which alters any one or more of the flavor, temperature, particle size, nicotine concentration, etc. of the aerosol as it passes through the insert before entering the user's mouth. For example, the insert may include tobacco or treated tobacco. Such systems may be referred to as hybrid systems. The insert may include any suitable aerosol modifying material, which may encompass the aerosol generating materials described above.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0194">Although it has been described above that the heating elements <b>24</b> are arranged to provide heat to a portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> at an operational temperature at which aerosol is generated from the portion of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, in some implementations, the heating elements <b>24</b> are arranged to pre-heat portions of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> to a pre-heat temperature (which is lower than the operational temperature). At the pre-heat temperature, a lower amount or no aerosol is generated when the portion is heated at the pre-heat temperature. However, a lower amount of energy is required to raise the temperature of the aerosol generating material from the pre-heat temperature to the operational temperature. This may be particularly suitable for relatively thicker portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, e.g., having thicknesses above 400 &#x3bc;m which require relatively larger amounts of energy to be supplied in order to reach the operational temperature. In such implementations, the energy consumption (e.g., from the power source <b>22</b>) may be comparably higher, however.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0195">Although the above has described implementations in which the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> comprises an end of use indicator <b>31</b>, it should be appreciated that the end of use indicator <b>31</b> may be provided by another device remote from the aerosol provision device <b>2</b>. For example, in some implementations, the control circuitry <b>23</b> of the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> may comprise a communication mechanism which allows data transfer between the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> and a remote device such as a smartphone or smartwatch, for example. In these implementations, when the control circuitry <b>23</b> determines that the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> has reached its end of use, the control circuitry <b>23</b> is configured to transmit a signal to the remote device, and the remote device is configured to generate the alert signal (e.g., using the display of a smartphone). Other remote devices and other mechanisms for generating the alert signal may be used as described above.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0196">In some implementations, the article <b>4</b> may comprise an identifier, such as a readable bar code or an RFID tag or the like, and the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> comprises a corresponding reader. When the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> is inserted into the receptacle <b>25</b> of the aerosol provision device <b>2</b>, the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> may be configured to read the identifier on the aerosol provision article <b>4</b>. The control circuitry <b>23</b> may be configured to either recognize the presence of the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> (and thus permit heating and/or reset an end of life indicator) or identify the type and/or the location of the portions of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> relative to the aerosol provision article <b>4</b>. This may affect which portions the control circuitry <b>23</b> aerosolizes and/or the way in which the portions are aerosolized, e.g., via adjusting the aerosol generation temperature and/or heating duration. Any suitable technique for recognizing the aerosol provision article <b>4</b> may be employed.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">Thus, there has been described a method of reducing the quantity of a first constituent in aerosol generating material using an aerosol generating device configured to deliver inhalable aerosol to a user. The method comprises performing a first aerosolization process (S<b>2</b>) on a portion of the aerosol generating material comprising the first constituent to generate an aerosol for user inhalation, and performing a second aerosolization process (S<b>5</b>) on at least the portion of the aerosol generating material until the at least the portion of the aerosol generating material is substantially free of the first constituent. Also provided is an aerosol provision device and an aerosol provision system.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">In addition, when the portions of aerosol generating material <b>44</b> are provided on a carrier component <b>42</b>, the portions may, in some implementations, include weakened regions, e.g., through holes or areas of relatively thinner aerosol generating material <b>44</b>, in a direction approximately perpendicular to the plane of the carrier component <b>42</b>. This may be the case when the hottest part of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> is the area directly contacting the carrier component <b>42</b> (in other words, in scenarios where the heat is applied primarily to the surface of the aerosol generating material that contacts the carrier component <b>42</b>). Accordingly, the through holes may provide channels for the generated aerosol to escape and be released to the environment/the air flow through the aerosol provision device <b>2</b> rather than causing a potential build-up of aerosol between the carrier component <b>42</b> and the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>. Such build-up of aerosol can reduce the heating efficiency of the aerosol provision system <b>1</b> as the build-up of aerosol can, in some implementations, cause a lifting of the aerosol generating material <b>44</b> from the carrier component <b>42</b> thus decreasing the efficiency of the heat transfer to the aerosol generating material <b>44</b>.
