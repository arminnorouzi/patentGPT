Systems and Methods for Fast Beam Refinement and/or Tracking for High Mobility Wireless Communication Device</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">In certain systems (e.g., 5G new radio (NR) and/or other systems), mobile communication methods/procedures may use/implement/enable analog beam-forming techniques. Analog beam-forming may facilitate/increase/enhance the robustness of high-frequency communications and/or processes. In some embodiments, quasi co-location (QCL) state and/or transmission configuration indicator (TCI) state may support/enable/facilitate beam indication for one or more types of channels and/or signals. For example, QCL state and/or TCI state may support beam indication for downlink (DL) control channels (e.g., physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) and/or other channels), DL data channels (e.g., physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) and/or other channels), and/or reference signals (e.g., channel state information reference signaling (CSI-RS) and/or other types of signals). In some embodiments, spatial relation information (e.g., higher layer parameters, such as spatialRelationInfo, and/or other parameters) may support/enable/facilitate beam indication for one or more types of channels and/or signals. For instance, spatial relation information (and/or other information) may support beam indication for uplink (UL) control channels (e.g., physical uplink control channel (PUCCH)), reference signals (e.g., sounding reference signal (SRS)), and/or other types of channels/signals. For UL data channels (e.g., physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) and/or other channels), beam indication can be achieved/implemented/enabled by mapping one or more SRS resources and/or one or more ports of an UL data channel. A wireless communication node (e.g., a ground terminal, a base station, a gNB, an eNB, or a serving node) may indicate/specify the one or more SRS resources. Therefore, a configuration of the beam for an UL data channel (or other channels) may be derived/determined/obtained by using the spatial relation information. The spatial relation information can be associated/related/linked with one or more SRS resources and/or ports of the UL data channel.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">Certain systems (e.g., 5G NR and/or other systems) may be designed/configured/developed under the assumption of user equipment (UE) random mobility. For instance, in certain frequency ranges (e.g., frequency range (FR) <b>2</b>), UE mobility can be average and/or low (e.g., 30 km/h for outdoor settings and/or 3 km/h for indoor settings). In certain specifications, one or more solutions (e.g., 5G NR solution) may use/implement/execute independent procedures for reporting one or more beams (e.g., channel state information (CSI)+reference signal received power (RSRP), and/or synchronization signal block resource indicator (SSBRI)+RSRP) and/or indicating a TCI and/or spatial relation information (e.g., handled by a gNB command). In some embodiments, beam reporting and/or TCI (and/or spatial relation information) indication may be decoupled/unrelated/unassociated procedures. Therefore, TCI (and/or spatial relation information) indication may be flexibly performed for subsequent data scheduling, regardless/independent of a beam reporting operation. Reporting one or more beams and/or indicating a TCI (and/or spatial relation information) may introduce/involve a certain amount of latency.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">In certain applications, the current level of flexibility of certain configurations (e.g., beam reporting and/or TCI indication) may be unable to support UE high mobility (e.g., the effectiveness for UE high mobility decreases/degrades). In some embodiments (e.g., high mobility scenarios), a speed/rate of a wireless communication device (e.g., a UE, a terminal, or a served node) can be high/elevated (e.g., 350 km/h and/or other values of speed). If the speed of a wireless communication device (e.g., UE) is high (e.g., exceeds certain values of speed), a corresponding time of beam dwelling may decrease/shorten (e.g., by 10 ms and/or other length of time). When the beam dwelling time decreases (e.g., in UE high mobility scenarios), the latency (e.g., 14 ms and/or other time instances) introduced by beam reporting and/or TCI (and/or spatial relation information) indication may become problematic.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">The systems and methods presented herein include a novel approach for achieving/improving/enhancing fast beam refinement and/or beam tracking for UE high mobility (e.g., improving by at least 25%, 35%, 45%, or other percent) by using predictive beam measurements, joint beam reporting, and/or joint beam indication. The system and methods presented herein may consider/contemplate/address one or more of the following issues/challenges:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0053">1) DL beam refinement: In DL beam refinement, one or more wireless communication node (e.g., gNB) candidate Tx beams and/or one or more wireless communication device candidate (e.g., UE) receive (Rx) beams may exist. In certain systems (e.g., 5G NR), the wireless communication device may perform/execute a plurality of steps, wherein the steps can include probing the Tx beams, reporting the Tx beam(s), indicating at least one new Tx beam, and/or sweeping the Rx beams along with the indicated Tx beam(s). The number of steps of the plurality of steps can be reduced/decreased/compressed to reduce/decrease/save latency. For example, the relationship between beam reporting and Rx beam sweeping (along with the reported beam) may be explored/considered/analyzed to reduce the latency.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0054">2) DL and UL beam refinement: One or more of the issues/challenges of DL beam refinement may apply in DL and UL beam refinement. Certain systems (e.g., 5G NR) and/or solutions may execute/perform independent DL and UL beam refinement procedures. The systems and methods presented herein may reduce/decrease the number of steps of beam indication for UL beam refinement. In some embodiments, the systems and methods presented herein may consider UL beam sweeping with DL Tx beam reporting.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0055">3) In some embodiments, one or more techniques/procedures for DL beam refinement and/or DL and UL beam refinement can be extended/enhanced/improved to include scenarios with simultaneous DL multi-beam transmissions (e.g., for multiple transmit/transmission receive points (mTRP)) and/or group based reporting.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0055" num="0056">In certain systems, the use of high frequency resources may induce/produce/cause a considerable propagation loss. Therefore, wide and/or ultra-wide spectrum resources may pose/introduce/cause noticeable challenges (e.g., due to propagation loss). In some embodiments, certain technologies/techniques may achieve/cause beam alignment and/or obtain/cause sufficient antenna gain. For example, antenna arrays and/or beam-forming training techniques that use massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) (e.g., up to 1024 antenna elements for one node) may achieve beam alignment and/or sufficient antenna gain. In some embodiments, analog phase shifters may be used to implement/enable mmWave beam-forming. Using analog phase shifters may result in a low cost of implementation with the benefits of using antenna arrays. If analog phase shifters are used (e.g., to implement mmWave beam-forming), the number of controllable phases may be finite/defined/restricted. In some embodiments, the use of analog phase shifters may place/cause one or more constant modulus constraints on the analog phase shifters. Given a set of one or more pre-specified beam patterns, the goal/target of variable-phase-shift-based beamforming (BF) training may correspond to identifying/determining the optimum beam pattern for subsequent data transmissions. The identified beam pattern may apply to one or more scenarios with one TRP and/or one panel (e.g., a UE with one panel).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, depicted is an example approach <b>300</b> for beam measurement and/or beam reporting with a wireless communication device (e.g., UE), wherein the wireless communication device uses one or more panels (e.g., panel 1, panel 2, panel 3, panel 4, and/or other panels). Certain systems (e.g., beyond 5G gNB and/or next generation communication systems) may consider/contemplate one or more scenarios with mTRP (e.g., TRP-1, TRP-2, and/or other TRPs) and/or one or more panels. A wireless communication device (e.g., a UE) may use more than one panel (e.g., four panels) to enhance/improve coverage by covering a larger space. In some embodiments, a panel of a TRP and/or a panel of a wireless communication device may have at least two transceiver units (TXRUs). The at least two TXRUs may be associated/related with cross polarization accordingly. In some embodiments, the TRP (e.g., TRP-1, TRP-2, and/or other TRPs) and/or wireless communication device (e.g., UE) may use different/distinct/separate beams (e.g., Rx beam #1, Rx beam #2, Rx beam #10, Rx beam #11, and/or other beams), generated with one or more panels, to achieve high rank and/or perform multi-layer transmissions (e.g., simultaneous transmission across multiple panels (STxMP)).
