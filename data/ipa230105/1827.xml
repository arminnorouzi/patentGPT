id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a vehicle seat reclining device. Specifically, the present invention relates to a vehicle seat reclining device that adjusts an inclination angle of a seat back.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A known vehicle seat reclining device includes a stepped lock mechanism capable of adjusting a backrest angle of a seat back by a constant pitch angle (Patent Literature 1). The vehicle seat reclining device is a joint device that couples the seat back to a seal cushion such that the backrest angle is adjustable. Specifically, the vehicle seat reclining device includes a ratchet and a guide that are formed by substantially disk-shaped metal members assembled to be rotatable relative to each other, and a lock mechanism that locks relative rotation between the ratchet and the guide.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The lock mechanism is configured such that a plurality of pawls set on the guide are biased against inner circumferential teeth formed on an outer circumferential portion of the ratchet and thereby being pressed against and meshed with the inner circumferential teeth, thereby locking the relative rotation between the ratchet and the guide. Each of the pawls is supported by the guide from both sides in a rotation direction and is guided to be movable only inward and outward in a radial direction.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Literature 1: WO2016/129423</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to ensure sliding performance of each pawl, it is necessary to set a slight gap in the rotation direction between each pawl and each guide wall of the guide that supports the pawl from both sides in the rotation direction. However, when the gap is large, a posture of each pawl may be unstable (that is, so-called &#x201c;rattling&#x201d; occurs) due to inclination of each pawl between the guide walls of the pawls. One object of the present invention is to provide a vehicle seat reclining device capable of ensuring sliding performance of a pawl and preventing rattling at the same time.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">[1] In a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a vehicle seat reclining device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The vehicle seat reclining device includes:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">a ratchet and a guide assembled in an axial direction to be rotatable relative to each other;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">a plurality of pawls that are supported from both sides in a rotation direction by a pair of guide wails provided on the guide, mesh with the ratchet by movement of being pushed outward in a radial direction, and are arranged in the rotation direction that restrict relative rotation between the ratchet and the guide; and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">a cam that pushes and moves the plurality of pawls outward from an inner side in the radial direction, in which</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">one of the plurality of pawls</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">is a main pawl having a rattle preventing structure that reduces rattling in the rotation direction by bringing the pawl into contact with both of the pair of guide walls by being pushed and moved by the cam, and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">at least one of the main pawl and the pressing portion of the cam that presses the main pawl from the inner side in the radial direction</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">includes bulging portions having a shape in which surfaces of the main pawl and the pressing portion that abut against the other side bulge toward the other side so that the main pawl is largely pushed outward in the radial direction more than another pawl.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the first aspect, the main pawl having a rattle preventing structure in the rotation direction can be meshed with the ratchet by the bulging portions before the another pawl. Therefore, even if a gap for ensuring sliding performance is provided between the pawl and the guide wall, the pawl can be meshed with the ratchet in a state where rattling is appropriately reduced.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">[2] In a second aspect of the present invention according to the first aspect,</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">the main pawl</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">is pushed out such that outer teeth of the main pawl enter inner teeth of the ratchet by the bulging portions before the another pawl.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the second aspect, the main pawl can be more reliably meshed with the ratchet.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">[3] In a third aspect of the present invention according to the first or second aspect,</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">the main pawl</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">has a structure in which the main pawl is inclined in the rotation direction between the pair of guide walls so that the main pawl contacts both of the pair of guide walls when the main pawl is pressed from the inner side in the radial direction as a rattle prevention structure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the third aspect, even when the main pawl has a structure in which the rattling is hardly reduced other the another pawl meshes with the ratchet, the main pawl can be meshed with the ratchet in a state where the rattling is appropriately reduced.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">[4] In a fourth aspect of the present invention according to any one of the first to third aspects,</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">the bulging portions</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">are provided on both the main pawl and the pressing portion.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the fourth aspect, sizes of the bulging portions formed on the main pawl and the pressing portion, respectively, can be reduced as compared with a configuration in which the bulging portion is formed on only one of the main pawl and the pressing portion. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent each basic structure from being largely broken, and it is possible to prevent problems such as a decrease in strength from occurring.</p><?summary-of-invention

Device)</heading><p id="p-0067" num="0066">First, the configuration of the seat reclining device <b>4</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>37</b></figref>. In the following description, directions such as front, rear, upper, lower, left, and right directions, indicate directions shown in the drawings. A term &#x201c;seat width direction&#x201d; refers to a left-right direction of a seat <b>1</b> to be described later.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the seat reclining device <b>4</b> of the present embodiment is applied to the seat <b>1</b> forming a right seat of an automobile. The seat reclining device <b>4</b> is configured as a reclining adjustment mechanism that couples a seat back <b>2</b> forming a backrest portion of the seat <b>1</b> to a seat cushion <b>3</b> forming a seating portion so that an angle is adjustable. Specifically, a pair of left and right seat reclining devices <b>4</b> are provided between the seat back <b>2</b> and the seat cushion <b>3</b>. The seat reclining devices <b>4</b> are configured to fix and release a backrest angle of the seat back <b>2</b> by being switched together between locked and unlocked states.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the seat reclining devices <b>4</b> are respectively interposed between lower end portions of side frames <b>2</b>F forming left and right side frames of the seat back <b>2</b> and reclining plates <b>3</b>F coupled to rear end portions of left and right side frames of the seat cushion <b>3</b> that are positioned on outer sides of the side frames <b>2</b>F in the seat width direction. The seat reclining devices <b>4</b> are coupled to the lower end portions of the side frames <b>2</b>F and the reclining plates <b>3</b>F in a state of being rotatable relative to each other or prevented from rotating about the same axis.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the seat reclining devices <b>4</b> are normally held in the locked state in which the backrest angle of the seat back <b>2</b> is fixed. The seat reclining devices <b>4</b> are released from the locked state together by an operation (circled number <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of a user pulling up a reclining lever <b>5</b> provided on a side portion on a vehicle outer side (right side) of the seat cushion <b>3</b>. Accordingly, the seat reclining devices <b>4</b> are switched to the unlocked state in which the backrest angle of the seat back <b>2</b> is adjustable in a seat front-rear direction. When an operation of the reclining lever <b>5</b> is returned, the seat reclining devices <b>4</b> are biased and returned to the locked state.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Return springs <b>6</b> that apply spring biasing forces in a direction in which the seat back <b>2</b> is tilted forward and rotated are respectively hooked between the left and right side frames <b>2</b>F of the seat back <b>2</b> and the reclining plates <b>3</b>F positioned on the outer sides of the side frames <b>2</b>F. By rotational biasing forces of the return springs <b>6</b>, a fixed state of the backrest angle by the seat reclining devices <b>4</b> is released, so that the seat back <b>2</b> is raised to a position where the seat back <b>2</b> abuts against a back of a seated occupant.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Then, the backrest angle of the seat back <b>2</b> is freely adjusted in the front-rear direction according to movement (circled number <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in which the back of the seated occupant is tilted in the front-rear direction. Thus, the backrest angle of the seat back <b>2</b> can be easily adjusted by providing the return springs <b>6</b> that apply the biasing forces in a forward rotation direction to the seat back <b>2</b>. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, the seat back <b>2</b> can be rotated in the seat front-rear direction in a rotation region of about 180 degrees between a forward tilt position Pa at Which the seat back <b>2</b> is folded on an upper surface of the seat cushion <b>3</b> and a rearward tilt position Pc at which the seat back <b>2</b> is tilted rearward substantially horizontally.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A structure for locking the seat back <b>2</b> to the forward tilt position Pa is a structure in which locking plates <b>2</b>Fc, which are coupled to outer surface portions of the side frames <b>2</b>F of the seat back <b>2</b>, are abutted against front stoppers <b>3</b>Fc protruding from front edge portions of the reclining plates <b>3</b>F and locked to the front stoppers <b>3</b>Fc. A structure for locking the seat back <b>2</b> to the rearward tilted position Pc is a structure in which the locking plates <b>2</b>Fc, which are coupled to the outer surface portions of the side frames <b>2</b>F of the seat back <b>2</b>, are abutted against rear stoppers <b>3</b>Fd protruding from rear edge portions of the reclining plates <b>3</b>F and locked to the rear stoppers <b>3</b>Fd.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Here, in the above-described rotation region of the seat back <b>2</b>, a rotation region of about 90 degrees from an initial lock position Pb, in which the seat back <b>2</b> is at a backrest angle of standing substantially vertically, to the rearward tilted position Pc is set as a &#x201c;lock region A<b>1</b>&#x201d;, in which the backrest angle of the seat back <b>2</b> is returned to the fixed state by releasing an operation of pulling up the reclining lever <b>5</b>. A rotation region of about 90 degrees from a position in which the backrest angle of the seat back <b>2</b> is at the initial lock position Pb to the forward tilted position Pa is set as a &#x201c;free region A<b>2</b>&#x201d;, in which the angle of the seat back <b>2</b> is not fixed but held in a released state (state in which the lock is disabled) even when the operation of pulling up the reclining lever <b>5</b> is released.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The lock region A<b>1</b> and the free region A<b>2</b> are configured with functions of the seat reclining device <b>4</b>, which will be described later. By setting the free region A<b>2</b>, when the reclining lever <b>5</b> is operated and the seat back <b>2</b> is tilted forward to a position where the seat back <b>2</b> enters the free region A<b>2</b> in a state in which no person is seated in the seat <b>1</b>, the seat back <b>2</b> is naturally tilted to the forward tilt position Pa even when the operation of the reclining lever <b>5</b> is not continued.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the seat reclining device <b>4</b> above includes a ratchet <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) integrally coupled to the outer surface portion of the side frame <b>2</b>F on each side of the seat back <b>2</b>, and a guide <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) integrally coupled to an inner surface portion of the reclining plate <b>3</b>F on each side. The seat reclining device <b>4</b> fixes and releases the backrest angle of the seat back <b>2</b> by being switched such that relative rotation between the ratchet <b>10</b> and the guide <b>20</b> is locked and released.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Configuration of Each Part of Seat Reclining Device <b>4</b></heading><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Hereinafter, the configuration of each part of the pair of left and right seat reclining devices <b>4</b> will be described in detail. The seat reclining devices <b>4</b> have the same configurations that are bilaterally symmetrical to each other. Therefore, hereinafter, as an example, a configuration of the seat reclining device <b>4</b> disposed on the vehicle outer side (right side) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> will be described in detail.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the seat reclining device <b>4</b> includes the substantially disk-shaped ratchet <b>10</b> and guide <b>20</b> that are assembled to each other in an axial direction, three pawls <b>30</b> assembled between the ratchet <b>10</b> and the guide <b>20</b>, and a rotation cam <b>40</b> that moves the pawls <b>30</b> inward and outward in a radial direction. The seat reclining device <b>4</b> further includes a lock spring <b>50</b> (spiral spring) that biases the rotation cam <b>40</b> in a lock rotation direction relative to the guide <b>20</b>, and a substantially cylindrical outer circumferential ring <b>60</b> that is installed across outer circumferential portions of the ratchet <b>10</b> and the guide <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The outer circumferential ring <b>60</b> functions as a holding member that holds the ratchet <b>10</b> and the guide <b>20</b> in a state of being assembled to each other in the axial direction. Here, the rotation cam <b>40</b> corresponds to a &#x201c;cam&#x201d; of the present invention. Each of the ratchet <b>10</b>, the guide <b>20</b>, the three pawls <b>30</b>, and the rotation cam <b>40</b> is hardened by quenching processing after press molding and has high structural strength.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Ratchet <b>10</b></heading><p id="p-0080" num="0079">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the ratchet <b>10</b> is processed into a shape by cutting a metal plate member into a substantially disk shape and extruding portions of the substantially disk-shaped metal plate member in a half-punched shape in a plate thickness direction (axial direction). Specifically, a stepped cylindrical portion protruding in two stages in a stepped cylindrical shape in the axial direction, which is an assembling direction of the ratchet <b>10</b> to the guide <b>20</b>, is extruded in a half-punched shape and formed on an outer circumferential edge portion of a disk main body <b>11</b> of the ratchet <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">A cylindrical part on an outer circumferential side of the stepped cylindrical portion is formed as a cylindrical portion <b>12</b> whose entire inner circumferential surface is formed with inner teeth <b>12</b>A. A cylindrical part on an inner circumferential side of the stepped cylindrical portion is formed as an intermediate cylindrical portion <b>13</b> having a protruding length in the axial direction shorter than that of the cylindrical portion <b>12</b>. The inner teeth <b>12</b>A of the cylindrical portion <b>12</b> have such a tooth surface shape that outer teeth <b>31</b> formed on an outer circumferential surface portion of the pawl <b>30</b>, which will be described later, can mesh with the inner teeth <b>12</b>A from an inner side in the radial direction. Specifically, the inner teeth <b>12</b>A have a shape in which tooth surfaces are arranged at equal intervals at a pitch of two degrees in the rotation direction.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">At an inner circumferential surface portion of the intermediate cylindrical portion <b>13</b>, three regions (first region <b>13</b>A, second region <b>13</b>B, third region <b>13</b>C) in which an inner diameter dimension from a rotation center C of the ratchet <b>10</b> and a length in the rotation direction are individually set, and a first convex portion <b>13</b>D and a second convex portion <b>13</b>E that protrude inward in the radial direction from corresponding boundary portions between regions are formed.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Each of the first region <b>13</b>A, the second region <b>13</b>B, and the third region <b>13</b>C is formed in an inner circumferential surface shape curving in an arc shape drawn around the rotation center C of the ratchet <b>10</b>. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the first region <b>13</b>A and the third region <b>13</b>C have an inner circumferential surface shape of the same diameter having the same inner diameter dimension slightly larger than that of the second region <b>13</b>B.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>, <b>17</b>A, and <b>18</b>A</figref>, when the ratchet <b>10</b> is at a rotation angle where the first region <b>13</b>A overlaps with a main pawl P<b>1</b> that is one of the three pawls <b>30</b> to be described later in the rotation direction, the first region <b>13</b>A forms the lock region A<b>1</b> in which the main pawl P<b>1</b> is allowed to mesh with the inner teeth <b>12</b>A. At this time, the second region <b>13</b>B and the third region <b>13</b>C overlap with remaining two sub pawls P<b>2</b> in the rotation direction, and serve as relief regions A<b>3</b> in which the sub pawls P<b>2</b> are allowed to mesh with the inner teeth <b>12</b>A. Here, the sub pawls P<b>2</b> correspond to &#x201c;another pawl&#x201d; of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, when the ratchet <b>10</b> is at a rotation angle where the second region <b>13</b>B overlaps with the main pawl P<b>1</b> in the rotation direction, the second region <b>13</b>B forms the free region A<b>2</b> in which the main pawl P<b>1</b> rides on an inner circumferential surface and meshing of the main pawl P<b>1</b> with the inner teeth <b>12</b>A is stopped, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>, <b>17</b>B, and <b>18</b>B</figref>. At this time, the third region <b>13</b>C and the first region <b>13</b>A overlap with the remaining two sub pawls P<b>2</b> in the rotation direction, and serve as the relief regions A<b>3</b> in which movement of the sub pawls P<b>2</b> is prevented.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">That is, the intermediate cylindrical portion <b>13</b> of the ratchet <b>10</b> is configured to allow a locking operation of the main pawl P<b>1</b> in the first region <b>13</b>A as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, and stop the locking operation of the main pawl P<b>1</b> in the second region <b>13</b>B as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, when the locking operation of the main pawl P<b>1</b> among the pawls <b>30</b> is allowed, the locking operation of the remaining two sub pawls P<b>2</b> is also allowed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, when the locking operation of the main pawl P<b>1</b> among the pawls <b>30</b> is stopped, the locking operation of the remaining two sub pawls P<b>2</b> is also stopped.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Thus, the intermediate cylindrical portion <b>13</b> of the ratchet <b>10</b> controls the lock allowance and block of the main pawl P<b>1</b> by the first region <b>13</b>A and the second region <b>13</b>B. Then, when the first region <b>13</b>A functions as the lock region A<b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>), the other two regions (second region <b>13</b>B, third region <b>13</b>C) function as the relief regions A<b>3</b> in which the locking operation of the remaining two sub pawls P<b>2</b> is allowed. When the second region <b>13</b>B functions as the free region A<b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>), the other two regions (first region <b>13</b>A, third region <b>13</b>C) function as the relief regions A<b>3</b> in which the movement of the remaining two sub pawls P<b>2</b> is prevented.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>C and <b>18</b>C</figref>, when the main pawl P<b>1</b> shifts from the lock region A<b>1</b> (first region <b>13</b>A) to the free region A<b>2</b> (second region <b>13</b>B) by the rotation of the ratchet <b>10</b>, the main pawl P<b>1</b> may be abutted against a step between the first region <b>13</b>A and the second region <b>13</b>B in the rotation direction in a state in which the main pawl P<b>1</b> is halfway pushed outward in the radial direction. In this case, the first convex portion <b>13</b>D and the second convex portion <b>13</b>E are respectively formed at positions at which the sub pawls P<b>2</b> are abutted against the first convex portion <b>13</b>D and the second convex portion <b>13</b>E in the rotation direction at the same time. By the abutment of the sub pawls P<b>2</b> at the same time, a load that the main pawl P<b>1</b> receives when being abutted against the step can also be distributed to the other two sub pawls P<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Specifically, the first convex portion <b>13</b>D and the second convex portion <b>13</b>E are formed at positions where, when a ride-up protrusion <b>34</b> of the main pawl P<b>1</b> abuts against the step between the first region <b>13</b>A and the second region <b>13</b>B in the rotation direction by the rotation of the ratchet <b>10</b>, ride-up protrusions <b>34</b> of the remaining two sub pawls P<b>2</b> can abut against the first convex portion <b>13</b>D and the second convex portion <b>13</b>E in the same rotation direction.

The second convex portion <b>13</b>E is formed at a position where the second convex portion <b>13</b>E may overlap with the ride-up protrusion <b>34</b> of the main pawl P<b>1</b> in the rotation direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>, <b>17</b>D, and <b>18</b>D</figref> when the seat back <b>2</b> is tilted to a starting end of the lock region A<b>1</b>, that is, the rearward tilted position Pc as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">A reason is as follows. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, when the seat back <b>2</b> is tilted to the rearward tilted position Pc, the locking plate <b>2</b>Fc abuts against the rear stopper <b>3</b>Fd of the reclining plate <b>3</b>F and is locked to the rear stopper <b>3</b>Fd.
