It enables any head-end node, i.e., the source node, to choose a path without relying on hop-by-hop signaling protocols in the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) network, such as Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) or Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic engineered (RSVP-TE). Each path is specified as a set of &#x201c;segments&#x201d; advertised by link-state routing Protocols. A Segment Routed Path can be derived from a variety of mechanisms, including an interior gateway protocol (IGP) Shortest Path Tree (SPT), explicit configuration, or calculated by a Path Computation Element (PCE). Such paths may be chosen by a suitable network planning tool or provisioned on the ingress node.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Reference is made to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Network Working Group Internet-Draft &#x201c;Segment Routing Architecture&#x201d;, draft-filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing-00, for introduction to the SR architecture. The draft-filsfils-rtgwg-segment-routing-00 defines an &#x201c;IGP Segment or IGP SID&#x201d; as a segment attached to a piece of information advertised by a link-state routing protocols, e.g. an IGP prefix or an IGP adjacency. Several types of segments are defined. An IGP-Node Segment represents an IGP-Prefix Segment which identifies a specific router (e.g. a loopback). The terms &#x201c;Node Segment&#x201d; or &#x201c;Node-segment identifier (SID)&#x201d; are often used as an abbreviation. An IGP-Adjacency Segment or Adjacency Segment or Adj-SID represents an IGP segment attached to an unidirectional adjacency or a set of unidirectional adjacencies. An Adjacency Segment is local to the node which advertises it. Both Node segments and Adjacency segments can be used for SR Traffic Engineering (SR-TE).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">SR may be performed using extensions to Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocols. SR can operate with the MPLS data plane or an Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) data plane, and SR integrates with multiple service capabilities of thelVIPLS, including Layer 3 virtual private network (L3VPN), Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS), Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), and Ethernet VPN (EVPN).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The SR architecture can be applied to the MPLS forwarding plane without any change, in which case an SR path corresponds to anlVIPLS Label Switching Path (LSP). The SR is applied to IPV6 forwarding plane using Segment Routing Header (SRH) as specified in the Internet-draft [I D.ietf-6man-segment-routing-header].</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Reference is also made to IETF Internet-Draft draft-ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions, e.g. draft-ietf-isis-segment-routing-extensions-00 , &#x201c;IS-IS Extensions for Segment Routing&#x201d;. Further, for OSPF Extensions for SR, reference is made to IETF Internet-Draft draft-ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions, e.g. draft-ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions-00 , &#x201c;OSPF Extensions for Segment Routing&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Reference is also made to IETF Internet-Draft draft-ietf-pce-segment-routing-09, &#x201c;PCEP Extensions for Segment Routing&#x201d;, April 2017, which provides further details on SR to support SR by MPLS data plane. This document defines a new ERO subobject denoted by &#x201c;SR-ERO subobject&#x201d; capable of carrying a SID as well as a node/adjacency identifier (NM) associated with the SID. The SR-capable PCEP speakers (i.e., path computation client (PCC) and PCE) are able to generate and/or process such ERO subobject.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, draft-ietf-pce-segment-routing-09 specifies extensions to the PCEP extensions for supporting an SR-TE 1 sp for MPLS forwarding plane, that allow a stateful PCE to compute and initiate Traffic Engineering (TE) paths, as well as a PCC to request a path subject to certain constraint(s) and optimization criteria in SR networks.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">IETF Internet-Draft draft-ietf-6man-segment-routing-header-06, &#x201c;IPv6 Segment Routing Header (SRH)&#x201d;, discloses that SR can be applied to the IPv6 data plane with the addition of a new type of Routing Extension Header.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, none of these documents define any mechanism for establishing an SRv6 tunnel based on SR forIPv6 data-plane/forwarding plane.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, there exists a dire need for a mechanism in a PCE-managed software-defined networking (SDN) network to support SRv6.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">This summary is provided to introduce concepts related to a method for establishing an SR tunnel, and the same are further described below in the detailed description.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">An objective of the present disclosure is to provide PCEP extensions for establishing an SR tunnel by a PCE-managed SDN based on the IPv6 dataplane. The SRv6 tunnel can be configured in PCC or initiated by PCE.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another objective of the present disclosure is to provide a PCC or PCE indicating its ability to support IPv6 SR-Path during the PCEP session Initialization phase via a new flag bit in the SR-PCE-CAPABILITY type-length-value (TLV).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Accordingly, in first aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a method for sending data packets in a communications network. The method comprises the steps of generating, by a PCE, a first PCEP message, wherein the first PCEP message comprises an indicating information and a SID field, the SID field comprises multiple SIDs and the indicating information is used to indicate that each of the multiple SIDs is an IPv6 prefix of a node in a tunnel respectively, and sending, by the PCE, the first PCEP message to a first PCC to establish a SRv6 tunnel from the first PCC to a second PCC according to the SIDs and the indicating information.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one implementation of the first aspect, before generating the first PCEP message, the method comprises the steps of receiving, by the PCE, a second PCEP message from the first PCC, sending, by the PCE, a third PCEP message to the first PCC, wherein, the second PCEP message and the third PCEP message are used to set up an SRv6 capable PCEP session between the first PCC and the PCE, each of the second PCEP message and the third PCEP message carries an SRv6-CAPABILITY TLV field, wherein the Type field of the SRv6-CAPABILITY TLV field is used to indicate that both the PCE and the first PCC support SRv6 forwarding.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Accordingly, in second aspect of the present disclosure there is provided a method in a communications network. This method comprises the steps of receiving, by a first PCC, a first PCEP message from a PCE, wherein the first PCEP message comprises an indicating information and a SID field, the SID field comprises multiple SIDs and the indicating information is used to indicate that each of the multiple SIDs is an IPv6 Prefix of a node in tunnel respectively , and establishing, by the first PCC, a SRv6 tunnel from the first PCC to a second PCC according to the SIDs and the indicating information the SIDs and the indicating information.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one implementation of the second aspect, before receiving the first PCEP message, the method comprises the steps of sending, by the first PCC, a second PCEP message to the PCE, receiving, by the first PCC, a third PCEP message from the PCE, wherein, the second PCEP message and the third PCEP message are used to set up an SRv6 capable PCEP session between the first PCC and the PCE, each of the second PCEP message and the third PCEP message carries an SRv6-CAPABILITY TLV field, wherein the Type field of the SRv6-CAPABILITY TLV field is used to indicate that both the PCE and the first PCC support SRv6 forwarding.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Significantly, SID field and the indication information can be carried by an Explicit Route Object (ERO) subobject supporting variable length SID for SR IPv6. The ERO subobject in the present application can also be known as SRv6-ERO Subobject. The indicating information can be a bit, i.e. an I-bit of the SRv6-ERO Subobject, modified to support variable length SID for SR IPv6. It indicates that the SID is variable length (i.e. 16 bytes to encode IPv6 Prefix) unlike 4 bytes in old subobjects. The ERO subobjects can be carried in at least one or more of update message (PCUpd) message, PCEP LSP Initiate Request (PCInitiate) message and Path Computation Reply (PCRep) message to convey an explicit-path to the PCC from the PCE.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Optionally, the first PCEP message, which can be a PCInitiate message, or a PCRep message, also comprises a PATH-SETUP-TLV field, where the Type field of the PATH-SETUP-TLV field indicates that the tunnel is established by SRv6 technique. The second PCEP message, which can be a PCReq Message, also comprises an SRv6-CAPABILITY TLV field, where the Type field of the SRv6-CAPABILITY TLV field indicates that the first PCC supports SRv6 forwarding. The third PCEP message, which can be a PCRep Message, also comprises an SRv6-CAPABILITY TLV field, where the Type field of the SRv6-CAPABILITY TLV field indicates that the PCE supports SRv6 forwarding.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Optionally, the PCC configured to send a Path Computation Report (PCRpt) message for updating Link-State-Database (LSDB) to the PCE. The PCE determines IPv6 LSDB through path computation element protocol link state (PCEPLS) or Border Gateway Protocol link state (BGPLS) or IGP or any combination thereof. The PCE configured to modify said path and sends a PCUpd message to the PCC.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">At the outset, both PCC and PCE can exchange SRv6 capability TLV through an Open message, for establishing SRv6 capability during the PCEP session. As an example, the PCC first sends an Open message to PCE to indicate that it is capable of establishing an SRv6 session. In reply, the PCE sends an Open message to PCC to indicate that it is also capable of establishing an SRv6 session.
