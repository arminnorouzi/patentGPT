For example, hydraulic fracturing (commonly referred to as &#x201c;fracking&#x201d;) is a well stimulation technique used in oil and gas production, in which highly pressurized fluid is injected into a cased wellbore. When hydraulic fracturing is employed during oil and gas production, the pressured fluid flows through perforations in a casing in a well bore and creates fractures in deep rock formations. Pressurized fluid is delivered to the casing through a wellhead supported on the ground surface. Sand or other small particles (commonly referred to as &#x201c;proppants&#x201d;) are normally delivered with the fluid into the rock formations. The proppants help hold the fractures open after the fluid is withdrawn. The resulting fractures facilitate the extraction of oil, gas, brine, or other fluid trapped within the rock formations.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Fluid ends are devices used in conjunction with a power end to pressurize the fluid used during hydraulic fracturing operations. Together, the fluid end and power end function as a reciprocating pump. A single fracking operation may require the use of two or more pumps at one time. The pumps are typically positioned on a truck bed at the wellsite so that they may be easily moved, as needed. The fluid and proppant mixture to be pressurized is normally held in large tanks at the wellsite. An intake piping system delivers the fluid and proppant mixture from the tanks to each fluid end. A discharge piping system transfers the pressurized fluid from each fluid end to the wellhead, where it is delivered into the casing.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a front right-side perspective view of an embodiment of a high-pressure hydraulic fracturing pump.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is the front right-side perspective view of the pump shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with the drive section and base section removed.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a right-side elevational view of the pump shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a rear right-side perspective view of the pump shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a rear elevational view of the pump shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a front elevational view of the pump shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a top plan view of the pump shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> a front right-side perspective view of the power end assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0126" num="0125">High pressure hydraulic fracturing pumps typically comprise a fluid end assembly attached to a power end assembly. Fluid end assemblies are typically used in oil and gas operations to deliver highly pressurized corrosive and/or abrasive fluids to piping leading to the wellbore. The assemblies are typically attached to power ends run by engines. The engine crankshaft is attached to a transmission input shaft, the transmission output shaft is connected to a gearbox input shaft, and the gearbox output shaft is attached to the power end crankshaft. The power end crankshaft reciprocates plungers within the fluid end assembly to pump fluid through the fluid end.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Fluid ends operate under notoriously extreme conditions, enduring the same pressures, vibrations, and abrasives that are needed to fracture deep rock formations at a well site. Fluid ends may operate at pressures of 5,000-15,000 pounds per square inch (psi) or greater. However, the pressure may reach up to 22,500 psi. The power end used with the fluid end typically has a power output of at least 2,250 horsepower during hydraulic fracturing operations. A single fluid end typically produces a fluid volume of about 185-690 gallons per minute or 4-15 barrels per minute during a fracking operation. When a plurality of fluid ends is used together, the fluid ends collectively deliver about 4,600 gallons per minute or 100 barrels per minute to the wellbore.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Power end assemblies known in the art typically use a one-piece frame fabricated from steel plate and/or castings to provide a structure to mount the crankshaft, drive apparatus, and fluid end. The one-piece frame is also used to attach the entire high-pressure hydraulic fracturing pump to a trailer or truck bed for transport and use in the field. The one-piece frame is very heavy due to the size of the material needed to withstand the forces applied during operation and because of the large mount areas needed to attach the various components.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Power ends often fail at the mount plate, the point the fluid end connects to the power end. Fluid ends are attached to the mount plate using stay rods. The stay rods are typically torqued into threaded holes in the mount plate of the power end and the fluid end is attached to the protruding end of the stay rods. This produces an area of stress concentration at the threaded holes of the mount plate. Typical failures include the mount plate breaking out around the threads, weld failures in the area where the mount plate is welded to the other components of the one-piece power end, and thread failure. All these failures require major repair to, or complete replacement of, the power end.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">Other common failures in power ends occur due to poor lubrication of the moving parts. It is known in the art to lubricate the main bearings and connecting rod bearings by forcing pressurized lubricant through a center bore and intersecting cross bores in the crankshaft. It is also known in the art to lubricate the wrist pin, connecting rod end, thrust seat and crosshead by forcing pressurized lubricant into the crosshead bore and intersecting cross bores through the crosshead, thrust seat, and crosshead end of the connecting rod. The problem is that the entire lubrication system is a single system. One lubrication pump pressurizes a manifold to which all lubrication circuits are attached.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">During operation components wear and clearances between the components increase. This increase in the clearances reduces the amount of resistance to lubricant flow resulting in higher lubricant flow in that area. While higher lubricant flow results in reduced wear in that circuit, the other circuits will experience reduced flow and higher wear. The reduced lubricant flow will accelerate the wear in another area increasing clearances until it receives enough lubricant to stop eroding. This alternating wear and lubrication cycle repeats causing uneven and accelerated wear in the components of the power end reducing maintenance intervals. A lack of modularity in the current industry designs mean that the entire system is replaced or undergoes repair.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">To reduce, mitigate, or eliminate the failures listed above, the inventors propose a novel power end assembly with modular construction. Such modular construction also reduces the physical dimensions and weight of the power end assembly in various embodiments. The power end assemblies disclosed herein include some or all of the following features and advantages in various embodiments:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0132">Modular construction of the power end includes individual connect plates, individual crosshead frames, and/or individual crosshead assemblies that may be individually replaced, which allows failed components to be replaced without discarding other components.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0133">The power end assembly is held together by one or more sets of stay rods that may be disengaged and reengaged using nuts to facilitate replacement of components without cutting or welding.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0134">Tension on the one or more sets of stay rods causes compression on the power end assembly to preload the power end assembly against working loads and/or to apply compression to components made of materials that benefit from compression.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0135">Using a plurality of sets of stay rods enables the stay rods to be vertically offset such that deflection and stress from driving the fluid end can be reduced by moving the set of stay rods that couple the connector section to the power end assembly closer to the cylindrical axes of the plungers reciprocating in the fluid ends.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0136">Compression from the one or more sets of stay rods is distributed throughout the power end using one or more unitary plates. The one or more unitary plates also reduces stress on and displacement of modular components due to static and working loads.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0137">Different components of the power end assembly are made of different materials that are suited to different purposes. For example, components housing moving components such as the crosshead frames and crank frame may be made of ductile iron that is being compressed by plates made of high-alloy steel. Compressing the ductile iron components increases their performance (e.g., resistance to wear, working life) in various embodiments. Other components may be made of high-alloy steel for strength. The use of different materials may also reduce weight and cost of materials.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0138">Weight is strategically reduced throughout the power end by using individual crosshead frames and through the use of weight-reducing features in the crosshead section, crank section, and various plates.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0139">Blind nuts and/or threaded receivers in one or more of the plates allows nuts to be installed at the proper amount of torque without measuring an amount of exposed thread extending from the nuts.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0140">Feet in the crank frame anchor the crank frame to the base section at each bearing journal location and in line with bearing loads that are transferred to the feet and then to the base section.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0141">Longer connecting arms and wider crossheads lower pressure-velocity loading of the crosshead assembly on the crosshead frames.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0011" num="0142">Using pony rod seal housings that hold the pony rod seal partially inside the crosshead frame increases the clearance around the pony rod clamp on the backstroke of the power end assembly.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0012" num="0143">Lubrication is applied at the top of the power end at both the crosshead section and the crank section, collected through a plurality of drains in the crank section, and reused in a closed lubrication system.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0013" num="0144">Spacers maintain the distance between the connect plates and the crosshead frames.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0014" num="0145">Use of seals positioned in grooves cut into components instead of gaskets avoids common problems with gaskets such as saturation and over compression.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0015" num="0146">Various bores in the crosshead frames facilitate the flow of air and lubricant from the crosshead frames to the crank section.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0016" num="0147">Various alignment dowel pins, countersunk holes, and/or sleeves facilitate alignment of components during assembly (or reassembly) of the power end assembly.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0133" num="0148">The advantages conferred by the previously described improvements are listed here for convenience. This is not an exhaustive list and it is expected that other benefits will be realized as the improvements are implemented.

As will be understood, ductile iron (also referred to as ductile cast iron, spheroidal graphite cast iron, or nodular cast iron) has improved impact and fatigue resistance, elongation, and wear resistance due to the spherical (round) graphite structures in the metal.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0185">Further, as the individual crosshead frames <b>220</b> and crank frame <b>210</b> are subjected to wear, the graphite embedded in the ductile iron may act as an additional dry lubricant around the crankshaft <b>212</b> and the crosshead assembly as they move. Additionally, the geometry of crank frame <b>210</b> and the individual crosshead frames <b>220</b> may be easier to manufacture with ductile iron because the crank frame <b>210</b> and the individual crosshead frames <b>220</b> can be cast from molten ductile iron, which may be easier and less expensive than machining the crank frame <b>210</b> and the individual crosshead frames <b>220</b> from blocks of high alloy steel.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0186">In contrast, high alloy steel (compared to ductile iron or carbon steel) has greater properties of strength, hardness, toughness, wear resistance, corrosion resistance, hardenability, and hot hardness. Thus, a high alloy steel is better able accept and distribute stress from tension on the first set of rods <b>240</b> and the second set of rods <b>242</b>, and from deflection from the reciprocating plunger and individual connect plates <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0187">Further, because the rear support plate <b>200</b>, the central support plate <b>202</b>, the top front support plate <b>204</b>, and the bottom front support plate <b>206</b> are plates with various bores and cutouts discussed herein, machining them from larger plates is a relatively easier and less expensive than it would be to machine the crank frame <b>210</b> and the individual crosshead frames <b>220</b> from blocks of high alloy steel.

In such embodiments, the second set of rods <b>242</b> is configured to remove high deflection and high stress in the connect plate <b>230</b> that might not be as effectively removed in an embodiment having a single set of stay rods because the single set of stay rods would be spaced too far from the cylindrical axis of the plunger (i.e. centerline A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) to effectively eliminate the deflection and stress if they were the only set of stay rods used. In contrast, by being closer to centerline A, the second set of rods <b>242</b> decreases deflection and stress on the individual connect plates <b>230</b>, the spacers <b>232</b>, and the second set of rods <b>242</b> is decreased because the vertical offset <b>306</b> is closer to centerline A.

The visible inspection of this exposed thread may be indicative of backing off by either the first nut <b>2400</b> and/or the blind nut <b>2408</b>, which may improve ease of maintenance.

The seals <b>4802</b> engage with the central support plate <b>202</b> to prevent lubrication from entering the connect plate stay rod holes <b>904</b> and leaking out of the crosshead frame <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0271">The front face of crosshead frame <b>220</b> includes a plurality of threaded holes <b>4500</b> disposed around the central bore <b>4600</b>. As discussed herein, the threaded holes <b>4500</b> receive the fasteners <b>3802</b>, thereby securing the pony rod seal housing <b>3800</b> to the front of central bore <b>4600</b>. The top of crosshead frame <b>220</b> includes at least two holes: the lubrication inlet bore <b>1900</b> that is coupled to lubrication conduit <b>702</b> to receive lubricant during operation as discussed herein, and a lifting eye bore <b>4410</b> which is configured to facilitate lifting of crosshead frame <b>220</b> during assembly.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0272">The lubrication inlet bore <b>1900</b> is partially threaded at the top. The threaded portion begins at the top surface and may extend to half the bore depth. The threaded portion is configured to receive the connector <b>704</b> from the lubrication system <b>700</b>. A conduit may be disposed within the lubrication inlet bore <b>1900</b> to facilitate lubrication. In addition to the lubrication inlet bore <b>1900</b>, the crosshead frame <b>220</b> also defines channel <b>1906</b> configured to allow lubrication to flow into the crank section <b>122</b> and the channel <b>2500</b>. The channel <b>2500</b> allows air to flow between the crank section <b>122</b> and the crosshead section <b>124</b> to release air that is pressurized by a forward stroke by crosshead assembly <b>1700</b> and to relieve a vacuum that is created by a back stroke by crosshead assembly <b>1700</b>. The channel <b>1906</b> and the channel <b>2500</b> open to the central bore <b>4600</b> and the rear face of the crosshead frame <b>220</b>, but neither of the channel <b>1906</b> nor the channel <b>2500</b> open to the front face of the crosshead frame <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0273">Employing individual crosshead frames <b>220</b> allows for further weight reduction relative to a unitary crosshead section. For example, if two crosshead frames <b>220</b> are arranged side-by-side, the weight reducing cut out sections <b>4300</b> of the adjacent sides of the crosshead frames <b>220</b> result in at least some of the area between the central bores <b>4600</b> of the crosshead frames <b>220</b> to be negative space rather than solid material that would connect a unitary crosshead section. Additionally, using individual crosshead frames <b>220</b> means that if a single crosshead frame <b>220</b> in a crosshead section <b>124</b> fails (e.g., because crosshead <b>3810</b> has eroded central bore <b>4600</b> of the crosshead frame <b>220</b>), the failed crosshead frame <b>220</b> may be individually replaced rather than replacing the entire crosshead section <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0274">Replacement may be further aided by the various alignment pins discussed herein helping to align the replacement with the rest of the power end assembly <b>120</b>. Further, because replacing an individual crosshead frame <b>220</b> with a new crosshead frame <b>220</b> will take less time than repairing a damaged crosshead frame, the power end assembly <b>120</b> may be brought back into service faster relative to repairing a unitary crosshead section. It is also easier and/or less costly to cast a smaller piece such as an individual crosshead frame <b>220</b> rather than a unitary crosshead section. Constructing a crosshead section <b>124</b> using a plurality of individual crosshead frames <b>220</b> may result in weight reduction, cost savings, less down time, and various other improvements relative to a unitary crosshead section.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0275">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>51</b> and <b>52</b></figref>, the spatial relationship between a narrow portion <b>5110</b> of the connecting rod <b>3830</b> and a wider portion of the connecting rod <b>3830</b> results in the clearance <b>5100</b> between the connecting rod <b>3830</b> and the crosshead <b>3810</b>. By reducing weight in the sides of the crosshead <b>3810</b> (e.g., with main bearing clearance cut outs <b>3813</b>), overall weight of the crosshead <b>3810</b> is reduced without reducing the amount of material on the top and bottom of the crosshead <b>3810</b>. Because the top and bottom of the crosshead <b>3810</b> contact the walls of the crosshead frame <b>220</b> that define the central bore <b>4600</b> as the crosshead assembly <b>1700</b> reciprocates, it is on the top and bottom of the crosshead <b>3810</b> and the corresponding portions of the crosshead frame <b>220</b> that experience the most wear.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0276">Further, clearance <b>5100</b> allows more room such that the connecting rod <b>3820</b> can be longer. Compared to crossheads used in other types of power ends, the crosshead <b>3810</b> is both longer and has a wider diameter. Additionally, as discussed herein, the connecting rod <b>3830</b> is longer than connecting rods in other power ends. As a result, pressure-velocity loading on the linear portions of the crosshead assembly <b>1700</b> and the crosshead frame <b>220</b> can be reduced. Further, the main bearing clearance cut outs <b>3813</b> also provide clearance around the crankshaft <b>212</b> when the crosshead assembly <b>1700</b> is backstroking. Additionally, the connecting rod <b>3830</b> is made of a single piece, which may reduce manufacturing and labor costs compared a connecting rod made of multiple pieces.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0277">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>52</b></figref>, a cutaway sideview of the plunger <b>800</b> and the crosshead assembly <b>1700</b> is shown.

A flat rear surface <b>44</b> of the outer nut <b>35</b> abuts a flat front surface <b>45</b> of the washer <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0341">In operation, as the outer nut <b>35</b> is turned, the inner nut <b>36</b> moves axially away from the front support plates <b>28</b> or <b>29</b>, thereby applying a tensile load to the stay rod <b>240</b>. The engagement of the splined surfaces <b>38</b> and <b>41</b> between the inner nut <b>36</b> and the washer <b>34</b> rotationally couples the inner nut <b>36</b> to the washer <b>34</b>. Such coupling prevents the inner nut <b>36</b> from turning while providing a solid reaction point for turning the outer nut <b>35</b>.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0342">The construction of the first nut <b>33</b> allows the first nut <b>33</b> to load the stay rods <b>240</b> in tension with only a minimal amount of torsional stress. In contrast, the first nut <b>2400</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, may apply a greater amount of torsional stress to the stay rod <b>240</b> to properly secure the stay rod <b>240</b> in place. By reducing the amount of torsional stress applied to the stay rod <b>240</b>, the life of the stay rod <b>240</b> is increased.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0343">The construction of the first nut <b>33</b> also provides a more accurate application of tensile force to each of the stay rods <b>240</b>. When using the first nut <b>2400</b> and the washer <b>2402</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, the friction between the nut <b>2400</b> and the front support plates <b>204</b> or <b>206</b> must be overcome by the applied torque. As a result, less torque is used to apply tension to the stay rod <b>240</b>. Further, the friction between each nut <b>2400</b> and the plates <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> may vary greatly and defy generic application. The plurality of stay rods <b>240</b> may thus vary between rods that are overloaded or underloaded. Both situations result in a reduced operating life and potential failure. The first nut <b>33</b>, in contrast, applies a repeatable tensile force to each stay rod <b>240</b> when a known torque is applied to the first nut <b>33</b>.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0344">During assembly and operation of the power end assembly <b>120</b>, it is essential to apply a known clamping force to the assembly <b>120</b>. Torque is preferably applied to each nut <b>33</b> or <b>2400</b> until the target clamping force is reached. The clamping force may be inferred from the torque applied to the first nuts <b>33</b> or <b>2400</b>. However, the damping force may be directly measured using methods known in the art. For example, a force washer configured to measure the force applied by the nut may be used in place of a traditional washer. Alternatively, a strain gauge may be applied directly to each stay rod <b>240</b> and the damping force may be calculated based on the measured strain.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0345">The clamping force may be continually monitored during operation. Any reduction in the measured clamping force during operation may indicate that a failure has occurred and the pump <b>100</b> needs to be shut down. Being able to immediately shut down the pump <b>100</b> in response to a failure helps mitigate any future damage. Further, constant monitoring of the clamping force and the knowledge accumulated from such monitoring helps an operator infer or derive various operating parameters of the pump <b>100</b>. Such parameters may be used to optimize the pump's operation and life.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0346">During assembly and operation, the amount of clamping force applied to the power end assembly <b>120</b> for proper operation is significantly high. Such high clamping force may deform the crosshead frames <b>220</b>. Specifically, the central bore <b>4600</b> formed in the crosshead frame <b>220</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>47</b>-<b>50</b></figref>, may deform, causing interference between the crosshead <b>3810</b> and frame <b>220</b> during assembly. Such interference may make installation of the crosshead <b>3810</b> into the frame <b>220</b> impossible or, if installed, cause too much friction during operation, leading to failure.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0347">One method of solving such issue is to apply the operating clamp load to the crosshead frame <b>220</b> during manufacture of the frame's central bore <b>4600</b>. In practice, the crosshead frame <b>220</b> is mounted in a machining fixture that reproduces the clamping force, and any other forces applied to the crosshead frame <b>220</b> during assembly and/or operation. Once such forces are applied, the central bore <b>4600</b> is formed within the crosshead frame <b>220</b>. The central bore <b>4600</b> may be formed using any number of methods known in the art. After the central bore <b>4600</b> is formed, the crosshead frame <b>220</b> is removed from the machining fixture and may be installed within the power end assembly <b>120</b>. When the same clamping force is reapplied to the crosshead frame <b>220</b> during assembly of the power end assembly <b>120</b>, the central bore <b>4600</b> distorts to its desired shape. Thus, proper clearance between a frame <b>220</b> and a crosshead <b>3810</b> is achieved.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0348">Another solution to the above deformation issue is to calculate and/or predict the expected deformation of the central bore <b>4600</b>. The central bore <b>4600</b> is then formed in a traditional manner, but instead of forming the original desired shape, the bore is formed to account for the expected deformation. For example, if the desired shape of the bore <b>4600</b> is round, the bore <b>4600</b> is formed non-round, so that upon deformation of the bore <b>4600</b> during assembly, the bore is deformed into the desired round shape.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0349">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>84</b>-<b>90</b></figref>, an alternative embodiment of a power end assembly <b>46</b> is shown.
