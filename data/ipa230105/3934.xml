However, as communication data rates increase beyond 10 Gb/s, the primary optical penalty is signal broadening (eye closure) due to modal and chromatic dispersions in the optical media. Due to dispersion effects, the maximum channel reaches for higher-speed communications have been decreasing from 400 m over OM4 fiber for 10 Gb/s (10GBASE-SR), to 150 m for 40 Gb/s (40GBASE-SR4), 100 m for 100 Gb/s (100GBASE-SR4), and 85 m for 128 Gb/s Fibre Channel For these higher-speed systems, insertion loss and fiber attenuation have little if any effect on limiting maximum channel reach.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Optical Multimode Fiber Types OM3, OM4, and OM5, are characterized by minimum effective modal bandwidth (EMB), ranging from 2000 MHzkm for OM3, to 4700 MHzkm for OM4 and OM5 at the nominal operating wavelength of 850 nm. However, due to an interaction between modal and chromatic dispersions in channels utilizing vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) based transceivers, the actual total operating channel bandwidth is unknown. It is therefore increasingly important to have the capability of measuring MMF bandwidth in the field in order to ensure the channels can support the required data rates over the required reaches of the installed structured cabling. Unfortunately, due to the very high cost of high-speed commercial test equipment, bandwidth measurements in the field are not practical and are cost prohibitive.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this disclosure, we describe a new method and low cost apparatus for measuring the channel bandwidth distance product of VCSEL transmission over the MMF optical cabling infrustruction under test in order to determine the maximum data rate the optical cabling infrastructure can support, taking into account the interactions between modal and chromatic dispersions. The apparatus and method according to the present invention estimates the channel bandwidth and measures the optical length of the fiber under test utilizing a VCSEL transceiver and optical time-domain reflectometry. Utilizing reference data, one result of the measured data analysis is the display of the estimated maximum data rate the fiber cabling under test can support. An apparatus and method according the present invention, can let the user know if a legacy cabling infrastructure can be re-used for future upgraded higher data rate.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since the standardization of 10 Gb/s Ethernet (10GBASE-SR) and laser-optimized OM3 multimode fiber (MMF) in 2002, the deployment of MMF has been rapidly growing and is now commonplace in most data communication networks. However, with the relentless demand for increases in Ethernet data rates and the need for longer reaches, new MMF types including OM4, OM4+, and OM5 have been introduced into the marketplace. In general, the difference between these MMF types is their minimum Effective Modal Bandwidth (EMB), and the wavelength dependence of the EMB. EMB is a parameter that characterizes the MMF's ability to minimize the distortion of the transmitted optical signal as it propagates through the fiber. The higher the EMB, the lower the optical signal distortion.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Due to process variations in the fiber manufacturing process, there is a relatively large distribution of EMB values. Following the fabrication process, based on the fiber's EMB, fibers are sorted as OM3 and OM4, where OM3 has an EMB of at least 2000 MHz&#xb7;km and OM4 has an EMB of at least 4700 MHz&#xb7;km at the measurement wavelength of 850 nm. However, EMB alone is not sufficient to predict the performance of an optical channel. It has been shown that in addition to chromatic dispersion due to spectral width, the spatial-spectral emission pattern of the light emitted by a VCSEL transmitter also plays a critical role in the modal bandwidth of the MMF channel.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">During the development of 10 Gb/s Ethernet and OM3 fiber, it was assumed that VCSELs launch the same optical spectrum into all the different fiber modes uniformly. However, in 2008 Panduit fiber researchers discovered that this is not the case. Shorter wavelengths are emitted at large radial offsets and with larger angles normal to the surface of the VCSEL and consequently, couple into higher-order fiber modes in the outer regions of the fiber core. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>d</i></figref>, we show the spatial spectral emission pattern for four of the wavelength modes coupled into a MMF by a nominal VCSEL transceiver. We see that the longest wavelength (850.452 nm) is emitted from the central region of the VCSEL, which tend to couple into low-order modes close to the fiber optic axis. The shortest wavelength 849.108 nm on the other hand, couples into an annular region having larger radial offsets. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b><i>a</i></figref>-<b>2</b><i>c, </i>we plot the center wavelength as a function of radial offset across a MMF core for three VCSEL transceivers. We see that the center wavelength of the coupled power varies from longer wavelength at the center of the fiber, to a shorter wavelength near the core-cladding interface, which excites the highest order fiber modes at large radial offsets. As a consequence of this spectral-spatial emission bias, different fiber modes contain different wavelengths, and therefore, in addition to modal dispersion, radial fiber modes also undergo a chromatic dispersion relative to each other due to their differences in wavelength.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a consequence of process variation in the production of MMF, depending on the bias <b>301</b> or <b>302</b> in refractive index profile <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, when the fiber is coupled to a VCSEL the modal dispersion of the optical communication system will change due to a shift in modal dispersion resulting from their variation in wavelengths and chromatic dispersion. In other words, due to the chromatic dispersion in glass and the fact that different mode groups have different wavelengths, the mode groups will propagate at different speeds as a result of both modal and chromatic dispersion resulting in a total combined fiber-VCSEL channel bandwidth, which is highly dependent on the production variations in refractive index profile.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, we show the bit error rate (BER) performance for two MMFs <b>401</b> and <b>402</b> with identical EMB values of about 2400 MHz&#xb7;km, using the same VCSEL transceiver. Based on the measured EMB, one would predict the BER performance for these two fibers would be essentially identical. However, fiber <b>401</b> has a refractive index profile resembling variation <b>301</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and fiber <b>402</b>, has an index profile resembling variation <b>302</b>. Due to the opposite bias of index profile variation and the interaction of modal and chromatic dispersions, the BER channel performance when coupled to the same 10 Gb/s Ethernet compliant transceiver results in a difference in bit error rate of more than 3-orders of magnitude at a receive power of &#x2212;10 dBm. It has been shown that for bias <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> in refractive index profile <b>300</b> have peak optimized EMBs shifted away from the nominal 850 nm, where bias <b>301</b> results in a peak EMB shifted to a longer wavelength, e.g., 870 nm, whereas bias <b>302</b>, results in a fiber with its peak EMB shifted to a shorter wavelength i.e., less than 850 nm.

The distribution in power intensity is illustrated by the color scale shown on the right of each image, where yellow represents high optical power and blue represents low optical power. It can be seen that the longest wavelength (850.452 nm) is confined to the inner region of the MMF and therefore, the power for this wavelength is carried by low-order fiber modes propagating in the central region of the fiber. The optical power for the shortest propagating wavelength (849.108) is seen to occupy an annular region within the fiber core ranging over a radial offset of about 8-15 microns.

Fiber <b>401</b> has a variation in refractive index profile resembling <b>301</b>, and fiber <b>402</b> resembles index profile <b>302</b>. According to the IEEE 802.3ae Ethernet Standard, the minimum reach requirement for OM3 fiber is 300 m for a received optical power of &#x2212;9.9 dBm.

It has been shown that the root cause of this discrepancy in optical channel system performance is the spatial-spectral coupling of VCSEL modes to fiber modes which results in a large difference in dispersion due to the interaction between the modal and chromatic dispersions. Although fiber <b>402</b> passes the minimum EMB standardized specification of 2000 MHz&#xb7;km, due to its refractive index bias <b>302</b>, the fiber does not support the specified channel reach when coupled to a VCSEL having a &#x394;&#x3bb;<sub>c</sub>.

Based on the standard EMB metric, fiber <b>502</b> should have a lower BER than <b>501</b>, but we find this is not the case. Due to differences the bias in refractive index profile, these two fibers show a large difference in channel performance using the same VCSEL transceiver.

In general, due to the modal-chromatic dispersion interaction, many of the tested fibers develop noise floors which makes it difficult to compare performance at an error rate of 1E-12. However, the BER performance can be compared by using a higher error rate, above which fibers show no significant noise floor.

Industry standards for data rates of 10 Gb/s and higher require error rates to be less than 1 error bit in every 1 trillion bits transmitted (1E-12). Due to the spatial-spectral coupling of VCSEL modes into fiber modes, the BER of an optical channel cannot be predicted based on the fiber's measured EMB alone, but must take into account the total bandwidth of the VCSEL-Fiber optical system. To evaluate the spatial-spectral bandwidth of a VCSEL-Fiber communication channel, VCSEL <b>702</b> in transceiver <b>701</b> must be characterized in terms of its bandwidth and spectral-spatial launch conditions, which requires a careful evaluation of the light distribution inside fiber <b>707</b>, being launched to the fiber under test <b>711</b>.
