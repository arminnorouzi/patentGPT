The invention further relates to a method for manufacturing the platelet-shaped magnetic effect pigment, a printing ink containing the effect pigments and a value document printed with the effect pigments.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Data carriers, such as value documents or identification documents, or other objects of value, such as branded articles, are often provided for safeguarding purposes with security elements which permit a verification of the authenticity of the data carriers and which at the same time serve as protection from unauthorized reproduction. An important role in safeguarding the authentication is played by security elements with viewing angle-dependent effects because these cannot be reproduced even with the most modern copiers. The security elements are equipped here with optically variable elements which convey a different pictorial impression to the viewer from different viewing angles, showing for example a different color impression or brightness impression and/or a different graphic motif, depending on the viewing angle.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thin-film systems which produce a viewing angle-dependent color impression for the viewer by means of interference are known in the prior art. This optical effect can serve as an optically variable security element. A large-area thin-film system can be crushed by means of various techniques. The size of the resulting flakes or platelets can be as small as a few micrometers laterally, but the size usually ranges in a region from 2 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m. The vertical construction of a platelet is given by the requirements of the interference layers and is normally as thin as possible, e.g. in a region from 200 nm to 800 nm. Such platelets are employed e.g. in an optically variable ink (so-called OVI&#xae; ink) which is used for providing a security element.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Further known is the possibility of applying the thin-film systems producing a color impression onto a ferromagnetic material. The pigment platelets thus have a magnetic moment. Magnetically orientable effect pigments are commercially available, e.g. under the trade name OVMI&#xae; of the SICPA company (the abbreviation OVMI stands for &#x201c;optically variable magnetic ink&#x201d;). The pigments typically have a platelet-shaped construction and are present in the form of a layered composite which often includes two layers of optical effect layers and a magnetic layer embedded in between. With regard to the optical effect layers, metallically mirroring layers as well as color-shifting layer systems, e.g. with an absorber/dielectric/reflector construction, can be considered. The embedded magnetic layer is normally invisible, but is required for the alignment of the pigments.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the prior art it is further known to utilize such color pigments having a magnetic moment for providing optically variable security elements. For this purpose, the pigments are incorporated into a transparent binding agent. By means of an external magnetic field the alignment of the pigments can be influenced immediately after the printing on a printing stock. Then, the binding agent is cured, e.g. by means of UV radiation, in order to fix the alignments of the pigments. By skillfully setting the spatial course of the pigment alignments, it is possible to equip the printed substrate with optical kinetic effects. Since due to shape anisotropy the magnetization direction of the pigments extends preferably along the direction of the largest dimension of the pigments, the magnetic moment of the particles is aligned perpendicular to the normal vector of the thin films. If a magnetic field with a field strength with the formula symbol &#x201c;H&#x201d; is applied, the pigments are aligned such that their magnetic moments are as parallel as possible to the field vector.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a consequence, the magnetic pigments can rotate about axes parallel to their magnetization, which are arranged perpendicular to the normal vector of the thin films. When using the magnetic pigments in a manner known in the prior art, it can be assumed that the alignment of the pigments in one direction is substantially uniform, while in another direction it is substantially randomly distributed. This leads to a widening of the light reflection and to a decreased brilliance and sharpness of the optically variable effect.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object of the present invention is to provide magnetic effect pigments which allow a more extensive control of spatial alignment, in order to thereby achieve a more attractive optical effect.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This object is achieved based on the feature combinations defined in the independent claims.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Developments of the invention are subject matter of the subclaims.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">1.

Instead of the formulation &#x201c;a preferential magnetic direction deviating from the platelet plane&#x201d;, the formulation &#x201c;a preferential magnetic direction deviating from the perpendicular to the normal vector of the platelet&#x201d; is also used herein. The formulation &#x201c;largely uniform preferential direction&#x201d; of the magnetic particles is to be understood in such a way that the individual magnetic particles of the effect pigment do not necessarily all have to point in exactly the same direction, but where applicable the individual magnetic particles (in particular narrowly) distributed around a mean value or average can be oriented on average along exactly one direction. The magnetic particles have in particular a size of less than 1000 nm, preferably less than 500 nm, further preferably less than 200 nm and particularly preferably less than 100 nm. The largely uniform preferential magnetic direction of the magnetic particles fixed within the solid matrix is preferably aligned substantially perpendicular to the platelet plane of the effect pigment. It is preferred that the largely uniform preferential magnetic direction of the magnetic particles fixed within the solid matrix is a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy, in particular preferably a uniaxial magnetic crystal anisotropy or a uniaxial magnetic shape anisotropy. The magnetic particles are in particular ferromagnetic particles or ferrimagnetic particles. The magnetic particles can be selected e.g. from the group consisting of BaFe<sub>12</sub>O<sub>19 </sub>or barium ferrite, FePt, CoCrPt, CoPt, BiMn or bismanol, &#x3b1;-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>or hematite and (in particular tetragonal) Nd<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>14</sub>B.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0043">The production of platelet-shaped magnetic effect pigments with a magnetic moment perpendicular to the platelet plane requires the manufacture of a thin layer with a magnetic moment that is permanently perpendicular to the layer plane. Such a manufacture is a major technical challenge, in particular if in view of occupational health and safety one has to do without toxic substances, such as toxic transition metals. By means of the manufacturing method according to the invention, magnetic layers with a magnetic moment in particular perpendicular to the layer plane can be produced in an advantageous manner, starting from which advantageous platelet-shaped magnetic effect pigments with in particular a magnetic moment perpendicular to the platelet plane can be obtained. The inventive idea is based on the use of an initially liquid medium surrounding the magnetic particles, which can be solidified in targeted fashion, e.g. by UV radiation, by electron beam curing (EBC) or by means of heat. In the solid aggregate state, the medium is able to enclose the magnetic particles embedded therein in a stationary manner, so that further spatial alignment of the embedded particles can be avoided. In the course of the manufacturing, first, a liquid medium with magnetic particles embedded therein is provided. The magnetic particles are present randomly distributed within the liquid medium and have a random spatial orientation. In a subsequent step, an external magnetic field is applied, the direction of the field lines corresponding to the magnetization direction desired for the magnetic particles. Within the liquid medium, the magnetic particles are still mobile. Thus, they can be aligned, e.g. by an external magnetic field, and during this process or shortly afterwards be frozen, so to speak, by solidification of the medium enclosing the magnetic particles, so that the position and relative orientation or alignment of the magnetic particles relative to the surrounding medium can no longer be changed. The preferred uniaxial anisotropy ensures that the magnetization direction is maintained even if the external magnetic field is switched off or removed. To achieve the preferred perpendicular magnetization, the external magnetic field is applied substantially perpendicular to the layer of the liquid medium containing the magnetic particles. In this magnetic field, the magnetic particles are aligned such that the axis of easy magnetization (also called &#x201c;easy axis&#x201d; in the technical literature) is oriented perpendicular to the layer surface. The curing of the liquid medium (also referred to above as &#x201c;freezing&#x201d;) can be effected e.g. by UV radiation, provided that the medium enclosing the magnetic particles contains UV-curing substances. The curing of the liquid medium can alternatively be effected by supplying heat, which leads to the drying of the liquid medium. After the immobilization of the magnetic particles, the axis of easy magnetization (or &#x201c;easy axis&#x201d;) of the resulting magnetic layer extends perpendicular to the plane of the layer. Instead of UV curing, electron beam curing (EBC) can also be used.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0044">Of course, the resulting magnetic layer based on the method described above can be provided with any arbitrary magnetization direction by applying the external magnetic field, while the magnetic particles are still mobile, relative to the layer plane in the direction of the desired magnetization. After the curing of the liquid medium and the immobilization of the magnetic particles associated therewith, the axis of easy magnetization corresponds exactly to the direction in which the external magnetic field was applied during or before the &#x201c;freezing&#x201d;. In principle, the direction relative to the layer can be freely selected; a perpendicular magnetization or a magnetization in the layer plane are special cases here.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0045">According to one variant, as magnetic particles there can be employed needles which are obtainable by means of the glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique or the oblique angle deposition (OAD) technique. These are sub-variants of the physical vapor deposition (PVD). Normally, in PVD processes the angles at which the gas particles impinge on the substrate to be vapor-deposited are broadly distributed around a mean value of about 90&#xb0;, because in this way the highest possible proportion of condensation on the substrate is achieved. In the case of the GLAD or OAD technique, one chooses a narrow incidence angle distribution, the mean value of which sometimes deviates very significantly from the perpendicular incidence angle and may even extend approximately parallel to the substrate plane. It has been shown that in these configurations there often result special morphologies of the condensate. In a sense, forests are formed that consist of needle-shaped structures, the needle-shaped structures being arranged almost parallel, having high aspect ratios and being all at a certain angle to the substrate surface. If a ferromagnetic or a ferrimagnetic material is vaporized in this way, due to the shape anisotropy the magnetization direction will be parallel to the longest direction of extension of the needle structures. Thus, a magnetic film can be produced whose magnetization direction is at a fixed angle to the substrate plane. This angle can be influenced by the vapor deposition parameters and can e.g. also be almost perpendicular to the substrate plane. By detaching the obtained layer consisting of needles from the substrate and subsequently grinding or crushing it into individual needles there result needle-shaped magnetic particles with uniaxial anisotropy, which results from the stray field energy minimization (shape anisotropy).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0046">The magnetic layer obtained according to the manufacturing methods described above can be combined on one side with an optical functional layer to produce an optically variable magnetic layer construction in this way. Alternatively, the magnetic layer can be combined on both sides with respectively one optical functional layer to produce an optically variable magnetic layer construction in this way.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0047">A preferred layer construction is a symmetric layer construction with e.g. the layer sequence of absorbent layer-dielectric layer-reflective layer-magnetic layer-reflective layer-dielectric layer-absorbent layer. In this layer construction there is present on each side, with respect to the central magnetic layer, a color-tilting coating based on an absorber/dielectric/reflector thin-film system. The individual layers can e.g. be vapor-deposited in a vacuum or applied by so-called sputtering.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0048">A further preferred layer construction has the layer sequence absorbent layer-dielectric layer-reflective layer-dielectric layer-absorbent layer-magnetic layer. In this layer construction, the reflectivity or the reflectance of the layer construction is influenced on one side by the presence of the magnetic layer. This influence is low when the magnetic particles are sufficiently small, e.g. have a size of less than 500 nm, preferably less than 200 nm and particularly preferably less than 100 nm, and when the particles only occupy a small proportion of the layer volume and when the binding agent is substantially transparent.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0049">Instead of an interference coating or a color-tilting thin-film system, as an optical functional layer there can further be used color layers available by printing technology, preferably translucent color layers, and/or pure reflective layers or metallic layers.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0050">Instead of a symmetric layer construction, in which the color impression is independent of the viewing side, an asymmetric layer construction can also be used. Since according to the invention the magnetic moment is in particular perpendicular to the layer plane, the visibilities of the upper side and the lower side can be controlled in certain regions by means of external magnetic fields. In other words, platelet-shaped magnetic effect pigments can be utilized which have a fixed magnetic north side and south side but differ from each other with respect to the optical functional layer of these two sides. For example, optically variable magnetic effect pigments can be utilized which at the same time have different color-tilting effects on the upper side and on the lower side and whose magnetic moment is firmly defined relative to the upper side and lower side: north pole at the upper side with the first color-tilting effect and south pole at the lower side with the second color-tilting effect. If one prints these pigments on a transparent (value document) substrate and aligns them by an external magnetic field prior to the curing of the binding agent of the printing ink, from one side the viewer always sees the upper side of the pigments with the first color-tilting effect and from the other side the lower side of the pigments with the second color-tilting effect differing from the first color-tilting effect.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0051">Furthermore, the magnetic layer of the effect pigment according to the invention can be combined, e.g. on one side or on both sides, with (in each case) an optical functional layer, the optical functional layer having a metallic layer, in particular a reflective metallic layer, and a glazing or translucent color layer. By means of a metallic layer arranged between the magnetic layer and the color layer, appealing optical effects can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0052">Furthermore, the magnetic layer of the effect pigment according to the invention can be combined, e.g. on one side or on both sides, with (in each case) an optical functional layer, the optical functional layer having a dielectric layer, e.g. SiO<sub>2</sub>, and a metallic layer, in particular a reflective metallic layer, e.g. Al. By means of a combination of SiO<sub>2 </sub>and Al e.g. golden color tones can be achieved even without a further absorbent layer and without a further color layer.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0053">With reference to the manufacturing method for the magnetic layer described above, there is a risk that the binding agent of the magnetic layer (or the matrix) does not have an optically smooth surface after curing, so that the reflectivity of subsequent layers is impaired. This can be counteracted by not applying the further layers directly on the magnetic layer, but by first manufacturing them on another substrate, e.g. a foil such as a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foil. In a further step, a flexible adhesive layer can be applied onto the magnetic layer, thereby levelling its rough surface, before the further layers are laminated or applied onto the magnetic layer. In an optional step, the aforementioned &#x201c;another&#x201d; substrate can be removed from the obtained construction (so-called transfer lamination).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0054">Alternatively, the lack of an optically smooth surface on the magnetic layer can be remedied by applying a levelling, smoothing intermediate layer, e.g. a suitable intermediate lacquer.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0055">According to a preferred embodiment for obtaining a magnetic layer, the magnetic particles are mixed into a laminating lacquer and the two color-tilting layer systems are brought together with the obtained laminating lacquer. In this time phase, the particles are still mobile and can be aligned in an externally applied magnetic field. This is followed by the curing of the laminating lacquer, which leads to a permanent connection of the color-tilting layer systems and at the same time to an immobilization of the homogeneously oriented magnetic particles.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0056">With regard to the manufacturing of the pigments according to the invention, there are various possibilities. Common to all methods is that first a layer construction is produced above a carrier substrate, e.g. a carrier foil such as a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foil, the layer construction having at least the magnetic layer and an optical functional layer. Subsequently, the layer construction is detached from the carrier substrate and, where applicable, crushed, e.g. by means of grinding, until particles with an adequate size distribution are obtained. For this purpose, it is advantageous to arrange a further layer between the carrier substrate and the layer construction, which can be removed in a controlled or selective manner, e.g. by dissolving it in a suitable solvent. Afterwards, the effect pigments obtained can be mixed with a UV-curing binding agent to form a (screen) printing ink. The effect pigments are in particular areal optically-variable pigments and preferably have a magnetic moment oriented perpendicular to the effect pigment plane, corresponding to the perpendicular orientation of the individual magnetic particles located within the solid matrix of the magnetic layer. To obtain a preferential magnetic direction of an entire pigment, it is sufficient when the individual magnetic particles of this pigment are oriented on average along this direction. It is not necessary that the magnetic moments of all the magnetic particles point in exactly the same direction. In the step of applying the ink onto a printing stock such as a security paper or a security document substrate by printing technology, an external magnetic field is expediently applied and the ink is cured, e.g. by UV radiation or by the action of heat, so that the effect pigments become immobile.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0057">Further, the invention relates to a method for manufacturing a value document, comprising<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0058">printing the value document substrate with a first printing ink containing platelet-shaped magnetic effect pigments according to the invention, in a first region;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0059">aligning the platelet-shaped magnetic effect pigments in the first printing ink printed in the first region by means of an external magnetic field;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0060">curing the first printing ink printed in the first region.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0049" num="0061">Compared to prior art effect pigments with a magnetization extending in the plane of the effect pigment, the magnetic effect pigments according to the invention align themselves in an externally applied magnetic field such that the security feature resulting therefrom appears more brilliant and the light reflections look smoother because less light is scattered in deviating directions.

Such effect pigments <b>9</b> are commercially available under the trade name OVMI&#xae; from the company SICPA, have a platelet-shaped construction and are present in the form of a layer composite which includes two layers of optical effect layers, e.g. in each case a color-shifting layer system with absorber/dielectric/reflector construction, and a magnetic layer embedded in between. The optical effect layers each represent a color area. The side areas of the pigment <b>9</b> are more or less uncolored. The magnetization of the magnetic pigment <b>9</b> is referred to by the formula symbol &#x201c;m&#x201d;. If a magnetic field with a field strength having the formula symbol &#x201c;H&#x201d; is applied, the pigments <b>9</b> are aligned such that their magnetization is parallel to the field vector, if possible (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). As a consequence, the magnetic pigments <b>9</b> can rotate about axes parallel to their magnetization &#x201c;m&#x201d;. The use of such magnetic pigments <b>9</b>, e.g. when printing a value document, thus leads to a substantially uniform alignment of the pigments <b>9</b> in one direction, while the alignment of the pigments <b>9</b> in another direction is substantially randomly distributed. Thus, when viewing a value document obtained in this way, it is not always a color area of the pigment <b>9</b> that points upwards in the direction of the viewer. This leads to a widening of the light reflection and to a decreased brilliance and sharpness of the optically variable effect.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an example of a platelet-shaped magnetic effect pigment <b>8</b> according to the invention, whose magnetic moment &#x201c;m&#x201d; is aligned perpendicular to the platelet plane. If a magnetic field with a field strength having the formula symbol &#x201c;H&#x201d; is applied, the pigments <b>8</b> are aligned such that their magnetization is parallel to the field vector, if possible. Just as with the magnetic effect pigments <b>9</b> known in the prior art, a degree of freedom remains: the platelets can rotate about an axis parallel to their magnetic moment without changing their potential energy in the magnetic field. In contrast to the magnetic pigments <b>9</b> known in the prior art, however, the rotation in the case of the pigments <b>8</b> according to the invention has no significant influence on the reflecting properties of the pigments <b>8</b>. Consequently, the reflecting properties can be better controlled. In the case of the magnetic pigments <b>9</b> known in the prior art, the viewer sees a plurality of small pigments, each with a substantially random brightness. The security elements obtained in this way consequently have a granular or a, so to speak, &#x201c;noisy&#x201d; optical texture. In comparison, homogeneously glossy areas can be produced by means of the pigments <b>8</b> according to the invention.

In the present example, the two optical functional layers are identical and are each formed by an interference layer construction with a reflective layer (e.g. an Al layer), a dielectric layer (e.g. an SiO<sub>2 </sub>layer) and an absorbent layer (e.g. a Cr layer).

Electron beam curing can be particularly interesting in the field of highly pigmented layers or when using the magnet-bearing layer as a laminating adhesive, because the UV transparency of the construction is not important here. The magnetic alignment has such a large force that the alignment can also take place in a matrix that is so highly viscous that the alignment of the individual magnetic particle no longer changes significantly without active external action. Therefore, the matrix could even be a 100% system of laminating adhesive.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0092">When employing a cationic laminating adhesive system, the exposure could be effected first, followed by bringing together the substrates and immediately afterwards the alignment of the magnetic particles.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0093">With radically curing systems, the alignment of the particles can be effected either shortly before curing or during curing, because here the cross-linking reaction normally is effected so quickly that later an alignment is no longer possible. Radically curing systems can be cross-linked e.g. by UV or EBC.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0094">UV curing normally requires a suitable photoinitiator, which should advantageously be chosen such that the UV radiation that can sufficiently penetrate the layer can also excite the photoinitiator. There exists a large number of suitable photoinitiators. Typical type I initiators are e.g. the BAPO (bisacylphosphine oxide) types, e.g. Omnirad 819, the aminoketones (e.g. Omnirad 369, 379). Typical type II initiators are ITX and the benzophenones. These normally still require co-initiators, such as tertiary amines.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0095">Radically curing systems continue to consist mostly of acrylic acid esters (on the one hand the prepolymers, on the other the reactive thinners). Manufacturers, such as the companies Allnex, Arkema, BASF, Miwon, offer numerous representatives of both product groups. To increase the reactivity, e.g. thiols can still be used.
