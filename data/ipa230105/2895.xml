Embodiments described here are only used to illustrate and explain the present disclosure, and are not intended to limit the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In many semiconductor devices, metal tungsten deposition is mainly deposited by a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. With the CVD method, metal filling of a via and a trench can substantially be realized. A critical dimension (CD) of an early semiconductor device is relatively large, and a depth-to-width ratio of the hole or trench is also relatively small. Thus, filling such a structure is not a very serious challenge for a CVD process. With advancements in the semiconductor technology, the CD of the semiconductor device tends to be miniaturized. For a tungsten plug process, the via and trench with a small opening and a large depth-to-width ratio gradually become a difficulty in the process. The metal tungsten filled in the via and trench is required that no pore or hole is left if possible, the impurities are as few as possible, and the resistivity is relatively low.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">To prevent the tungsten from being deposited on an edge of a substrate during the process, that is, an edge exclusion region is left at the edge of the substrate, an edge purge gas flow needs to be added at the edge of the substrate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing the edge purge gas flow at the edge of the substrate in the chemical vapor deposition process in the existing technology. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, when the process is performed, an upper block ring <b>6</b> and a lower block ring <b>7</b> are arranged at an edge of a base <b>1</b>. An inner edge part of the upper block ring <b>6</b> has a certain shielding on an edge of a substrate <b>2</b>, and a gap is reserved between the upper block ring <b>6</b> and the substrate <b>2</b> in a vertical direction. Thus, a purge gas channel is formed among the upper block ring <b>6</b>, the lower block ring <b>7</b>, the base <b>1</b>, and the substrate <b>2</b>. When the edge purge gas flow is blown out from the gas channel (as indicated by a dotted arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), a reactant distributed on a region of a surface of the substrate <b>2</b>, which is shielded by the upper block ring <b>6</b>, is blown away. Thus, a thin film cannot be deposited in the region. Therefore, forming a desired edge removal region is formed at the edge of the surface of the substrate <b>2</b>. The remaining gas after the reaction enters an exhaust gas port through an exhaust gas channel between the upper surface of the upper block ring <b>6</b> and the top of the reaction chamber to be discharged out from the reaction chamber.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">However, to place the upper block ring <b>6</b> above the surface of the substrate <b>2</b> to perform shielding, an upper surface of the lower block ring <b>7</b> is generally positioned higher than the upper surface of the substrate <b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a distance between the upper block ring <b>6</b> and the chamber upper cover <b>51</b> of the reaction chamber is relatively small and is generally 10% to 50% narrower than a distance between the substrate <b>2</b> and the chamber upper cover <b>51</b> of the reaction chamber. Thus, the exhaust gas channel between the upper surface of the upper block ring <b>6</b> and a chamber upper cover <b>51</b> of the reaction chamber is relatively narrow. Since a flow rate of the process gas flowing through the exhaust gas channel is relatively fast, stay time of the process gas at the substrate <b>2</b> is relatively short, a thickness of a film formed at the edge of the substrate <b>2</b> is relatively narrow, and uniformity of the over film thickness on the substrate <b>2</b> is poor.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic curve diagram showing a thickness of a thin film on the substrate in the existing technology. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, when the upper block ring <b>6</b> is provided, a dashed line represents a thickness distribution curve of a thin film deposited on different regions of the substrate <b>2</b>. When the upper block ring <b>6</b> is not provided, a solid line represents a thickness distribution curve of a thin film deposited on different regions of the substrate <b>2</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, when the upper block ring <b>6</b> is not provided, the thickness distribution curve of the thin film is relatively flat, that is, the thickness of the thin film on the entire surface of the substrate <b>2</b> is relatively uniform. When the upper block ring <b>6</b> is provided, the thickness of the thin film shows a tendency of a sharp decrease in a region greater than a radius of 135 mm on the substrate <b>2</b>. That is, the thickness uniformity of the thin film on the entire surface of the substrate <b>2</b> is poor.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In order to solve the above problem, embodiments of the present disclosure provide a reaction chamber. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram showing a part of the reaction chamber according to embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a top view of a second block ring according to embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the reaction chamber includes a chamber body <b>5</b> and a base <b>1</b> arranged in the chamber body <b>5</b>. The base <b>1</b> includes a carrier member <b>11</b> for carrying the substrate <b>2</b> and an edge member <b>12</b> arranged around the carrier member <b>11</b>. A height of an upper surface of the carrier member <b>11</b> is greater than a height of an upper surface of the edge member <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The reaction chamber further includes a first block ring <b>3</b> and a second block ring <b>4</b>. The first block ring <b>3</b> is arranged on the upper surface of the edge member <b>12</b>. The first block ring <b>3</b> is arranged around the carrier member <b>11</b>. The upper surface of the carrier member <b>11</b> is higher than the upper surface of the first block ring <b>3</b>. The second block ring <b>4</b> is arranged on the upper surface of the first block ring <b>3</b> (i.e., a side facing away from the edge member <b>12</b>). The second block ring <b>4</b> includes a body member <b>41</b> and a shield member <b>42</b> arranged on a side of the body member <b>41</b> away from the first block ring <b>3</b>. The shield member <b>42</b> protrudes from a surface of the second block ring <b>4</b> opposite to the carrier member <b>11</b>. The shield member <b>42</b> is configured to shield an edge of the upper surface of the substrate <b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a dotted line is an edge contour line of the substrate <b>2</b>, and a region between the edge contour line and an inner peripheral edge line of the shield member <b>42</b> is a region where the substrate <b>2</b> is shielded by the shield member <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Since the upper surface of the carrier member <b>11</b> is higher than the upper surface of the first block ring <b>3</b>, a lower surface of the second block ring <b>4</b> is also lower than a lower surface of the carrier member <b>11</b>. Compared with a solution of the entire lower surface of the upper block ring <b>6</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> being higher than the upper surface of the carrier member <b>11</b>, the overall height of the second block ring <b>4</b> is reduced in the embodiments of the present disclosure. Thus, a dimension of the gas channel between the second block ring <b>4</b> and the top of the reaction chamber may be increased to further reduce the flow rate of the process gas flowing through the edge of the substrate. Therefore, the flow rate of the process gas in the edge region above the surface of the substrate may be consistent with the flow rates of the process gas in other regions, thereby improving the overall film thickness uniformity of the substrate.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the embodiment, the shield member <b>42</b> may be arranged on a side of the body member <b>41</b> close to the carrier member <b>11</b>, and a thickness of the shield member <b>42</b> may be set as small as possible. Thus, the overall thickness of the second block ring <b>4</b> may be reduced as much as possible.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a purge gas channel is formed between an inner peripheral surface of the first block ring <b>3</b>, an inner peripheral surface of the body member <b>41</b> of the second block ring <b>4</b>, an upper surface of the edge member <b>12</b>, an outer peripheral surface of the carrier member <b>11</b>, a bottom surface of a protrusion of the shield member <b>42</b>, and an outer peripheral surface and the edge of the upper surface of the substrate <b>2</b>. The purge gas may be outputted to the edge of the upper surface of the substrate <b>2</b> after passing through the purge gas channel to blow the process gas at the edge away and prevent the process gas from depositing at the edge. Thus, an edge exclusion region may be formed at the edge of the upper surface of the substrate <b>2</b>. A channel that is configured to transfer the purge gas may be arranged in the edge member <b>12</b>. A gas outlet of the channel may be located on the upper surface of the edge member <b>12</b>, and between the inner peripheral surface of the first block ring <b>3</b> and the outer peripheral surface of the carrier member <b>11</b> and may be configured to transfer the purge gas into the purge gas channel.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the base <b>1</b> may be connected to the drive mechanism. The drive mechanism may be configured to drive the base <b>1</b> to ascend and descend and/or rotate. The second block ring <b>4</b> may be fixed in a predetermined position in the reaction chamber. When the base <b>1</b> is descended, the first block ring <b>3</b> may descend with the base <b>1</b>, and the second block ring <b>4</b> may remain in the original position. At this time, the first block ring <b>3</b> and the second block ring <b>4</b> may be separated from each other. Thus, the substrate <b>2</b> may be placed on the upper surface of the base <b>1</b> without being blocked by the second block ring <b>4</b>. When the base <b>1</b> is ascended to a process position, the first block ring <b>3</b> may ascend with the base <b>1</b> until the base <b>1</b> is in contact with the second block ring <b>4</b>. At this time, the shield member <b>42</b> of the second block ring <b>4</b> may shield the edge of the upper surface of the substrate <b>2</b> to perform the deposition process.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, a first predetermined vertical distance is provided between the lower surface of the shield member <b>42</b> and the upper surface of the carrier member <b>11</b>. The lower surface of the shield member <b>42</b> may be a surface of the shield member <b>42</b> facing the body member <b>41</b>. The upper surface of the carrier member <b>11</b> may be a carrier surface that is configured to carry the substrate <b>2</b>. The first predetermined vertical distance may be greater than the thickness of the substrate <b>2</b> that is to be carried. Thus, when the base <b>1</b> is in the process position, and the second block ring <b>4</b> is in contact with the first block ring <b>3</b>, a gap may be reserved between the lower surface of the protrusion of the shield member <b>42</b> and the upper surface of the substrate <b>2</b> to facilitate the purge gas to flow out from the gap.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, a second predetermined vertical distance may be provided between the upper surface of the body member <b>41</b> and the upper surface of the carrier member <b>11</b>, and the second predetermined vertical distance may be less than or equal to the first predetermined vertical distance. The upper surface of the body member <b>41</b> may be a surface away from the surface of the first block ring <b>3</b>. Since the second predetermined vertical distance is less than or equal to the first predetermined vertical distance, the upper surface of the body member <b>41</b> may be not higher than the lower surface of the shield member <b>42</b>.
