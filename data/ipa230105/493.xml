site. The packaging assembly protects the buttress assembly from damage due to physical contact as well as exposure to adverse environmental factors like excess moisture, etc. In one example the packaging assembly includes a dual tray design with an inner tray that holds the applicator. The combined inner tray and applicator are hermetically sealed within a foil assembly or foil pouch. The foil pouch with the inner tray and applicator within is placed within the outer tray to protect the foil from damage.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="66.38mm" wi="135.55mm" file="US20230000494A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="215.73mm" wi="142.32mm" file="US20230000494A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="172.30mm" wi="139.78mm" file="US20230000494A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="207.09mm" wi="139.78mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230000494A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="236.98mm" wi="155.28mm" file="US20230000494A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="228.35mm" wi="155.28mm" file="US20230000494A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="218.61mm" wi="158.16mm" file="US20230000494A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="236.39mm" wi="155.11mm" file="US20230000494A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="237.07mm" wi="157.48mm" file="US20230000494A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="184.07mm" wi="151.30mm" file="US20230000494A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="188.04mm" wi="141.14mm" file="US20230000494A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">In some settings, endoscopic surgical instruments may be preferred over traditional open surgical devices since a smaller incision may reduce the post-operative recovery time and complications. Consequently, some endoscopic surgical instruments may be suitable for placement of a distal end effector at a desired surgical site through the cannula of a trocar. These distal end effectors may engage tissue in a number of ways to achieve a diagnostic or therapeutic effect (e.g., endocutter, grasper, cutter, stapler, clip applier, access device, drug/gene therapy delivery device, and energy delivery device using ultrasonic vibration, RF, laser, etc.). Endoscopic surgical instruments may include a shaft between the end effector and a handle portion, which is manipulated by the clinician. Such a shaft may enable insertion to a desired depth and rotation about the longitudinal axis of the shaft, thereby facilitating positioning of the end effector within the patient. Positioning of an end effector may be further facilitated through inclusion of one or more articulation joints or features, enabling the end effector to be selectively articulated or otherwise deflected relative to the longitudinal axis of the shaft.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Examples of endoscopic surgical instruments include surgical staplers. Some such staplers are operable to clamp down on layers of tissue, cut through the clamped layers of tissue, and drive staples through the layers of tissue to substantially seal the severed layers of tissue together near the severed ends of the tissue layers.

By way of example only, a surgical stapler may be inserted through a thoracotomy, and thereby between a patient's ribs, to reach one or more organs in a thoracic surgical procedure that does not use a trocar as a conduit for the stapler. Such procedures may include the use of the stapler to sever and close a vessel leading to a lung. For instance, the vessels leading to an organ may be severed and closed by a stapler before removal of the organ from the thoracic cavity. Of course, surgical staplers may be used in various other settings and procedures.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Examples of surgical staplers that may be particularly suited for use through a thoracotomy are disclosed in U.S. Pat.

Such a buttress may prevent the applied staples from pulling through tissue and may otherwise reduce a risk of tissue tearing at or near the site of applied staples. When using a buttress material to reinforce a cut and stapled tissue site, a buttress applicator may be used to load one or more buttresses onto the end effector for subsequent deployment at the cut and stapled tissue site. To preserve the integrity of the buttresses prior to loading and deployment of buttresses at a tissue site, various packaging is used for the buttresses and/or applicators containing the buttresses.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">While various kinds of surgical stapling instruments and associated components have been made and used, it is believed that no one prior to the inventor(s) has

Accordingly, the drawings and descriptions should be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">I. Exemplary Packaging Assembly for Buttress Applicator</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As mentioned above, it can be beneficial to apply a buttress to a cut and stapled surgical site as a reinforcement. In doing so, the buttress must be loaded onto an end effector of a surgical stapler, and then applied at the site releasing from the end effector in the process. In use the buttress can be configured to be bioabsorbable so over time it is completely absorbed by the body of the patient. To achieve the desired loading and release properties of the buttress, as well as desired reinforcement properties when in use, the buttress material itself, as well as materials applied to the buttress such as adhesive, can be susceptible to degradation when exposed prematurely to environmental factors such as moisture, etc. Using a packaging assembly as shown and described herein can preserve the integrity of the buttress prior to its use and application.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A. Exemplary Outer Tray and Foil Assembly</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref> illustrate an exemplary packaging assembly (<b>10</b>) for a buttress applicator of a surgical stapler. Packaging assembly comprises a foil assembly or foil pouch (<b>400</b>) and an outer tray (<b>500</b>). Foil pouch (<b>400</b>) comprises a top layer (<b>402</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and a bottom layer (<b>404</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref>. Outer tray (<b>500</b>) is positioned such that foil pouch (<b>400</b>) sits within outer tray (<b>500</b>). In this respect, outer tray (<b>500</b>) comprises a cavity or space (<b>502</b>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, configured to received foil pouch (<b>400</b>). At least a portion of outer tray (<b>500</b>) has a shape that matches or closely matches a shape of an underside (<b>406</b>) of foil pouch (<b>400</b>) as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>. In this manner in the present example, a surface (<b>504</b>) of cavity (<b>502</b>) is immediately adjacent to underside (<b>406</b>) of foil pouch (<b>400</b>). With this configuration, outer tray (<b>500</b>) is configured to protect bottom layer (<b>404</b>) of foil pouch (<b>400</b>) from damage by fitting closely against bottom layer (<b>404</b>).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, outer tray (<b>500</b>) is configured for stacking with outer tray (<b>500</b>) comprising a smooth flat underside (<b>506</b>). The smooth and flat nature of underside (<b>506</b>) allows for stacking multiple packaging assemblies (<b>10</b>) on top of one another, without underside surface (<b>506</b>) damaging top layer (<b>402</b>) of an adjacent foil pouch (<b>400</b>). The size and shape of underside (<b>506</b>) is configured such that a flap (<b>602</b>) of an inner tray (<b>600</b>)&#x2014;as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>&#x2014;of one packaging assembly (<b>10</b>) can provide structural support to bear the weight of another packaging assembly (<b>10</b>) stacked thereupon. In this manner, top layer (<b>402</b>) of foil pouch (<b>400</b>) is not required in all cases to bear the weight or load of whatever packaging assemblies (<b>10</b>) are stacked above, which preserves the integrity of foil pouch (<b>400</b>) by preventing creasing or puncture of top layers (<b>402</b>) of stacked packaging assemblies (<b>10</b>).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, outer tray (<b>500</b>) also comprises recess (<b>508</b>) on a bottom side. Recess (<b>508</b>) is configured as an area that can be easily accessed and grasped by a user to pick up a select packaging assembly (<b>10</b>) either separately or from a group of stacked packaging assemblies (<b>10</b>). With this configuration, opposite recess (<b>508</b>) on a top side of outer tray (<b>500</b>) is a flat surface (<b>510</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, which is configured as a complementary area that can be easily accessed and grasped by a user to pick up a select packaging assembly (<b>10</b>) either separately or from a group of stacked packaging assemblies (<b>10</b>). In this manner, outer tray (<b>500</b>) is configured with an accessible area for a user to grasp, hold, or pick up packaging assembly (<b>10</b>) easily and safely without risk of contacting buttress and/or buttress applicator.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">B. Exemplary Foil Assembly and Inner Tray</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a portion of packaging assembly (<b>10</b>), where outer tray (<b>500</b>) has been set aside. Furthermore, foil pouch (<b>400</b>) is shown as partially opened, with top layer (<b>402</b>) peeled back and away from bottom layer (<b>404</b>). As shown, foil pouch (<b>400</b>) comprises an interior (<b>408</b>) between top and bottom layers (<b>402</b>, <b>404</b>). Furthermore, interior (<b>408</b>) is configured to receive, retain, or hold inner tray (<b>600</b>), which receives, retains, or holds a buttress applicator (<b>300</b>). Prior to top layer (<b>402</b>) and bottom layer (<b>404</b>) being separated, top layer (<b>402</b>) and bottom layer (<b>404</b>) are connectable to seal inner tray (<b>600</b>) with buttress applicator (<b>300</b>) within foil pouch (<b>400</b>). In the present example, top and bottom layers (<b>402</b>, <b>404</b>) seal together to form a hermetic seal. In this way, the seal is airtight such that moisture outside foil pouch (<b>400</b>) cannot enter and thereby damage or degrade the buttress assemblies (<b>316</b>, <b>318</b>) of buttress applicator (<b>300</b>). As noted and shown, the hermetic seal between top layer (<b>402</b>) and bottom layer (<b>404</b>) is selective and not permanent such that a user can separate top and bottom layers (<b>402</b>, <b>404</b>) to retrieve buttress applicator (<b>300</b>). In some examples, foil pouch (<b>400</b>) is sealed under dry nitrogen to provide interior (<b>408</b>) with an extremely low moisture and oxygen environment.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">With foil pouch (<b>400</b>) sealed and surrounding inner tray (<b>600</b>), top layer (<b>402</b>) of foil pouch (<b>400</b>) and bottom layer (<b>404</b>) of foil pouch (<b>400</b>) are configured to closely follow the contour of inner tray (<b>600</b>). This close fit, which can be seen in the cross-section views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, promotes protection of foil pouch (<b>400</b>) from damage when and if being contacted, as inner tray (<b>600</b>) provides support to top and bottom layers (<b>402</b>, <b>404</b>) of foil pouch (<b>600</b>) from the inside of foil pouch (<b>400</b>) outward. By way of example only, if too much space is provided between foil pouch (<b>400</b>) and inner tray (<b>600</b>) when inner tray (<b>600</b>) is sealed within foil pouch (<b>400</b>), then top and/or bottom layers (<b>402</b>, <b>404</b>) of foil pouch (<b>400</b>) are more susceptible to damage in the form of creases, cuts, and/or punctures.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">With the configuration described above, packaging assembly (<b>10</b>) is configured with two trays: inner tray (<b>600</b>) and outer tray (<b>500</b>). Moreover, inner tray (<b>600</b>) and outer tray (<b>500</b>) are separable from one another. In the present example, foil pouch (<b>400</b>) separates inner tray (<b>600</b>) from outer tray (<b>500</b>), and more specifically, bottom layer (<b>404</b>) of foil pouch (<b>400</b>) separates inner tray (<b>600</b>) from outer tray (<b>500</b>). Foil pouch (<b>400</b>) is configured as an impermeable material such that water and air cannot pass through layers (<b>402</b>, <b>404</b>) of foil pouch (<b>400</b>). Thus, in one version packaging assembly (<b>10</b>) comprises outer tray (<b>500</b>) and inner tray (<b>600</b>) configured to selectively retain buttress applicator (<b>300</b>), where there is an impermeable material positionable between outer tray (<b>500</b>) and inner tray (<b>600</b>). Furthermore, the impermeable material surrounds buttress applicator (<b>300</b>) retained by inner tray (<b>600</b>) forming a hermetic seal around inner tray (<b>600</b>) and buttress applicator (<b>300</b>). Further yet, with the above-described configuration, outer tray (<b>500</b>) is configured to protect the impermeable material from damage. While the present example shows packaging assembly (<b>10</b>) with two trays (<b>600</b>, <b>500</b>) separable by impermeable bottom foil layer (<b>404</b>), in other versions, packaging assembly (<b>10</b>) can be configured with greater or fewer trays and separable by other materials as will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">While examples of packaging assembly (<b>10</b>) herein describe pouch (<b>400</b>) as foil pouch (<b>400</b>), it should be understood that pouch (<b>400</b>) is not limited to being constructed of foil. In other examples, pouch (<b>400</b>) is constructed of other suitable materials that can provide a hermetic seal. Such other suitable materials can include impermeable films such as films made of various plastics. In view of the teachings herein, other materials for use in constructing pouch (<b>400</b>) of packaging assembly (<b>10</b>) will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">C. Exemplary Inner Tray and Buttress Applicator</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>11</b></figref> illustrate inner tray (<b>600</b>), including buttress applicator (<b>300</b>). In some instances buttress applicator (<b>300</b>) is referred to herein as merely applicator (<b>300</b>). It should be understood that these terms are used and understood herein to be interchangeable. As illustrated, inner tray (<b>600</b>) comprises a base (<b>606</b>), flap (<b>602</b>), and a living hinge (<b>608</b>) connecting flap (<b>602</b>) with base (<b>606</b>). Base (<b>606</b>) of inner tray (<b>600</b>) is configured to selectively retain applicator (<b>300</b>). Flap (<b>602</b>) is rotatable from a closed position as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, to an open position as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>. In the closed position, flap (<b>602</b>) at least partially covers applicator (<b>300</b>) when applicator (<b>300</b>) is retained within base (<b>606</b>). In the open position, flap (<b>602</b>) reveals applicator (<b>300</b>) such that it may be removed from inner tray (<b>600</b>).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Inner tray (<b>600</b>) includes fastening features (<b>609</b>) that are configured to selectively engage so that flap (<b>602</b>) connects with base (<b>606</b>) as mentioned above. In the present example, one fastening feature (<b>609</b>) comprises fastening members (<b>610</b>, <b>612</b>), with one fastening member (<b>610</b>) located on an underside (<b>614</b>) of flap (<b>602</b>), and the other fastening member (<b>612</b>) located on a ridge (<b>618</b>) within base (<b>606</b>). Fastening members (<b>610</b>) engage with fastening members (<b>612</b>) when flap (<b>602</b>) is in the closed position. While the illustrated version of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>11</b></figref> shows a pair of fastening features (<b>609</b>), in other versions greater or fewer fastening features (<b>609</b>)&#x2014;and their associated fastening members (<b>610</b>, <b>612</b>)&#x2014;may be used to achieve selective closure of flap (<b>602</b>) with body (<b>606</b>). By way of example only, and not limitation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref> illustrate another exemplary inner tray (<b>700</b>). Inner tray (<b>700</b>) is the same as inner tray (<b>600</b>) with the exception that inner tray (<b>700</b>) comprises two pair, or four total, fastening features (<b>709</b>), each with fastening members (<b>710</b>) that are configured to selectively engage with fastening members (<b>712</b>).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, in some versions, inner tray (<b>600</b>) is configured such that applicator (<b>300</b>) only sits within base (<b>606</b>) and with flap (<b>602</b>) closable when applicator (<b>300</b>) is oriented or positioned in a certain manner. For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, inner tray (<b>600</b>) presents a distal end (<b>360</b>) of applicator (<b>300</b>) for a user to grasp. Proximal end (<b>362</b>) of applicator (<b>300</b>) is covered by flap (<b>602</b>) when flap (<b>602</b>) is closed. Flap (<b>602</b>) is configured with guide features (<b>616</b>) along its underside (<b>614</b>), where guide features (<b>616</b>) are configured to locate within a space created by an open end (<b>301</b>) of applicator (<b>300</b>). Because applicator (<b>300</b>) is a closed structure along its distal end (<b>360</b>), if applicator (<b>300</b>) is positioned within base (<b>606</b>) with its proximal end (<b>362</b>) presenting towards a user for grasping&#x2014;opposite of what is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>&#x2014;then guide features (<b>616</b>) will interfere with the closed distal end (<b>360</b>) of applicator (<b>300</b>) such that flap (<b>602</b>) cannot close fully with fastening members (<b>610</b>) engaging fastening members (<b>612</b>).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this configuration, a poka-yoke relationship or configuration exists among inner tray (<b>600</b>) and applicator (<b>300</b>) to ensure applicator (<b>300</b>) is oriented with its distal end (<b>360</b>) visible and its proximal end (<b>362</b>) covered by flap (<b>602</b>) when flap (<b>602</b>) is closed. This orientation of applicator (<b>300</b>) relative to inner tray (<b>600</b>) provides that flap (<b>602</b>) shields buttress assemblies (<b>316</b>, <b>318</b>) of applicator (<b>300</b>) so that buttress assemblies (<b>316</b>, <b>318</b>) are inaccessible. In this manner, flap (<b>602</b>) protects buttress assemblies (<b>316</b>, <b>318</b>) from contact when applicator (<b>300</b>) is positioned within inner tray (<b>600</b>) with flap (<b>602</b>) closed. Additionally, base (<b>606</b>) of inner tray (<b>600</b>) further includes ridges (<b>618</b>) and stops (<b>628</b>, <b>630</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref> that help minimize applicator (<b>300</b>) shifting or moving when seated within base (<b>606</b>) of tray (<b>600</b>). For instance, ridges (<b>618</b>) help minimize lateral movement of applicator (<b>300</b>), while stops (<b>628</b>, <b>630</b>) help minimize longitudinal movement of applicator (<b>300</b>).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, inner tray (<b>600</b>) and applicator (<b>300</b>) are configured in the present example such that flap (<b>602</b>) can be disengaged from base (<b>606</b>) by lifting distal end (<b>360</b>) of applicator (<b>300</b>). In this way, housing portion (<b>302</b>) of applicator (<b>300</b>) pushes on underside (<b>614</b>) of flap (<b>602</b>) to release the engagement between fastening members (<b>610</b>, <b>612</b>). This opening technique helps prevent or shield buttress assemblies (<b>316</b>, <b>318</b>) from contact. Still other ways to open flap (<b>602</b>) exist. For example, flap (<b>602</b>) comprises peninsula portion (<b>620</b>). Portion (<b>620</b>) may be grasped by a user and lifted to open flap (<b>602</b>) for removal of applicator (<b>300</b>). Peninsula portion (<b>620</b>) further allows for a center region of applicator (<b>300</b>) having buttress assemblies (<b>316</b>, <b>318</b>) to be covered when flap (<b>602</b>) is closed, while exposing distal end (<b>360</b>) of applicator (<b>300</b>) for visualization or grasping by a user. Still further, flap (<b>602</b>) presents a leading edge (<b>622</b>), which can be contacted by a user and lifted to move flap (<b>602</b>) from its closed position to its open position. In view of the teachings herein, other ways to facilitate opening flap (<b>602</b>) to remove applicator (<b>300</b>) from inner tray (<b>600</b>) while protecting buttress assemblies (<b>316</b>, <b>318</b>) from contact and other environmental exposure will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">D. Exemplary Inner Tray and Desiccant Material</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>12</b></figref>, inner tray (<b>600</b>) is configured to selectively retain a desiccant material (<b>604</b>). Desiccant material (<b>604</b>) is configured to preferentially absorb any moisture within interior (<b>408</b>) of foil pouch (<b>400</b>). In this way, desiccant material (<b>604</b>) may be an overdried material that is combined with inner tray (<b>600</b>) and then sealed within foil pouch (<b>400</b>). Any moisture that exists within foil pouch (<b>400</b>) will be first absorbed by the overdried desiccant material (<b>604</b>) before being absorbed by buttress assemblies (<b>316</b>, <b>318</b>) of buttress applicator (<b>300</b>). In the present example, desiccant material (<b>604</b>) comprises a piece of paperboard, but in other versions desiccant material (<b>604</b>) can be made of other materials such as cotton, silica, and other materials that will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of the teachings herein.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, inner tray (<b>600</b>) comprises an area (<b>624</b>) on an outer surface (<b>626</b>) of flap (<b>602</b>) that is configured to selectively retain desiccant material (<b>604</b>). In this configuration, inner tray (<b>600</b>) selective retains desiccant material (<b>604</b>) in a way where desiccant material (<b>604</b>) does not contact applicator (<b>300</b>). In one example, area (<b>624</b>) of flap (<b>602</b>) comprises tabs. In the present example, inner tray (<b>600</b>) comprises a molded plastic and accordingly area (<b>624</b>) and tabs are molded features of inner tray (<b>600</b>). Desiccant material (<b>604</b>) and tabs are configured such that desiccant material (<b>604</b>) can be slid along area (<b>624</b>) with tabs sliding above desiccant material (<b>604</b>) to selectively retain desiccant material (<b>604</b>) adjacent to area (<b>624</b>) of flap (<b>602</b>). Similarly, desiccant material (<b>604</b>) can be removed from inner tray (<b>600</b>) by sliding desiccant material (<b>604</b>) distally away from area (<b>624</b>) such that tabs no longer impinge on and retain desiccant material (<b>604</b>) with inner tray (<b>600</b>). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, in another example, area (<b>624</b>) of flap (<b>602</b>) comprises openings (<b>632</b>). In the present example, inner tray (<b>600</b>) comprises a molded plastic and accordingly area (<b>624</b>) and openings (<b>632</b>) are molded features of inner tray (<b>600</b>). Furthermore, desiccant material (<b>604</b>) comprises tabs (<b>633</b>), which are engagement features that can be inserted into and received by openings (<b>632</b>) such that desiccant material (<b>604</b>) can be selectively attached with area (<b>624</b>). In the present example, tabs (<b>633</b>) are resiliently biased outward from a longitudinal centerline of desiccant material (<b>604</b>). When inserted within openings (<b>632</b>) tabs (<b>633</b>) deflect inward and the resilient bias of tabs (<b>633</b>) provide a selective interference fitting between tabs (<b>633</b>) and openings (<b>632</b>) to selectively retain desiccant material (<b>604</b>) with area (<b>624</b>) of flap (<b>602</b>). Desiccant material (<b>604</b>) can be removed from inner tray (<b>600</b>) by pulling desiccant material (<b>604</b>) upward away from area (<b>624</b>) of flap (<b>602</b>) to overcome the interference fitting such that tabs (<b>633</b>) disengage from openings (<b>632</b>). In view of the teachings herein, other ways to attach and remove desiccant material (<b>604</b>) with inner tray (<b>600</b>) will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">II.

In the present example buttress assemblies (<b>316</b>, <b>318</b>) are the same with each comprising an adhesive (<b>320</b>) located on a buttress (<b>322</b>) as will be described in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Buttress applicator (<b>300</b>) can be used with end effector (<b>40</b>) in the same manner as described below with respect to buttress applicator (<b>200</b>). For instance, buttress assemblies (<b>316</b>, <b>318</b>) are loaded to end effector (<b>40</b>) in the same manner as described below where end effector (<b>40</b>) is moved to a closed or clamped position once anvil (<b>60</b>) and lower jaw (<b>50</b>) are positioned over central portion (<b>310</b>) of frame (<b>306</b>). More specifically, the clamping action of end effector (<b>40</b>) when over buttress assemblies (<b>316</b>, <b>318</b>) and compression pad (<b>308</b>) causes anvil (<b>60</b>) and staple cartridge (<b>70</b>) of lower jaw (<b>50</b>) to contact retention features (<b>324</b>) on left clamp arms (<b>311</b>) and retention features (<b>325</b>) on right clamp arms (<b>313</b>). This contact drives clamp arms (<b>311</b>, <b>313</b>) laterally away from buttress assemblies (<b>316</b>, <b>318</b>) thereby disengaging retention features (<b>324</b>, <b>325</b>) from buttress assemblies (<b>316</b>, <b>318</b>). With retention features (<b>324</b>, <b>325</b>) disengaged, depending on the clamping orientation used with end effector (<b>40</b>), adhesive (<b>320</b>) of buttress assembly (<b>316</b>) contacts either underside (<b>65</b>) of anvil (<b>60</b>) or deck (<b>73</b>) of staple cartridge (<b>70</b>), while adhesive (<b>320</b>) of buttress assembly (<b>318</b>) contacts the other of underside (<b>65</b>) of anvil (<b>60</b>) or deck (<b>73</b>) of staple cartridge (<b>70</b>). This causes buttress assemblies (<b>316</b>, <b>318</b>) to attach with end effector (<b>40</b>) and remain with end effector (<b>40</b>) as end effector is opened and moved away from buttress applicator (<b>300</b>). From this point, buttress assemblies (<b>316</b>, <b>318</b>) may be applied to a cut and stapled tissue site.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">III. Exemplary Buttress Loading and Application</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>18</b></figref> illustrate an exemplary end effector (<b>40</b>) configured to apply a buttress to a tissue site where a cutting and stapling operation is performed. End effector (<b>40</b>) is connected with a shaft assembly (<b>30</b>). End effector (<b>40</b>) comprises an anvil (<b>60</b>), a lower jaw (<b>50</b>), and a staple cartridge (<b>70</b>) received by lower jaw (<b>50</b>).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>18</b></figref> also illustrate an exemplary buttress applicator (<b>200</b>). Buttress applicator (<b>200</b>) is configured to selectively retain buttress assemblies (<b>100</b>). In the present example, buttress assembly (<b>100</b>) is selectively retained on a top side of applicator (<b>200</b>) and another buttress assembly (<b>100</b>) is selectively retained on a bottom side of applicator (<b>200</b>). In some other versions, applicator (<b>200</b>) can be configured such that only one buttress assembly (<b>100</b>) is selectively retained by buttress applicator (<b>200</b>).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">To use buttress applicator (<b>200</b>) to load end effector (<b>40</b>) with buttress assemblies (<b>100</b>), the operator would first position applicator (<b>200</b>) and end effector (<b>40</b>) such that end effector (<b>40</b>) is aligned with an open end (<b>202</b>) of applicator (<b>200</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. The operator would then advance end effector (<b>40</b>) distally (and/or retract applicator (<b>200</b>) proximally) to position buttress assemblies (<b>100</b>) between anvil (<b>60</b>) and staple cartridge (<b>70</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. In order to load buttress assemblies (<b>100</b>) on end effector (<b>40</b>), the operator may simply close end effector (<b>40</b>) by pivoting anvil (<b>60</b>) toward staple cartridge (<b>70</b>). Closure of end effector (<b>40</b>) results in the distal ends of anvil (<b>60</b>) and staple cartridge (<b>70</b>) bearing against retaining features of buttress applicator (<b>200</b>) that are configured to selectively retain buttress assemblies (<b>100</b>) with buttress applicator (<b>200</b>). This contact deflects such retaining features of buttress applicator (<b>200</b>) to thereby permit contact between a surface of anvil (<b>60</b>) and buttress assembly (<b>100</b>) on one side of buttress applicator (<b>200</b>), and a surface of staple cartridge (<b>70</b>) and buttress assembly (<b>100</b>) on another side of buttress applicator (<b>200</b>). Buttress assemblies (<b>100</b>) comprise an adhesive on their respective surfaces such that with end effector (<b>40</b>) clamping on both buttress assemblies (<b>100</b>), buttress assemblies (<b>100</b>) are adhered respectively to an underside of anvil (<b>60</b>) and a deck surface of staple cartridge (<b>70</b>). End effector (<b>40</b>) may then be re-opened (i.e., pivoting anvil (<b>60</b>) away from staple cartridge (<b>70</b>)) and pulled away from buttress applicator (<b>200</b>). With retaining features of applicator (<b>200</b>) disengaged from buttress assemblies (<b>100</b>), end effector (<b>40</b>) may freely pull buttress assemblies (<b>100</b>) away from buttress applicator (<b>200</b>) as end effector (<b>40</b>) is pulled away from buttress applicator (<b>200</b>). With buttress assemblies (<b>100</b>) loaded on end effector (<b>40</b>), end effector (<b>40</b>) may then be used to cut, staple, and reinforce the tissue site.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition to the foregoing, it should also be understood that any of the various buttress assemblies described herein may be further constructed and operable in accordance with at least some of the teachings of U.S. Pat. Pub. No. 2016/0278774, entitled &#x201c;Method of Applying a Buttress to a Surgical Stapler,&#x201d; published Sep. 29, 2016, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">IV.
