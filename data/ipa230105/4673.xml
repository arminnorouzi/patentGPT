Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosed subject matter relates generally to methods, systems, and products for privacy in networks and, in some particular embodiments, to a system, method, and computer program product for maintaining user privacy in advertisement networks.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Technical Considerations</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Certain advertising techniques (e.g., online advertising techniques and/or the like) rely on tracking user activities and personal data in order to personalize advertisements. For example, users may have two types of information: identifiable and non-identifiable. Identifiable information may be linked to an individual. Such identifiable information may be protected by privacy laws. If not handled properly, identifiable data may cause harm to the individual. As such, sharing of identifiable data with unauthorized parties should be prevented.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Additionally, the Internet of Things (IoT) is proliferating, and IoT devices are projected to reach tens of billions in the coming years. IoT devices may be equipped with various sensors for context awareness and with ubiquitous Internet connectivity, providing a continuous stream of events and actions to users. Data based on such streams may provide an opportunity for personalized advertising.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, certain techniques for providing personalized advertisements to users risk exposing identifiable information to external systems or entities. For example, an advertisement network may track online activities of users and therefore preserve the linkage between user identity data and other user data. Users have limited options to audit and control the data flow, with blocking (the most common option) being an all-or-nothing proposition. Further, in the IoT context, there is a lack of a native global view of information being shared. For example, IoT devices do not necessarily talk to all other devices or a central point. In addition, regulations/restrictions on data access, lack of user consent, and user resistance (e.g., for privacy concerns) may result in unavailability of access to user information. For example, extending existing tracking mechanisms to IoT may result in a significant backlash from consumers and regulators. In light of frequent data breaches, consumer resistance, and strict privacy regulations, among other challenges, balancing privacy with the need to access user information may be difficult.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it is an object of the presently disclosed subject matter to provide systems, methods, and computer program products for maintaining user privacy in advertisement networks.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to non-limiting embodiments, provided is a computer-implemented method for maintaining user privacy in advertisement networks.

For example, an issuer institution may provide an account identifier, such as a primary account number (PAN), to a customer that uniquely identifies one or more accounts associated with that customer. The account identifier may be embodied on a portable financial device, such as a physical financial instrument, e.g., a payment card, and/or may be electronic and used for electronic payments. The terms &#x201c;issuer institution&#x201d; and &#x201c;issuer institution system&#x201d; may also refer to one or more computer systems operated by or on behalf of an issuer institution, such as a server computer executing one or more software applications. For example, an issuer institution system may include one or more authorization servers for authorizing a transaction.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">As used herein, the term &#x201c;account identifier&#x201d; may include one or more types of identifiers associated with a user account (e.g., a PAN, a card number, a payment card number, a payment token, and/or the like). In some non-limiting embodiments, an issuer institution may provide an account identifier (e.g., a PAN, a payment token, and/or the like) to a user that uniquely identifies one or more accounts associated with that user. The account identifier may be embodied on a physical financial instrument (e.g., a portable financial instrument, a payment card, a credit card, a debit card, and/or the like) and/or may be electronic information communicated to the user that the user may use for electronic payments. In some non-limiting embodiments, the account identifier may be an original account identifier, where the original account identifier was provided to a user at the creation of the account associated with the account identifier. In some non-limiting embodiments, the account identifier may be an account identifier (e.g., a supplemental account identifier) that is provided to a user after the original account identifier was provided to the user. For example, if the original account identifier is forgotten, stolen, and/or the like, a supplemental account identifier may be provided to the user. In some non-limiting embodiments, an account identifier may be directly or indirectly associated with an issuer institution such that an account identifier may be a payment token that maps to a PAN or other type of identifier. Account identifiers may be alphanumeric, any combination of characters and/or symbols, and/or the like. An issuer institution may be associated with a bank identification number (BIN) that uniquely identifies the issuer institution.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As used herein, the term &#x201c;payment token&#x201d; may refer to an identifier that is used as a substitute or replacement identifier for an account identifier, such as a PAN. Payment tokens may be associated with a PAN or other account identifiers in one or more data structures (e.g., one or more databases and/or the like) such that they can be used to conduct a transaction (e.g., a payment transaction) without directly using the account identifier, such as a PAN. In some examples, an account identifier, such as a PAN, may be associated with a plurality of payment tokens for different individuals, different uses, and/or different purposes. For example, a payment token may include a series of numeric and/or alphanumeric characters that may be used as a substitute for an original account identifier. For example, a payment token &#x201c;4900 0000 0000 0001&#x201d; may be used in place of a PAN &#x201c;4147 0900 0000 1234.&#x201d; In some non-limiting embodiments, a payment token may be &#x201c;format preserving&#x201d; and may have a numeric format that conforms to the account identifiers used in existing payment processing networks (e.g., ISO 8583 financial transaction message format). In some non-limiting embodiments, a payment token may be used in place of a PAN to initiate, authorize, settle, or resolve a payment transaction or represent the original credential in other systems where the original credential would typically be provided. In some non-limiting embodiments, a payment token value may be generated such that the recovery of the original PAN or other account identifier from the payment token value may not be computationally derived (e.g., with a one-way hash or other cryptographic function). Further, in some non-limiting embodiments, the payment token format may be configured to allow the entity receiving the payment token to identify it as a payment token and recognize the entity that issued the payment token.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As used herein, the term &#x201c;provisioning&#x201d; may refer to a process of enabling a device to use a resource or service. For example, provisioning may involve enabling a device to perform transactions using an account. Additionally or alternatively, provisioning may include adding provisioning data associated with account data (e.g., a payment token representing an account number) to a device.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As used herein, the term &#x201c;payment token requestor&#x201d; may refer to an entity that is seeking to implement tokenization according to embodiments of the presently disclosed subject matter. For example, the payment token requestor may initiate a request that a PAN be tokenized by submitting a payment token request message to a payment token service provider. Additionally or alternatively, a payment token requestor may no longer need to store a PAN associated with a payment token once the requestor has received the payment token in response to a payment token request message. In some non-limiting embodiments, the requestor may be an application, a device, a process, or a system that is configured to perform actions associated with payment tokens. For example, a requestor may request registration with a network payment token system, request payment token generation, payment token activation, payment token de-activation, payment token exchange, other payment token lifecycle management related processes, and/or any other payment token related processes. In some non-limiting embodiments, a requestor may interface with a network payment token system through any suitable communication network and/or protocol (e.g., using HTTPS, SOAP, and/or an XML interface among others). For example, a payment token requestor may include card-on-file merchants, acquirers, acquirer processors, payment gateways acting on behalf of merchants, payment enablers (e.g., original equipment manufacturers, mobile network operators, and/or the like), digital wallet providers, issuers, third-party wallet providers, payment processing networks, and/or the like. In some non-limiting embodiments, a payment token requestor may request payment tokens for multiple domains and/or channels.

Additionally or alternatively, user device(s) <b>406</b> may assure that the user identity data is not made available to advertisement network system <b>404</b>, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In some non-limiting embodiments, the user data (e.g., persona data and/or generalized persona data) intended for sharing with advertisement network system <b>404</b> (e.g., for targeted advertising and/or the like), may be shared (e.g., communicated and/or the like) via mediator system <b>102</b> (e.g., an honest-but-curious mediator), e.g., in a manner that satisfies desired and/or selected security and/or privacy properties. For example, mediator system <b>402</b> may be able to view (e.g., receive in plain text, clear text and/or the like) only the user identity (e.g., user identity data and/or the like). Additionally or alternatively, mediator system <b>402</b> may receive an encryption of user data (e.g., encrypted generalized persona data and/or a ciphertext containing the same), but may not receive and/or view the user data (e.g., in plain text, clear text and/or the like). In some non-limiting embodiments, mediator system <b>402</b> may assist in persona generalization, anonymous billing, and/or the like, as described herein. For example, mediator system <b>402</b> may compute (e.g., in collaboration with user device(s) <b>406</b>, without such collaboration, and/or the like) a generalized persona function (e.g., Generate( ) and/or the like), e.g., based on encrypted user data (e.g., encrypted persona data and/or the like) using homomorphic encryption so that the local agent may decide (e.g., automatically, selectively, and/or the like) the level for generalization (e.g., coarseness and/or the like) of the raw user data (e.g., persona data). Additionally or alternatively, mediator system <b>402</b> may track delivery (e.g., communication, presentation, and/or the like) of targeted advertisements, e.g., for accounting, payment, billing, and/or the like using a verifiable one-time token (e.g., tracking token from advertisement network system <b>404</b> and/or the like), as described herein. In some non-limiting embodiments, the token (e.g., tracking token and/or the like) may flow (e.g., be communicated and/or the like) to and/or from users (e.g., user devices <b>406</b>), publishers (e.g., publisher system(s) <b>408</b>), mediator system <b>402</b>, advertisement network system <b>404</b>, and/or the like. Additionally or alternatively, payment (e.g., based on the tracking token) may flow (e.g., be transferred and/or the like) to and/or from advertisement network system <b>404</b>, mediator system <b>402</b>, publishers (e.g., publisher system(s) <b>408</b>), users (e.g., user devices <b>406</b>), and/or the like (e.g., the reverse route of communication of the tracking token). In some non-limiting embodiments, the accounting/billing/payment process may happen in a less frequent manner, e.g., once a month and/or the like, compared to the targeted advertisement delivery.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In some non-limiting embodiments, communications may be encrypted, e.g., using a semantically secure encryption scheme so that no attacks on integrity or confidentiality of the communications may be feasible. The encryption may include any suitable encryption technique, e.g., an encryption technique in which the desired security properties are achieved. In some non-limiting embodiments, notation such as Enc<sub>PK</sub>(m) may denote a ciphertext corresponding to message m, encrypted using the public key PK. Additionally or alternatively, Dec<sub>sk</sub>(m) may denote the decryption of (encrypted) message m using the secret key sk. Additionally or alternatively, the public key and private key for entity i may be denoted as pk<sub>i </sub>and sk<sub>i</sub>, respectively. In some non-limiting embodiments, at least some and/or part of communications may be signed by the sender, e.g., to allow for authentication. The signature may include any suitable digital signature technique, e.g., a technique that guarantees protection against forgery. In some non-limiting embodiments, notation such as &#x3c;m&#x3e;<sub>s </sub>may denote that the message m is signed by secret key sk.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In some non-limiting embodiments, persona generalization may include a technique that may allow different users to have different secret keys corresponding to a common public key such that, when the messages encrypted corresponding to these secret keys are combined together, it is possible to obtain the encrypted form for the sum of these messages, which can be decoded using a secret key that is also the sum of the secret keys of the messages involved. For example, one such technique may be referred to as a linear key homomorphic encryption scheme, an additive homomorphic encryption scheme, and/or the like. In some non-limiting embodiments, a Paillier cryptosystem may be a suitable example of such an encryption scheme and/or may allow anonymization and/or generalization of user personas efficiently.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In some non-limiting embodiments, a local agent may include a program (e.g., application and/or the like) that may run on a user's local trusted execution environment (e.g., TEE of user device(s) <b>406</b> and/or the like). Additionally or alternatively, the local agent may coordinate sensitive data management and network communication. In some non-limiting embodiments, the sensitive data may include keys for encryption, user identity data, non-identifiable user data (e.g., persona data, generalized persona data, and/or the like), tokens (e.g., tracking tokens, payment tokens, and/or the like), and/or the like. In some non-limiting embodiments, to protect such sensitive data, the local agent may run in a TEE. Additionally or alternatively, such sensitive data may be revealed in plaintext only in the TEE, and the data in the storage (e.g., hard disk, flash memory, and/or the like) may be encrypted with a secret key generated in the TEE. For example, a smartphone may include an encrypted enclave for sensitive data.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">When a user wants to join, the user may start by verifying its TEE (e.g., of the respective user device <b>406</b>) and initializing a local agent therein. Additionally or alternatively, upon initialization, the local agent may build secure connection channels with publisher system(s) <b>408</b> (e.g., IoT devices, web sites/services, mobile applications, and/or the like), e.g., that are associated with the user. Additionally or alternatively, the channels may allow the local agent to aggregate data from different publishers (e.g., associated with publisher system(s) <b>408</b>) and build initial (e.g., raw) persona data, e.g., a vector of attributes, with user identity data omitted. In some non-limiting embodiments, the agent may determine the generalization function, e.g., by having at least one communication with mediator system <b>402</b> on the encrypted raw persona data. Additionally or alternatively, the agent may display the raw persona, the generalization functions (e.g., buckets/hierarchical categorizations that assure each attribute is hidden among threshold many users), and/or the like in a graphical user interface (e.g., privacy dashboard and/or the like). In some non-limiting embodiments, the user may choose generalization functions (e.g., buckets/hierarchical categorizations), whether to share certain attributes, and/or the like, e.g., based on the user's preference(s). Additionally or alternatively, the user may go online (e.g., open, log into, and/or the like the agent application) anytime. Additionally or alternatively, the agent may handle the communications described herein automatically. For example, the user may occasionally check in the agent to update privacy selections/preferences, collect rewards (e.g., promotions, payments, discount offers, and/or the like) from publishers (e.g., associated with publisher system(s) <b>408</b>) based on the user's contributions (e.g., targeted advertisements communicated/presented to the user, e.g., by user device <b>406</b>, publisher system(s) <b>408</b>, and/or the like).</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">In some non-limiting embodiments, the agent may generate a one-time session key K<sub>j </sub>and/or encrypts the generalized persona data and/or session key with a public key pk<sub>A </sub>of advertisement network system <b>404</b>. Additionally or alternatively, using mediator system <b>402</b> as a proxy, the agent may send the ciphertext CU<sub>j </sub>to advertisement network system <b>404</b>, which may compute and encrypt the targeted advertisement Ad<sub>j </sub>with a one-time token t<sub>j </sub>(which may also be signed as &#x3c;t<sub>j</sub>&#x3e;<sub>A</sub>) with K<sub>j </sub>to form a second ciphertext CA<sub>j</sub>, which may be sent back to the agent using the same route (e.g., via mediator system <b>402</b>). Additionally or alternatively, the agent may then decrypt the second ciphertext, verifies the signed token, and/or communicate/present the targeted advertisement. Additionally or alternatively, the agent may communicated the targeted advertisement and/or the token to the appropriate (e.g., designated and/or the like) publisher system <b>408</b> for presentation (e.g., display and/or the like).</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In some non-limiting embodiments, a one-time setup (e.g., registration and/or the like) may be performed for each new user (e.g., user device <b>406</b> thereof) that wishes to participate. For example, the setup (e.g., registration and/or the like) may include distributing keys (e.g., public and/or private keys, as described herein) for secure communication, establishing authorization credentials for the user, and/or the like. In some non-limiting embodiments, a trusted certification authority (e.g., reputable certificate authorities like Symantec, DigiCert, GlobalSign, and/or the like) may carry out at least a portion of the setup (e.g., key generation and distribution and/or the like). Additionally or alternatively, based on the number of users registered, such a trusted authority may also help with data anonymization (e.g., as decryption server <b>514</b><i>c</i>, as described herein). In some non-limiting embodiments, the trusted authority may be contacted only once per new user, and therefore involvement of such trusted authority may be limited.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">In some non-limiting embodiments, users may be rewarded for their role. Additionally or alternatively, sybil identities (e.g., fake identities imitating real users) may be prevented (e.g., eliminated, reduced, detected, and/or the like). For example, sybil identities may be detectable by the trusted authority only registering users (e.g., user devices <b>406</b> thereof) that can prove that they run a TEE (e.g., Intel-SGX enabled devices and/or the like).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">In some non-limiting embodiments, user device(s) <b>406</b> may receive persona data (Data<sub>l</sub>) and publisher identity data (l) from publisher system(s) <b>408</b>, as described herein.

With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in some non-limiting embodiments or aspects, implementation <b>500</b><i>a </i>may be implemented (e.g., completely, partially, and/or the like) by user device(s) <b>406</b> and/or mediator system <b>402</b> (e.g., one or more devices of mediator system <b>402</b>). In some non-limiting embodiments or aspects, implementation <b>500</b><i>a </i>may be implemented (e.g., completely, partially, and/or the like) by another system, another device, another group of systems, or another group of devices, separate from or including user device(s) <b>406</b> and/or mediator system <b>402</b>, such as advertisement network system <b>404</b> (e.g., one or more devices of advertisement network system <b>404</b>), publisher system(s) <b>408</b> (e.g., one or more devices of publisher system(s) <b>408</b>), advertisement database <b>410</b>, advertiser system(s) <b>412</b> (e.g., one or more devices of advertiser system(s) <b>412</b>), and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">In some non-limiting embodiments, mediator system <b>402</b> may break the correlation between user identity data and other user data (e.g., persona data and/or the like). For example, it may be undesirable for user identity data to be available to advertisement network system <b>404</b> (e.g., which may exploit user identity data, in contravention of privacy concerns). In some non-limiting embodiments, the user data (e.g., persona data) may be sent to advertisement network system <b>404</b> in a format that may have a low possibility of uniquely identifying the user (e.g., generalized format, such as generalized persona data). For example, a user may be indistinguishable from N other similar users. In some non-limiting embodiments, persona data may include a vector of attributes, and each attribute may have a limited set of possible values (e.g., initial buckets and/or the like). Additionally or alternatively, for each attribute, the bucket description may be generalized (e.g., coarsened and/or the like), e.g., to ensure there are at least 8 users in the bucket. For example, if the attribute age has a value 21, the value may be generalized into a coarser bucket (e.g., age 20-30), assuring more than 8 number of users belong to this age bucket. In some non-limiting embodiments, an exemplary technique for determining such generalized buckets may be referred to as an Attribute Rebucketing Algorithm (ARA). Additionally or alternatively, the ARA may include collaboration with a centralized environment (e.g., mediator system <b>402</b>).</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">In some non-limiting embodiments, for each attribute, there may be more than one categorization for the value (e.g., hierarchical categorizations). For example, a user's age may be referred to as 21, between 20 and 30, between 0 and 50, and/or the like. Additionally or alternatively, a user's location may be described by a zip code (e.g., 94306), a city name (e.g., Palo Alto), a region name (e.g., Bay Area), a state name (e.g., California), a country name (e.g., US), a planet name (e.g., Earth) and/or the like. In some non-limiting embodiments, the hierarchy of categorization may form a tree structure. For example, the leaves (e.g., leaf nodes of the tree) may include the fine-grained (e.g., finest-grained, raw, and/or the like) values. Additionally or alternatively, each parent (e.g., non-leaf node) at each level may include a categorization that is more coarse-grained. In some non-limiting embodiments, advertisement network system <b>404</b> and/or mediator system <b>402</b> may agree on the hierarchy of categorization for each attribute in advance (e.g., predefined categorizations, preselected categorizations, and/or the like). For example, such agreement may be beneficial for transparency and public auditing.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">In some non-limiting embodiments, user data (e.g., persona data including a vector of attributes with corresponding attribute values) for each user, before any generalization, may include attribute values associated with the leaves (e.g., leaf nodes) of the tree. For example, such fine-grained attribute values may potentially be used by a receiver (e.g., advertisement network system <b>404</b> and/or the like) to uniquely identify the user. In some non-limiting embodiments, the attribute values may be replaced with higher-level (e.g., coarse-grained) categorizations (e.g., buckets), e.g., from non-leaf nodes above the leaf node. For example, the ARA may include a threshold &#x3b8; such that the determined bucket for each attribute may have more than the threshold &#x3b8; number of users therein. In some non-limiting embodiments, attribute values may be coarsened by moving up the levels in the tree structure until a non-leaf node (e.g., associated with a bucket/categorization) is identified in which a total count of users at the node exceeds the threshold.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">For the purpose of illustration, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, assume that a given attribute initially has seven buckets, which may be referred to as A through G. (In some non-limiting embodiments, the following algorithm (ARA) may apply to each attribute of persona data (e.g., in series, in parallel, and/or the like), and may be applied for any possible number of initial buckets/leaf nodes). In some non-limiting embodiments, a tree structure may be generated with leaf nodes for each initial bucket (e.g., A through G). For the purpose of illustration, assume the threshold &#x3b8; for this attribute is 500. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the aggregate count of hypothetical users in each of the initial buckets A through G may be [122, 462, 56, 27, 481, 11, 101], respectively (e.g., 122 users have an attributed value associated with bucket A, 462 users have an attributed value associated with bucket B, and so on). In some non-limiting embodiments, ARA may proceed as follows:</p><p id="p-0155" num="0000">1. For each non-leaf node, compute the value to be equal to the sum of its children: e.g., val(H)=val(A)+val(B).<br/>2. Invalidate the nodes whose values are lower than 8 (e.g., trim the tree).<br/>3. For each leaf node, traverse up to its ancestors until the first valid node is identified, which is assigned as the determined bucket, e.g., A&#x2192;H, B&#x2192;H, C&#x2192;K, D&#x2192;K, E&#x2192;J, F&#x2192;J, and G&#x2192;J.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0154">In some non-limiting embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the mapping relation at the end of the algorithm may be {A, B&#x2192;H; C, D&#x2192;K; E, F, G&#x2192;J}. In some non-limiting embodiments, ARA may run in time linear in the number of total nodes of the tree. Additionally or alternatively, given the trimmed tree, there might be multiple ancestors to which a leaf node may be mapped. For example, leaf node A may choose to map to its valid ancestors H or K. In some non-limiting embodiments, since both nodes contain sufficiently many users (e.g., privacy preserving), a user with an attribute value associated with leaf node A may select to report the categorization for either of these non-leaf nodes H or K for that user's generalized persona data. Additionally or alternatively, personalization (e.g., targeted advertisements and/or the like) may be more accurate if the direct ancestor (e.g., non-leaf node H) is reported instead of the further ancestor (e.g., non-leaf node K). In some non-limiting embodiments, ARA may reveal to the users what (initial) buckets had fewer (or more) than the threshold number of users belonging thereto. Additionally or alternatively, the actual counts remain hidden, e.g., to provide further privacy.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0155">In some non-limiting embodiments, the choice of threshold &#x3b8; may be impactful in ensuring privacy for the registered users. For example, the threshold &#x3b8; may be set sufficiently high for the users to be sufficiently indistinguishable. Additionally or alternatively, if the threshold &#x3b8; is set too high, over-generalization may be possible and/or may result in reduced personalization (e.g., reduced accuracy in generation of targeted advertisements by advertisement network system <b>404</b> and/or the like). In some non-limiting embodiments, advertisement network system <b>404</b> may recommend a threshold value &#x3b8; (e.g., to mediator system <b>402</b>, the trusted authority, and/or the like). For example, the recommended threshold may be a value beyond which personalization may not be guaranteed. In some non-limiting embodiments, when a new user registers, the new user may be informed (e.g., by mediator system <b>402</b>, the trusted authority, and/or the like) of the recommended threshold. Additionally or alternatively, the use may select (e.g., via user device <b>406</b> and/or the like) whether to conform the recommended threshold or select a different threshold value. For example, if the user is satisfied with the recommendation provided by advertisement network system <b>404</b> (e.g., via the agent on user device <b>406</b>), registration may proceed. Additionally or alternatively, if the user selects (e.g., via the agent on user device <b>406</b>) a higher threshold (e.g., the user feels the current recommendation is too low, prefers greater privacy, does not trust advertisement network system <b>404</b>, and/or the like), then user device <b>406</b>, mediator system <b>402</b>, and/or the trusted authority may ensure that buckets generated for the user conform to the user-specified threshold. In some non-limiting embodiments, a reduction in the reward paid to the user (e.g., as a fee for sharing the generalized persona and/or receiving the targeted advertisement) may correspond to a high threshold &#x3b8; (e.g., a more generalized persona). In some non-limiting embodiments, advertisement network system <b>404</b> may receive some information about the threshold picked by the user (e.g., the level of generalization may be apparent from and/or inferred from the generalized persona data and/or the like), and/or advertisement network system <b>404</b> may better understand the privacy preferences of its user(s) based thereon.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0156">In some non-limiting embodiments, the ARA may give an N-anonymity guarantee for each attribute. Additionally or alternatively, when users share more than one attribute (e.g., the persona data includes a vector with more than one attribute), the upper bound of the most anonymity level is the minimum of the threshold levels of all attributes of the vector (e.g., Min(&#x3b8;<sub>1</sub>, &#x3b8;<sub>2</sub>, . . . &#x3b8;<sub>v</sub>), where &#x3b8;<sub>i </sub>is the threshold for attribute i in a vector with v attributes). In some non-limiting embodiments, for simplicity, attributes may be assumed to be independent from each other. Additionally or alternatively, it may be likely that a user with some number of attributes may be actually unique. In some non-limiting embodiments, to address such a possibility, a clustering algorithm may be run on per-attribute N-anonymized personas to converge orphan personas. Such clustering may assure (e.g., with acceptably high probability) that the each cluster may contain more than T users. Additionally or alternatively, users in the same cluster may be very alike (e.g., share many attributes, generalized attributes, and/or the like).</p><p id="p-0159" num="0157">In some non-limiting embodiments, clustering may be performed with access to the plain text data (e.g., persona data). For example, after ARA, each attribute may be N-anonymized. Additionally or alternatively, each user can send that user's N-anonymized persona data (e.g., vector of attributes with N-anonymized attribute values) to a trusted decryption server (e.g., of mediator system <b>402</b>, the trusted authority, and/or the like). Additionally or alternatively, such a trusted decryption server may also have access to each user's unique (e.g., raw) persona, and such access may be tolerable because the trusted decryption server may not know which user the unique persona maps to (e.g., may not have access to the user identity data), so the possibility of the trusted decryption server identifying the user may be 1/M, where M is total number of users in the system. In some non-limiting embodiments, clustering may include the following (e.g., by the trusted decryption server):</p><p id="p-0160" num="0000">1. Rank each persona by number of users in descending order, and select the top M/T personas to be the centroid.<br/>2. For each user, compute the distance to each centroid, find the closest one, and assign that user to the cluster with the closest centroid.<br/>3. For each cluster, compute the new centroids using majority vote. Compute the size of the cluster (e.g., number of users in the cluster).<br/>4. For the cluster whose size is less than T, compute the distance of the centroid to other clusters' centroids, find the closest other cluster, and merge the cluster and the closest other cluster.<br/>5. Repeat step 4 until all clusters have more than T users.<br/>6. For each user of each cluster, compute the mapping relation to the centroid.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0158">In some non-limiting embodiments, the number of attributes may be extremely large if exhausting all possible attributes at once. Additionally or alternatively, step 1 may result in uniformly sized clusters of one persona each, and clustering from top personas may be difficult, not be useful, and/or the like. In some non-limiting embodiments, a subset of attributes may be agreed upon (e.g., by the advertisement network system <b>404</b>, mediator system <b>402</b>, and/or the like). For example, the subsets may be non-overlapping, or, if overlapping, the attributes are may be dependent. Additionally or alternatively, clusters may be produced in step 1 for each subset.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0159">In some non-limiting embodiments, clustering may be performed without access to the plain text data (e.g., persona data), e.g., clustering may be performed using encrypted data (e.g., persona data). For example, secret sharing may be used to decrypt a given persona (e.g., a persona with a subset of attributes with given attribute values/categories) when a sufficient number of shares of such persona are available. In some non-limiting embodiments, each user may have a share of a given persona, and when there is enough shares sent to the decryption server, the decryption server may be able to recover the given persona.

In some non-limiting embodiments, each user may communicate the initial (e.g., raw) value for each attribute of such user's persona to a central point (e.g., mediator system <b>502</b>) for counting. Additionally or alternatively, such communication may reveal the user data (e.g., persona data) to the central point (e.g., mediator system <b>502</b>), and/or such revealing may allow the central point to stump advertisement network system <b>404</b>.

Additionally or alternatively, each user device <b>506</b> may provide (e.g., communicate) to mediator system <b>502</b> the generalized persona based on such buckets (e.g., encrypted using the public key of advertisement network system <b>404</b> to produce encrypted generalized persona data, as described herein). For example, mediator system <b>502</b> may be unable to learn the individual personas that the users (e.g., user device <b>506</b> thereof) share with advertisement network system <b>404</b>. In some non-limiting embodiments, user-centric counting may become increasingly expensive for computation when the number of users increases and may require all the user device <b>506</b> to be online at the time the aggregate information is being computed by mediator system <b>502</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the amount of data communicated from the Mediator to the user may increase because aggregate information may be being communicated. Additionally or alternatively, each user (e.g., user device <b>506</b> thereof) may learn the counts for all the buckets, so although the user device <b>506</b> does not have access to user identify data of individual users that contact mediator system <b>502</b>, each user device <b>506</b> may have access to the full demographics of such users.

For example, mediator-centric counting may solve the challenges of high bandwidth, key distribution, and users joining/leaving. In some non-limiting embodiments, mediator-centric counting may include four rounds of communication (e.g., between each user device <b>506</b> and mediator system <b>502</b>) and/or may provide (e.g., guarantee and/or the like) comparable performance to user-centric counting by replacing expensive key-homomorphic schemes with faster secret sharing and additive homomorphic schemes (e.g., Paillier encryption).</p><p id="p-0167" num="0164">In some non-limiting embodiments, mediator-centric counting may obviate sending relatively large aggregate data to each user device <b>506</b> (which may result in high bandwidth and/or privacy concerns, as described herein).

Additionally or alternatively, a threshold number of these secret keys may collectively be used to decrypt any message encrypted using public key pk, but decryption may not be possible with less than the threshold number of secret keys.

Mediator system <b>502</b> may combine these encrypted messages using an additive homomorphic scheme to obtain a combined message C=Enc<sub>pk</sub>(&#x3a3;<sub>i</sub>m<sub>i</sub>). This combined message C may be communicated by mediator system <b>502</b> to all user devices <b>506</b>.<br/>3. Each user device <b>506</b> may use its share of the secret key sk<sub>i </sub>to decrypt the combined message C and obtains share of the combined message s<sub>i</sub>=Dec<sub>ski</sub>(C).

Mediator system <b>502</b> may receive the share of the combined message s<sub>i </sub>from a threshold number of user devices <b>506</b> to obtain the sum of the messages &#x3a3;<sub>i</sub>m<sub>i</sub>. The aggregate information (&#x3a3;<sub>i</sub>m<sub>i</sub>) may be used to create the buckets, e.g., using the ARA described herein (e.g., which now may have the property that each bucket has at least threshold many users). (In some non-limiting embodiments, an option for the user to select what threshold the user wants may be added. Additionally or alternatively, mediator system <b>502</b> may create the buckets based on such selection. Such selectable thresholds may result in a cost of added computation for mediator system <b>502</b>, which may re-bucket multiple times (e.g. up to once for each user), but such selectable thresholds have the benefit of increased personalization. Additionally or alternatively, such selectable thresholds may allow each user to control how much privacy such user is comfortable with/desires.)

Additionally or alternatively, the number of such shares of the private key sk<sub>i </sub>may depend on the frequency at which the system is desired to run (e.g., can afford to run and/or the like) a full redistribution for the keys (e.g., shares of the secret key sk<sub>i</sub>), the storage constraints of the trusted authority, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0166">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> is a swimlane diagram of an exemplary implementation <b>500</b><i>c </i>of a non-limiting embodiment relating to process <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

For example, none of pseudo-identity data (i&#x2032;), ciphertext from advertisement network for the session (CA), publisher identity data, and/or tracking token t<sub>j </sub>leaks (e.g., exposes, allow mediator system <b>402</b> to infer, and/or the like) the targeted advertisement to mediator system <b>402</b>.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0181">In some non-limiting embodiments, malicious users may be prevented from learning user identity data of other users by sending fake persona information. For example, as described herein, even the finest bucket will only reveal user identities with a probability that is exponentially low in the threshold &#x3b8; selected for the ARA. Additionally or alternatively, the maximum information revealed to the malicious users is whether the number of non-malicious users belonging to any given bucket (or collection thereof) is lower or higher than the threshold &#x3b8;. Additionally or alternatively, even in a worst case scenario in which the number of malicious users t=&#x3b8;&#x2212;2, when these malicious users determine that a bucket contains &#x3b8;&#x2212;1 users, the single non-malicious user in this bucket could have been anyone among the M&#x2212;&#x3b8;+2 users, which may be a large number of users. In some non-limiting embodiments, malicious users may be prevented from receiving an incentive (e.g., directly or indirectly from the advertisement network system <b>404</b>) by faking communication/presentation of targeted advertisements. For example, since advertisement network system <b>404</b> issues incentives only when a valid token is received, the malicious users may not be able to locally generate a valid token without decrypting the advertisement and/or reusing previously obtained tokens, since the nonce used by advertisement network system <b>404</b> to generate valid tokens may be unknown to the users and may not be retrieved otherwise.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0182">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a swimlane diagram of an exemplary implementation <b>600</b> of a non-limiting embodiment relating to process <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.
