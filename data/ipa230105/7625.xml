Fifth generation (5G) wireless systems refer to the next generation (NG) of radio systems and network architecture. 5G network technology is mostly based on new radio (NR) technology, but the 5G (or NG) network can also build on E-UTRAN radio. It is estimated that NR will provide bitrates on the order of 10-20 Gbit/s or higher, and will support at least enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency-communication (URLLC) as well as massive machine type communication (mMTC). NR is expected to deliver extreme broadband and ultra-robust, low latency connectivity and massive networking to support the Internet of Things (IoT). With IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication becoming more widespread, there will be a growing need for networks that meet the needs of lower power, low data rate, and long battery life. It is noted that, in 5G, the nodes that can provide radio access functionality to a user equipment (i.e., similar to Node B in UTRAN or eNB in LTE) are named gNB when built on NR technology and named NG-eNB when built on E-UTRAN radio.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some example embodiments may be directed to a method.

The following is a detailed description of some example embodiments of systems, methods, apparatuses, and computer program products for blind physical broadcast channel detection for narrowband new radio.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The features, structures, or characteristics of example embodiments described throughout this specification may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more example embodiments. For example, the usage of the phrases &#x201c;certain embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;an example embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;some embodiments,&#x201d; or other similar language, throughout this specification refers to the fact that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with an embodiment may be included in at least one embodiment. Thus, appearances of the phrases &#x201c;in certain embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;an example embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;in some embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;in other embodiments,&#x201d; or other similar language, throughout this specification do not necessarily refer to the same group of embodiments, and the described features, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more example embodiments.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Narrowband new radio (NB NR) is an emerging scenario driven by the future of global railway communication needs, as well as some smart grid and public safety operating environments. However, NB NR solutions may also be applicable to other scenarios including, but not limited to, for example, smartphone and/or Internet of Things (IoT) deployments for certain narrow bandwidth (BW) deployments (e.g., below 1 GHz carrier frequency). As such, certain aspects may be of consideration including, for example, reception of punctured physical broadcast channel (PBCH). In certain cases, punctured PBCH may be used to narrow down the BW of synchronization signal blocks (SSBs) in order to match the available BW.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some scenarios, it may be beneficial to enable the operation of 5G NR in a narrower BW than 5 MHz channels for which it was originally designed. For example, deployment of NR in the 900 MHz future railway mobile communication system (FRMCS) band needs to take place alongside legacy global system for mobile communications&#x2014;railway (GSM-R) carriers within a 5.6 MHz bandwidth, which permits about 3.6 MHz to be used for NR in one deployment example. In other examples, other GSM channels may be spaced at 200 kHz. Thus, GSM may reserve N&#xd7;200 kHz in principle, and the rest may be available for NR. Similarly, there may be some cases where 3 MHz channels are available for NR. However, in other cases, depending on the scenario, the actual BW may differ from the examples described above.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example NR initial access signals and channels with 15 kHz subcarrier spacing. As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the essential signals and channels transmitted by the NR base stations (gNBs) were not designed for transmission in such narrow channels. Further, in an initial cell selection (e.g., initial access), the UE may search for a primary synchronization signal (PSS) on the predefined synch raster points. In other words, the synchronization raster may indicate the frequency positions of the synchronization signal block (SSB) that can be used by the user equipment (UE) for system acquisition when explicit signaling of the SB position is not present. In addition, a global synchronization raster may be defined for all frequencies. The frequency position of the SSB may be defined as the frequency position of the SSB (SSREF) with a corresponding number such as, for example, a global synchronization channel number (GSCN). This is illustrated in, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which illustrates an example table of GSCN parameters for the global frequency raster. Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example of synch raster points at below 3 GHz, which are defined in clusters of three points.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">It may be possible, in some cases, to use NR in a narrower BW than 5 MHz in which it may be assumed that the SSs and system information (SI) transmissions may be redesigned. This may be based on, for example, smaller subcarrier spacing (e.g., 7.5 kHz) which would reduce the SSB BW by 50% (compared to 15 kHz SCS), or a new SSB structure (e.g. SSB comprising more than four OFDM symbols). This may be a fundamental change to the design of NR, which may adversely impact the ecosystem. Thus, a mechanism may be needed to adapt NR to such narrower BWs. Such a mechanism may include, for example puncturing the PBCH rather than recoding and remapping it. Alternatively, rate matching may provided as a different approach to adapt NR to narrower BWs. With puncturing, the transport block may be prepared according to the original size (i.e., in frequency and time). Additionally, the transmitter may ignore transmission of certain (punctured) resource elements. Moreover, the receiver may operate with or without the knowledge of the puncturing on the resources used by the transmitter. In other words, the receiver may correctly decode the transport block (TB) if it does not use the correct assumption of puncturing. In other cases, puncturing may refer to a scenario where the transmitter (e.g., gNB) does not transmit the prepared modulated symbols in certain resource elements. Furthermore, in rate matching (or remapping), the TB block may be prepared for a new (i.e., smaller) resource size. In certain cases of rate matching, the receiver may not be able to correctly decode the TB if it uses the wrong assumption for the resource size at the receiver.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Depending on the scenario, the UE may not be aware of the actual BW of the PBCH. If the UE operates according to the BW of the complete PBCH (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), the UE may suffer from significant performance degradation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example table of performance degradation due to puncturing.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an example case scenario, the UE may suffer from performance degradation when there is a one-sided puncturing of the PBCH, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example of PBCH with asymmetric puncturing with no remapping. In this example case scenario, additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) interference may be used to mimic GSM-R interference. Additionally, in this example case scenario, the gNB may not transmit PBCH on those GSM-R &#x201c;PRBs&#x201d;, and the UE may assume that the detection is performed on a complete PBCH bandwidth (i.e., wrong PBCH Tx BW). As illustrated in the example table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, degradation on signal-to-noise ratio (dSNR) that is required for adequate PBCH detection performance is shown for different amounts of PRB puncturing (i.e., 2, 4, and 6 PRBs). In other words, dSNR indicates how much higher SNR should be so that the UE reaches adequate PBCH detection performance when compared to PBCH transmitted and detected on complete PBCH bandwidth of 20 RBs.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some cases, depending on the interference power, PBCH detection performance may be degraded by more than 5 dB. This would mean that the UE is frequently unable to access the cell. Additionally, in deployment scenarios such as GSM-R refarming, the GSM and NR BS may likely be co-located to the same sites, making the higher GSM power levels more probable.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one scenario, the UE may have knowledge of the actual Tx BW. However, this may be problematic since the SSB (including the PBCH) may be the first signal that the UE detects. In this case, something may be determined implicitly, for example, based on the synch raster location, or by other means. However, the problem may be that it may introduce a fixed relationship between the PBCH and BW. Furthermore, it may be seen as a significant change for the current structure. Thus, in certain example embodiments, the PBCH BW may be varied according to coexistence scenarios, which may change over time. Such a change may be due to progress on the GSM-R refarming.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Certain example embodiments may provide a PBCH blind detection arrangement for the UE. For instance, when certain predefined conditions are met, the UE may try to decode the PBCH not only using 20 PRBs, but also with other predefined BW assumptions. In certain example embodiments, the predefined conditions may include, but not limited to, the UE operating in a predefined frequency range (e.g., FR1). The predefined conditions may also include the UE operating in a predefined frequency band(s) (e.g., FRMCS band, 2&#xd7;5.6 MHz FDD and 874.4-880 MHz/919.4-925 MHz). Additionally, the predefined conditions may include the UE detecting PBCH with a predefined numerology (e.g., 15 kHz subcarrier spacing (SCS)). In certain example embodiments, the above listed predefined conditions and other predefined conditions not listed may vary depending on the use case and scenario.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example table of PBCH detection options, according to certain example embodiments. In certain example embodiments, when the predefined conditions are satisfied, the UE may perform PBCH detection with the current PBCH BW assumption (e.g., full allocation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>), and also using one or more predefined BW assumptions. In other example embodiments, the BW assumptions may include one or more of the puncturing options shown in the example table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. According to certain example embodiments, puncturing &#x201c;x&#x201d; number of PRBs may correspond to a PBCH being prepared for full allocation. However, in some example embodiments, the BS may not transmit on the punctured PRBs, and the UE may perform detection assuming (20-X) PRBs. In other example embodiments, instead of puncturing, the UE may decode with different rate matching options for PBCH while performing multiple detections. In this case, the difference compared to puncturing may be that in those scenarios, PBCH may be prepared with an assumption that the PBCH block is prepared for different numbers of PRBs (rather than punctured).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In certain example embodiments, the UE may perform detection of the punctured PBCH in a predefined order. In particular, according to some example embodiments, the UE may try a detection option of the punctured PBCH, for example, with the highest BW first. However, in other example embodiments, there may be a predefined priority order instead of starting from the highest BW. If the detection fails, the UE may try to detect the next highest BW PBCH, and so on. In doing so, it may be possible to provide support for physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) detection with the right BW hypothesis (i.e., estimate). According to certain example embodiments, this may be seen as a UE BW configuration for an initial Rx operation including SSB (secondary synchronization signal (SSS)/primary synchronization signal (PSS), and PBCH) and PDCCH detection and related operations.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In certain example embodiments, when the UE may receive PBCH correctly with the puncturing hypothesis (considered as estimated PBCH puncturing pattern), the UE may assume that the PDCCH transmitted via control resource set #0 (CORESET #0) is also transmitted with reduced BW. Thus, the UE may use the estimated PBCH puncturing pattern for receiving PDCCH for system information block n (SIBn) and paging scheduling, which may include SIB1. In particular, in certain example embodiments, the downlink control information (DCI) in PDCCH may provide scheduling grant for the PDSCH, which may then carry SIBn and paging content. It may also be possible that DCI (On PDCCH) already has some system information included. According to certain example embodiments, when receiving the PDCCH for SIB1, the UE may mask the PBCH pattern with a control channel element (CCE) structure (i.e., it may not consider punctured CCEs as valid CCE). In other words, the UE may assume that CCEs that would be partially punctured are not transmitted.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an example of 2-symbol and 3-symbol structures for CORESET #0 with 24 PRBs, according to certain example embodiments. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates the CCE structure for 2-symbol and 3-symbol CORESET #0, and assumes that the lowest frequency of PBCH and CORESET #0 are aligned. In other example embodiments, the UE may use CORESET #0 and PBCH relative locations in the frequency domain to validate the PBCH puncturing pattern. For instance, in certain example embodiments, when either one of CORESET #0 resource edges is aligned with (full allocation) PBCH edge, asymmetric puncturing patterns puncturing the other (not aligned) CORESET #0 edge are valid. The puncturing hypothesis may be corrected to the closest (smallest number of resource blocks (RBs) with changed puncturing/no puncturing assumptions) valid puncturing pattern. When neither of the CORESET #0 resource edges are aligned with a (full allocation) PBCH edge, symmetric puncturing patterns are valid. Additionally, the puncturing hypothesis may be corrected to the closest (smallest number of RBs with changed puncturing/no puncturing assumptions) valid puncturing pattern.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to certain example embodiments, SIB1 may include the information for the actual BW used in transmissions, in which case a new information element may be needed. According to other example embodiments, the UE may determine whether the puncturing is assumed at the high frequency or the low frequency, or the order for using or testing PBCH puncturing patterns whether to start from the patterns with puncturing on the high frequency or the low frequency. In certain example embodiments, this determination may be based on the synchronization raster point of the detected PSS. In certain example embodiments, the high frequency and the low frequency may be defined according to PRB indexes within the initial DL BWP. In particular, low frequency may correspond to the lowest indexes, and high frequency may correspond to the high frequencies. According to certain example embodiments, the initial BWP may cover the PRBs occupied by the CORESET #0.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an example puncturing pattern with respect to synch raster points, according to certain example embodiments. For instance, according to some example embodiments, when the synch raster point is at a lower frequency of the channel of interest, the UE may assume puncturing may be at high frequencies. Correspondingly, when the synch raster point is at a higher frequency of the channel of interest, the UE may assume puncturing may be at the low frequency. This principle is illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, where the channel of interest is 919.4-925 MHz (DL), and N values 768 and 769 indicating cluster index of the synch raster points for the lower frequency and higher frequency of the channel, respectively. In certain example embodiments, it may be specified that the UE may assume that the RE overlapping in the frequency domain with PSS (and SSS) are not punctured for example, for detection of PBCH/PDCCH (CORESET #0).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to certain example embodiments, the UE (implementation) may adjust the PBCH puncturing assumption/order in a detection accounting the prevailing signal conditions (estimated, for example, based on PSS/SSS quality) so that in good signal quality conditions, larger puncturing (lowest BW) may be given priority as it may provide sufficient quality for correct detection, while reducing the detection effort/time. In this case, the UE may use the successful PBCH puncturing hypothesis for SIB1 PDCCH blind decoding. Additionally, in case of PDCCH detection failure(s), the UE may use the PBCH puncturing hypothesis with a wider BW.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In other example embodiments, the UE may be provided with assistance information via, for example, a subscriber identity module (SIM), to determine which of the possible puncturing assumptions are possible (i.e., a subset of possible puncturing patterns or list of puncturing patterns. The puncturing patterns not included in the subset are not applied). According to certain example embodiments, the subcarrier-based resource element granularity may be applied (instead of the default PRB granularity) for BW detection of the punctured PBCH. This may allow for fine tuning of the BW for optimizing system performance against RF criteria given for operation BW and its adjacent carrier regulations.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Additionally, certain example embodiments may include various tracks. In a first track, the possible puncturing pattern may be predefined for the relevant scenarios. Additionally, when receiving the PBCH, the UE may be expected to detect the PBCH with all determined puncturing patterns. In certain example embodiments, the UE may detect the PBCH with all determined puncturing patterns in a predefined order.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a second track, the UE may determine the puncturing patterns by implementation. An example of such implementation is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a flow chart of an example implementation by the UE, according to certain example embodiments. At <b>100</b>, the UE may detect the PSS and/or SSB. At <b>105</b>, the UE may determine whether certain predefined conditions of the UE have been met. If no, at <b>140</b>, the UE may detect a PBCH and SIB1 PDCCH with a full RB allocation. However, if the predefined conditions have been met, at <b>110</b>, the UE may determine a PBCH candidate pattern, and receive the PBCH. At <b>115</b>, the UE may determine whether the PBCH has been received. According to certain example embodiments, determination of whether the PBCH has been received may be based on a cyclic redundancy check (CRC). If no, the flow may return to <b>110</b> and determine another PBCH candidate pattern or modify the PBCH candidate pattern. However, if yes, at <b>120</b>, the UE may receive the SIB1 PDCCH with the PBCH candidate pattern. At <b>125</b>, the UE may determine whether the PDCCH has been received. According to certain example embodiments, determination of whether the PDCCH has been received may be based on a cyclic redundancy check (CRC). If no, at <b>130</b>, the UE may modify the PBCH candidate pattern, and return to <b>120</b>. However, if yes, at <b>135</b>, the UE may receive an SIB1 PDSCH.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates an example flow diagram of a method, according to certain example embodiments.

In some example embodiments, it may be possible for the PBCH performance to be similar to a scenario where the UE has full knowledge of the actual puncturing pattern (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). Additionally, when comparing values in Table 1 and Table 2, it can be noted that there is a significant performance difference between the two cases. For example, &#x2014;3 dB in the case of 4PRBs and 0 dB interference power (with respect to the PBCH power).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Other example embodiments may provide a scalable solution for the gNB to adjust the PBCH puncturing pattern based on the scenario. For instance, in the case of GSM refarming, PBCH puncturing may be reduced in time (e.g., as the amount of GSM terminals reduces). Certain example embodiments may also eliminate the need for additional signaling, and enable the PBCH structure to remain unchanged. Additional example embodiments may help with improving PDCCH reception, and reduce additional UE complexity.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some example embodiments, an apparatus may include or be associated with at least one software application, module, unit or entity configured as arithmetic operation(s), or as a program or portions of programs (including an added or updated software routine), which may be executed by at least one operation processor or controller.
