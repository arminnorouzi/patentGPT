The density of TILs in tissue is correlated with disease progression, patient survival, and treatment response in different types of cancer, including lung cancer. However, existing immune infiltration metrics that measure TIL density are not as effective in predicting recurrence as evaluating the relative concentrations of different TIL subtypes, each of which may have different biological roles in tumor control. For example, while some TIL populations stimulate an anti-tumor response, others promote cancer progression. Furthermore, different TIL subtypes are difficult, or even impossible, to detect or identify by manual inspection of hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x26;E) stained tissue samples.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Existing approaches for detecting different TIL subtypes in H&#x26;E stained tissue samples are complex and tissue-destructive. For instance, existing approaches employ multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) or immunohisto-chemistry (IHC) to identify TIL subtypes, including CD3, CD4, and CD8 TILs. Increased levels of CD3 and CD8 TILs are associated with improved outcome in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Additionally, the spatial interplay between different families of intratumoral TIL cells is correlated with survival in pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, the spatial interplay between tumor and regulatory T cells is associated with survival in NSCLC. However, existing approaches to TIL subtyping in identifying increased levels of CD3 and CD8 TILs, quantifying the spatial interplay between different families of intratumoral TILs, or quantifying the spatial interplay between tumor and regulatory T cells, all employ QIF or IHC, and are thus complex, non-trivial, and tissue destructive processes.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Some existing approaches may employ computerized image analysis for quantifying the presence and extent of TILs from H&#x26;E images using both QIF and IHC, and for predicting the outcome and response to therapy. These existing approaches either use machine learning techniques, alone, or use handcrafted features, alone. In contrast, embodiments integrate both handcrafted features and a transfer learning-based CNN approach to indentify TILs and TIL regions.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Embodiments non-destructively identify TIL cluster families and their spatial architecture represented in routine H&#x26;E stained images, obviating the need for more expensive, complex, tissue-destructive techniques like QIF or IHC. Embodiments derive quantitative measurements from the identified TIL cluster families represented in the H&#x26;E stained images, and the spatial architecture of the TIL cluster families. Embodiments further predict recurrence in NSCLC based on the derived quantitative measurements with increased accuracy compared to existing approaches.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Embodiments automatically identify and analyze different TIL families from routine H&#x26;E images in a reproducible, more accurate, non-tissue-destructive way using a machine vision approach. Embodiments may employ an automated TIL detection technique to detect lymphocytes and non-lymphocytes represented in a routine H&#x26;E image. Embodiments compute contextual features with respect to the detected lymphocytes. Embodiments then cluster detected lymphocytes, based at least in part, on the contextual features, to establish a relation between different TIL families.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">TIL subpopulations are strategically distributed with respect to tumoral cells, and the spatial location of the TILs may have biological meaning and relevance. Thus, embodiments that analyze the representation of the tumoral relationships take into account the contextual information, i.e., groups of cells rather than merely individual nuclei. Embodiments define a set of context-based features that model the tumor environment and the relationships between lymphocytes and their surrounding cells, including lymphocytes and non-lymphocytes. Embodiments may further extract morphological features associated with the lymphocytes. Embodiments group lymphocytes using a cluster-based approach, which may include a Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DPGMM). The DPGMM clusters the data extracted from the H&#x26;E image via a non-parametric Bayesian framework that describes distributions over mixture models with an infinite number of mixture components. Embodiments thus improve over existing approaches since embodiments do not need to make any assumptions about the number of TIL clusters. Rather than explicitly defining the number of TIL clusters that might exist, embodiments performing clustering using a DPGMM approach facilitate a natural aggregation of groups, which removes the need to make explicit assumptions about the number of clusters. Embodiments then characterize the H&#x26;E image by generating a frequency distribution of the TIL clusters, which may be represented as a histogram of occurrences of the identified TILs within the particular partition defined by the clusters. Embodiments then provide the frequency distribution to a machine learning classifier, which classifies the region of tissue represented in the H&#x26;E image as likely to experience recurrence or unlikely to experience recurrence, based, at least in part, on the frequency distribution. Embodiments may further train a machine learning classifier using the frequency distributions of H&#x26;E images in a training set, to predict the likelihood of recurrence in early stage NSCLC patients. Embodiments may further test the machine learning classifier using the frequency distributions of H&#x26;E images in a testing set.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">An exemplary embodiment for predicting NSCLC recurrence using TIL phenotyping is now described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example workflow <b>100</b> for identifying TIL subtypes in a routine H&#x26;E image according to embodiments. Workflow <b>100</b> includes, at <b>110</b>, accessing a routine H&#x26;E stained tissue microarray (TMA) image of a region of tissue demonstrating cancerous pathology. In this embodiment, a set of H&#x26;E stained TMA images of tissue demonstrating early stage NSCLC is accessed. In another embodiment, other, different stain types may be employed.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Workflow <b>100</b> also includes, at <b>120</b>, identifying lymphocytes represented in the image. Nuclei represented in an H&#x26;E image are segmented using a watershed-based technique in this embodiment. Embodiments extract a shape feature, a texture feature, or a color feature from the segmented nuclei. A segmented nucleus is classified as either lymphocyte or non-lymphocyte according to a nuclei texture feature, a shape feature, or a color feature. For example, lymphocyte nuclei are distinguished from other cell nuclei by their smaller size, more rounded shape, and darker homogeneous staining.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Workflow <b>100</b> also includes, at <b>130</b>, extracting features that quantify the relationship between TIL families represented in the image. Embodiments characterize a lymphocyte based on the lymphocyte's own morphological features and further by a set of contextual features to describe the lymphocyte and its surroundings (i.e., local neighborhood). Embodiments may extract morphological features or contextual features using a concentric circles approach. For a lymphocyte, a set of circles with incremental radii of k=dL&#xd7;10, dL&#xd7;20, dL&#xd7;30 pixels are placed at the lymphocyte center, where dL=20 pixels is the average diameter of the detected lymphocytes. Embodiments may define the center of a lymphocyte by, for example, defining the geometric center of the lymphocyte. Embodiments also compute a set of features extracted from within each circle. Embodiments use the set of features to characterize the lymphocyte. In this example, these features may include but are not limited to features that measure the grouping factor of lymphocytes, relative lymphocyte-cellular density, lymphocyte tissular density, variations of the median intensities of lymphocytes, or relative lymphocyte-cellular interspersing.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In embodiments, the set of contextual features may include a sum of the inverse Euclidean distances between a lymphocyte located on the center of the circle and other lymphocytes in the circled area. The set of contextual features may include a ratio between the sum of the area of lymphocytes and the area of non-lymphocytes. The set of contextual features may include a ratio between the sum of the areas of lymphocytes and the eosinophilic tissue area. The set of contextual features may include a ratio between the number of lymphocytes and the number of non-lymphocytes. The set of contextual features may include an average of the squared differences between the median intensities of lymphocytes. The set of contextual features may include a ratio between the area of a convex hull containing all the lymphocytes and a convex hull containing non-lymphocytes. The set of contextual features may include an intersection between the convex hull containing all the lymphocytes and the convex hull containing all the non-lymphocytes. The set of contextual features may include a median of distances from each lymphocyte to a closest non-lymphocyte neighbor. The set of contextual features may include a ratio between the median of the distance between all the lymphocytes and their closest lymphocyte neighbor and the median of the distance between all the non-lymphocytes and their closest non-lymphocyte neighbor. The set of contextual features may include a number of lymphocytes within a convex hull of non-lymphocytes. The set of contextual features may also include a sum of distances between the centered lymphocyte and its non-lymphocytes neighbors. In other embodiments, the set of contextual features may include other, different contextual features or combinations of contextual features. While in this embodiment, contextual features that consider relationships between all the lymphocytes or all the non-lymphocytes in a region, in another embodiment, contextual features that consider a threshold level of lymphocytes or non-lymphocytes may be employed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Embodiments perform a clustering analysis of TILs identified in the image. Workflow <b>100</b> further includes, at <b>140</b>, performing a clustering analysis based, at least in part, on the extracted set of morphological or contextual features. Gaussian mixture models are probabilistic models that assume all the data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters. In such cases, a Dirichlet Process as a prior distribution of the number of clusters, provides that the probability mass can be easily re-distributed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary DPGMM <b>200</b> suitable for use by embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In DPGMM <b>200</b>, xi represent observed data points (i.e., individual TILs to be clustered). Z<sub>i </sub>represents a set of labels assigning xi to one of k clusters. Cluster parameters are represented by &#x3c0; and &#x3b8;, where &#x3c0; represents mixture proportions, and &#x3b8; represents cluster means and covariances. Associated uninformative priors are represented by a and k. Since biological subtypes of lymphocytes are not visually distinguishable in H&#x26;E images by an unaided human eye or in the human mind, and since it is unknown the number of possible groups existent in a set of H&#x26;E images, embodiments that employ DPGMMs facilitate a more convenient framework for TIL clustering than existing approaches.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this example, it is first assumed that there exists an infinite set of latent groups, each group described by a set of parameters (e.g., a Gaussian with mean p and standard deviation a). Then, a lymphocyte is assigned to a cluster. One approach suitable for employment by embodiments for assigning a lymphocyte to a cluster is the &#x201c;stick breaking&#x201d; approach described herein.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the &#x201c;stick breaking&#x201d; approach, assume a stick of length one. A random variable &#x3b2;<sub>1</sub>&#x2dc;Beta (1, &#x3b1;) is generated. A real number between 0 and 1 is set by the Beta distribution, with an expected value of 1/(1+a). a is the concentration scaling parameter, and is a positive real number that influences the dispersion of data points. A low a value will generate more tightly clustered data points, while a higher a value will generate more clusters, or a wider range of different clusters. The stick is then broken off at &#x3b2;<sub>1</sub>, and &#x3c9;<sub>1 </sub>is the stick length at the left side. Next, using the right side of the stick, embodiments generate &#x3b2;<sub>2</sub>&#x2dc;Beta (1, &#x3b1;).

Embodiments thus improve on existing approaches that use, for example, K-means clustering, which may force lymphocytes into specific clusters or force the creation of specific clusters. Using the DPGGM, or similar clustering techniques, embodiments ensure that, even if a model discovers, for example, a possible ten top clusters, embodiments are still capable of determining that, for a specific case (e.g., a specific patient) that four of the ten, or three of the ten clusters have been found in the specific case, with specific distribution for each cluster. Embodiments thus facilitate more accurate personalized prediction of recurrence, since the lymphocytes detected in a particular image will be clustered according to the specific properties of that image, and not forced into a specific set of clusters that may not accurately characterize the actual lymphocytes represented in that image.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Embodiments may characterize the image. In this example, once lymphocytes are assigned to a cluster (i.e., group), a histological image may be characterized using the clusters obtained via the DPGMM. A particular image may be represented by a histogram containing the number of TIL occurrences per cluster. These image histograms are normalized, resulting in corresponding probability distribution functions.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Embodiments may train a machine learning classifier to predict the likelihood of recurrence. Embodiments may train the machine learning classifier using a training set. In one embodiment, the training set is generated from a dataset of 178 H&#x26;E stained tissue cores, corresponding to <b>178</b> different patients. The data set, in this embodiment, is acquired from two independent and well-characterized collections of NSCLC represented in TMAs. The TMAs were digitally scanned at 20&#xd7; magnification. Each tissue core was digitized within an image with dimensions of 1500 pixels by 1500 pixels, and labeled either &#x201c;recurrence&#x201d; or &#x201c;non-recurrence&#x201d;, where information indicating recurrence or non-recurrence was acquired from the patient record. Other labeling schemes may be employed.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Embodiments may determine whether an NSCLC case represented in a TMA has recurrence or not, or whether it is likely or unlikely the region of tissue will experience recurrence. Embodiments may be evaluated in terms of ability to determine whether a NSCLC case experiences recurrence. For example, the dataset of 178 H&#x26;E stained tissue cores, corresponding to <b>178</b> different patients described above may be randomly split into a learning (i.e., training) set (n=100), and testing set (n=78). In this example, the learning set is used to determine clustering parameters and train a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier model that separates cases into two classes: recurrence and non-recurrence. Unlike existing approaches, embodiments, when training the classifier, explore the features actually present in the training imagery, extract the features, and find the optimal distribution of clusters and apply that distribution of clusters to the testing set, without restricting cluster formation.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In this example, different a values may be used for generating different numbers of clusters, and the performance of each set of clusters is assessed. Additionally, embodiments are compared against two different approaches. The first existing approach employs a model in which images are characterized by lymphocyte local and contextual features but with no clustering. In this first existing approach, features pertaining to lymphocyte mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis are used to build a feature vector. A second, different existing approach includes a prediction model constructed based on the density of TILs in an image, i.e., the ratio between the number of extant lymphocytes to the total tissue area. Embodiments predict recurrence with greater accuracy than at least these two different existing approaches.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates visual results corresponding to two lung cancer non-recurrence cases in row <b>310</b> and row <b>320</b>.
