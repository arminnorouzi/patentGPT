Obviously, the described embodiments are only parts of the embodiments of the present disclosure, not all of the embodiments. Based on the embodiments of the present disclosure, all other embodiments obtained by those of ordinary skill in the art without creative work, should fall within the protection scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>13</b></figref>, the present disclosure provides a screen magnifier. In one embodiment, the screen magnifier comprises a magnifier body and a mounting seat <b>2</b>. The magnifier body comprises a magnifying glass <b>1</b>. A rotating shaft <b>3</b> is disposed on the magnifier body. The rotating shaft <b>3</b> is disposed perpendicular to a glass surface of the magnifying glass. The magnifier body is rotated around an axis of the rotating shaft to switch between a horizontal position and a vertical position of the magnifier body. The rotating shaft <b>3</b> may be relatively fixedly connected with the magnifier body. That is, as shown in the drawings, the rotating shaft <b>3</b> and the magnifier body are rotated synchronously, the structure of which is reasonable, and the assembly is convenient. Of course, the rotating shaft <b>3</b> and the magnifier body can also be rotated asynchronously, and the magnifier body is relatively sleeved on the rotating shaft <b>3</b>. By rotating back and forth, the magnifying glass <b>1</b> is switched between the horizontal position and the vertical position.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In addition, mounting holes <b>4</b> are on the mounting seat. The mounting holes <b>4</b> extend along a horizontal direction. The rotating shaft <b>3</b> is movably connected with the mounting holes <b>4</b>. The rotating shaft <b>3</b> is disposed in the mounting holes <b>4</b>. The rotating shaft <b>3</b> is movable in the mounting holes <b>4</b> of the mounting seat <b>2</b> to change a position of the rotating shaft <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, as shown in the drawings, when the magnifier body is switched from the horizontal position to the vertical position, the rotating shaft <b>3</b> is moved to the left along the mounting holes <b>4</b>, and the magnifier body rotates clockwise to switch to the vertical position. Similarly, when the magnifier body is switched from the vertical position to the horizontal position, the rotating shaft <b>3</b> moves to the right along the mounting holes <b>4</b>, and the magnifier body rotates counterclockwise to switch to the horizontal position. The magnifier body is located at a middle portion with respect to the mounting seat no matter it is in the vertical position or the horizontal position, so it is always directly facing a display screen of an electronic device.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the screen magnifier of the present disclosure, the magnifier body rotated around the axis of the rotating shaft <b>3</b>, and the horizontal position and the vertical position of the magnifier body is switched by rotating, so as to adapt to horizontal or vertical viewing of the display screen of the electronic device. In addition, the rotating shaft <b>3</b> moves in the mounting holes <b>4</b> of the mounting seat <b>2</b>. The position of the axis of the rotating shaft <b>3</b> is changed in the mounting holes <b>4</b>, which cooperates with the mounting holes <b>4</b> to realize the switching between the horizontal position and the vertical position of the magnifier body, while ensuring that the magnifying glass <b>1</b> is moved to face the display screen of the electronic device after the switching. The screen magnifier is reasonable in structure and is convenient to use.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">On the basis of the above embodiment, the following embodiments or further descriptions are made.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In one embodiment, the magnifier body further comprises a frame <b>5</b>. The magnifying glass <b>1</b> is connected with the frame <b>5</b>. The rotating shaft <b>3</b> is disposed on the frame <b>5</b>. By configuring the frame <b>5</b>, a structure of the magnifying glass <b>1</b> is stable, and mounting of the rotating shaft <b>3</b> is convenient. The frame <b>5</b> is a full frame structure, a half frame structure, or a partial frame structure, which is not limited thereto. Of course, it is not necessary to configure the frame <b>5</b>, and the rotating shaft <b>3</b> may be directly disposed on the magnifying glass <b>1</b>, or the rotating shaft <b>3</b> may be disposed on a mounting block disposed on the magnifying glass <b>1</b>. In the embodiment, as shown in the drawings, the frame <b>5</b> is a full frame, and the frame <b>5</b> comprises a front frame <b>6</b> and a rear frame <b>7</b>. The front frame <b>6</b> and the rear frame <b>7</b> are assembled together by fasteners or buckles. The front frame <b>6</b> and the rear frame <b>7</b> clamp the magnifying glass <b>1</b> to fix the magnifying glass <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Furthermore, the magnifying glass <b>1</b> is rectangular or quasi-rectangular. The rotating shaft <b>3</b> is disposed on a corner of the frame <b>5</b> or the rotating shaft is disposed on a corner of the magnifying glass <b>1</b>, which makes a structure layout reasonable, makes the magnifying glass <b>1</b> convenient to rotate. Thus, the magnifying glass <b>1</b> is switched between the horizontal position and the vertical position with respect to one side of the mounting seat <b>2</b> to match with the display screen of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Furthermore, a magnifying glass support portion is disposed on the mounting seat <b>2</b>. After the magnifier body is rotated horizontally and vertically, the magnifier body is then supported by the magnifying glass support portion, which makes a position of the magnifier body on the mounting seat <b>2</b> stable.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">There are many ways to design the magnifying glass support portion, such as using a support block or a support strip to hold the magnifying glass <b>1</b> (or the magnifying glass <b>1</b> and the frame <b>5</b>). In the embodiment, the bottom portion <b>11</b> of the receiving groove <b>10</b> is configured as the magnifying glass support portion, which will be explained in detail below.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, the mounting holes <b>4</b> are horizontal holes, so the rotating shaft <b>3</b> is able to move horizontally left and right in the mounting holes <b>4</b>. The magnifying glass <b>1</b> is rectangular or quasi-rectangular and the mounting holes <b>4</b> are horizontal holes, so when the rotating shaft <b>3</b> is mounted in the mounting holes <b>4</b>, the rotating shaft <b>3</b> is able to move horizontally left and right, which is convenient to use, and makes support effect of the mounting seat <b>2</b> on the magnifier body good. When in use, the magnifier body is connected with the mounting seat <b>2</b> and is supported by the mounting seat <b>2</b>. The magnifying glass <b>1</b> is rectangular or quasi-rectangular, which can well match the current display screen of the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Furthermore, the mounting seat <b>2</b> comprises a first mounting portion <b>8</b> and a second mounting portion <b>9</b>. A receiving groove <b>10</b> is defined between the first mounting portion <b>8</b> and the second mounting portion <b>9</b>. The mounting holes <b>4</b> comprises a first mounting hole defined on the first mounting portion <b>8</b> and a second mounting hole defined on the second mounting portion <b>9</b>. The rotating shaft <b>3</b> comprises shaft heads disposed on two sides of the magnifier body. The shaft heads are respectively disposed in the first mounting hole defined on the first mounting portion <b>8</b> and the second mounting hole defined on the second mounting portion <b>9</b>. The rotating shaft <b>3</b> is supported by the mounting holes <b>4</b> on front and rear sides and is movable along the mounting holes <b>4</b>, making the rotating shaft <b>3</b> running stably, and making the magnifier body rotating stably. As shown in the drawings, the first mounting portion <b>8</b> is a first plate, the second mounting portion <b>9</b> is a second plate, and the mounting holes <b>4</b> are specifically adopted as horizontal strip-shaped holes. In addition, a length of the mounting holes <b>4</b> is optimized so that when the rotating shaft <b>3</b> is leaning against left ends of the mounting holes, the magnifying glass <b>1</b> is just at the middle position after being turned to the right, and when the rotating shaft <b>3</b> abuts against right ends of the mounting holes, the magnifying glass <b>1</b> is at the middle position after being rotated clockwise.
