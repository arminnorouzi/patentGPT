However, this technology is currently limited by the resolution and core composition.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Briefly, a method for producing a flexible mold for casting a ceramic core is presented. From the flexible mold, a ceramic core for an investment casting may be produced. For the purposes of this disclosure, the term &#x2018;flexible&#x2019; as used herein, refers to a quick curable material such as a room temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicone rubber or other material which may be used to form the flexible mold which is not rigid like prior art metal molds, but that allows the mold to be bent and stretched to a degree in order to facilitate removal of the mold from a structure cast therein.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a flowchart depicting a method for producing a flexible mold is shown. In step <b>102</b>, routine <b>100</b> forms a consumable master tool by 3D-printing, the master tool having a negative surface geometry representative of the flexible mold to be produced. In step <b>104</b>, routine <b>100</b> produces the flexible mold from the master tool. In step <b>106</b>, routine <b>100</b> allows the flexible mold to cure. In step <b>108</b>, routine <b>100</b> removes the consumable master tool.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment, the consumable master tool is 3D printed from a printable wax. Development work has shown that printed wax may be effectively used as a master tool within a mold cavity to produce a flexible mold with integrity. In an embodiment, the master tool may be a multi-sided three-dimensional (3D) master tool in order to produce ceramic cores with intricate geometry and/or advanced features. When the ceramic core is used in an investment casting process to produce a final component, this intricate geometry and/or advanced features will be cast into the final component. In one such example, the 3D master tool includes a surface geometry corresponding to a turbine blade or vane. Advanced features on a turbine blade or vane, for example, may include detailed features such as trailing edge cooling holes.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> illustrate an embodiment of the proposed method to produce a flexible mold for casting a ceramic core. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the first three steps <b>200</b> of an embodiment of the proposed method are shown. In step <b>202</b>, a 3D printed consumable wax master tool <b>208</b> is formed. For exemplary purposes, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a simplified 2D representation of a 3D printed wax master tool <b>208</b> having a negative surface geometry representative of the flexible mold to be produced. The wax master tool <b>208</b> may be 3D printed using known 3D printing methods. A CAD file depicting the 3D geometry of the component to be produced may be utilized by the 3D printer to produce the printed consumable wax master tool <b>208</b>. It has been shown that 3D printed wax technology is the most dimensionally stable of the printed processes to date.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The printed consumable wax master tool <b>208</b> may be an insert for creating a surface in a flexible mold. Inserts may be utilized to further define a section of the geometry of the existing flexible mold surface. The inserts may include a bottom surface, side surface, and a top surface whose geometry includes a finer resolution or otherwise higher definition than the adjacent geometry of the existing flexible mold. The insert may be installed in correspondingly shaped cavities within the existing flexible mold and may be interchanged with other inserts in order to create alternate topography on the ceramic core.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another embodiment, the produced ceramic core may be a ceramic core insert inserted into a surface of a ceramic shell. The ceramic core insert may include a contoured geometry on a surface having fine details. The ceramic core insert may also include interlocking features on another surface intended to hold the ceramic core insert in place effectively to the ceramic shell after a shell dipping process. The attachment of ceramic core insert to the ceramic shell allows the core insert surface to become part of the ceramic shell. This contoured geometry may then be cast into a component.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In step <b>204</b>, the wax master tool <b>208</b> is placed in mold cavity <b>210</b>. A containment vessel <b>214</b> having mold cavity <b>210</b> may be obtained for containing the master tool <b>208</b> as well as a liquid mold material <b>212</b> for producing the flexible mold. The master tool <b>208</b> may be appropriately supported within the mold cavity <b>210</b>. While other shaped containment vessels may be utilized in the presented method, for ease of use, a box shaped containment vessel <b>214</b> is exemplified in the shown embodiment. Mold cavity <b>210</b> is configured to receive a flexible liquid mold material <b>212</b>. The flexible liquid mold material <b>212</b> may be a quick curable chemical compound such as silicone rubber. By situating the master tool <b>208</b> in the mold cavity <b>210</b> through suspension or another suitable means, the mold cavity <b>210</b> may be filled with the liquid mold material <b>212</b>, in a fluid state that will conform to the surface topography of the master tool <b>208</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In step <b>206</b>, the liquid mold material <b>212</b> may be poured into the mold cavity <b>210</b> until it is filled or partially filled and the master tool <b>208</b> is encapsulated by the liquid mold material <b>212</b> on the surfaces whose geometry is intended to be imparted in the flexible mold formed upon the curing of the liquid mold material <b>212</b>. The chemical compound is then allowed, step <b>106</b>, to cure, generally, by some thermodynamic and/or chemical process familiar to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the last three steps <b>300</b> of the proposed method are illustrated. Upon curing, the now solidified flexible mold <b>308</b> will yield a flexible mold capable of casting the external geometry of a ceramic core. In an embodiment, removing <b>108</b>, <b>302</b> the master tool <b>208</b> from the flexible mold <b>308</b> includes dissolving the printable wax. Alternately, the printable wax may be melted through heating means. In an embodiment, the master tool <b>208</b> is a two-sided master tool such that the geometry on each of the two sides may create two separate flexible opposing mold halves. The two-sided master tool <b>208</b> may have a similar geometry on each of the two sides or completely different geometry on each of the two sides.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">With the flexible mold <b>308</b> now produced (or inserted within an existing flexible mold), a ceramic core <b>312</b> may then be cast from the flexible mold <b>308</b>. In step <b>304</b>, a ceramic slurry is poured into the mold cavity <b>210</b>. In the embodiment where two separate opposing halves of a flexible mold <b>308</b> were created, the two separate opposing mold halves may be aligned to form a cavity capable of receiving the ceramic slurry <b>310</b>. The ceramic slurry <b>310</b> may be a liquid mixture including silica dioxide and solvent or other mixture familiar to those of skill in the art. The flexible mold <b>308</b> may be supported in an appropriate structure that may be the original containment vessel <b>214</b>, but also may be another suitable structure that can support the flexible mold <b>308</b> as well as the ceramic slurry <b>310</b>. The ceramic slurry <b>310</b> is allowed to cure generally by some thermodynamic and/or chemical process familiar to those skilled in the art. The flexible mold <b>308</b> may then be separated from the cured ceramic core <b>312</b>, thereby exposing the newly molded ceramic core <b>312</b>, itself in a &#x2018;green&#x2019; state. The &#x2018;green&#x2019; ceramic core <b>312</b> may then be subject to an industrial process know to those skilled in the art such as, for example, hand-detailing and kiln-firing and/or sintering. The ceramic core <b>312</b> is thus produced as shown by illustrated step <b>306</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The ceramic core thus produced is suitable for use in a conventional metal alloy casting process.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Those skilled in the art will be aware that the current methods employed to yield the geometry definition of the flexible mold topography is dependent on a machined master tool, conventionally cut or otherwise sculpted from a solid block of a raw metal such as aluminum. Such master tooling requires an extraordinary amount of time labor, and cost to produce and has limited flexibility in terms of the ability to implement alterations, repairs, or rework, without considerably impacting a typical budget and labor schedule. The methods disclosed reduce design time and eliminate the need to manufacture metal master tooling.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">While specific embodiments have been described in detail, those with ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that various modifications and alternatives to those details could be developed in light of the overall teachings of the disclosure. Accordingly, the particular arrangements disclosed are meant to be illustrative only and not limiting as to the scope of the invention, which is to be given the full breadth of the appended claims, and any and all equivalents thereof.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
