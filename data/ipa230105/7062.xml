They also relate to monitoring communications between participants of the primary conference to determine if a) participants have a disagreement that relates to a topic of the meeting or b) if a topic from the meeting agenda requires additional time for discussion, and if so, automatically creating a breakout conference and moving participants associated with a topic of the disagreement from the primary conference to the breakout conference.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conference calls are frequently used by individuals, groups, associations, and employees of various organizations. They are the backbone of a collaborative workplace, and when properly used, increase productivity and efficiency by allowing individuals to discuss various topics and develop solutions for moving forward in their respective roles and projects. They are especially useful when the collaboration occurs among people who are geographically separated from one another and between employees that work remotely thereby alleviating or minimizing the need to meet physically for discussing a topic that can be discussed over a conference call. In more recent times, there has been an explosion of conference call activity, especially during the 2019-2021 years of the Covid-19 pandemic, during which a mass number of individuals worked remotely and had the need to connect with their colleagues over a conference call to accomplish their job duties.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Although conference calls can be a useful mechanism to discuss various issues, unfortunately, there exist several issues with current conferencing methods that result in unproductive meetings, or in some instances, a waste of time. Since conference calling has become more easy and common through a variety of online conferencing options, such as Zoom, Google Meet&#x2122;, and Microsoft Teams&#x2122; individuals are spending more time than ever before on conference calls. (Google Meet is a trademark owned by Google LLC and Microsoft Teams is a trademark owned by Microsoft Corporation).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some reasons for unproductive conferences include lack of preparation among participants and poorly defined objectives. Among the many reasons, one of the common reasons for an unproductive conference include a disagreement/conflict between participants that derails the meeting and requires all other participants to halt discussion of their meeting topic until the disagreement is resolved. In some instances, the disagreement persists throughout the conference and takes up much needed time that was allocated for other topics on the meeting agenda to be discussed thereby resulting in the other topics not being discussed or being pushed to a subsequently scheduled meeting and delaying progress.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As such, there is a need for a better conferencing system and method to increase productivity during conference calls, especially when a disagreement occurs between its participants.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The various objects and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary system for creating and managing a primary and breakout conference, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary conference calling system, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of a conference device, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is block diagram for an exemplary primary conference call, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is block diagram for an exemplary breakout conference, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is flowchart of a process for generating a breakout conference for a primary conference, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is block diagram of categories for determining a disagreement, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is flowchart of a process for determining a disagreement between participants in the primary conference, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> is depicts an exemplary process of applying natural language processing and artificial intelligence to determine a disagreement and the context of the disagreement based on a voice input, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is a block diagram of a plurality of participants in a primary conference and their voice signals, in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> is a table of voice signal received over a time period, in accordance with some embodiments;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a table of conflict score that represents a sentiment of the participants in the primary conference, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is block diagram for a primary and multiple breakout conference sessions, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is an exemplary template of management and communication tools offered for selection to participants of either the breakout rooms or the primary conference, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with some embodiments disclosed herein, the above-mentioned limitations are overcome by automatically creating a breakout conference for the primary virtual conference for topics that result in a disagreement or topics that require additional discussion. The system allocates a time for the virtual breakout conference such that issues relating to the disagreement may be resolved within the allotted time. Participants involved in the disagreement, and participants that are associated with the topic of disagreement, are automatically selected by the system and moved to the virtual breakout conference either automatically or upon acceptance of a selectable option to move.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the method includes creating a primary conference and allowing a plurality of participants to join the primary conference. The primary conference, also referred to herein as main conference, main session, virtual conference, conference call, is a virtual conference calling session that may provide audio and/or video capabilities to its participants. The system obtains an agenda for the primary conference prior to its start time. The system uses the agenda to determine the topics to be covered in the primary conference and the amount of time allocated for each topic. In instances when an agenda is not available, or the topics for the agenda and allocated times are not available, then the system determines if historical data is available for a previous conference in which the same participants as the current primary conference attended the meeting. If so, to the extent discernable from the prior conference, the system uses an artificial intelligence algorithm to allocate amounts of time for each topic to be covered based on information gathered from the prior conference.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">During the primary conference, the system monitors all conversations between participants. The conversations are converted to text using a natural language processing algorithm. The system determines if speech/statement made by a participant relates to a topic included in the meeting agenda. If so, the system associates the speech with a topic in the agenda and determines the context of the statement made. As referred to here, speech, voice signal, voice input, statement, and dialog refer to speech made by a participant during the conference.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The system then monitors all subsequent statements made during the primary conference to determine if any subsequent statements made by other participants also relate to the same topic. If the system determines that the subsequent statements made by another participant relates to the same topic, then the system determines if the subsequent statement contextually conflicts or disagrees with the earlier statement. If so, the system determines that the participants that made the statements may have a disagreement with respect to the topic and a separate virtual breakout conference may be needed to resolve the disagreement such that the primary conference can continue with disruption due to the disagreement and other topics on the agenda can be covered. As referred to herein, conflict, disagreement, frustration, opposing view, are used interchangeably and refer to a participant disagrees with a statement made by another participant.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Since one conflicting statement may not rise to the level of a disagreement, in some embodiments, the system concludes that a disagreement exists only after a threshold number of disagreeing statements are made by the other participants. For example, in some instances a participant may make a suggestion, which sounds like a disagreement, such as &#x201c;you should also look into XYZ,&#x201d; and the participant is not persistently disagreeing. To avoid rushing into a breakout session without a disagreement, in some embodiments, the system may look for repeated disagreements to ensure that the disagreement warrants a separate breakout conference for resolution.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In other embodiments, the system uses various factors for determining if a disagreement exists. These factors include, determining if other participants' raise their voice at a high decibel levels, if the other participants' speech overlaps the participant speech who made the original statement, if the other participants' facial expressions, body language, tone, or behavior suggests a disagreement or frustration with the original statement, or if the job function of the other participant is such that their position is likely at odds with the job role and position of the participant who made the original statement and is likely to have a disagreement, and determination if the participants had a disagreement in previous meetings.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In other embodiments, a conflict score may be calculated. In this embodiment the system tracks the sentiment of the participants as the discussion in the primary conference progresses. If the sentiment reaches a negative conflict score that meets the negative sentiment threshold, then the system determines that a disagreement exists. Additional factors are described further in the application that may be used by the system to determine whether a disagreement exists.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Once a determination is made that a disagreement exists, the system automatically sets up a breakout conference that can be used by the participants that had the disagreement. The system seamlessly moves the participants involved in the disagreement, and any other participants that are associated with the topic of the disagreement, to the breakout conference. The move may be performed automatically or after the participants agree to the move.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As part of the move to the breakout conference, in some embodiments, the system accesses a human resources database to extract the profiles of each participant, their titles in the company, and their job roles. The system uses the profile information to designate a leader for the breakout conference (also referred to herein as breakout room, breakout session, secondary conference, and virtual breakout conference). For example, the system may select the participant with the senior most title or the participant that has ownership of the topic based on their job duties as the leader of the breakout conference.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">While in the breakout conference, in some embodiments, the system provides communication and management tools to the participants of the breakout conference. The communication and management tools allow the participants to track progress of the primary conference without having to leave their breakout conference. The tools also allow the participants in the breakout conference to communicate with the participants in the primary conference, such as, to answer any questions that relate to a participant in the breakout conference or to the topic of discussion, and to provide a summary of their progress to the participants in the primary conference, without having to leave the breakout session.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Once the time allocated for the breakout conference ends, the participants in the breakout session are seamlessly and automatically integrated back into the primary conference without the participants having to execute any commands for moving back to the primary conference. By providing the breakout conference capability, and the ability to communicate between sessions, the system allows the primary conference to progress productively without a delay that may have been caused due to the disagreement.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, and <b>2</b></figref> describe exemplary devices, systems, servers, and related hardware for creating and managing main/primary conference and virtual breakout conference sessions in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary system for creating and managing a primary and breakout conference, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.

The conference call session includes a total of 5 participants <b>310</b>, <b>315</b>, <b>317</b>, <b>320</b>, and <b>330</b>. In some embodiments the conference call may have a presenter, a leader, or a moderator. In other embodiments there may be a different number or participants and the conference call may not have a designated presenter or moderator and it may be a meeting where several participants discuss a plurality of topics.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the conference call session <b>300</b> includes a presenter, such as presenter <b>310</b>. The presenter may lead the meeting and facilitate the discussion of topics in the agenda <b>325</b>. The presenter may use an electronic device, such as electronic device <b>321</b>, to manage the conference session <b>300</b>, to communicate with other participants, and select conferencing options available for the conference session <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the electronic device <b>321</b> may include a graphic user interface having a display. The system, such as the system depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, through its control circuitry, may cause the display on the graphic user interface which includes the title and agenda <b>325</b> of the meeting. The title and the agenda may be obtained from a plurality of sources. For example, a document containing that meeting title and the topics of agenda may have been circulated to the participants of the meeting. The title and agenda may also we obtained through a scheduler, calendar, or a meeting invite dot lists the title and the agenda of the meeting. In some embodiments, the title and agenda may be uttered by one of the participants during the conference call and the system, by applying natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms may determine the topic and agenda based on analyzing the uttered speech.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The control circuitry may also cause to display on the graphic user interface, a conferencing option for creating a breakout conference as needed. The control circuitry, as used herein in refers to control circuitry <b>128</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and/or control circuitry <b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For ease discussion, control circuitry <b>204</b> will be used in the embodiments below, however, both control circuitry <b>128</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and/or control circuitry <b>204</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one example, as depicted in block <b>340</b>, control circuitry may cause to display on the graphical user interface, an option to the presenter <b>310</b>, to generate a breakout room 1 (<b>340</b>) for facilitating conversations or disagreements relating to a particular topic. As described further in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the breakout conference may be created automatically when the control circuitry <b>204</b> determines, such as through use of AI algorithms, that a particular topic that is part of the agenda <b>325</b> requires further attention, requires grouping of certain participants for further discussion, or has conflicting views that may need to be resolved in a separate breakout conference such that the primary conferencing session <b>300</b> can proceed without delays. Several categories may be analyzed by the control circuitry <b>204</b> to determine whether a particular topic requires further discussion, is the basis for a disagreement, or has conflicting views that require a breakout conference. Some exemplary categories analyzed to determine if a disagreement exists are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The control circuitry <b>204</b> may also cause to display on the graphic user interface, a list of attendees or conference participants that should discuss the disagreed upon topic in the breakout room 1. The attendee list for the breakout room may be generated through a plurality of techniques and may be based on a variety of factors. For example, an AI algorithm may detect that two people out of a group of five participants have a disagreement on a particular topic.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, all the participants may have a graphic user interface on their electronic device and in other embodiments they may be dialing into the conference using a phone system that does not have a graphic user interface. The embodiments described herein apply to both type of electronic devices.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As depicted, the control circuitry <b>204</b> displays the meeting agenda to both participant 1 and 4 on their electronic device's graphic user interface. It may also audibly provide the agenda if the participant's device does not include a display. The exemplary agenda displayed on the electronic devices of the participants may include the topics &#x201c;Design,&#x201d; &#x201c;Testing,&#x201d; &#x201c;Marketing,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Sales.&#x201d; The exemplary time for the primary conference session <b>300</b> to cover the listed topics in the agenda may be 1-hour.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, participant 1 (John) and participant 4 (Sally) are discussing thermal testing, which is the second topic on the agenda. During the conference session <b>300</b>, John may ask a question using his audio input equipment (e.g., headset) or speak into a microphone of the electronic device. In this example, John spoke and stated that &#x201c;We will need to do thermal testing in June 15<sup>th </sup>week.&#x201d; In response to John's statement relating to thermal testing, Sally may have responded using her audio input equipment (e.g., headset) or spoke into a microphone of her electronic device. In this example, Sally spoke and stated that &#x201c;Not possible. Testing room is already booked that week.&#x201d; John and Sally's discussion relates to meeting agenda item &#x201c;Testing&#x201d; that is listed in the agenda <b>325</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some embodiments, the control circuitry <b>204</b> may deploy natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to convert their speech to text and then analyze the context of their discussion. The AI algorithm may detect that since John and Sally have different views on testing schedules for the week of June 15<sup>th </sup>and as such it is better, they discuss scheduling issues in a separate breakout conference. As such the control circuitry may receive the data from AI algorithm and automatically set up a break room 1 such that both John and Sally can discuss the topic of thermal testing separate from the conference session <b>300</b>. Moving John and Sally's disagreement to a separate breakout conference allows other topics on the meeting agenda be covered by the remaining participants.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, the system, through its control circuitry <b>204</b>, may be provided access to a plurality of databases and systems of the company. In this example, the participants <b>310</b>, <b>315</b>, <b>317</b>, <b>320</b>, which include John and Sally, work for the company and are having a work-related meeting. Since the system may have access to employee databases, such as human resources database, the system may also have access to each employee's title, their job function, and their profile.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In this example, the system may determine that Sally is senior to John and holds a higher position in the company. As such, the control circuitry <b>204</b> may provide an option on the graphical user interface of Sally's electronic device, who is senior to John, to approve a separate breakout conference such that John and Sally can discuss the thermal testing topic. Since Sally is at a higher position that John, the system may provide the option to approve the creating of the breakout conference only on Sally's electronic device and not on John's electronic device. In other embodiments, both John and Sally may be provided the option to accept breaking out to a separate virtual breakout conference for discussing thermal testing. In yet another embodiment, the system may automatically move John and Sally to breakout room 1 without seeking their approval.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The control circuitry <b>204</b> may automatically create the breakout conference at any time during conference session <b>300</b>. It may also create the breakout conference prior to the start of the meeting if the AI algorithm determines that a disagreement or a deeper discussion on a topic is likely to occur. For example, the AI algorithm may predict a disagreement based on prior meetings or may predict a disagreement based on John and Sally's positions in the company, such as John might be a test engineer who usually needs to test products before launch and Sally might be the director of the testing lab that overseas all testing and testing schedules for various products in the company and that the two roles are usually at conflict with each other.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Although only two participants in this example are presented with a recommendation to move to a breakout conference, the embodiments are not so limited and allow any number of participants in the meeting to move to a breakout conference. In a scenario where all the participants are involved in discussing to particular topic or involved in a disagreement relating to a particular topic, then a separate breakout room is not created.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram for an exemplary breakout conference, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. The breakout room 1 (<b>410</b>), where the breakout conference is held, is a virtual room that is automatically created by the control circuitry <b>204</b>. The breakout room 1 (<b>410</b>) includes John <b>315</b> and Sally <b>320</b>, the two participants from the primary conferencing session <b>300</b> that had a disagreement relating to the topic of thermal testing.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In this embodiment, based on the total time allocated for the primary conferencing session <b>300</b>, the control circuitry <b>204</b> determines the time allocated for discussing the topic (thermal testing) and sets a timer in the breakout room 1 such that the participants of the breakout room 1 are aware of the amount of time they have been allotted to discuss the topic and then return to the primary conference <b>300</b>. In some embodiments, the amount of time allotted in the agenda <b>325</b> for discussing this topic is 20 minutes. As such, the control circuitry <b>204</b> may cause a timer to be displayed in the virtual breakout room 1 showing the amount of time remaining within the allotted 20 minutes to finish discussion of the topic. As depicted, from the 20 minutes allotted for discussing this topic, 11:14 remains.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The control circuitry <b>204</b> may provide additional communication and management tools <b>30</b> and <b>440</b> to the attendees in the breakout room 1 as depicted in pop up block <b>420</b>. For example, the attendees in breakout room 1 may be able to monitor and track the progress of the primary conference <b>300</b> as depicted in block <b>430</b>. The control circuitry <b>204</b> may provide a selectable option to the attendees <b>315</b> and <b>320</b> to accept the tracking of the primary conference call or ignore the tracking of the primary conference call. If accepted, the attendees while in a separate breakout room 1 may be able to track the progress of topics in the primary conference session <b>300</b>. In addition to tracking progress of the main/primary conference call, tracking may include a summary of topics discussed while the breakout conference in breakout room 1 is in progress.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The control circuitry <b>204</b> may also allow the attendees of breakout room 1 (<b>410</b>) to communicate and send a message through a communication tool <b>440</b> to the primary conference attendees in primary conference session <b>300</b>. For example, if the AI detects a question in the primary conference session <b>300</b> that relates to either John, Sally, or the topic of thermal testing, the control circuitry <b>204</b> may present the question as a pop-up display in breakout room 1 and allow the attendees of breakout room 1 to respond to the question. The attendees of breakout room 1 may also send other types of communications and messages to the attendees of the primary conference session <b>300</b>, such as keeping them informed of the progress being made in breakout room 1 (<b>410</b>), or that they need extra time to finish discussing the topic. The communication tool may allow back and forth messaging between the two separate sessions, i.e., the primary conferencing session <b>300</b> and the breakout conference session <b>410</b>, without the attendees having to leave their respective sessions to communicate or answer a quick question.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The control circuitry <b>204</b> may audibly alert the participants of the breakout room 1 (<b>410</b>) when the breakout conference is about to end or has ended. The control circuitry <b>204</b> may automatically switch the attendees of the breakout conference back into the primary conferencing session <b>300</b> once the timer has expired. As such transitioning from the primary/main conferencing section <b>300</b> to the breakout room 1 (<b>410</b>) and then back to the primary conferencing session <b>300</b> once the breakout conference has ended is performed seamlessly by the control circuitry <b>204</b> without the attendees having to perform steps to create the separate virtual breakout room or having to perform actions to rejoin the primary conferencing section <b>300</b>. At most, in some embodiments, the control circuitry <b>204</b> may present options to the attendees to either approve or reject the creation of the breakout room and the movement from one session to the other. Additionally, the control circuitry <b>204</b> may also allow the participants to add or delete additional participants to the breakout conference on an as needed basis.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is flowchart of a process for generating a breakout conference for a primary conference, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. The process <b>500</b> includes, at block <b>510</b>, capturing a plurality of voice signals during a primary conference call, such as the primary conference call in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In another embodiment, the process may also capture video, images, gestures, chat comments, and other body language and behaviors of the participant, or group of participants, using cameras associated with, or connected to, the conferencing equipment and/or the electronic device used during the conference.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">At block <b>520</b>, the control circuitry <b>204</b>, using NLP and/or AI algorithms, may analyze the captured voice signals from each participant. In another embodiment a closed caption file may be created based on the voice input, i.e., uttered words, phrases, and statements, from each participant. The AI algorithm may analyze the voice signals or the closed caption file to determine whether a disagreement exists. For example, the AI algorithm may determine if any negative comments were uttered between participants during the conference that indicate a disagreement. The AI algorithm may also look at other categories, such as categories described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, to determine if a disagreement exists with respect to a particular topic or if the topic needs additional discussion, and if so, whether a separate breakout conference may be created.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">If at block <b>540</b> a determination is made that a disagreement exists, or that a particular topic needs additional discussion, then the process proceeds to block <b>550</b> where the AI algorithm determines the topic of the disagreement. For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, John and Sally disagree on a schedule for thermal testing, as such, the AI algorithm would determine that the topic of thermal testing needs resolution and both John and Sally currently have conflicting views for the testing schedule.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">At block <b>560</b>, the AI algorithm determines the participants that are involved in the disagreement. In some embodiments there may be two participants that disagree with each other on a particular topic. In other embodiments, there may be a few participants that agree on a direction for the topic and a few participants that have a different direction for the topic. The system may also group participants that agree into a separate breakout session such that they may discuss the topic in further details such that they can present more convincing point to those participants that disagree with their position.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In addition to determining the participants for the breakout conference, the control circuitry <b>204</b> may also assign a leader for the breakout conference. In some embodiments, the system may be provided access to a plurality of databases and systems that are associated with the participants in the primary conference session <b>300</b>. For example, in a corporate setting, the system may be provided access to human resources databases, databases that store information relating to meetings, and information relating to employee titles, job descriptions, and org charts. The control circuitry <b>204</b> may access relevant databases to determine each participant's title, role, and job description, and use such information to determine the leader for each breakout conference. Accordingly, the control circuitry <b>204</b> may pick the person with the most seniority, or the highest title, or authority over a topic, to lead the breakout conference. In another embodiment the system may determine that a participant who is not the most senior person but the most knowledgeable person on a particular topic to be the leader.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The control circuitry <b>204</b> at block <b>570</b> may automatically create one or more virtual breakout rooms where a virtual breakout conference can be hld. It may also determine participants connected with the disagreement that need to move to the virtual breakout conference to resolve their disagreement. In a scenario where 3 participants agree on a first direction for the topic and a 4<sup>th </sup>participant disagrees with the first direction and proposes a second direction for the topic, the control circuitry <b>204</b> may decide to create a virtual breakout conference room for the 3 participants that agree on the first direction such that they may further discuss the first direction and present a full solution to convince the 4th person. In another embodiment may create a virtual breakout room such that all four participants may discuss the topic and resolve their concerns.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Once a breakout conference is created, which may be in real time, the system through its control circuitry <b>204</b> may provide a selectable option on the graphic user interface of the participants that are going to discuss the topic in the breakout conference. The selectable option may allow the participants to either approve the breakout conference or reject the option to create a separate breakout conference for discussion of the topic. In some embodiments, the system may provide the selectable option only to the most senior person that will be leading the breakout conference. In another embodiment the selectable option may be provided to all the participants that will be involved in the breakout conference. In yet another embodiment, the system may automatically move the participants to the breakout conference without seeking their approval.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">At block <b>580</b>, the system may provide meeting tools to the participants in the virtual breakout conference. In some embodiment, one of the tools provided in the breakout conference may be a breakout conference timer. Since the control circuitry <b>204</b> may have access to the agenda <b>325</b>, the control circuitry <b>204</b> may determine the amount of time allocated for each topic in the agenda. For example, if a particular topic has 20 minutes allocated to it, then the control circuitry <b>204</b> may start at 20-minute timer and display it on all participants electronic devices such that they can keep track of time while discussing the topic in the breakout conference. In another embodiment, if a time has not been allocated for the topic of the breakout conference, then the control circuitry <b>204</b>, using an AI algorithm, may determine a time for the breakout conference based on the discussion of the topic in previous meetings or in the primary conference. In yet another embodiment, the control circuit may allocate a time for the breakout conference and allow the participants to modify the allocated time as needed.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some embodiments, another meeting tool provided in the breakout conference may be the option to track the progress of the primary/main conference <b>300</b> while the participants are in the breakout conference. The tracking may allow the participants to keep track of the progress being made in the primary conference section <b>300</b>. For example, if in the primary conference session, the discussion has moved to the next topic, then the participants in the breakout room may use that information to perform necessary actions, such as end the breakout conference early so they can get back to the primary conference or ask for additional time to discuss the topic in the breakout conference.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Yet another meeting tool provided by the control circuitry <b>204</b> may be the ability to communicate with the participants in the main/primary conference session <b>300</b>. The participants may use the communication tool to provide an update of the breakout conference, answer any questions that may come up in the primary conference section <b>300</b>, or provide any other communications to participants of the primary conference session <b>300</b>. As such, the communication tool may allow back and forth communication between the primary conference session <b>300</b> and a breakout conference without the participants having to leave their respective sessions.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">At block <b>590</b>, the system may automatically move the participants from the breakout room to the primary conference session <b>300</b>. The system may perform the move when the timer ends or when a participant in the breakout conference ends the breakout conference. In another embodiment, the system may provide a selectable option to the participants of the breakout conference to approve the move to the primary conference session <b>300</b>, and, upon receiving an approval through the selectable option, move the participants to the primary conference without the participants having to perform any additional actions for executing the move.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is block diagram of categories for determining a disagreement, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. The control circuitry <b>204</b> may analyze one or more categories depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, such as by using an AI algorithm, to determine if a disagreement between participants exists. If a determination is made by the control circuitry <b>204</b> that a disagreement exists, then the control circuitry <b>204</b>, by using the AI algorithm, may determine the topic of the disagreement and the participants involved in the disagreement such that it may automatically create a virtual breakout conference and move the participants involved in the disagreement to the breakout conference.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">As depicted in block <b>610</b>, negations are one of the exemplary categories that may be analyzed by the control circuitry <b>204</b>, such as by using an AI algorithm, to determine if a disagreement exists with respect to a particular topic or if the topic needs additional discussion, and if so, whether a separate breakout conference may be created. As used herein, negations include disagreements, different opinions, comments that counter and provide an opposing or a different view of the prior statements, or words that express frustrations.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In this example, an NLP algorithm may convert the speech/voice input of each participant into a textual format such that may be analyzed using an AI algorithm. The AI algorithm may use process <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> to determine if there is a disagreement between two participants of the conference session.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some embodiments, the process <b>700</b> may begin at block <b>710</b>, where the AI algorithm monitors voice input by all participants in the primary conference session. At block <b>710</b>, a first statement made by a first participant is analyzed. The analysis includes determining the context and the topic of the statement. The analysis also determines whether the statement requires a response from another participant.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">At block <b>720</b>, the AI algorithm is used by the control circuitry <b>204</b> to analyze statements made by a second participant of the conference call. The analysis includes determining the context and the topic of the statement. The AI algorithm may analyze words, phrases, and context of both statements from the first and second participants to determine if the statements relate to each other and if the second statement negates the first statement. The AI algorithm may be used to determine if a word, phrase, or comment is a negation or a different point of view. The control circuitry may access dictionaries and other resources that can aid the AI algorithm in determining if the response negates the earlier statement. Negations may include words and phrases such as, &#x201c;no,&#x201d; &#x201c;not,&#x201d; &#x201c;does not work,&#x201d; &#x201c;cannot,&#x201d; and other variations that disagree with the statements made by the first participant. In other embodiments, the AI algorithm may be used to determine the context of the comment made by the second participant to determine if it negates or provides a different opinion on the topic of the statement made by the first participant. For example, the second participant may utter phrases such as &#x201c;that could work, but a better way of doing that is,&#x201d; or &#x201c;maybe we should try,&#x201d; &#x201c;we tried that last time,&#x201d; which may need to be analyzed based on the context of the discussion to determine whether the statements negate the prior statement thereby creating a disagreement.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">At block <b>730</b>, the AI algorithm is used by the control circuitry <b>204</b> to determine if the number of negations or counter statements meet a threshold number. The threshold may be a predetermined number that is determined by the system or the user and may be used to ensure that the negations in fact create a disagreement and is not simply another view or comment that does not rise to the degree of a disagreement that needs a separate breakout conference to be resolved. Since not all negations in a conversation rise to the level of a disagreement, the control circuitry may explore the negations in light of the context and also analyze the degree of the negation, such as a strong disagreement or a minor negation or comment that does not create a disagreement, to explore breakout conference creating options.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">One example of applying natural language processing and artificial intelligence (AI) at blocks <b>720</b> and <b>730</b> is provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>. In this example each voice input from a participant is provided to an NLP engine that has instructions stored therein, or in a separate database, to run a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, the NLP algorithm uses various speech processing techniques to convert the voice input into text and, determine relevance of each word, and select keywords that are indicative of the context of the voice input. In some embodiments the NLP algorithm (or the artificial intelligence algorithm) can determine the most relevant portions of the voice input, such as relevant text, text strings, tags, timing of the words, and relationship to the topic in the meeting agenda. For example, in a statement &#x201c;what is the temperature used for the test,&#x201d; the NLP algorithm may select key words &#x201c;temperature&#x201d; and &#x201c;test&#x201d; that is representative of the context of the voice input and feed them to the artificial intelligence engine that runs an AI algorithm.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The AI algorithm may then contextually make sense of the statement, such as by using off the shelf speech analysis software, and relate each keyword or voice input to a topic of the meeting agenda. In another example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, the AI engine, executing instructions to apply an AI algorithm, may contextually relate one voice input with another voice input. For example, it may relate the voice input &#x201c;its 400 degrees F.&#x201d; to be contextually related and associate as a response to an earlier voice input &#x201c;what is the temperature used for the test.&#x201d; Likewise, the AI algorithm may detect that voice input &#x201c;That will not work&#x201d; is a negation and is contextually related to a prior voice input &#x201c;We need to do the test next week.&#x201d; The AI algorithm may also use external resources, such as a library database that can be used by the AI algorithm to make word associations and determine whether a word or phrase is associated with a disagreement or negation. The AI algorithm may also use off the shelf speech processing and other tools to determine if a word/phrase can be considered as a negation or disagreement.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, if a determination is made at block <b>730</b>, that the number of negations or counter statements meet the threshold number, then at block <b>740</b> the control circuitry <b>204</b> automatically creates a virtual breakout conference to resolve the disagreement. In another embodiment, when the number of negations or counter statements does not meet the threshold number, however the control circuitry <b>204</b>, through the use of AI algorithm, determines that the negation is strong enough, has a diametrically opposite view, or is stated in a manner that creates a disagreement, then the control circuitry may conclude that a disagreement exists and create the separate breakout conference.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Additionally, at block <b>730</b>, if the number of negations or counter statements do not meet a threshold number, and the negation is not strong enough to rise to the level of a conflict, then the control circuitry <b>204</b> continues to monitor the conversations in the primary conference <b>300</b> and evaluate each statement in response to the statement and follow the process from block <b>710</b> onwards.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">At block <b>750</b>, once a decision has been made to create a breakout conference, then the control circuitry <b>204</b>, which has access to a plurality of systems or databases, determines the leader for the breakout conference based on the employee profiles or other information that indicates which of the participants for the breakout session is senior to others or has the responsibility of the topic.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, as depicted in block <b>615</b>, &#x201c;Questions asked/Comments made&#x201d; is one of the exemplary categories that may be analyzed by the control circuitry <b>204</b>, such as by using an AI algorithm, to determine if a disagreement exists with respect to a particular topic or if the topic needs additional discussion, and if so, whether a separate breakout conference may be created. There may be questions asked during the primary conference or comments made such as &#x201c;we should take that offline,&#x201d; or &#x201c;that is going to need some more time,&#x201d; &#x201c;let's table that discussion for next time,&#x201d; &#x201c;we need to get Bob on the call to answer that question,&#x201d; that are not necessarily negations or disagreements but may require either additional time for discussion of the topic or require additional participants that may not be part of the primary conference. The control circuitry <b>204</b>, using AI algorithm, may determine that such discussions that need additional time or additional participants can be broken out from the current primary conference session such that they may be discussed separately. In such situations, the control circuitry <b>204</b> may present a selectable option to the attendees, where the selectable options may allow the control circuitry <b>204</b> to create a breakout conference either during the primary conference call or schedule it at a later time. If the breakout session is to be created during the conference time and requires additional participants, the control circuitry <b>204</b> may present a selectable option to the current participants such that if selected, the control circuitry <b>204</b> may in real time contact the other participants that are not part of the current meeting and ask them to join the breakout conference. Accordingly, the control circuitry <b>204</b> may automatically set up a breakout conference and move those participants that are involved in discussing the topic, and seamlessly integrate additional participants that are needed for the breakout conference but were not part of the primary conference session into the breakout conference. The control circuitry may also provide limited access to the additional participants added such that they are provided access only to the breakout conference.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">As depicted in block <b>620</b>, decibel levels of the participants may be monitored and analyzed by the control circuitry <b>204</b>, such as by using an AI algorithm, to determine if a disagreement exists with respect to a particular topic or if the topic needs additional discussion, and if so, whether a separate breakout conference may be created. In some embodiments, the control circuitry <b>204</b> monitors the decibel levels during the primary conference session and calculates an average decibel level. In a typical conversation, when there's a conflict, disagreement, or a heated argument the volume of the participant's speech may increase to a higher decibel level. As such, if the decibel level exceeds the average decibel level by a threshold amount during the conference call, then a determination is made whether the higher decibel level is associated with a disagreement or a heated discussion. If the control circuitry <b>204</b> determines that the higher decibel level is associated with a disagreement, then a separate virtual breakout room is automatically created and either a recommendation is provided to the attendees involved in the disagreement to move to the breakout conference or the system may automatically move them to the breakout room without seeking their approval.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> depict a situation when a higher decibel level may be captured and associated with a disagreement.

If decibel level associated with participant P1's voice signal <b>810</b> is taken as an average decibel level for the conversation, then, in some exemplary embodiments, as depicted by voice signal <b>820</b>, participant P2 has a higher decibel level associated with their voice signal as compared to the average decibel level. If P2's decibel level exceeds the average decibel level by a threshold number, then the control circuitry <b>204</b> may determine that P2's decibel level is associated with a disagreement and the control circuitry <b>204</b> may automatically create a separate virtual breakout conference. The control circuitry may also include participant P2 and anyone else from the primary conference session that is also involved with the same topic for which P2's decibel level was raised to the breakout conference.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">As depicted in block <b>625</b>, overlapping voice signals of the participants speaking over each other are analyzed by the control circuitry <b>204</b>, such as by using an AI algorithm, to determine if a disagreement exists with respect to a particular topic or if the topic needs additional discussion, and if so, whether a separate breakout conference may be created. When a conflict, disagreement, or a heated argument takes place in a conversation, it is typical for participants to speak over each other to get their point across. As such, if the control circuitry <b>204</b> determines that multiple voice signals overlap each other, then a determination is made whether the overlapping voice signals are associated with a disagreement or a heated discussion. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, which is a table of voice signals captured for each of the participants P1-P6 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, at time t=2, participants P2 and P4 have overlapping voice signals <b>860</b>.

In some embodiments, the control circuitry <b>204</b> may access a camera associated with either the conferencing equipment or the electronic device used by a participant during the conferencing session. For example, the participant may be using a laptop that includes a camera, or the participant may be in a conference room which has a separate camera that is associated with the conferencing equipment, or the participant may be using a mobile phone or a tablet that includes a camera. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, the control circuitry <b>204</b>, accessing a camera, make capture an image of participant P3.

The control circuitry <b>204</b> made determine the topic of discussion at the time the image of P3 is captured and determine that a separate breakout conference is needed due to P3's frustration with the topic. If the control circuitry <b>204</b> determines that the facial expressions of P3 are associated with a disagreement, then a separate virtual breakout room may be automatically created and P3 and at least one more participant who is involved in the discussion of the same topic may be invited to move to the separate virtual breakout room to further discuss the topic or the system may automatically move them to the breakout conference without seeking their approval.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In addition to facial expressions, the camera may also capture a participant's body language, as depicted in block <b>635</b>.

In some embodiments, the participant may utter the same words and phrases repeatedly and in other embodiments the participant may utter other words and phrases that contextually convey the same point in an attempt to convey their position to others that disagree with their position. If the control circuitry <b>204</b> determines that a participant's repeated words or repeated language contextually conveys the same point, then the control circuitry <b>204</b> may determine whether the repetition is associated with a disagreement. Since not every repetition is associated with the disagreement, the AI will determine if the repetition is associated contextually with a disagreement. If a determination is made by the control circuitry <b>204</b> that a disagreement exists, then the control circuitry <b>204</b> may automatically create a separate virtual breakout conference and either a recommendation is presented to the attendees involved in the disagreement to approve a move to the breakout conference or the system may automatically move them to the breakout conference without seeking their approval.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">As depicted in block <b>645</b>, a closed caption of the speech uttered by the plurality of participants may be generated by the control circuitry <b>204</b>.

If the sentiment is negative, a threshold may be established and if the threshold value is met then a separate breakout conference may be generated by the control circuitry <b>204</b> for discussing the topic relating to the sentiment.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the control circuitry <b>204</b>, using the AI algorithm, may perform a sentiment analysis.

The AI algorithm may analyze the statement to determine whether it is a positive or a negative statement, i.e., whether a participant agrees or disagrees with the position taken with respect to a topic. The control circuitry <b>204</b> may monitor a sentiment value for each topic separately. A positive statement which agrees with the prior statement may be scored positively as a +1 and a negative statement scored as a &#x2212;1.

Likewise participant P2 statements are also analyzed by the AI algorithm. As depicted, participant P2 disagrees with the concept of pricing the product at $50 USD, as such, a conflict score of &#x2212;1 is given based on P2 statements. The control circuitry <b>204</b> keeps her running score of the sentiment as. Since P2's disagreement cancels out P1's agreement, the total sentiment score after P2's disagreement is 0. In addition to statements, control circuitry <b>204</b> may also analyze facial expressions and body language when performing a sentiment analysis. Since P3's body language suggests that P3 is frustrated with the pricing, the AI algorithm may analyze P3's body language in context with the conversation and determine whether P3's body language should be associated with an agreement or a disagreement with respect to the $50 USD target price for the product. As depicted, P3's body language is associated with a disagreement and ask such given a &#x2212;1 conflict score. The control circuitry <b>204</b> may also set a predetermined threshold for a negative sentiment value.

For example, if one of the participants of the conference session is in marketing and their job title and duties relate to ensuring that the product gets released to the public quickly and another participant of the conference session is in product testing and their job title and role lends to making sure the product is not released until it is thoroughly tested, then the AI algorithm may determine that the two participants may be at odds with respect to a topic of product release, the speed at which the product is released, and product release schedule. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the control circuitry may analyze the job title and job role of the participants using the AI algorithm prior to the start of the meeting.

The timer may allow participants of one conference to monitor the progress of another conference.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In some embodiments, the meeting tools allow the participants from the primary conference to receive alerts <b>1160</b> from the breakout conference(s) and allow the participants from the breakout conference to receive alerts <b>1160</b> from the primary conference or from another breakout conference without having to leave their respective conference. The control circuitry <b>204</b> may be configured to provide an alert from one conference to another conference, for example if a participant in another conference mentions a name of the participant that is currently in another conference. In this example, the participant whose name is mentioned may be alerted and notified such that they may respond to a question, or a comment related to them. Other alerts, such as a mention of a topic may also be configured such that a participant associated with that topic is alerted if the topic is brought up in another conference. For example, a participant who is currently in a breakout conference in breakout room 2 (<b>1030</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> and is responsible for thermal testing may be alerted if either their name or the mention of thermal testing comes up in either the primary conference <b>1000</b> or in the breakout conference <b>1020</b>. In such instances, the participant may be alerted and notified of the topic and subtopic being discussed, the context in which their name or topic was mentioned, and if there is a pending question relating to the participant or the topic thereby allowing the participant to answer a question or post a comment without having to leave their respective conference.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In some embodiments, the meeting tools allow the participants of either the primary conference or breakout conference to add a participant <b>1170</b> to their conference without having to separately contact a participant that was not originally part of the conference. In other embodiments, the meeting tools allow adding a participant from the primary conference to the breakout conference who was not originally moved to the breakout conference.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">When adding a participant that was not originally part of either the primary of breakout conference, the control circuitry <b>204</b> may automatically contact and add the needed participant to a conference where their input is needed or ask for their approval prior to being added.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">In some embodiments, the meeting tools allow the participants from the primary conference to receive automated updates <b>1180</b> from the breakout conference(s) without having to leave the primary conference.
