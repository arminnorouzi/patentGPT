Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, the present invention relates to a device, system, and method for subsea piston accumulators utilized with blowout preventers in oil and gas well operations. More particularly, the present invention provides an improved accumulator system by including pressure sensors for the gas bottle and a positioning sensor system for the piston in the hydraulic bottle of subsea accumulators.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As known in the art, a blowout preventer is a large, specialized valve or similar mechanical device, usually installed redundantly in stacks, used to seal, control, and monitor oil and gas wells. Blowout preventers were developed to cope with extreme erratic pressures and uncontrolled flow, often referred to as a formation kick, emanating from a well reservoir during drilling. Kicks can lead to a potentially catastrophic event known as a blowout. In addition to controlling the downhole pressure occurring in the drilled hole and the flow of oil and gas, blowout preventers are intended to prevent tubing such as drill pipe and well casing, tools, and drilling fluid from being blown out of the wellbore when a blowout threatens.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A typical subsea deep-water blowout preventer system includes hydraulic accumulators module that maintains the hydraulic fluid pressures needed to actuate valves on the blowout preventer. A subsea accumulator stores hydraulic fluid under pressure and must release the hydraulic fluid on demand to provide fast closure of the preventers and for cycling all critical components. The fluid to be pressurized is typically an oil-based product or a water based product with added lubricity and corrosion protection and are generally stored in what is referred to as the hydraulic bottle. Accumulators with a piston typically have a piston sliding up and down a seal bore to separate the fluid from the gas.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is also known that a depth compensated piston accumulator must maintain a constant working fluid pressure in the working fluid chamber at any depth. At the surface, the nitrogen chamber is charged to a specific pressure, which exerts a force on top of the piston, which in turn pressurizes the working hydraulic fluid on the other side of the piston. As the accumulator is lowered deeper into the ocean, the ambient seawater pressure squeezes the hydraulic fluid in the bladder to the same pressure. This seawater pressure from the bladder is exerted on top of the piston in the seawater chamber. Essentially, all of the pressure force that is lost from the nitrogen due to the increased water pressure in very deep water is regained by directing that ambient pressure to the seawater chamber.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Blowout preventers are obviously extremely critical to well operations. Thus, there is a need for an apparatus, process, and or system that provides a system to monitor the pressure in the nitrogen tank and piston position in the hydraulic tank for use with a subsea piston accumulator. It is desirable to fill these needs with reliable technology that are affordable and attractive to accumulator operations associated with blowout preventers. The above discussed limitations in the prior art are not exhaustive. The current invention provides an inexpensive, time saving, more reliable apparatus, method, and system where the prior art fails.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of accumulators utilized with blowout preventers now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new and improved apparatus, system, and method of use that provides better accumulator performance. As such, the general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new and improved sensor system for use with subsea piston accumulators for blowout preventers, which has all the advantages of the prior art devices and none of the disadvantages.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is, therefore, contemplated that the present invention is an apparatus, system, and method for improved subsea piston accumulators by providing a first pressure sensor at the top of an accumulator nitrogen bottle and a second pressure sensor at the bottom. This may provide accurate information on the bottle's performance as well as a warning if pressures are too high or too low. It is also contemplated to provide a piston positioning sensor in the hydraulic bottle for determining the piston position relative to function. This may also provide a warning if the position of the piston is not optimal.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated.
