In the following description, although examples of the embodiment of the present disclosure will be described, the present disclosure is not limited to the examples. In the following description, although examples of specific numerical values and materials may be illustrated, other numerical values and materials may be applied as long as the advantageous effects of the present disclosure can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Flat Non-Aqueous Electrolyte Secondary Battery</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">A first flat non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure and a second flat non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery according to another exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure will be described below. In the following description, the first flat non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery may be referred to as a &#x201c;first secondary battery&#x201d;, and the second flat non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery may be referred to as a &#x201c;second secondary battery&#x201d;. In one view point, the first secondary battery and the second secondary battery represent a battery of the present disclosure from different viewpoints. Accordingly, at least a portion of the battery included in the first secondary battery and at least a portion of the battery included in the second secondary battery overlap with each other.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Items Common to First Secondary Battery and Second Secondary Battery</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Each of the first and second secondary batteries (flat non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries) includes a case having a flat shape, a positive electrode plate, a negative electrode plate, a separator, and a non-aqueous electrolyte. The positive electrode plate, the negative electrode plate, the separator and the non-aqueous electrolyte are disposed in the case. The positive electrode plate includes three or more positive electrode units aligned and connected to one another. The negative electrode plate includes three or more negative electrode units aligned and connected to one another. Each of the three or more positive electrode units includes a positive electrode current collector and a positive electrode active material layer disposed on the positive electrode current collector. Each of the three or more negative electrode units includes a negative electrode current collector and a negative electrode active material layer disposed on the negative electrode current collector. The positive electrode plate is folded in a zigzag pattern by folding the positive electrode plate alternately in opposite directions at first fold portions. Each of the first fold portions is a boundary between corresponding adjacent two of the positive electrode units. The negative electrode plate is folded in a zigzag pattern by folding the negative electrode plate alternately in opposite directions at second fold portions. Each of the second fold portions is a boundary between corresponding two of the negative electrode units. The positive electrode active material layer is disposed on the first fold portions and the negative electrode active material layer is disposed on the second fold portions. The positive electrode plate, the negative electrode plate, and the separator are arranged such that the positive electrode active material layer on the positive electrode units faces the negative electrode active material layer on the negative electrode units across the separator, and that the first fold portions face the second fold portions across the separator.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The folding of the electrode plate (positive electrode plate, negative electrode plate) in opposite directions means that the electrode plate is folded by approximately 180 degrees. By folding the electrode plate in opposite directions at the fold portions, the electrode plate is folded in a zigzag pattern.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the first secondary battery, a length X of each positive electrode unit in the direction in which the positive electrode units are aligned is greater than length Y of each negative electrode unit in the direction in which the negative electrode units are aligned. Here, a length X of each positive electrode unit in the direction in which the positive electrode units are aligned refers to the length along the positive electrode plate. In other words, the length X is a length of each positive electrode unit in the direction in which the positive electrode units are aligned in a flat development of the positive electrode plate. Similarly, a length Y of each negative electrode unit in the direction in which the negative electrode units are aligned refers to the length of each negative electrode unit in the direction in which the negative electrode units are aligned in a flat development of the negative electrode plate.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the first secondary battery, the three or more positive electrode units have the same planar shape (including substantially the same planar shape). In other words, lengths X of the positive electrode units are substantially equal to each other. Similarly, the three or more negative electrode units have the same planar shape (including substantially the same planar shape). In other words, lengths Y of the negative electrode units are substantially equal to each other. The three or more positive electrode units of the second secondary battery have the same planar shape, but may have different planar shapes. Similarly, the three or more negative electrode units of the second secondary battery have the same planar shape, but may have different planar shapes.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the second secondary battery, distance L<b>1</b> between the positive electrode active material layer at a center of the first fold portion and the negative electrode active material layer at a center of the second fold portion in each portion where the negative electrode plate is covered with the positive electrode plate is greater than distance L<b>2</b> between the positive electrode active material layer at a center of the first fold portion and the negative electrode active material layer at a center of the second fold portion in each portion where the positive electrode plate is covered with the negative electrode plate.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the following description, the portion where the negative electrode plate is covered with the positive electrode plate may be referred to as a &#x201c;positive electrode active material excessive portion&#x201d;. Similarly, in the following description, the portion where the positive electrode plate is covered with the negative electrode plate may be referred to as a &#x201c;negative electrode active material excessive portion&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Here, the center of the fold portion (first or second fold portion) in the positive electrode active material excessive portion or the negative electrode active material excessive portion refers to the outermost portion of the fold portion in the excessive portion in a cross section of the fold in directions in which the electrode plate units (positive electrode units or negative electrode units) are connected to one another in the zigzag pattern (that is, the cross section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> to be described later). For example, the center of the first fold portion in the positive electrode active material excessive portion is the outermost portion of the first fold portion in the cross section along directions in which the positive electrode units are connected to one another in the zigzag pattern (that is, the cross section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> to be described later). In a typical example, the boundary between adjacent two positive electrode units serves as the center of the first fold portion, and the boundary between adjacent two negative electrode units serves as the center of the second fold portion.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the first and second secondary batteries, the active material layers are also disposed on both the first and second fold portions, accordingly increasing the capacity of the batteries.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In consideration of battery characteristics, a predetermined amount of active material is disposed on each of the positive electrode plate and the negative electrode plate per unit area of the positive electrode plate and the negative electrode plate. Accordingly, in the case that the positive electrode plate faces the negative electrode plate in parallel, the positive electrode active material faces the negative electrode active material at an ideal amount ratio as designed. However, in the electrode group folded in the zigzag pattern, the amount of the positive electrode active material is larger than the ideal amount ratio in the portion where the negative electrode plate is wrapped covered with the positive electrode plate. The inventors of the present application have found that when charging and discharging are repeated in the above case, the negative electrode active material layer cannot completely absorb the lithium ions released from the positive electrode active material layer, and lithium metal is likely to be deposited between the active material layers. Such a deposition of lithium metal may cause a short circuit of the battery and reduce a battery capacity. On the other hand, in the portion where the positive electrode plate is covered with the negative electrode plate, the amount of the negative electrode active material is larger than the ideal amount ratio. In such a case, even when charging and discharging are repeated, lithium metal is less likely to be deposited between the active material layers.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the first and second secondary batteries, the gap between the positive electrode active material layer and the negative electrode active material layer in the positive electrode active material excessive portion may be greater than the gap between the positive electrode active material layer and the negative electrode active material layer in the negative electrode active material excessive portion. This configuration reduces the exchange of lithium ions in the positive electrode active material excessive portion, accordingly reducing the deposition of lithium metal in the portion.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the first and second secondary batteries, the number N of positive electrode units included in each positive electrode plate is often equal to the number M of negative electrode units included in each negative electrode plate. In a preferred example, the number N of positive electrode units and the number M of negative electrode units are equal to each other and odd numbers, but may be even numbers.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The planar shape of each of the positive electrode units may be determined according to the shape of the case. The planar shape of the positive electrode unit may be a polygonal shape or a circular shape. In the case that the case has a quadrangular shape, a preferred example of the planar shape of the positive electrode unit has a rectangular shape, for example, a rectangular shape slightly smaller than one main surface of the case. In the case that the case has a coin shape, a preferred example of the planar shape of the positive electrode unit is a polygonal shape (for example, a hexagonal shape, an octagonal shape, or a decagonal shape) or a circular shape. The positive electrode unit may have a planar shape with a portion serving as the fold portion.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The planar shape of each of the negative electrode units may be determined similarly to the planar shape of each positive electrode unit as described above. In a preferred example, the planar shape of the positive electrode unit and the planar shape of the negative electrode unit are determined such that the area where the positive electrode active material faces the negative electrode active material is maximized. For example, the planar shape of the positive electrode unit may be substantially similar to the planar shape of the negative electrode unit. The planar shape of the positive electrode unit and the planar shape of the negative electrode unit are selected so as to satisfy the above described relation between length X and length Y and/or the above described relation between distance L<b>1</b> and distance L<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">One positive electrode plate includes one positive electrode current collector and a positive electrode active material layer disposed on the current collector. The positive electrode active material layer disposed on the positive electrode current collector is continuous preferably without interruption. One negative electrode plate includes one negative electrode current collector and a negative electrode active material layer disposed on the current collector. The negative electrode active material layer disposed on the negative electrode current collector is continuous preferably without interruption.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the first and second secondary batteries, the difference (X&#x2212;Y) between length X and length Y may range from 0.1 mm to 0.3 mm. The difference (X&#x2212; Y) in this range provides a highly reliable secondary battery with little loss of battery capacity.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">If the thickness of the members (electrode plates, current collectors, separator) included in the electrode group is not taken into account, the difference (L<b>1</b>&#x2212;L<b>2</b>) between distance L<b>1</b> and distance L<b>2</b> is regarded as being equal to the difference (X&#x2212;Y). Hence, the difference (L<b>1</b>&#x2212;L<b>2</b>) may range from 0.1 mm to 0.3 mm similarly to the difference (X&#x2212;Y). With consideration for the thickness of the members included in the electrode group, the difference (L<b>1</b>&#x2212;L<b>2</b>) may be slightly smaller than the preferred difference (X&#x2212;Y). Length L<b>2</b> is preferably small, and may be, for example, about the same as the thickness of the separator. In the case that the electrode group has different distances L<b>1</b> and/or different distances L<b>2</b>, all of distances L<b>1</b> and distances L<b>2</b> may preferably satisfy the above relation.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The maximum length of the positive electrode unit in a direction perpendicular to the direction in which the positive electrode units are connected to one another is defined as width WX. The maximum length of the negative electrode units in a direction perpendicular to the direction in which the negative electrode units are connected to one another is defined as width WY. Width WX of the positive electrode units in the direction perpendicular to the direction in which the positive electrode units are connected to one another and width WY of the negative electrode units in the direction perpendicular to the direction in which the negative electrode units are connected to one another may satisfy the relation of WX&#x3e;WY, but often satisfies the relation of WX&#x2264;WY. In addition, area SP of one positive electrode unit and area SN of one negative electrode unit may satisfy the relation of SP&#x3e;SN, but often satisfies the relation of SP&#x2264;SN.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the first and second secondary batteries, at least a portion of the separator may be fixed to the negative electrode plate (negative electrode active material layer) or may be fixed to the positive electrode plate (positive electrode active material layer). Such configurations facilitate the manufacture of batteries. The method of fixing the separator is not particularly limited, and a known technique may be used. For example, the separator may be fixed to the negative electrode plate by a hot press or the like. Alternatively, a separator having an adhesive layer on the surface may be used. As the adhesive layer, for example, a layer containing resin, such as polyvinylidene fluoride, may be used.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The first and second secondary batteries may include one or more positive electrode plates and one or more negative electrode plates such that the total number of the positive and negative electrode plates is two or three. Three examples (first to third arrangement examples) regarding the number of the positive and negative electrode plates and the arrangement of the active material layers will be described below.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a first arrangement example, the number of the one or more positive electrode plates is one and the number of the one or more negative electrode plates is one. In this case, a positive electrode active material layer is disposed only on one surface of the positive electrode current collector, and a negative electrode active material layer is disposed on only one surface of the negative electrode current collector. In a second arrangement example, the number of the one or more positive electrode plates is two and the number of the one or more negative electrode plates is one. In this case, a positive electrode active material layer is disposed on only one surface of the positive electrode current collector, and negative electrode active material layers are disposed on each of both surfaces of the negative electrode current collector. In the second arrangement example, the two positive electrode plates and the one negative electrode plate are arranged such that the two positive electrode plates sandwich the one negative electrode plate. In a third arrangement example, the number of the one or more negative electrode plates is two, and the number of the one or more positive electrode plates is one. In this case, positive electrode active material layers are disposed on each of both surfaces of the positive electrode current collector, and a negative electrode active material layer is disposed on only one surface of the negative electrode current collector.

The planar shapes of the positive electrode units and the negative electrode units were substantially regular octagonal shapes.

In the charge and discharge cycle test, the charge and discharge cycle was repeated 1000 cycles each including charging and discharging. In the charge and discharge cycle test, charging was performed under the conditions of 4.35 V and 6 mA, and discharging was performed under the conditions of 3.0 V and 6 mA.

Table 1 further shows the calculation result of capacity loss rate R (%) on the assumption that the difference between length X and length Y does not contribute to the battery capacity. The calculation result is based on the assumption to be described later. With an increase in this value, the capacity loss increases. Hence, the value of capacity loss rate R (%) is preferably smaller.

On the other hand, in comparative sample 1 with length X that is equal to length Y, deposition of lithium metal was observed in the positive electrode active material excessive portions after the charge and discharge cycle test. Comparative sample 1 is thus more likely to cause a short circuit or a decrease in capacity due to repeated charging and discharging compared with samples 1 to 4.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0116">As shown in Table 1, the secondary batteries of samples 1 to 4 maintained a battery capacity higher than 80% of the initial capacity even after 1000 cycles.

This result indicates that the secondary batteries of samples 1 to 4 have little deterioration caused due to repeated charging and discharging.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0117">On the other hand, as shown in Table 1, an increase in value of the difference (X&#x2212;Y) between length X and length Y increases the capacity loss rate accordingly.

Considering the value of capacity loss rate R, the value of the difference (X&#x2212;Y) is preferably less than or equal to 0.3, and may more preferably ranges from 0.1 to 0.3. The values of length X are different between comparative sample 1 and samples 1 to 4. Hence, the result that a capacity loss rate of comparative sample 1 is smaller than a capacity loss rate of samples 1 to 4 does not necessarily indicate that a battery capacity of comparative sample 1 greater than a battery capacity of samples 1 to 4. Even if not all of the active material layers at the fold portions in the positive electrode active material excessive portions do not contribute to the battery capacity, the active material layer at the fold portions in the negative electrode active material excessive portions contributes to an increase in battery capacity.
