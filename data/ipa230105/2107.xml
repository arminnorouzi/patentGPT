In some cases, no partition is desired which requires removal of the separate partition.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such conventional methods and systems have generally been considered satisfactory for their intended purpose. However, there is still a need in the art for improved containers. The present disclosure provides a solution for this need.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In accordance with at least one aspect of this disclosure, a container can include a plurality of side panels defining an interior space, and an inner partition member disposed at least partially within the interior space. The inner partition member can be configured to be at least partially conformal with the plurality of side panels in a first position, and to form one or more partitions dividing the interior space in at least a second position. In certain embodiments, only a portion of the inner partition member can be attached to an interior surface of the plurality of side panels such that the inner partition member can be configured to be moved between the first position and at least the second position.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The plurality of side panels can include at least a first side panel, a second side panel, a third side panel, and a fourth side panel foldably connected together at vertical side fold lines. In certain embodiments, the plurality of side panels can include only the first, second, third, and fourth side panels, wherein the first side panel is connected to the fourth side panel to form a box.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The inner partition member can include a plurality of partition panels foldably connected together at vertical partition fold lines. The plurality of inner partition panels can include an odd number of partition panels. For example, the middle panel can be connected to the inner surface of one of the side panels.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In certain embodiments, the inner partition member can include a first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh partition panels. In certain embodiments, the partition panels can be equally sized and shaped.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The first and third side panels can be sized to be the about the same length as three partition panels. The second and fourth side panels can be sized such that two partition panels are configured to extend across the interior space from the third side panel to the first side panel.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In certain embodiments, the fourth partition panel can be adhered to a middle of the interior surface of the third side panel or second side panel such that the first, second, third, fifth, sixth, and seventh partition panels can be configured to move relative to the fourth partition panel and the third side panel or second side panel. In certain embodiments, the second position can be a partially partitioned position. For example, the third partition panel and the second partition panel can be folded relative to the fourth partition panel to extend across the interior space such that the first panel can be in flush contact with the opposing side wall, or the fifth partition panel and the sixth partition panel can be folded relative to the fourth partition panel to extend across the interior space such that the seventh panel can be in flush contact with the opposing side wall.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In certain embodiments, the second position can be a fully partitioned position wherein the third partition panel and the second partition panel can be folded relative to the fourth partition panel to extend across the interior space such that the first panel can be in flush contact with the opposing side wall, and the fifth partition panel and the sixth partition panel can be folded relative to the fourth partition panel to extend across the interior space such that the seventh panel can be in flush contact with the opposing side wall.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In certain embodiments, the partition panels can be about the same height as the side panels. In certain embodiments, the partition panels can be less than the height of the side panels (e.g., half size).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The container can include a plurality of bottom panels configured to form a bottom, each foldably connected to a bottom of a respective side panel. In certain embodiments, in the second position, the partition panels that extend across the interior space can be configured to align with and/or interact with an edge of one or more bottom panels to provide a lateral support to the partition panels to at least partially retain the partition panels in the second position.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In certain embodiments, the container can include one or more top panels configured to form a top enclosure, each foldably connected to a top of a respective side panel. Any other suitable panels are contemplated herein.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with at least one aspect of this disclosure, a blank arrangement can be configured to form any suitable package as disclosed herein, e.g., as described above. In certain embodiments, a blank arraignment can include a first blank having a plurality of side panels foldably connected together and configured to define an interior space, and a second blank comprising a plurality of partition panels foldably connected together. In certain embodiments, only a single partition panel may be adhered to an attachment panel of the plurality of side panels.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In certain embodiments, only a middle panel or plurality of middle panels of the plurality of partition panels are adhered to attachment panel. Any other suitable arrangement is contemplated herein.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In certain embodiments, the plurality of side panels includes a first, second, third, and fourth side panel. The plurality of partition panels can include a first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh partition panel. The fourth partition panel can be adhered to a middle of the third side panel such that there are an equal number of moveable partition panels on each side of the fourth side panel.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In certain embodiments, the second blank can lay completely within edges of the first blank. For example, in certain embodiments, the second blank can extend over only the second, third, and fourth side panels.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In certain embodiments, the partition panels can be equally sized and shaped.
