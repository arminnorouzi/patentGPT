Users see benefits in having multiple parties in the chain verify a transaction or event before it is added to the chain or on the underlying transactions that may be represented on the blockchain. However, current system have few if any checks on members that join the chain. An advantage of blockchain is that you do not know who is part of the chain which makes it harder to commander control of the blockchain. On the other hand, not know who is part of the chain can allow virtually anyone become part of the blockchain, including people who join with the goal of committing fraud or having users invest in risky transactions.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A blockchain storage system is disclosed.

The request may be a payment or may be to accept a contract. As will be explained, the requests are many and varied. The request may then be funneled into a peer to peer network and broadcast to each member or node (B<b>1</b>-B<b>6</b>).</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, individual nodes B<b>1</b>-B<b>6</b> may receive the request and validate the transaction using an algorithm. The request may follow a known or proprietary protocol. The algorithm may take many forms and may vary in different situation as will be explained. The request may be approved and be turned into another block <b>205</b> to be added to the blockchain <b>105</b> and a blockchain ledger.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As illustrated at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, approved requests may be represented as blocks <b>205</b> and may be added to a public ledger. Once the block <b>205</b> is added to an existing chain, the transaction as a result of the request may be permanent and complete. Hashing reduces data to a bunch of seemingly random characters&#x2014;for example, the hash of the phrase &#x201c;the quick brown fox&#x201d; may be &#x201c;9ECB36561341D18EB65484E833EFEA61EDC74B84CF5E6AE1B81C63533E25FC8F&#x201d; using an encoding method called SHA-256. Tweaking just one letter in the phrase produces a completely different hash, and it is not possible to go backward to figure out the original data from the hash. With blockchain, hashes may be linked together so any small or minute change is immediately visible, not just for the block housing it but for all other blocks added later.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">An advantage to blockchain may be that a plurality of users are needed to validate a transaction. At the same time, there may be no authority or watchdog to oversee who is joining the blockchain. In a hypothetical, fraudulent users may join and overtake control of a blockchain and the value in the blockchain may be lost. Similarly. blockchains <b>105</b> may be used to store deals or proposed contracts. A party may have to accept a proposal and that acceptance along with details of the proposed contract may be stored on the blockchain. The proposal may have many risks such as the risk of the underlying contract, the risk of the players that are part of the transaction, the risk of the market in general, the skills of the players in the deal, etc.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A successful contract, for example, on a loan for a start-up, may be often influenced by all parties in the contract, not just the recipient of the loan. An active investor may make or break a new venture through micro-managing, giving access to influential contacts, having backup funds to smooth over rough times, etc. Also, the riskiness changes dramatically over time as new entrants enter and leave the target sector of the endeavor. One loan may require an active investor while another may not be based on factors such as if the endeavor needs external validation. Unfortunately, most risk estimations on loan are static and only take into consideration the recipient and not all contributing factors which may change over time and in face of outside factors.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">What is needed is a dynamic, secure method of quantifying all those risk factors. The present system and method attempts to address the problem of not knowing the other users of the blockchain or the risks of a proposed transaction. By analyzing the data around the blockchain <b>105</b>, a more sophisticated model may be created to help quantify the risk of the proposed action.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The proposed solution uses a machine learning (ML)/artificial intelligence (AI) scoring engine encoded securely in a blockchain. As the blockchain interacts with other blockchains and new data, the risk score may be provided for the proposal changes.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">This may enable:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0022">A unique, targeted risk score for each collection of participants, which may enable more specific risk estimates.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0023">Better risk scoring when solutions rely on external events, and timing is critical (for example, a load to set up a flash store for a upcoming event).</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0024">An adaptive system, that may, as more information about riskiness is made available, influence prior models scores.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0025">A safe and secure method to execute complex AI/ML algorithm within the blockchain context.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0026">A method of allowing complex and secure blockchain interactions and mergers.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0023" num="0027">A sample method may be illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. When a new request is issued to the blockchain at block <b>400</b>, the authority starts gathering data for a model design at block <b>405</b>. Each blockchain may have its own model based on the request, such as a contract or an investment.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0028">A target model template may be pulled from a database of model templates, segmented by types or requests, jurisdictions, user data and other attributes. For example, a loan requester originating from Europe, targeting participants across the world for a small business may have a designated template to build from. The request may be for a contract that may be accepted and stored on the blockchain. Similarly, a contract to use a web site may also have a template that is less complex but adaptable to many situations. For example, a database of possible end scenarios, one investor to N investors of various sizes may be built based on historical data of prior loans.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0029">The template may have factors that may be used in building the model. These factors may be adjusted to what information is available for this particular request and what end scenarios are expected. Metadata may be used to establish the factors. At a high level, the metadata on new users may be used to establish a risk rating based on past transactions for this user or similar users. At block <b>410</b>, metadata on the new party may be gathered. The possible user metadata may include:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0030">User Metadata:</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0031">Count contracts;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0032">Types of Contracts;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0033">First seen;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0034">Reputation Score;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0035">Graph metrics;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0007" num="0036">Connective;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0008" num="0037">Ego Net size;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0009" num="0038">Influence score; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0010" num="0039">Previous Activity.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0026" num="0040">These are just examples of possible metadata and not limitations. Logically, additional or less metadata may be available depending on each situation. The metadata may also change over time. For example, when new partners are joining, their data is used to generate a new score.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0041">At block <b>415</b>, outside data may be gathered. Outside data may relate to the type of transaction or to the players that are part of the transaction. In addition, outside sources of data may provide insight into the people trying to join the blockchain. For example, if a player has a criminal record for financial crimes, that data may be useful to people on the blockchain.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0042">At block <b>420</b>, blockchain metadata may be generated. Blockchain metadata may include data on past blockchains that may be similar to this blockchain. Sample metadata may include:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0043">Creation data for the blockchain;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0044">Start date of the blockchain;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0045">Frequency of updates of the blockchain;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0046">Average user reputation score on the blockchain; and</li>        <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0047">Previous Activity on the blockchain.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0029" num="0048">At block <b>425</b>, profiles may be generated. The profiles may be for the members of the proposed request. For example, if the request is for a contract, there may be at least two parties to the contract, if not more. The profiles may be used to create a rating for the proposed request. Other members of the blockchain, if known, may also be profiled in some embodiments as may be other participants in the request such as follow investors.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0049">At block <b>430</b>, historical data may be accessed. The historical data may be many and varied. The history may be about the users, the blockchain and the proposed transaction. In addition, historical data on similar actions may also be analyzed and may be meaningful to assess the risk.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0050">At block <b>435</b>, indexes may be rebuilt. As the transaction and data related to the request may be updated, the indexes that represent the machine learning results may be rebuilt with the updated data. As the indexes are rebuilt, faster the model may operate as the index may be able to quickly locate relevant data.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0051">At block <b>440</b>, sub-model may be rebuilt. Logically, if there is new data, such as new members to a transaction or new market conditions, the model should take in to account the new data. Thus, the sub-model may be re-built to take into account the new data and related analysis.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0052">Next, the model build process is started. Note: part of the model may be static and other may be custom built for this particular request. For example, if the blockchain is a standard contract to view a web site, a deep analysis of the players and the history of people using the web site may not be of much use. On the other hand, if the contract is to invest in a start-up, the details of the various players may be critical as a start-up may need guidance, personal connections and continued funding and a model more specific to the situation may be needed.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0053">The base line score may be determined and a secure form of the final model may be included in the blockchain <b>105</b> for this contract. In this way, the score may follow the contract and if the contract is reviewed in the future, the initial score may be seen. For example, if a venture financing project is not successful, the financier may wish to review the initial paperwork to see if there were sufficient signs to signify the risk of the deal in view of the proposed return.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0054">Using the new data, the blockchain <b>105</b>, using an algorithm, delivers a customized score and saves it to the blockchain <b>105</b>. The score may be on a scale and the scale may be set according to the user. For example, some users may want a number on a <b>100</b> point scale while other users may desire a simple letter grade and other users may desire a text categorical variable.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0055">At block <b>445</b>, a final model may be created. The final model may use all the data gathered and may create a final rating. As mentioned previously, the rating may take on a variety of forms such as numeric values or letter values.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0056">The creation of the rating value may also take on a variety of forms. For some users, the potential return from an investment may be given a heavy weight and the model rating may reflect the upside of the request. In other examples, the potential risks may be the most important factor to a user and the risks may be the largest portion of the rating. In additional embodiments, a combination of user defined factors may create the rating.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0057">In some embodiments, the ratings may be refined over time. Machine learning may be used to analyze past ratings in view of the actual results. Machine learning may be used to review a training group of past risk rating data and determine risk ratings moving forward. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may illustrate sample artificial intelligence (AI) training data according to one or more embodiments. As an example and not a limitation, an artificial intelligence system may trained by analyzing a set of training data <b>605</b>. The training data may be broken into sets, such as set A <b>610</b>, set B <b>615</b>, set C <b>620</b> and set D <b>625</b>.

The artificial intelligence system may analyze the training set (set A <b>610</b>, set B <b>615</b> and set C <b>620</b>) and use the testing set (set D <b>625</b>) to test the model create from the training data. Then the data sets may shift as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, where the test data set may be added to the training data sets (say set A <b>610</b>, set B <b>615</b> and set D <b>625</b>) and one of the training data sets that have not been used to test before (say set C <b>620</b>) may be used as the test data set. The analysis of the training data (set A <b>610</b>, set B <b>615</b> and set D <b>625</b>) may occur again with the new testing set (set C <b>620</b>) being used to test the model and the model may be refined. The rotation of data sets may occur repeatedly until all the data sets have been used as the test data sets. The model then may be considered complete and the model may then be used on additional data sets.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0058">At block <b>450</b>, an action may be determined based on the risk score. In some cases, the risk score may be over a threshold and events may begin automatically. For example, if the risk score is over a threshold for a particular project, the project may be automatically rejected and the method may end at block <b>455</b>.

Modules may constitute either software modules (e.g., code or instructions embodied on a machine-readable medium or in a transmission signal, wherein the code is executed by a processor) or hardware modules. A hardware module is tangible unit capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more hardware modules of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0096">In various embodiments, a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0097">Accordingly, the term &#x201c;hardware module&#x201d; should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired), or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. As used herein, &#x201c;hardware-implemented module&#x201d; refers to a hardware module. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware modules comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor, for example, to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0098">Hardware modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware modules. Accordingly, the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connect the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example, one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0099">The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented modules.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0100">Similarly, the methods or routines described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or processors or processor-implemented hardware modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processor or processors may be located in a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment or as a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0101">The one or more processors may also operate to support performance of the relevant operations in a &#x201c;cloud computing&#x201d; environment or as a &#x201c;software as a service&#x201d; (SaaS). For example, at least some of the operations may be performed by a group of computers (as examples of machines including processors), these operations being accessible via a network (e.g., the Internet) and via one or more appropriate interfaces (e.g., application program interfaces (APIs).)</p><p id="p-0065" num="0102">The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines.
