Accordingly, research is ongoing to develop display devices having a larger display area with reduced volume and weight.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recently, flexible display devices are attracting attention as next-generation display devices, which can be folded and unfolded as desired by forming the display area, wirings, etc., on a flexible substrate.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The degree of flexibility of a flexible display device may be defined as a threshold curvature radius (RTH). The threshold curvature radius refers to the minimum radius that allows a flexible display device to be bent without being broken. The smaller the threshold curvature radius of a material is, the greater the flexibility of the material is. On the contrary, as the threshold curvature radius increases, the flexibility of the flexible display device decreases. The threshold curvature radius of a flexible display device may be determined as a factory default or based on a third party's experiment results.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The inventors of the application have recognized that flexible display devices require excellent surface hardness, excellent flexibility, and excellent dent recovery ability to be commercially competitive. For mass production of flexible display devices designed to be bent, curled, or fold, the above-described characteristics are essentially required. Accordingly, the inventors of the application have researched and developed a flexible display device capable having improved surface hardness, flexibility, and dent recovery ability.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The inventors of the application have studied the organic coupling relationship between a cover window structure and a flexible display panel of a flexible display device to improve surface hardness, flexibility, and dent recovery ability. The cover window structure may refer to an element configured to protect the display surface of the flexible display device. The flexible display panel may refer to a flexible panel in which a plurality of pixels including light-emitting elements are formed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Firstly, the inventors of the application have studied to improve anti-scratch properties of the flexible display device by improving the surface hardness of the cover window structure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The inventors of the application have conducted various studies to improve the anti-scratch properties of the flexible display device using a high-hardness coating material capable of improving the surface hardness of the cover window structure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, due to the brittle characteristics of the high-hardness coating material, the threshold curvature radius of a flexible display device may be increased. If the threshold curvature radius increases, the flexibility decreases, and thus applications of the flexible display device may be limited.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In other words, the inventors of the application have recognized that as the thickness of the high-hardness coating material of the cover window structure increases, the flexibility of the flexible display device may be decreased.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In view of the above, the inventors of the application have studied on a flexible display device that has improved surface hardness as well as flexibility.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As described above, when the high-hardness coating material is thick, the high-hardness coating material of the cover window structure may be broken when the display device is bent. Accordingly, the inventors of the application have studied the correlation between the thickness of the high-hardness coating material and the threshold curvature radius, and have found the fact that the surface hardness of the cover window structure may not be substantially decreased even if the thickness of the high-hardness coating material is reduced. More specifically, as a result of attempts to reduce the thickness, the inventors of the application have found that the cover window structure can improve the surface hardness of the flexible display device as well as the flexibility.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Unfortunately, the inventors of the application have recognized that the above-described flexible display device having the thin cover window structure has a problem that the flex display device may be vulnerable to scratches. Specifically, permanent deformations such as dent and impression may be made on the flexible display device by a sharp object such as a pen and a nail. In addition, the inventors of the application have recognized that there may be problems such as defective pixels, disconnection of signal wiring in the flexible display panel.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Accordingly, the inventors of the application have studied to improve the surface hardness of a flexible display device, improve the flexibility of the flexible display device, and also improve the dent recovery ability of the flexible display device.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">To improve the dent issue on flexible display devices, the inventors of the application have recognized that it is necessary to improve the dent recovery ability of the flexible display device.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">More specifically, as the dent recovery ability of a flexible display device is decreased, a dent may remain permanently. If an external force is applied to the thin cover window structure and depresses it, then the impact is transmitted to the flexible display panel. As a result, the flexible display panel may be deformed.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The inventors of the application have found that the dent recovery ability of a flexible display device may vary depending on the materials of the cover window structure and the flexible display panel and the stacked structure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Moreover, unlike the scratches, the dent issue cannot be solved by simply improving the surface hardness of the cover window structure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">That is to say, a dent defect may occur permanently even if no scratch is made on the surface of the flexible display device.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In view of the above, what is required is a flexible display device having excellent surface hardness, excellent flexibility, and excellent dent recovery ability.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Objects of the present disclosure are not limited to the above-mentioned objects, and other objects, which are not mentioned above, can be clearly understood by those skilled in the art from the following descriptions.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a flexible display device. The flexible display device includes a flexible display panel. The flexible display device further includes a cover window structure on the flexible display panel, and including a flexible film and a first hard coating layer on the flexible film. The first hard coating layer includes a material made of a combination of a siloxane resin and a urethane-acrylic-, acrylic- or epoxy-type linker.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A thickness of the first hard coating layer may be 30 &#x3bc;m to 80 &#x3bc;m, and the first hard coating layer may have a pencil scratch hardness of 4H or more when measured at a test with a vertical load weight of 750 g according to ASTM D3363.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A thickness of the first hard coating layer may be equal to or greater than a thickness of the flexible film.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">A thickness of the flexible film may be 30 &#x3bc;m to 80 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The cover window structure may further include a second hard coating layer on a back side of the flexible film.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The second hard coating layer may be made of a same material as the first hard coating layer.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The second hard coating layer may be made of a different material from the first hard coating layer.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A thickness of the first hard coating layer may be equal to a thickness of the second hard coating layer.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A thickness of the first hard coating layer may be different from a thickness of the second hard coating layer.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The flexible display device may further include an adhesive member between the cover window structure and the flexible display panel, a modulus of elasticity the adhesive member may be 10<sup>3 </sup>Pa to 10<sup>6 </sup>Pa.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">A thickness of the cover window structure may be 150 &#x3bc;m to 240 &#x3bc;m.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Other detailed matters of the exemplary embodiments are included in the detailed description and the drawings.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, a flexible display device can have excellent surface hardness, excellent flexibility, and excellent dent recovery ability.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The effects according to the present disclosure are not limited to the contents exemplified above, and more various effects are included in the present specification.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The accompanying drawings, which are included to provide a further understanding of the disclosure and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this application, illustrate embodiments of the disclosure and together with the description serve to explain various principles.
