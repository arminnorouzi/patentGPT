Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A plasma tool includes a radio frequency (RF) generator, and impedance matching circuit, and a plasma chamber. The RF generator generates a radio frequency waveform that is supplied to the impedance matching circuit. The impedance matching circuit receives the radio frequency waveform to output a radio frequency signal that is supplied to the plasma chamber. A wafer is processed within the plasma chamber by plasma generated when the radio frequency signal is supplied in conjunction with a process gas. For example, the wafer is etched within the plasma chamber pursuant to the radio frequency signal.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is in this context that embodiments described in the present disclosure arise.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the disclosure provide systems, apparatus, methods and computer programs for multi-level parameter and multi-level frequency pulsing with a low angular spread. It should be appreciated that the present embodiments can be implemented in numerous ways, e.g., a process, an apparatus, a system, a device, or a method on a computer readable medium. Several embodiments are described below.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">To generate ions, such as both high energy and low energy ions, a radio frequency (RF) bias is increased at low frequency, such as 1 megahertz (MHz). The RF bias has a continuous waveform. The low energy ions have a low voltage and therefore, have a high angular spread. The high angular spread reduces an etch rate of etching a wafer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">With an increase in an amount of the RF bias, high aspect ratio etching is achieved. However, the increase in the amount of power increases mask erosion. Also, increasing the amount of RF bias greater than a pre-set amount, such as greater than approximately 5 kilovolts, does not reduce the angular spread due to high plasma sheath thickness.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">By using multiple voltage levels, such as a high bias voltage that is greater than 500 volts, the angular spread is reduced but the low energy ions may still have relatively high energy, which is approximately 200 electron volts (eV). Applying the multiple voltage levels with multiple frequency levels decreases the angular spread in addition to reducing energy of the low energy ions to less than 100 electron volts. The low energy ions with the angular spread that is reduced protect a mask layer and simultaneously etch a substrate layer. The substrate layer has a lower etching threshold compared to the mask layer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">If the multiple voltage levels and multiple frequency levels with the high bias voltage are applied, the reduction in the energy of the low energy ions and of the angular spread occurs. For example, a low frequency level is applied with a low voltage level and a high frequency level is applied with a high voltage level. After a transition from the low frequency level to the high frequency level and from the low voltage level to the high voltage level, a high electric field is applied to the low energy ions by the high frequency level and the high voltage level. The high electric field is applied to the low energy ions because it takes time to change a plasma sheath associated with the low energy ions. Voltage magnitudes of the low voltage level apply a voltage boost to the low energy ions during the high voltage level. Also, the low energy ions have a low temperature because of the low voltage level. The high electric field increases velocity and energy of the low energy ions without substantially increasing the high voltage level to increase directionality of the low energy ions or reducing the angular spread of the low energy ions. For example, the angular spread is reduced, such as to approximately 1 degree from approximately 2 degrees. The directionality is also increased by the low temperature of the low energy ions. The increase in directionality facilitates piercing of plasma sheath to increase an etch rate of etching a substrate. A number of the multiple voltage levels and a duty cycle of each of the voltage levels are optimized for reducing the angular spread of the low energy ions.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Also, the high voltage level and the high frequency level of an RF signal create high energy ions having a low angular spread. The low voltage level and the low frequency level create the low energy ions that have a high angular spread. The high energy ions etch a feature of the substrate faster and the low energy ions improve mask selectivity.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The reduction in the angular spread increases the mask selectivity compared to that achieved by applying the continuous waveform, reduces critical dimension, such as a thickness, of a channel within the substrate compared to that achieved by applying the continuous waveform, and achieves better high aspect ratio etching of the substrate compared to that achieved by applying the continuous waveform. For example, the mask selectivity is improved by approximately 20% or more, the etch rate is increased by approximately 40% or more, and the critical dimension is reduced by approximately 12% or more compared to that achieved using the continuous waveform.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, a method is described. The method includes controlling an RF generator to generate an RF signal that concurrently pulses between a plurality of parameter levels and between a plurality of frequency levels during a time period. The plurality of parameter levels include a first parameter level and a second parameter level and the plurality of frequency levels include a first frequency level and a second frequency level. During the time period, a transition from the first frequency level to the second frequency level occurs in substantial synchronization with a transition from the first parameter level to the second parameter level and a transition from the second frequency level to the first frequency level occurs in substantial synchronization with a transition from the second parameter level to the first parameter level.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In various embodiments, a controller is described. The controller includes a processor configured to control an RF generator to generate an RF signal that concurrently pulses between a plurality of parameter levels and between a plurality of frequency levels during a time period. The plurality of parameter levels include a first parameter level and a second parameter level and the plurality of frequency levels include a first frequency level and a second frequency level. During the time period, a transition from the first frequency level to the second frequency level occurs in substantial synchronization with a transition from the first parameter level to the second parameter level and a transition from the second frequency level to the first frequency level occurs in substantial synchronization with a transition from the second parameter level to the first parameter level. The controller includes a memory device coupled to the processor.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In several embodiments, a system is described. The system includes an RF generator and a controller coupled to the RF generator. The controller is configured to control the RF generator to generate an RF signal that concurrently pulses between a plurality of parameter levels and between a plurality of frequency levels during a time period.
