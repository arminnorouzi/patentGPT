Coaxial connectors are typically attached to the ends of cables to enable the cables to be connected with equipment or other cables. Connector interfaces provide a connect/disconnect functionality between a cable terminated with a connector and a corresponding connector with a mating connector interface mounted on an apparatus or another cable.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">An RF coaxial connector interface commonly referred to as 4.3/10 is under consideration by the International Electrical Commission, an international standards body, to become a standardized coaxial connector interface as matter IEC(46F/243/NP). The 4.3/10 connector interface can be connected with a tool, by hand, or as a &#x201c;quick-connect&#x201d; connector. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the 4.3/10 female connector <b>5</b> (shown on the left side of the figures) has an outer contact <b>10</b> with spring fingers <b>12</b> that engage an inner diameter of a mating interface cylinder <b>15</b> of the 4.3/10 male connector <b>20</b> (shown on the right side of the figures). Such engagement establishes electrical contact between the outer contacts of the connectors <b>5</b>, <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Early adopters of the 4.3/10 connection interface have applied these connectors to communications equipment such as cellular base station antennas. In some cases, the same equipment includes connections for multiple types of connector interfaces, which are often selected based upon the diameter of each of the coaxial cables being connected to the device.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One of these alternative connectors is referred to as 4.1-9.5 or &#x201c;Mini-Din&#x201d; connector. The Mini-Din male connector <b>25</b> (shown on the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>) has a smaller overall connection interface that utilizes a similar but smaller diameter outer conductor connection cylinder <b>30</b>. The male outer conductor cylinder <b>30</b> includes a beveled and/or radiused outer leading edge <b>35</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>10</b></figref>). The Mini-Din utilizes a coupling nut <b>40</b>&#x2032; with the same threading configuration as the 4.3/10 coupling nut <b>40</b>. Because the Mini-Din connector <b>25</b> looks nearly the same and employs the same coupling nut <b>40</b>&#x2032; as a 4.3/10 male connector <b>20</b>, an installer may mistakenly attempt to attach a Mini-Din male connector <b>25</b> to a 4.3/10 female connector <b>5</b>. If the initial resistance is overcome, the spring fingers <b>12</b> of the outer contact <b>10</b> of the 4.3/10 may be splayed outward (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), thereby enabling insertion of the Mini-Din connector <b>25</b> to the point where the threads of the coupling nut <b>40</b>&#x2032; threads are engaged. At this point, further threading of the coupling nut <b>40</b>&#x2032;, particularly with the force multiplying effect of the threads and ability to apply a wrench for additional leverage, may result in an erroneous interconnection. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the spring fingers <b>12</b> of the 4.3/10 outer contact <b>10</b> may be permanently splayed, thus preventing later interconnection with the correct 4.3/10 male connector <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). In addition to destroying the female 4.3/10 connector <b>5</b>, which renders equipment upon which is mounted unusable, the erroneous connection with a Mini-Din connector <b>25</b> may enable damaging mis-directed transmission of improper power/signals to further downline equipment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the foregoing, it may be desirable to provide an alternative connection interface that is compatible with existing 4.3/10 connectors.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As a first aspect, embodiments of the invention are directed to a similar interface blocking coaxial connector interconnectable with a 4.3/10 coaxial connector connection interface. The connector comprises: an inner contact defining a longitudinal axis; and an outer contact positioned radially outwardly from the inner contact and having axially-extending spring fingers. Each of the spring fingers includes a radially-inward protrusion projecting to an inner diameter less than an inner diameter of a male Mini-Din outer conductor cylinder.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As a second aspect, embodiments of the invention are directed to a similar interface blocking coaxial connector, interconnectable with a 4.3/10 coaxial connector connection interface, comprising: an inner contact that defines a longitudinal axis; and an outer contact with a distal end and a plurality of spring fingers. The distal end is located such that the distal end interferes with a Mini-Din connector before contact occurs between the spring fingers and an outer conductor cylinder of the Mini-Din connector.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a third aspect, embodiments of the invention are directed to a similar interface blocking coaxial connector, interconnectable with a 4.3/10 coaxial connector connection interface, comprising: an inner contact defining a longitudinal axis; a cylindrical outer contact with a plurality of spring fingers; and a barrier plug retained proximate a distal end of the spring fingers that creates a stop face adjacent an inner diameter of the outer contact.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">As a fourth aspect, embodiments of the invention are directed to a 4.3/10 coaxial connector configured to receive a mating 4.3/10 connector, comprising: an inner contact; a dielectric spacer; and an outer contact, the dielectric spacer separating the inner contact and the outer contact.

Below are described different approaches for a coaxial connector interface that is mechanically and electrically compatible with the 4.3/10 interface specification, but which inhibits erroneous interconnection with similar coaxial interfaces like the Mini-Din connector.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0050">In one approach, it is recognized that, although the 4.3/10 interface includes a generally cylindrical space CS within the inner diameter of the fingers <b>12</b> of the outer contact <b>10</b> of the female connector <b>5</b> (best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), because all of the electrical and mechanical interconnections are in fact made via the outer diameter of the fingers <b>12</b>, this cylindrical space CS is not a requirement to enable interconnection with a 4.3/10 interface.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, an exemplary female connector <b>105</b> includes an outer contact <b>110</b> with fingers <b>112</b> having inwardly-projecting protrusions <b>155</b> on their distal ends. The protrusions <b>155</b> provide additional surface area at the distal end to form blocking surfaces <b>160</b> (best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) to the cylindrical space CS. The presence of the blocking surfaces <b>160</b> securely inhibits splaying of the outer contact spring fingers <b>112</b> if an interconnection with a Mini-Din connector is erroneously attempted by an installer.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0052">The blocking surfaces <b>160</b> comprising the distal end of each of the outer contact spring fingers <b>112</b> may be generally planar (e.g., they may be aligned normal to a longitudinal axis of the outer contact <b>110</b>). The blocking surfaces <b>160</b> may form a discontinuous annular arrangement, with an inner diameter that is less than the inner diameter of the male Mini-Din outer conductor cylinder <b>25</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0053">The inwardly-projecting protrusions <b>155</b> may be present proximate the distal end as a lip or shoulder, or alternatively as a ramped surface wherein the thickness of the spring finger <b>112</b> increases from a proximal end to the distal end. Further, the inwardly-projecting protrusions <b>155</b> need not be applied to each of the outer contact spring fingers <b>112</b>, but may omit some (e.g., every other spring finger <b>112</b> may lack a protrusion <b>155</b>) to form a blocking face that effectively inhibits erroneous mating with a Mini-Din connector <b>25</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>. However, because the outer diameter/surfaces of the outer contact <b>110</b> of the female connector <b>105</b> remain dimensionally unchanged, the female connector <b>105</b> remains electromechanically compatible with the full range of male 4.3/10 connectors <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0054">The outer contact <b>110</b> may be a machined element, or alternatively may be formed via metal stamping or the like.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0055">Representative electrical modeling of the interface between the male 4.3/10 connector <b>20</b> and the female connector <b>105</b> demonstrates that the presence of the inward projecting protrusions <b>155</b> into the otherwise cylindrical space CS within the spring fingers <b>112</b> does not significantly degrade the electrical performance of an interface with the connector <b>105</b> compared to a conventional 4.3/10 connector interconnection (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). One skilled in the art will appreciate that further tuning of the interconnection area may be applied to optimize performance at specifically desired frequency bands. Thus, the connector <b>105</b> can improve protection against connector interface damage by providing a block against interconnection with the easily confused variants of the 4.3/10 connection interface, without significantly impacting the electrical performance of the resulting interconnection.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0056">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>14</b></figref>, another approach to preventing erroneous mating of connectors is shown therein. This approach recognizes that the 4.3/10 interface is capable of correctly mating over a range of insertion depths between the male and female connectors <b>5</b>, <b>20</b>. Further, the Mini-Din connector <b>25</b> has a generally shallower configuration corresponding to the smaller connection surface diameters of the prescribed Mini-Din interface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref> illustrate a female connector <b>205</b> with a connector body <b>235</b> that is longer than is typical. As a result, the outer contact <b>210</b> and inner contact <b>214</b> are seated deeper within the bore of the connector body <b>235</b>. Although sufficient depth is present to enable proper mating with a 4.3/10 male connector <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>), when a male Mini-Din connector <b>25</b> attempts to mate with the female connector <b>205</b>, the distal end <b>237</b> of the connector body <b>235</b> bottoms against a gasket <b>37</b> of the Mini-Din connector <b>25</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref>). As such, the outer conductor connection cylinder <b>30</b> of the Mini-Din connector <b>25</b> cannot splay the spring fingers <b>212</b> of the outer contact <b>210</b> of the 4.3/10 female connector <b>205</b> (best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). Thus, the female connector <b>205</b> resists erroneous interconnection with a Mini-Din connector <b>25</b> which could otherwise damage it.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0057">The amount of extension applied to the connector body <b>235</b> may be selected, for example, to coincide with the maximum extension which enables correct seating of the inner and outer contacts of the 4.3/10 female connector <b>205</b> with a male connector <b>20</b> according to the 4.3/10 interface specification. Limiting dimensions include, for example, that the inner contact <b>214</b> is able to seat at a longitudinal location along the male center pin <b>24</b> of the male 4.3/10 connector <b>20</b> that enables secure electrical contact to occur. To enhance this dimension further, the inner contact <b>214</b> of the female connector <b>205</b> may be provided with enhanced inward bias, enabling secure contact to be applied even to a conical end portion of the male center pin <b>24</b>. This configuration can also allow for tolerance errors. Similarly, the outer contact <b>210</b> may be provided with a level of outward bias that enables the outer contact <b>210</b> to seat against at least a conical surface of interface cylinder <b>15</b> of a 4.3/10 male connector <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0058">Because the outer diameter and surfaces of the outer contact <b>210</b> of the female connector <b>205</b> remain dimensionally unchanged, the connector <b>205</b> remains electromechanically compatible with the full range of male 4.3/10 connectors <b>20</b>. However, the female connector <b>205</b> can improve protection against connector interface damage by providing a block against interconnection with the easily confused variants of the 4.3/10 connection interface without significantly impacting the electrical performance of the resulting interconnection.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0059">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>-<b>26</b></figref>, another approach to prevent unwanted mating of the 4.3/10 female connector is illustrated. This approach recognizes that the ability of the Mini-Din outer conductor connection cylinder <b>30</b> to fit within the outer contact of the female connector, thereby splaying the fingers radially outwardly, enables damaging erroneous interconnection between a female 4.3/10 interface and a male Mini-Din connector. As a solution, a female connector <b>305</b> includes a barrier plug <b>355</b> seated along the inner diameter of the outer contact <b>310</b>. The barrier plug <b>355</b> provides a stop face <b>352</b> aligned with a distal end of the outer contact <b>310</b> that is operative to prevent insertion of a Mini-Din outer conductor connection cylinder <b>30</b> within the outer contact <b>310</b> of the female connector <b>305</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0060">The barrier plug <b>355</b> may be interlocked with the outer contact <b>310</b>. As one example, an inward protrusion of the outer contact spring fingers <b>312</b> keys with an outer diameter groove <b>354</b> of the barrier plug <b>355</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>, <b>18</b> and <b>21</b></figref>). In other embodiments, a barrier plug <b>355</b>&#x2032; may be interlocked with the outer contact <b>310</b> via a seat <b>357</b> provided proximate the distal end of the spring fingers <b>312</b> that keys with a retaining tab <b>360</b> provided on the outer surface <b>370</b> of the barrier plug <b>355</b>&#x2032; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, <b>19</b> and <b>20</b></figref>). Alternatively, protrusions provided on an outer surface of the barrier plug may key with corresponding grooves and/or bores provided in the spring fingers (and vice versa) in any configuration which retains the barrier plug <b>355</b> coupled with the outer contact <b>310</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0061">To prevent the barrier plug <b>355</b> from interfering with the range of motion/outward bias of the spring fingers <b>312</b> required for secure engagement with the inner diameter of the conical surface of interface cylinder <b>15</b> of a 4.3/10 male connector interface (best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>), the barrier plug <b>355</b> may be formed with an interior ring <b>365</b> of relatively rigid/higher strength dielectric polymer and an outer surface <b>370</b> formed of an elastomeric dielectric polymer (either as an outer ring layer or plurality of outer nubs). Due to the elastomeric nature of the outer surface <b>370</b>, the presence of the barrier plug <b>355</b> may avoid interfering with the relative motion of the spring fingers <b>312</b> during initial interconnection alignment and/or negatively impacting the outward bias of the spring fingers, but still have sufficient strength to resist axial displacement along the bore in order to maintain a stop surface <b>352</b>. The stop surface <b>352</b> can prevent the cylinder <b>30</b> of a Mini-Din connector <b>25</b> from further axial insertion which would otherwise result in splaying the outer contact <b>310</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>-<b>20</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0062">One skilled in the art will appreciate that the fit between the outer surface <b>370</b> and the spring fingers <b>312</b> (combined with the elastomeric properties of the outer surface material that is selected, such as silicon or the like) may also be configured to increase the outward bias of the spring fingers <b>312</b>, enabling a reduction in the bias properties required for the outer contact <b>310</b> alone. This configuration can enable the outer contact <b>310</b> to be provided with reduced dimensions and/or be formed of more cost efficient materials than may be possible without the presence of the barrier plug <b>355</b>. Alternatively, the outer surface <b>370</b> may be provided as the relatively rigid/higher strength dielectric polymer while the interior ring <b>365</b> is provided as elastomeric dielectric polymer.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0063">In further embodiments, a barrier plug <b>355</b>&#x2033; may be formed as an axial extrusion of relatively rigid dielectric material positioned coaxially between the inner and outer contacts (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>-<b>26</b></figref>). The plug <b>355</b>&#x2033; includes an outer sleeve <b>380</b>, an inner sleeve <b>382</b> and spokes <b>384</b>. The plug <b>355</b>&#x2033; provides a plurality of apertures between the spokes <b>384</b> to minimize material requirements but can still withstand the expected axial insertion forces against the stop face from attempts to apply a Mini-Din connector or the like.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0064">One skilled in the art will appreciate that the application of a barrier plug <b>355</b>, <b>355</b>&#x2032;, <b>355</b>&#x2033; in the female connection interface of a 4.3/10 connector can improve protection against connector interface damage by providing a stop face against interconnection with the easily confused variants of the 4.3/10 connection interface, without significantly impacting the electrical performance of the resulting interconnection.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0065">As another approach to addressing incorrect mating with a 4.3/10 female connector, it may be desirable to provide a design in which the spring fingers are less susceptible to deformation and breakage. To that end, an additional embodiment of a spring basket <b>410</b> for a connector <b>405</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b> and <b>28</b></figref>. The spring basket <b>410</b> has spring fingers <b>412</b> that form a gap with an outer conductor body like that shown at <b>210</b> above. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b> and <b>28</b></figref>, the fingers <b>412</b> essentially define a ring with slots <b>413</b> formed in one end thereof, with the fingers <b>412</b> flaring radially outwardly slightly.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0066">It may be desirable for the fingers <b>412</b> to exert a similar radial force on the outer conductor body of a mating conductor as that exerted by the fingers <b>212</b> described above. For analytical purposes the fingers <b>412</b> can be approximated as cantilever beams. The force applied by a deflected cantilevered beam can be calculated as:</p><p id="p-0064" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>N</i>=(3<i>DEI</i>)/<i>L</i><sup>3 </sup>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0065" num="0000">wherein<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0067">N=the force normal to the beam (in this instance, the radial force generated by the finger <b>412</b>);</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0068">D=the amount of deflection experienced by the beam (i.e., the radial deflection of the finger <b>412</b>);</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0069">E=elastic modulus of the material of the beam/finger <b>412</b>;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0070">I=moment of inertia through the cross-section of the beam/finger <b>412</b>; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0071">L=length of the beam/finger <b>412</b>.<br/>Thus, for two fingers <b>412</b> formed of the same material (such that E is the same in both equations) to exert a similar radial force N on a mating outer conductor, the geometry of the fingers <b>412</b> and the overall spring basket <b>410</b> may be adjusted. For example, if it is desired to provide a more robust finger <b>412</b> that is less susceptible to breakage, the thickness of the finger <b>412</b> may be increased. However, increasing the thickness raises the moment of inertia I, which in turn increases the radial force. In addition, a shorter finger <b>412</b> may also be less inclined to break under an axial load; however, a decrease in length may also raise the radial force. One manner of addressing the increased radial load is to decrease the amount of deflection induced by mating of the fingers <b>412</b> with a mating connector, particularly if the thickness is increased.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0066" num="0072">For comparative purposes, in the embodiment of the outer conductor body <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the fingers <b>12</b> may have a length of between about 0.252 and 0.260 inch, a width of 0.19 to 0.20 inch, a thickness of 0.012 to 0.015 inch, and a deflection distance of between 0.010 and 0.015 inch. As such, applying the concepts discussed above, the embodiment of the spring basket <b>410</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b> and <b>28</b></figref> would have the same width, but would have a decreased length of between about 0.230 and 0.24 inch and an increased thickness of between about 0.015 and 0.018 inch. This decrease in finger length would increase the radial force significantly, which can be counteracted by decreasing the deflection distance induced by mating to between 0.005 and 0.008 inch, with an outer diameter of the ring of fingers being between about 0.46 and 0.47 inch. This approach can generally maintain the radial force of the fingers <b>412</b>, strengthen the fingers <b>412</b> against breakage and/or deformation from the axial overloading of incorrect mating of connectors, and still provide a connector that conforms to the 4.3/10 guidelines.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0073">Notably, this concept can be applied not only to the spring basket discussed above, but also to other connectors conforming to the 4.3/10 interface guidelines that employ radial force between mating conductors, such as those shown in EP 2 304 851, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref> applies the concept to a spring basket <b>510</b> that has a slightly different configuration, as the spring basket <b>510</b> has only six slots <b>513</b> (and therefore six fingers <b>512</b>) rather than the eight slots <b>413</b> and eight fingers <b>412</b> discussed above. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>, the slots <b>513</b> are all oriented in the same direction (i.e., toward the top and bottom of the page in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>), which can simplify manufacturing of the spring basket <b>510</b>, as the slots <b>513</b> may be formed by a saw or other cutting blade. Notably, the fingers <b>512</b> are of two different sizes: four fingers <b>512</b><i>a </i>are of a size similar to the fingers <b>412</b>, whereas two fingers <b>512</b><i>b </i>are slightly more than twice the size of the fingers <b>412</b>. As such, either the thickness or the induced deflection of the fingers <b>512</b><i>b </i>may be varied if the radial force is to be generally the same as for the fingers <b>512</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0069" num="0075">While the present invention has been illustrated by the description of the embodiments thereof, and while the embodiments have been described in considerable detail, it is not the intention of the applicant to restrict or in any way limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail.
