The first shank portion <b>43</b> is provided near the top end thereof with an axle assembly <b>45</b>. The axle assembly <b>45</b> is located in the elongated groove <b>21</b> of the shank <b>20</b>. In this preferred embodiment, the axle assembly <b>45</b> is composed of a screw member <b>451</b> and a ring member <b>453</b>. The screw member <b>451</b> is a threaded rod, and the ring member <b>453</b> is made of a wear-resistant material such as metal or ceramic. The screw member <b>451</b> is inserted through the ring member <b>453</b> and screwed into the first shank portion <b>43</b> at a position near the top end of the first shank portion <b>43</b> to combine the ring member <b>453</b> and the first shank portion <b>43</b> together. Meanwhile, the ring member <b>453</b> is rotatable relative to the screw member <b>451</b>, and the diameter of the ring member <b>453</b> is a little smaller than the width of the elongated groove <b>21</b> so that the ring member <b>453</b> is just able to be accommodated in the elongated groove <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In other practicable embodiments, the axle assembly <b>45</b> may be integrally formed on the first shank portion <b>43</b> near the top end of the first shank portion <b>43</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The second handle <b>50</b> is connected to the bottom end of the first shank portion <b>43</b> for the user to hold the second handle <b>50</b> and apply force thereto.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The second shear blade <b>60</b> has a second blade portion <b>61</b> and a second shank portion <b>63</b>.

The larger the distance between the axle assembly <b>45</b> and the second pivot member <b>67</b>, the longer the arm of force between the second pivot member <b>67</b> and the axle assembly <b>45</b>, and the greater the resulting torque. The user operating the first handle <b>30</b> and the second handle <b>50</b> under the condition with relatively greater torque can save effort certainly.

Until the first blade portion <b>41</b> and the second blade portion <b>61</b> are opened to the maximum, the axle assembly <b>45</b> and the second pivot member <b>67</b> have the longest distance therebetween, which means the arm of force is the longest and the resulting torque is relatively greater during the shear.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">When the shears cut a branch relatively larger in diameter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the axle assembly <b>45</b> and the second pivot member <b>67</b> have the longest distance therebetween, which means the arm of force is the longest to bring the condition with the greatest torque. Therefore, the user can apply relatively smaller force to cut the branch relatively larger in diameter, so that the effort-saving effect is attained. When cutting the branch, the user applies force to the first handle <b>30</b> and the second handle <b>50</b> to close them inwardly. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the axle assembly <b>45</b> is firstly moved along the elongated groove <b>21</b> of the shank <b>20</b> in the direction of approaching the second pivot member <b>67</b> and then moved in the direction of leaving the second pivot member <b>67</b>, so as to make the first blade portion <b>41</b> and the second blade portion <b>61</b> completely closed to attain the objective of pruning the branch.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Accordingly, the present invention provides a gardening shears having an effort-saving structure, which has the technical feature that the axle assembly <b>45</b> moving along the elongated groove <b>21</b> of the shank <b>20</b> can change the torque produced by the force applied on the handles during operation to save the user effort, thereby having convenience in use.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the primary structure of a gardening shears <b>10</b>&#x2032; having an effort-saving structure of a second preferred embodiment of the present invention is approximately the same with the first preferred embodiment, but has the following difference.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The axle assembly <b>45</b>&#x2032; is composed of a pin <b>451</b>&#x2032;, a bearing <b>453</b>&#x2032; and a washer <b>455</b>&#x2032;. The pin <b>451</b>&#x2032; is inserted through the bearing <b>453</b>&#x2032; and the washer <b>455</b>&#x2032;, and then fixed to a through hole <b>431</b>&#x2032; of the first shank portion <b>43</b>&#x2032; at a position near the top end of the first shank portion <b>43</b>&#x2032; in a tight fit manner. The outer diameter of the bearing <b>453</b>&#x2032; is a little smaller than the width of the elongated groove <b>21</b>&#x2032; so that the bearing <b>453</b>&#x2032; is just able to be accommodated in the elongated groove <b>21</b>&#x2032; and thereby the effect of the axle assembly <b>45</b>&#x2032; moving along the elongated groove <b>21</b>&#x2032; of the shank <b>20</b>&#x2032; is achieved. Therefore, the axle assembly <b>45</b> is unlimited to the type provided in the preferred embodiments of the present invention. Besides, the arrangement of the bearing <b>453</b>&#x2032; is also effective in reducing the wear during moving along the elongated groove <b>21</b>&#x2032; and making the cutting action relatively smoother.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As a result, it can be seen that the second preferred embodiment of the present invention can not only achieve the effect of moving the axle assembly along the elongated groove of the shank to achieve the change of the torque produced by the force applied on the handles during operation to save the user effort, but also reduce wear to increase the life time of the shears of the present invention and make the cutting action relatively smoother.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
