num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a high-strength steel material, and manufacturing method therefor, and more particularly, to a high-strength steel material having superior ductility, and a manufacturing method therefor.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Structural steel materials used for ships, offshore structures, building structures, etc. tend to require high strength properties for use thereof. In order to reduce the weight of a structure while satisfying the structural strength required for the steel structure, the strength of the steel material should be excellent.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">On the other hand, in the process of manufacturing a steel structure, curved forming is usually accompanied by bending, but if ductility is insufficient, tears may occur in the steel plate during curved forming. When the steel plate is torn by such a curved forming, a problem in that the manufacturing time is significantly long may occur.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition, the exterior wall of the hull may be torn due to a stranding or collision or between ships during ship operations. In this case, it may lead to flooding or sinking, resulting in damage to life and property. In particular, if the ship's cargo is crude oil or petroleum products, it may lead to serious marine environmental accidents.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In this way, in order to prevent the steel plate from being torn due to a collision during ship operations or curved forming during manufacturing of a steel structure, and to prevent the exterior wall of the hull from being torn in the event of a collision with an external object, the ductility of the steel material applied to the exterior wall must be high enough to absorb impact energy.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, since strength and ductility are in inverse proportion to each other, it may not be easy to manufacture a steel plate having excellent strength and ductility simultaneously. Nevertheless, many efforts have been made to solve the problems as mentioned above.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, in Patent Document 1, the average grain size of ferrite as the main phase is 3 to 12 &#x3bc;m, the ferrite fraction is controlled to be 90% or more, and the average equivalent circle diameter of the second phase is controlled to be 0.8 &#x3bc;m or less. Thereby, a steel plate having excellent collision absorption properties with having a tensile strength of 490 MPa or more and a uniform elongation of 15% or more is described.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Patent Document 1 describes a steel plate having a tensile strength of 490 MPa or more and a uniform elongation of 15% or more. However, it does not clearly describe the total elongation secured by the disclosure, although the total elongation (or fracture elongation) is more related to the fracture of the steel plate than the uniform elongation.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Patent Document 2 describes a steel material in which the structure consists of ferrite and a hard second phase, the volume fraction of ferrite is 75% or more in the total thickness of the plate, the hardness is 140 Hv or more, 160 or less, and the average grain size is 2 &#x3bc;m or more by applying manufacturing conditions consisting of front cooling, air colling, and rear cooling in the cooling process after rolling. Thereby, it may provide a steel material having a tensile strength of 490 MPa or more and a uniform elongation of 20% or more.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Patent Document 2 has excellent tensile strength of 490 MPa or more and uniform elongation of 20% or more. However, even if the uniform elongation is excellent, the total elongation is not necessarily excellent, so it is unclear as to what the extent of the total elongation corresponding to the fracture elongation is.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In Patent Document 3, in order to increase the energy absorbing capacity during collision, it is described of the thick steel plate having a microstructure consisting of a main phase of ferrite and a second phase mainly composed of pearlite. Further, there is described of the thick steel plate that the average dislocation density of ferrite is lowered to a certain lever or less while the hardness, fraction, average area, and average peripheral length of the second phase satisfy predetermined conditions. To this end, a manufacturing method in which a steel material is heated to the high temperature higher than a general reheating temperature, then controlled rolling is performed, and air cooled or soft water cooled is disclosed.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Patent Document 4 describes a method for manufacturing a steel plate having high strength and high ductility that minimizes the difference in hardness between the surface layer and the center at thickness, by satisfying a ferrite area fraction of 80 to 95% and pearlite area fraction of 5 to 20%, and by limiting the grain size, aspect ratio, and dislocation density of ferrite. Thereby, it may to provide a steel plate having a tensile strength of 490 MPa or more, and an elongation of 23 to 40% or more depending on the thickness of the plate.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Patent Documents 3 and 4 can manufacture a steel plate having a tensile strength of 490 MPa or more and excellent ductility. However, in order to control S to 0.003% or less, it is inevitable to accompany the load in a steel making process. In addition, the reheating temperature is outside of the normal range, so difficulties in manufacturing the steel plate are expected.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR TECHNICAL LITERATURE</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0014">(Patent Document 1) Korea Patent No. 10-0914590</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0015">(Patent Document 2) Korea Patent Publication No. 10-2016-0104077</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0016">(Patent Document 3) Japan Patent No. 5994819</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0017">(Patent Document 4) Japan Patent No. 6007968</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0018">An aspect of the present disclosure is to provide a steel material having high strength properties and also having superior ductility, and a manufacturing method therefor.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019">An object of the present disclosure is not limited to the above description.

On the other hand, if the content thereof exceeds 0.17%, the tensile strength can be secured, but it becomes difficult to secure the ductility targeted in the present disclosure. Since ductility is inversely proportional to the pearlite area fraction, when the carbon (C) content increases, the pearlite increases, which is disadvantageous in securing ductility.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0034">Therefore, the content of the carbon (C) may be 0.14 to 0.17%, more preferably 0.15 to 0.165%.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0035">Silicon (Si): 0.3 to 0.5%</p><p id="p-0034" num="0036">Silicon (Si) is an element that is effective for deoxidation and increases hardenability, so that it should be added in an amount of 0.3% or more to secure tensile strength.

In order to make the polygonal ferrite grain size significantly fine, many industrial efforts are required, such as a significantly low reheating temperature or increasing the reduction ratio during rolling. It is significantly difficult to have a ferrite grain size of 2 &#x3bc;m or less through general thick steel plate rolling. In addition, when the ferrite grain size is below a certain level, the uniform elongation is greatly reduced and the total elongation is also reduced accordingly. Therefore, in order to secure the target tensile strength in the present disclosure, the pearlite fraction should be sufficiently high while reduce the ferrite grain size. If the pearlite area fraction is less than 20%, it is difficult to secure the tensile strength targeted in the present disclosure, and if it exceeds 30%, it is difficult to secure the elongation.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0065">It is preferable that bainite is not contained in other structures.

The higher the reheating temperature, the coarser austenite is, and the higher the amount of Nb solid solution increases, which pancakes the austenite during the rolling process. When the reheating temperature exceeds 1200&#xb0; C., Nb solid solution increases, but austenite becomes too coarse during reheating, so there is a problem in that polygonal ferrite grains are not sufficiently refined in the final microstructure. On the other hand, if the temperature is less than 1100&#xb0; C., Nb solid solution becomes insufficient, and pancaking of austenite during rolling may not be sufficiently achieved, so there may be a limit to refinement of polygonal ferrite.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0073">The reheating time depends on the thickness of the steel slab.

When air cooling is applied, it is advantageous to obtain a microstructure consisting only of polygonal ferrite and pearlite. On the other hand, when water cooling is applied, not only pearlite but also bainite is included as the second phase, so the strength is excessively increased, and the cooling variation for the steel material compared to air cooling deepens, thereby increasing variation in elongation. For the same reason, even with air cooling, if the cooling rate is too fast, the problem as described above may occur, so the upper limit of the cooling rate may be 5&#xb0; C./s. However, if the air cooling rate is too slow, polygonal ferrite becomes coarse and it is difficult to secure tensile strength. Therefore, the cooling rate must be 1&#xb0; C./s or more. In addition, since the air cooling rate of the steel plate may be determined according to the thickness of the steel plate, the thickness of the steel plate may be limited to 15 mm or less in order to secure the air cooling rate of the steel plate of 1&#xb0; C./s or more.
