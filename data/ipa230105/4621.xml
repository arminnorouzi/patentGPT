This way, all people can exercise and enjoy their rights to freedom of expression and other fundamental human rights. Accordingly, websites and web tools should be properly designed and coded, so that people with disabilities can use them. Currently, many websites and web tools are developed with accessibility barriers that make them difficult or impossible for some to use. Making the web accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society as a whole. International web standards define what is needed for accessibility. An example web standard is the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aspects of this disclosure describe providing web accessibility for people with disabilities using an accessibility graphical user interface (GUI) incorporated within websites.

A network may also include a public switched telephone network (&#x201c;PSTN&#x201d;) and/or a wireless cellular network. A network may be a secured network or unsecured network. In other embodiments, one or more components of the system may communicate directly through a dedicated communication network. Direct communications may use any suitable technologies, including, for example, BLUETOOTH&#x2122;, BLUETOOTH LE&#x2122; (BLE), Wi-Fi, near field communications (NFC), or other suitable communication methods that provide a medium for exchanging data and/or information between separate entities.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In connection with some embodiments, machine learning/artificial intelligence models may be trained using training examples. The models may employ learning algorithms. Some non-limiting examples of such learning algorithms may include classification algorithms, data regressions algorithms, image segmentation algorithms, visual detection algorithms (such as object detectors, face detectors, person detectors, motion detectors, edge detectors, etc.), visual recognition algorithms (such as face recognition, person recognition, object recognition, etc.), speech recognition algorithms, mathematical embedding algorithms, natural language processing algorithms, support vector machines, random forests, nearest neighbors algorithms, deep learning algorithms, artificial neural network algorithms, convolutional neural network algorithms, recursive neural network algorithms, linear machine learning models, non-linear machine learning models, ensemble algorithms, and so forth. For example, a trained machine learning algorithm may include an inference model, such as a predictive model, a classification model, a regression model, a clustering model, a segmentation model, an artificial neural network (such as a deep neural network, a convolutional neural network, a recursive neural network, etc.), a random forest, a support vector machine, and so forth. In some examples, the training examples may include example inputs together with the desired outputs corresponding to the example inputs. Further, in some examples, training machine learning algorithms using the training examples may generate a trained machine learning algorithm, and the trained machine learning algorithm may be used to estimate outputs for inputs not included in the training examples. In some examples, engineers, scientists, processes and machines that train machine learning algorithms may further use validation examples and/or test examples. For example, validation examples and/or test examples may include example inputs together with the desired outputs corresponding to the example inputs, a trained machine learning algorithm and/or an intermediately trained machine learning algorithm may be used to estimate outputs for the example inputs of the validation examples and/or test examples, the estimated outputs may be compared to the corresponding desired outputs, and the trained machine learning algorithm and/or the intermediately trained machine learning algorithm may be evaluated based on a result of the comparison. In some examples, a machine learning algorithm may have parameters and hyper parameters, where the hyper parameters are set manually by a person or automatically by a process external to the machine learning algorithm (such as a hyper parameter search algorithm), and the parameters of the machine learning algorithm are set by the machine teaming algorithm according to the training examples. In some implementations, the hyper-parameters are set according to the training examples and the validation examples, and the parameters are set according to the training examples and the selected hyper-parameters.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some examples, a trained machine learning algorithm may be used as an inference model that when provided with an input generates an inferred output. For example, a trained machine learning algorithm may include a classification algorithm, the input may include a sample, and the inferred output may include a classification of the sample (such as an inferred label, an inferred tag, and so forth). In another example, a trained machine teaming algorithm may include a regression model, the input may include a sample, and the inferred output may include an inferred value for the sample. In yet another example, a trained machine learning algorithm may include a clustering model, the input may include a sample, and the inferred output may include an assignment of the sample to at least one cluster. In an additional example, a trained machine learning algorithm may include a classification algorithm, the input may include an image, and the inferred output may include a classification of an item depicted in the image. In yet another example, a trained machine learning algorithm may include a regression model, the input may include an image, and the inferred output may include an inferred value for an item depicted in the image (such as an estimated property of the item, such as size, volume, age of a person depicted in the image, cost of a product depicted in the image, and so forth). In an additional example, a trained machine teaming algorithm may include an image segmentation model, the input may include an image, and the inferred output may include a segmentation of the image. In yet another example, a trained machine teaming algorithm may include an object detector, the input may include an image, and the inferred output may include one or more detected objects in the image and/or one or more locations of objects within the image. In some examples, the trained machine learning algorithm may include one or more formulas and/or one or more functions and/or one or more rules and/or one or more procedures, the input may be used as input to the formulas and/or functions and/or rules and/or procedures, and the inferred output may be based on the outputs of the formulas and/or functions and/or rules and/or procedures (for example, selecting one of the outputs of the formulas and/or functions and/or rules and/or procedures, using a statistical measure of the outputs of the formulas and/or functions and/or rules and/or procedures, and so forth).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, artificial neural networks may be configured to analyze inputs and generate corresponding outputs. Some non-limiting examples of such artificial neural networks may include shallow artificial neural networks, deep artificial neural networks, feedback artificial neural networks, feed forward artificial neural networks, autoencoder artificial neural networks, probabilistic artificial neural networks, time delay artificial neural networks, convolutional artificial neural networks, recurrent artificial neural networks, long/short term memory artificial neural networks, and so forth. In some examples, an artificial neural network may be configured manually. For example, a structure of the artificial neural network may be selected manually, a type of an artificial neuron of the artificial neural network may be selected manually, a parameter of the artificial neural network (such as a parameter of an artificial neuron of the artificial neural network) may be selected manually, and so forth. In some examples, an artificial neural network may be configured using a machine learning algorithm. For example, a user may select hyper-parameters for the artificial neural network and/or the machine learning algorithm, and the machine learning algorithm may use the hyper-parameters and training examples to determine the parameters of the artificial neural network, for example using back propagation, using gradient descent, using stochastic gradient descent, using mini-batch gradient descent, and so forth. In some examples, an artificial neural network may be created from two or more other artificial neural networks by combining the two or more other artificial neural networks into a single artificial neural network.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Disclosed embodiments may involve altering a display of a website to address disabilities of users. The term website may refer to any public, private, or semi-private web property including a collection of content to be presented to the public or to a limited audience. The web properties may be provided to users via one or more servers that implements the basic World Wide Web standards for the coding and transmission of HTML data. It will be understood to one skilled in the art that the web properties may be stored in a single server associated with a single geographic or a physical location but may also be stored in multiple geographically distributed servers that may be interconnected via one or more communications systems. Examples of such web properties include web sites, mobile websites, web pages within a larger website (e.g., profile pages on a social networking website, ecommerce product pages, etc.), vertical information portals, distributed applications, and other digital data sources accessible by any device via a wired or wireless network connection, including RSS feeds, blogs and vlogs, electronic newsletters, or blast emails.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Embodiments disclosed herein may include displaying a website exhibiting various website display parameters. The website display parameters or simply display parameters) may include properties whose values provide constraints on a presentation of a website or a webpage on a screen associated with a computing device of the user. Examples of website display parameters may include content scaling, readable font, highlight titles, highlight links, text magnifier, font size, line height, letter spacing, align center, align left, align right, contrast, monochrome, saturation, text colors, title colors, background color, mute sounds, hide images, read mode, reading guide, stop animation, highlight hover, and cursor appearance. Consistent with the present disclosure, a website may have an associated set of default values for the display parameters. The set of default values for the display parameters may be defined in a code associated with the website. For example, the set of default values may indicate that a first title on the website has a font size of 14 pt and a second title on the website has a font size of 18 pt. In additional embodiments, a website may include a plurality of sets of default values for the display parameters for the same content. A selection of one of the plurality of sets of default values may depend on the type of computing device used for displaying the website. For example, the first title on the website may have a font size of 14 pt when displayed on desktop computers and font size of 8 pt when displayed on mobile devices, such as, smartphones.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Disclosed embodiments may include implementing one or more changes in web display parameters to address a disability of a user. Consistent with the present disclosure, implementing changes in a web display parameter may include modifying values of that website display parameter in the website code. For example, in order to address a visual impairment of a user, the font size of all the titles on the website may be changed from a font size of 4 pt to a font size of 22 pt. The implementation of the change may take place in a code of the website. The term website code, as used above, may include software, firmware, and/or microcode, and may refer to programs, routines, functions, classes, data structures, and/or objects. The website code may include: (i) descriptive text to be parsed, such as HTML (hypertext markup language) or XML (extensible markup language), (ii) assembly code, (iii) object code generated from source code by a compiler, (iv) source code for execution by an interpreter, (v) source code for compilation and execution by a just-in-time compiler, etc. As examples only, website code may be written using syntax from languages including C, C++, C#, Objective-C, Haskell, Go, SQL, R, Lisp, Java&#xae;, Fortran, Perl, Pascal, Curl, OCaml, Javascript&#xae;, HTML5, Ada, ASP (active server pages), PHP, Scala, Eiffel, Smalltalk, Erlang, Ruby, Flash&#xae;, Visual Basic&#xae;, Lua, and Python&#xae;. Consistent with the present disclosure, the website code may be updated or revised for implementing one or more changes in web display parameters to address a disability of a user. In some embodiments, the changes to the website code may be local, i.e., the changes may affect the presentation of the website on the user's computing device and may not affect the presentation of the website on other users' computing devices.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Disclosed embodiments may involve providing an accessibility GUI (graphical user interface) for implementing changes in the website presentation. An accessibility GUI generally refers to an interface which allows users to customize website display parameters through graphical elements (e.g., icons, menus, scroll bars, windows, transitional animations, dialogue boxes, and more). In one embodiment, the disclosed methods may involve receiving input via the accessibility GUI indicative of a selection for adjusting one or more website display parameters. The received input may include any type of data inputted by a user using an input device, such as a keyboard, a mouse, a touch pad, a touch screen, a joystick, a microphone, an image sensor, and/or any other device connectable to the computing device. In some examples, the received input may be in the form of at least one of: text, sounds, speech, hand gestures, body gestures, or tactile information. Consistent with the present disclosure, the accessibility GUI may be presented by default whenever a website is uploaded and may be closed upon receiving an input. Alternatively, the accessibility GUI may be presented upon receiving an indication that the user of the website may have a disability. In a first example, the indication may include clicking on an accessibility icon shown at the bottom of the website. In a second example, the indication may include retrieving stored information suggesting that the user of the website may have a disability.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some embodiments, the input received via the accessibility GUI may be indicative of a selection of a specific web accessibility profile. As used herein, a web accessibility profile (or simply an accessibility profile) may include any type of data that may be used to determine a particular disability associated with a user. The selection of a web accessibility profile may trigger a bundle of predefined changes in a group of display parameters. Example web accessibility profiles may include a seizure safe profile, a vision impaired profile, a cognitive disability profile, a neurodevelopmental disorder profile, a screen reader profile, an elderly profile, a multi-disability profile, and/or any other grouping of predefined changes designed to address a condition. Consistent with the present disclosure, the web accessibility profile selection may have an associated set of disability profile values for the web display parameters. In some embodiments, the disability profile values may be different from the default values of the web display parameters. Upon receiving the user's selection, the method may include implementing a predefined template to alter one or more default website display parameters to conform with the needs of the specific disability of the website user. For example, upon selection of a visual impaired profile, disclosed embodiments may include implementing a predefined template associated with a visual impaired profile to alter the website display parameter &#x201c;font size parameter&#x201d; associated with all the titles to have a value of 20 pt, and to adjust the alter website display parameter &#x201c;saturation parameter&#x201d; to increase display intensity.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">One implementation of the disclosed embodiment may include alternating default display parameters to conform with a visual impairment profile. The visual impairment profile may be designed for disabilities such as degrading eyesight, tunnel vision, cataract, glaucoma, and others. Visual disabilities range from mild or moderate vision loss in one or both eyes (&#x201c;low vision&#x201d;) to substantial and uncorrectable vision loss in both eyes (&#x201c;blindness&#x201d;). For example, some website users have reduced or lack of sensitivity to certain colors (&#x201c;color blindness&#x201d;), or increased sensitivity to bright colors. These variations in perception of colors and brightness can be independent of the visual acuity. To address the particular visual disabilities of website users, the accessibility GUI may enable website users to change the presentation of web content into forms that are more usable for their particular needs. Changes to presentation may include, for example, enlarging or reducing text size and images, customizing settings for fonts, colors, and spacing, text-to-speech synthesis of the content, providing audio descriptions of video in multimedia, reading text using refreshable Braille, and/or any other visual, audible, or tactile alteration. In one embodiment, upon selection of the visual impairment profile, the disclosed software may alter a plurality of web display parameters to ensure that the presentation of web content is adapted to visually impaired users.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Another implementation of the disclosed embodiment may include alternating default display parameters to conform with a seizure-safe profile. Seizure disorders include different types of epilepsy and migraines, which may be in reaction to visual flickering or audio signals at certain frequencies or patterns. A seizure-safe profile is designed to eliminate the risk of seizures that result from flashing or blinking animations and risky color combinations. In one embodiment, upon selection of the seizure-safe profile, the disclosed software may limit the movement on the display to prevent blinking animation or to alter animations on the website such that they do not change at a rate greater than three frames per second.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Other implementations of the disclosed embodiment may include alternating default display parameters to conform with a cognitive disability profile and alternating default display parameters to conform with a neurodevelopmental disorder profile. The cognitive disability profile may be designed to help users with cognitive disabilities such as autism, dyslexia, CVA, and others, to focus on essential elements more easily. The neurodevelopmental disorder profile may be designed to reduce distractions and noise. In general, cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities involve neurodiversity and neurological disorders, as well as behavioral and mental health disorders that are not necessarily neurological. They may affect any part of the nervous system and impact how well people hear, move, see, speak, and understand information. Cognitive and neurological disabilities do not necessarily affect the intelligence of a person. People with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities may require different types of web browsing methods, depending on their particular needs. In some examples, the accessibility GUI may enable website users to use text-to-speech software to hear the information while reading it visually or to use captions to read the information while hearing it. In other examples, the accessibility GUI may enable website users to use tools that resize text and spacing or customize colors to assist reading. In other examples, the accessibility GUI may enable website users to use grammar and spelling tools to support writing. In one embodiment, upon selection of the cognitive disability profile, the disclosed software may highlight titles and actionable objects on the website; and upon selection of the neurodevelopmental disorder profile, the disclosed software may execute a stop animation command in the website code to limit the movement on the display.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Other implementations may include alternating website code to conform with a screen reader profile. Websites are visual representations of coding structure and elements. Whatever depicted on a screen has been executed by the website code. As a result, most visually abled users can overlook the website code itself. In contrast, blind users, for example, consume and navigate websites using a screen reader. A screen reader may be software application that translates textual and graphical information displayed on a screen and re-present it to a user using synthesized speech. Screen readers are a form of assistive technology (AT) potentially useful to the blind, visually impaired, color blind, low vision, dyslexic, illiterate or learning disabled, often in combination with other ATs such as screen magnifiers and tools for manipulating font type, font size, contrast, and the like. Typically, a screen reader may avoid the visual screen and goes straight to the code to essentially examine and then relay back to the user what is being represented on the screen.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Therefore, a website code should properly reflect what is being viewed on the website. However, there are different ways to code certain elements (such as a menu or dropdowns) that will all look the same to a visually abled user. For a blind person who can't recognize a globally recognized structure of an element, they could get misled about a website's content. For example, many times images on websites are used to symbolize a category on a website or to reveal a new sale that has been launched. So visually abled users will be able to read text such as &#x201c;Children's clothes&#x201d; or &#x201c;30% off kitchen supplies&#x201d; on the image but users that use screen readers may just hear &#x201c;graphic&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Consistent with the present disclosure, upon selection of the blind-users profile, the disclosed software may alter the website code to ensure that the presentation of web content is adapted to users that uses screen readers. Disclosed embodiments may involve using AI to scan a website and understand all of the elements on a page. The determined contextual information may reflect the purpose of every element, the way it's coded, and also how the end-user is meant to perceive it. Thereafter, the website code may be updated to ensure that the screen reader will understand what a blind user needs to know. In one implementation, Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) attributes may be automatically added for context and behavior-related adjustments to optimize elements in the most comprehensive and efficient way. Examples of added ARIA attributes may include describing main menus, header structure, and recognition of important icons. In another implementation, alternative text may be added automatically to images using image recognition technology to add elaborate and accurate descriptions to all images. In yet another implementation, screen reader text may be automatically added to help the screen reader describe certain actions and areas based on the context of a website.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Other implementations may include alternating default display parameters or providing additional content to conform with an audio impairment profile. Auditory disabilities range from mild or moderate hearing loss in one or both ears (&#x201c;hard of hearing&#x201d;) to substantial and uncorrectable hearing loss in both ears (&#x201c;deafness&#x201d;). Some people with auditory disabilities can hear sounds but sometimes not sufficiently to understand all speech, especially when there is background noise. This can include people using hearing aids. While multimedia on the Web provides many opportunities for people with auditory disabilities, it also poses challenges when content or web players are not designed to be accessible. For example, while video content can be used to communicate information visually, audio content may require alternatives, such as transcripts and captions, so that it is accessible for people with auditory disabilities. In one embodiment, upon selection of the audio impairment profile, the disclosed software may provide transcripts and captions of audio content, adjust the text size and colors of captions, provide options to stop, pause, adjust the volume of audio content (independently of the system volume), and generate high-quality foreground audio that is clearly distinguishable from any background noise.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Other implementations of the disclosed embodiment may include alternating default display parameters or providing additional content to conform with a physical impairment profile. Physical disabilities (sometimes called &#x201c;motor disabilities&#x201d;) include weakness and limitations of muscular control (such as involuntary movements including tremors, lack of coordination, or paralysis), limitations of sensation, joint disorders (such as arthritis), pain that impedes movement, and missing limbs. Some people with physical disabilities rely on keyboard support to activate functionality provided on web pages. They may need more time to type, click, or carry out other interactions, and they may type single keystrokes in sequence rather than typing simultaneous keystrokes (&#x201c;chording&#x201d;) to activate commands. Such keystrokes may include commands for special characters, shortcut keys, and to active menu items. In addition, people with physical disabilities may have trouble clicking small areas and are more likely to make mistakes in typing and clicking. In one embodiment, upon selection of the physical impairment profile, the disclosed software may provide important design aspects such as larger clickable areas, extended time to complete tasks, and error correction options for forms. Moreover, the software may provide visible indicators of the current focus, and mechanisms to skip over blocks, such as over page headers, navigation bars, and more.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The foregoing list of profiles associated with disabilities is only exemplary. The disclosed systems, methods and computer readable media may be designed to alternate one or more default web display parameters based on a selection of other accessibility profiles.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which shows an example of a system <b>100</b> for enabling users <b>110</b> to personalize the accessibly display of websites.

In some embodiments, process may be executed by different components of system <b>100</b>. For example, some steps of process <b>300</b> may be implemented by a processing device within website host <b>120</b>, a processing device within accessibility service host <b>130</b>, and a processing device within computing device <b>170</b>. For purposes of illustration, in the following description, reference is made to certain components of system <b>100</b>. It will be appreciated, however, that other implementations are possible and that any combination of components or devices may be utilized to implement the steps of the exemplary process. It will also be readily appreciated that the illustrated process can be altered to modify the order of steps, delete steps, or further include additional steps, such as steps directed to optional embodiments.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Process <b>300</b> begins when processing device <b>210</b> (e.g., a processor of website host <b>120</b>) adds an accessibility code to a code of website <b>150</b> (step <b>310</b>). In some embodiments, the code of website <b>150</b> may be a JavaScript code and the added accessibly code may be less than a single line of code. Upon adding the accessibility code, processing device <b>210</b> (e.g., a processor of accessibility service host <b>130</b>) may enable an accessibility GUI to be incorporated in website <b>150</b> (step <b>320</b>). Such incorporation causes the accessibility GUI to be displayed by any computing device <b>170</b> when website <b>150</b> is opened. In addition, processing device <b>210</b> may scan and analyze the visual appearance of website <b>150</b> and its website code (step <b>330</b>). Thereafter and based on the analysis of the visual appearance of website <b>150</b> and its website code, processing device <b>210</b> may determine accessibility information (step <b>340</b>). Process <b>300</b> may include rescanning the website every period of time to keep it up to date. For example, processing device <b>210</b> may scan and analyze the visual appearance of website <b>150</b> and its website code every 24 hours to make sure that all new content that was uploaded to the website is accessible.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Process <b>300</b> may continue when processing device <b>210</b> (e.g., a processor of website host <b>120</b>) may use the determined accessibility information to update the website with accessibility information (step <b>350</b>). In one embodiment, the accessibility information may include descriptive information of images depicted on the website. The descriptive information may be audibly presented to visually impaired users that have difficulty seeing images depicted on the website. In another embodiment, the accessibility information may include identification of first elements used as titles but untagged as titles and second elements used as actionable objects but untagged as actionable objects. This enables highlighting titles and actionable objects to impact presentation of content on a computing device of a user with a cognitive disability. Upon updating the website code, the website may be compliant and certified according to accessibility guidelines. Thereafter, computing device <b>170</b> may be used to access and display website <b>150</b> that includes the accessibility GUI (step <b>360</b>). As will be described later in greater detail, processing device <b>210</b> may receive a selection of an accessibility profile (step <b>370</b>) and adapt the presentation of website <b>150</b> to conform with a disability of the user (step <b>380</b>). In one embodiment, adapting the presentation of website <b>150</b> may include audibly presenting descriptive information of images depicted on the website to visually impaired users. In another embodiment, adapting the presentation of website <b>150</b> may include altering one or more web display parameters.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Consistent with the present disclosure, a processing device of system <b>100</b> may use machine learning/artificial intelligence (as described earlier) to analyze the visual appearance of website <b>150</b> and its website code.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> are exemplary illustrations of a website code revision for making a website accessible for a visually impaired user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> depicts website <b>150</b> before user <b>110</b>A selected a vision impaired profile in accessibility GUI <b>400</b>.

An example of initiating a change in the website display parameter may involve accessing a website's code which may include software, firmware, and/or microcode, and may refer to programs, routines, functions, classes, data structures, and/or objects. The website code may include descriptive text, such as HyperText Markup Language or extensible markup language that is parsed upon initiating a first change. In another example, the website code may be in the form of assembly code or object code generated from source code by a compiler. Whatever form the website code is in, the website code itself, upon initiating the first change, may be updated, changed, or revised to address a disability of a user. Non-limiting examples of changing the website display parameter may include increasing or decreasing a font size of content on a website, a change of a font type of content on the website, or an increase or decrease of letter spacing of content on the website. The change of the website display parameter may be based on an identified, selected, or generated predefined adjustment. The change in the website display parameter may be initiated to address a first aspect of the disability. Addressing an aspect of a disability may refer to a directing efforts, commands, or attention to a feature, characteristic, or manner of a disability to alleviate or help ease the related features and/or characteristics of the disability. A disability may refer to an ailment, a disorder, an impairment, an injury, an affliction, an inability, an incapacity, an incompetency, or any other physical, mental, cognitive, or developmental condition that impairs, interferes with, or limits a person's ability. Non-limiting examples of disabilities may include a visual impairment, a seizure disorder, a cognitive disability, a neurodevelopmental disorder, and an audio impairment.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Further, the change of the website display parameter may be based on the predefined adjustment to address an aspect of a disability associated with a selected web accessibility profile. The change of the website display parameter may be automatic or based on a user input or an input indicative of a connected accessibility device. For example, the change of the website display parameter may be automatic and associated with or based on the type of website accessed by the user, the time the website is accessed by the user, or the geographic location or IP address of the user when accessing the website. Non-limiting examples of types of websites include news-type websites, sports websites, article websites, scholarly websites, and gaming websites. Non-limiting examples of the website is accessed may be in the morning of the day, the afternoon of the day, or during the night.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">For example, a user may select a vision impaired profile as the web accessibility profile. The vision impaired profile may be associated with website display parameters, for example, font type, font size, and letter spacing of a main header on a website. In some examples, predefined adjustments may be changes in the associated website display parameters and the changes may include changing the font type of the main header on the website, increasing the font size of the main header on the website, and/or increasing letter spacing of the main header on the website. The changes to the associated website display parameters may address aspects of a disability associated with the vision impaired profile. For example, the user may be visually impaired and find it difficult to navigate and read the website. By changing the font type of the header to an easier-to-read font type, increasing the font size of the main header, and increasing letter spacing of the main header, the user may be able to more easily and/or clearly navigate and read the website.

Data may be included or accessed in a data structure. As discussed elsewhere in this disclosure, data structures may include any collection of data values and relationships among them. The data may be stored linearly, horizontally, hierarchically, relationally, non-relationally, uni-dimensionally, multidimensionally, operationally, in an ordered manner, in an unordered manner, in an object-oriented manner, in a centralized manner, in a decentralized manner, in a distributed manner, in a custom manner, or in any manner enabling data access. Previously collected data may refer to data that was already gathered. This data may include a selection of a particular accessibility profile, selection of a specific font type or font size, or any other website display parameters. In some embodiments, the previously collected data may be associated with a specific user that selected the web accessibility profile. Advantageously, the previously collected data may be collected by the network when a specific user first uses and/or logs into the network. Upon using and/or logging into the network, the specific user may select a web accessibility profile vision impaired profile. Thus, the previously collected data may be stored in an associated memory and/or saved to the specific user's profile to avoid redundant collections of the same data. For examples, at least one of a first predefined adjustment and a second predefined adjustment may be determined based on previously collected data and therefore may be linked to the user's profile vision impaired profile. Depending on the user profile, different first predefined adjustments and different second predefined adjustments may be determined based on different previously collected data. In some embodiments, the previously collected data may be associated with multiple users having the disability associated with the selected web accessibility profile. For example, a processor may collect data over time from multiple computing devices used by multiple users with the same disability and web accessibility profile. This collected data may be stored in a shared memory. This previously collected data may be used to determine better or more accurate adjustments to website display parameters to increase the efficiency and/or accuracy of displaying and modifying websites for users with the disability.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In some embodiments, at least one of the first predefined adjustment and the second predefined adjustment are determined based on a Web Content Accessibility Guideline. Web Content Accessibility Guideline may refer to recommendations for making web content more accessible, primarily for people with disabilities. An example of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines includes WCAG 2.1. For example, at least one of the first predefined adjustment and the second predefined adjustments may be changes according to WCAG 2.1. For example, at least one of the first predefined adjustment and the second predefined adjustment may be a change according to WCAG standard 1.3.4 to ensure that web content can be displayed in the preferred orientation (e.g., portrait, landscape) of a user, a change according to WCAG standard 1.3.6 to help identify the user, or a change according to WCAG standard 1.4.10 to support low vision users by enabling easier readability and tracking through responsive design. In some embodiments, the first predefined adjustment may be associated with a binary value, and the second predefined adjustment may be associated with a range value. Binary value may refer to two values, numbers expressed in the base-2 numeral system, the binary numeral system, or a method of mathematical expression which uses only two symbols. Non-limiting examples of binary values include &#x201c;O&#x201d; (zero) and &#x201c;1&#x201d; (one). A range value may refer to a number or set of numbers that vary or extend between specified limits or more than two values in between a maximum and a minimum. A non-limiting example of a range value may be a font size between 8 pt and 72 pt. For example, the first predefined adjustment may be associated with a binary value of either &#x201c;0&#x201d; or &#x201c;1.&#x201d; &#x201c;0&#x201d; may indicate that the first predefined adjustment, changing the magnification of the website, is &#x201c;OFF.&#x201d; &#x201c;1&#x201d; may indicate that the first predefined adjustment, changing the magnification of the website, is &#x201c;ON.&#x201d; For example, the second predefined adjustment may be associated with a range value between 8 pt and 72 pt for the font size. The second predefined adjustment may be changing the font size from 8 pt to 16 pt.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In some embodiments, initiating the first change and the second change transform a presentation of the website to conform with needs of a user having the disability associated with the selected web accessibility profile.

A non-limiting example of executing the operations in the browser session upon receiving the script from the remote server may include JavaScript Remote Scripting (JSRS). JSRS may use HyperText Markup Language, a document object model, a transport layer, and a data format. The document object model may be manipulated through JavaScript to dynamically display and interact with the website. In some embodiments, a script tag or an iframe may be used instead of a transport layer.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Some embodiments involve displaying in the accessibility GUI graphical elements for customizing the selected web accessibility profile; upon initiating the first and second changes, receiving input indicative of a desired change in at least one of the first and second website display parameters; and adjusting the at least one of the first and second website display parameters based on the input to implement the desired change. Graphical elements may refer to objects that show relationships, hierarchy, and emphasis virtually. Non-limiting examples may include icons, menus, scroll bars, windows, transitional animations, and dialogue boxes. Customizing a selected web accessibility profile may include changing, modifying, adjusting, correcting, reshaping, revising, reworking, tweaking, varying, or altering a web accessibility profile. For example, an accessibility GUI may be in the form of a menu pane on a left side of a website. The accessibility GUI pane may include graphical elements such as an &#x201c;Accessibility Adjustments&#x201d; window pane, &#x201c;ON&#x201d; and &#x201c;OFF&#x201d; buttons/toggles, a &#x201c;Reset Settings&#x201d; button, a &#x201c;Statement&#x201d; button, a &#x201c;Hide Interface&#x201d; button, a query window &#x201c;Search the online dictionary . . . ,&#x201d; circular icons adjacent to each web accessibility profile to indicate a selection of one or more than one of the web accessibility profiles, a &#x201c;Content Adjustments&#x201d; window pane, a &#x201c;Content Scaling&#x201d; window pane with a button to increase or decrease content scaling of the website, an &#x201c;Adjust Font Sizing&#x201d; window pane with a button to increase or decrease the font size of the website, and one or more buttons labeled &#x201c;Highlight Titles,&#x201d; &#x201c;Highlight Links,&#x201d; &#x201c;Readable Font,&#x201d; &#x201c;Text Magnifier,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Align Center.&#x201d; Although some exemplary graphical elements have been described above, it is contemplated that the accessibility GUI may include one or more additional or alternative graphical elements that may allow a user to adjust, change, or modify one or more website display parameters. The one or more graphical elements may allow a user to customize the one or more selected web accessibility profiles.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In some embodiments, after a user selects a web accessibility profile one or more display parameters such as a first website display parameter and a second website display parameter may be changed from their default values. Subsequently, input indicative of a desired change in at least one of the first change and the second change may be received. In response, the first and/or the second display parameter may be further modified based on the received input. Advantageously, this may allow users to further change and/or modify the website. For example, the first change may be a change of a font type from Calibri to Arial and the second change may be a change from a font size of 8 pt to a font size of 10 pt. After these changes have been made, input may be received for changing and/or adjusting the at least one of the first and second website display parameters. For example, an input may be received to change the font type from the font type Arial to the font type Times New Roman. Additionally, or alternatively, an input may be received to change the font size from the font size of 10 pt to the font size of 12 pt. Thus, even after selecting a web accessibility profile, the user may modify the changes to website display parameters to further fine tune the display of the website.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">In some embodiments, upon initiating the first and second changes associated with a first selected web accessibility profile, a selection of a second web accessibility profile different from the first selected web accessibility profile may be received; reverting values of the first and second website display parameters to default values; and initiating at least one additional change to transform the presentation of the website to conform with needs of a user having the disability associated with the second web accessibility profile. A user may enter input on a computing device to select a second web accessibility profile. For example, the user may use a keyboard and/or mouse associated with the computing device to select from a graphical user interface and/or display a graphical element corresponding to the second web accessibility profile. For example, a first selected web accessibility profile may be a vision impaired profile. Another selection of a second web accessibility profile may be received that may be different than the first selected web accessibility profile. For example, the second web accessibility profile may be received of an ADHD Friendly Profile. Reverting values of the first and second website display parameters may include returning or changing the first and second website display parameter values to a previous or default state and/or values. Default values may refer to values and/or parameters preselected and/or predetermined by a computer program or other mechanism when no alternative is specified by a user or programmer. Advantageously, when a different web accessibility profile is selected, the first and second website display parameters, may be reverted to default website display parameters. In some embodiments, the default website display parameters may be associated with or correspond to the different web accessibility profile. Further, at least one additional change may be made to transform a presentation of the website to conform with needs of the user having a disability associated with the second web accessibility profile. For example, if the second web accessibility profile is the ADHD Friendly Profile the at least one additional change made may be removing advertisements, images, or other distractors from the presentation of the website. Some embodiments involve initiating the at least one additional change to transform the presentation of the website to conform with needs of the user having disabilities associated with both the first selected web accessibility profile and the second web accessibility profile. For example, the at least one additional change to transform the presentation of the website may be made to conform with needs of the user having disabilities associated with both the vision impaired profile and the ADHD Friendly Profile. This may be advantageous for users who have more than one disability.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In some embodiments, the web accessibility profile selection may be stored to thereby enable accessibility of the user during a future browsing session without reselection of the web accessibility profile. Web accessibility profiles may be stored in a memory. Memory, as discussed more fully in other portions of this disclosure, may include a RAM, a ROM, a hard desk, or any other mechanism capable of storing instructions. A future browsing session may refer to a browser session at a future time and not the first or current browsing session at the first or current time. Advantageously, a user's selection of a web accessibility profile may be saved and/or stored for future retrieval during future browsing sessions so that the user does not need to select his or her web accessibility profile every browsing session. For example, the selection may be stored in a memory, in a database, in a table, in a relational table, or in a linked list. The selection, no matter how it is stored, may be associated with a user identifier. The user identifier may include an IP address, a name of the user, and the type of disability or disabilities. In a future browsing session, previous selections may be retrieved by a processor. For example, the user may enter, via a computing device, a user identifier. This user identifier is then compared to previously stored selection's user identifiers to determine a match. Once a match is made, the previously stored selection, with a matching user identifier to the one entered, may be selected.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, a method for enabling users to alter website presentations based on selected web accessibility profiles may be provided. Such an exemplary method includes displaying an accessibility GUI for a website, wherein the accessibility GUI may include a plurality of web accessibility profiles associated with differing disabilities.

When the selected web accessibility profile is the vision impairment profile, a first website display parameter may be a content scaling parameter and a second website display parameter may be a saturation parameter. This profile may require changes to one or more website display parameters such as changing the font type, changing the font size, or changing spacing. In some embodiments, content scaling and saturation may be changed. Content scaling, as discussed more fully in other portions of this disclosure, may refer to adjusting, increasing, or decreasing content on a website. A saturation parameter, as discussed more fully in other portions of this disclosure, may refer to an intensity of a color on a website. In some embodiments, the method further includes adjusting the content scaling parameter in a website code to increase content scaling and adjusting the saturation parameter in the website code to increase display intensity. Website code, as discussed more fully in other portions of this disclosure, may refer to programs, routines, functions, classes, data structures, and/or objects. The website code may include descriptive text, such as HyperText Markup Language or extensible markup language. For example, if the user selects the vision impaired profile, the user may have a visual disability such as degrading eyesight. Thus, to help users with visual impairments, the content scaling parameter may be adjusted, by accessing and altering the website's code, to increase content scaling of the website from 1&#xd7; to 1.5&#xd7; so the user may more easily see the website's content. Likewise, the saturation parameter may be adjusted, by accessing and altering the website's code, to increase display intensity from 1 to 10 of the website so the user may more easily and clearly see the website's content.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">In some embodiments, a selected web accessibility profile may be a cognitive disability profile. When the selected web accessibility profile is the cognitive disability profile, a first website display parameter may be a highlight titles parameter and a second website display parameter may be a highlight actionable objects parameter. This profile may require changes to one or more website display parameters such as changing the font type, changing the font size, or changing spacing. In some embodiments, highlight titles and highlight actionable objects may be performed. Highlight titles, as discussed more fully in other portions of this disclosure, may refer to accents, emphases, features, bringing out, calling attention to, or underlining titles. Title may refer to a header on the website or any other descriptive name, word, characters, or combinations thereof. An example of a highlight may include a colored overlay applied to one or more titles. The colored overlay may be in any color. Actionable objects may refer to objects that a user may interact with. In some embodiments, the method may further include detecting titles and actionable objects associated with the website and highlighting on a user session basis the detected titles and actionable objects. For example, if the user selects the web accessibility profile cognitive disability profile, the user may have a cognitive disability such as autism, dyslexia, or CVA. Thus, to help users with cognitive impairments, highlight titles may be detected on the website and highlighted with a yellow color. Additionally, or alternatively, actionable objects may be detected on the website and highlighted with a green color. Advantageously, the user may more easily navigate and access the website's content.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">In some embodiments, a selected web accessibility profile may be an epilepsy-safe profile. When the selected web accessibility profile is the epilepsy-safe profile, a first website display parameter may be a saturation parameter and a second website display parameter may be a stop animation parameter. This profile may require changes to one or more website display parameters such as changing the font type, changing the font size, or changing spacing. In some embodiments, animations may be stopped and saturation may be changed. A saturation parameter, as discussed more fully in other portions of this disclosure, may refer to an intensity of a color on a website. A stop animation parameter may refer to an animation, event, action, or process of the website to an end. Non-limiting examples of stop animation may include preventing a blinking animation and altering an animation's rate of change. In some embodiments, the method further includes adjusting the saturation parameter in a website code to decrease display intensity and executing a command in the website code to limit movement on a display. Website code, as discussed more fully in other portions of this disclosure, may refer to programs, routines, functions, classes, data structures, and/or objects. The website code may include descriptive text, such as HyperText Markup Language or extensible markup language. For example, if the user selects the web accessibility profile epilepsy-safe profile, the user may have a disability or disorder related to seizures, including different types of epilepsy and migraines which may be a reaction to visual flickering or audio signals at certain frequencies or patterns. Thus, to help users with these impairments, the saturation parameter may be adjusted, by accessing and altering the website's code, to decrease display intensity of the website so the user may more easily see the website's content. Likewise, the stop animation parameter may execute a command in the website code to limit movement on the display of the website to prevent triggering a seizure, migraine, or other form of epilepsy of the user. In another example, limiting movement on the display may be in the form of preventing blinking animation or altering animation on the website such that they do not change at a rate greater than three frames per second. Advantageously, these limitations of movement may also help prevent trigging a seizure, migraine, or other form of epilepsy of the user.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">In some embodiments, a selected web accessibility profile may be an ADHD friendly profile. When the selected web accessibility profile is the ADHD friendly profile, a first website display parameter may be a content scaling parameter and a second website display parameter may be a stop animation parameter. This profile may require changes to one or more website display parameters such as changing the font type, changing the font size, or changing spacing. In some embodiments, content scaling may be changed, and animations may be stopped. Content scaling, as discussed more fully in other portions of this disclosure, may refer to adjusting, increasing, or decreasing content on a website. A stop animation parameter may refer to a command, code, or rule that causes an animation, event, action, or process of the website to end or to be altered. Non-limiting examples of stop animation may include preventing a blinking animation and altering an animation's rate of change. In some embodiments, the method further includes adjusting the content scaling parameter in a website code to increase content scaling and executing a command in the website code to limit movement on a display. For example, if the user selects the web accessibility profile ADHD Friendly Profile, the user may have a disability related to distractions by noise or movement and find it more difficult to browse, read, and focus on essential elements. Thus, to help users with ADHD, the content scaling parameter may be adjusted, by accessing and altering the website's code, to increase content scaling of the website so the user may more easily see the website's content. Likewise, the stop animation parameter may execute a command in the website code to limit movement on the display of the website to help the user focus and read the website. In another example, limiting movement on the display may be in the form of preventing blinking animation or altering animation on the website such that they do not change at a rate greater than three frames per second. Advantageously, these limitations of movement may also help the user focus. According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, a system for enabling users to alter website presentations based on selected web accessibility profiles may be provided. Consistent with disclosed embodiments, the system includes a memory configured to store values of various website display parameters associated with a plurality of web accessibility profiles. The system may also include at least one processor. The system may display an accessibility GUI for a website, wherein the accessibility GUI may include a plurality of web accessibility profiles associated with differing disabilities. The system may receive a selection of one of the plurality of web accessibility profiles. The system may identify a first predefined adjustment to a first website display parameter associated with the selected web accessibility profile. The system may initiate a first change in the first website display parameter based on the identified first predefined adjustment to thereby address a first aspect of the disability associated with the selected web accessibility profile. The system may identify a second predefined adjustment to a second website display parameter associated with the selected web accessibility profile. The system may initiate a second change in the second website display parameter based on the identified second predefined adjustment to thereby address a second aspect of the disability associated with the selected web accessibility profile. In some embodiments, initiate the first change and the second change transforms a presentation of the website to conform with needs of a user having the disability associated with the selected web accessibility profile.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">Some embodiments may enable a user to selectively activate or modify one or more web accessibility profiles. By way of one example, this capability may be useful in situations where multiple users may be using the same device (e.g., at different times), and each user may require different accessibility options. For example, the device may belong to an institution such as a library, or residence and may be available to multiple different users, each with a different disability. This capability may additionally be useful in situations when a user wishes to further customize an accessibility profile to suit the individual needs of the user. Disclosed embodiments may allow each user to selectively activate and/or modify (e.g., customize) one of multiple available web accessibility profiles, according to individual need.

In some embodiments, the at least one processor may receive at least a portion of the first input as a notification, for example as an interrupt event from a peripheral input device used by the user to make a selection. The at least one processor may access a buffer associated with the peripheral device to receive additional input, e.g., information associated with the selection.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">For example, a user who is cognitively impaired may select an option of the accessibility GUI for the web accessibility profile corresponding to cognitive impairment. e.g., from a menu. The selection may occur, for example, via a touch sensitive screen or through a mouse click. An event listener associated with the selected option may detect the selection and send a notification to the at least one processor. The at least one processor may probe the state of the option (e.g., a button with an ON/OFF toggle setting) and determine that the option has been selected (e.g., the state of the button is ON), thereby receiving the first input via the accessibility GUI. The first input may thus indicate to the at least one processor that the first user has selected the web accessibility profile for cognitive impairment, which is associated with cognitive disability.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> illustrates an exemplary implementation for receiving a first input via the accessibility GUI indicative of a selection of a specific web accessibility profile associated with a specific disability, consistent with some disclosed embodiments. For example, processing device <b>210</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of computing device <b>1708</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may receive a first input, e.g., from user <b>1108</b>, indicating the selection of button <b>1016</b>_<b>3</b> corresponding to the cognitive impairment web accessibility profile associated with a cognitive disability. User <b>1108</b> may make the selection via input interface <b>240</b>, such as by selecting button <b>1016</b>_<b>3</b>. An event listener associated with button <b>10163</b> may detect the selection of button <b>10163</b> (e.g., switched to ON) via interface <b>240</b>, for example as a mouse click, keyboard press, joystick maneuver, touch via a touch-sensitive screen, voice command, head, hand or foot gesture, or any other suitable input means. The event listener may send a notification of the selection to processing device <b>210</b>A, which may determine the selection of the cognitive impairment web accessibility profile, thereby receiving the first input via accessibility GUI <b>1008</b>.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">Some embodiments involve, based on the first input, implementing a first website display change corresponding to the specific accessibility profile. The term &#x201c;website display change&#x201d; may refer to modifying, replacing, substituting, or otherwise altering a rendering of one or more visual elements of the website. For example, the website display change may switch the rendering of an element of the website from a default display setting (e.g., recommended for non-disabled users) to a setting defined for one of the web accessibility profiles for a specific disability. The change may be implemented via any suitable output medium, such as but not limited to a visual medium (e.g., a display screen) an audio medium (e.g., a speaker), a tactile medium (e.g., a vibrating motor), and any other output medium configured to convey information to the user. Thus, based on the first input (e.g., the selection of the specific web accessibility profile), the at least one processor may modify or alter the rendering of one or more display elements of the website, to thereby implement the website display change. For example, according to the initial values for the display parameters for the website, a header may be displayed as black text against a white background, and navigation buttons may be displayed with a plain format and accompanying text below. Displayed thus (e.g., according to the initial values), a user with cognitive disability may have difficulty distinguishing the header from other text or knowing which navigation button to press. On determining the selection of the web accessibility profile for cognitive impairment, the at least one processor may modify, enhance, or augment the display of the webpage, for example by changing the color of the header and by adding one or more graphic images to facilitate the navigation of the website by individuals who are cognitively impaired.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>B</figref> illustrate an example of implementing, based on the first input, a first website display change corresponding to the specific accessibility profile, consistent with some disclosed embodiments, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> may correspond to an original, unmodified rendering of webpage <b>1004</b>, e.g., displayed according to the initial values for the set of display parameters for website <b>1004</b>. According to the initial values (e.g., before the first website display change is implemented) navigation buttons <b>1012</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>1012</b>_<b>6</b> are displayed using a plain white format with accompanying text. In addition, the text for header <b>1010</b> is displayed in black against a white background using a Times New Roman 16-point font. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>, on determining the selection of the cognitive impairment web accessibility profile of accessibility GUI <b>1008</b> (e.g., corresponding to setting button <b>1016</b>_<b>3</b> to ON), processing device <b>210</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may implement the first website display change by modifying the display of webpage <b>1004</b> according to one or more display parameter values store in advance for the cognitive impairment web accessibility profile, such as at memory device <b>220</b>A. For example, processing device <b>210</b>A may modify the display of buttons <b>1012</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>1012</b>_<b>6</b> by adding descriptive graphic images that complement text <b>1014</b>A-<b>1014</b>B.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">Some embodiments may involve implementing the first website display change, wherein the first website display change alters a plurality of the initial values of the set of display parameters to address the specific disability. The term &#x201c;alter a plurality of initial values&#x201d; may refer to substituting, replacing, or otherwise changing at least one of the initial values (e.g., a plurality of the predefined, recommended, or default settings) defined for the website. The term &#x201c;address&#x201d; may refer to targeting, handling, facilitating, or otherwise assisting with one or more aspects related to the specific disability, for example to facilitate the navigation of the website by an individual having the specific disability. Thus, in some embodiments, to implement the first website display change, the at least one processor may modify (e.g., alter) one or more different default or predefined display settings (e.g., initial values of the set of display parameters) for the website. For example, if the initial values for the display parameters cause one or more navigation buttons to be displayed using a plain white format and accompanying text, the first website display change may augment the display of the navigation buttons with one or more descriptive images, allowing cognitively impaired individuals to understand the context or purpose for each navigation button. Similarly, if the initial values for the display parameters cause a header to be displayed using black text against a white background, the first website display change may modify the background color for the header to yellow, to assist in distinguishing the header from other text of the website. Modifying at least one of the display parameters thus may facilitate individuals with cognitive disabilities to navigate the website with greater ease. In this manner, the first website display change may address cognitive disability. The foregoing are simply a few examples for illustrative purposes. Any modification to default display parameters to address a specific disability may qualify as addressing the specific disability.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>B</figref>, together, illustrates an exemplary implementation for at least one processor implementing the first website display change, wherein the first website display change alters a plurality of the initial values of the set of display parameters to address the specific disability, consistent with some disclosed embodiments. For example, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, the initial values for the display parameters for website <b>1004</b> may cause navigation buttons <b>1012</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>1012</b>_<b>6</b> to be displayed with a plain white format with accompanying text, e.g., according to a default display setting recommended for non-disabled users. Similarly, the text for header <b>1010</b> may be displayed black against a white background a Times New Roman 16-point font. User <b>110</b>B, having a cognitive disability, may have difficulty distinguishing header <b>1010</b> from other text on webpage <b>1004</b>, and may have further difficulty comprehending the context for each of navigation buttons <b>1012</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>1012</b>_<b>6</b>. These difficulties may hinder the ability of user <b>10</b>B to navigate website <b>1004</b>. To address this, user <b>1108</b> may select the cognitive disability profile as described above. In response to the selection (e.g., the first input), processing device <b>210</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may alter the background color for header <b>1010</b> to yellow, allowing header <b>1010</b> to be dearly distinguished from other text displayed on webpage <b>1004</b>. Additionally, processing device <b>210</b>A may add descriptive images to one or more of navigation buttons <b>1012</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>10126</b> that complement text <b>1014</b>A-<b>1014</b>B, allowing user <b>1108</b> to understand the context for each of navigation buttons <b>1012</b>_<b>1</b> to <b>10126</b>, despite difficulty in reading comprehension. Due to these changes, user <b>1108</b> may be able to navigate website <b>1004</b> more efficiently and access relevant information and services. In this manner, the first website display change implemented by processing device <b>210</b>A may address the cognitive disability (e.g., the specific disability) of user <b>1108</b>.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">Some embodiments may involve receiving a second input via the accessibility GUI. The term &#x201c;receiving,&#x201d; and &#x201c;input&#x201d; may be understood as described earlier. As one example, the user may wish to further customize the display of the website to accommodate specific needs or preferences (e.g., a cognitively impaired user may drill down into one or more sub-categories of the cognitive disability profile). As another example, the computing device may belong to an institution (e.g., public library, or hostel) that may serve many different users. After the first user with a first disability (e.g., cognitive impairment) has finished using the computing device, a second user with a second disability (e.g., visual impairment) may wish to use the same computing device and switch the web accessibility profile to accommodate the second disability. The second input may be provided using any suitable technique, such as by reciting a voice command into a microphone, performing a head, hand, or foot gesture, or selecting a graphic web element of the accessibility GUI via a mouse, keyboard, touch sensitive screen, or any other selection technique. An event listener may detect the selection and send a notification to the at least one processor. The at least one processor may determine that the option has been selected, thereby receiving the second input via the accessibility GUI. Returning to the first example, the second input may indicate to the at least one processor that the user (e.g., the cognitively impaired user) has selected to further modify the display of the website, e.g., within a sub-category of the cognitive disability profile. Returning to the second example, the second input may indicate to the at least one processor that a second user (e.g., visually impaired user) has selected to switch to a different web accessibility profile associated with vision disability.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>C and <b>11</b></figref> illustrate exemplary implementations for at least one processor receiving a second input via the accessibility GUI, consistent with some disclosed embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref> illustrates an exemplary implementation of the first example.

The term &#x201c;causes an adjustment&#x201d; may refer to an action that modifies, alters, reconfigures, or otherwise redefines a value. Thus, causing an adjustment to the altered values may refer to modifying (again) the values for the set of display parameters, for example, by modifying the values that were altered above for the first website display change. In other words, the first input may cause a first alteration changing the initial values for the display parameters. The second input may cause a second alteration of the first altered values, further changing the values for the set of display parameters, e.g., to customize the first alteration for the first disability, or to implement a different profile for a second disability.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">Returning to the first example (e.g., customizing the first alteration for the first disability), the at least one processor may make additional changes to the header (e.g., after changing the background color in the first alteration) such as by increasing the font size, changing the font type, and simplifying the text, thereby causing an adjustment to the altered values of the set of display parameters. Returning to the second example (e.g., implementing a different profile corresponding to a second disability) the at least one processor may undo or reverse one or more of the modifications implemented in response to the first input, for example if the modifications do not address the second disability. Accordingly, the at least one processor may remove the descriptive images previously added to the navigation buttons, since these might not assist a visually impaired user, yet cause increased overhead when loading the webpage.

The term &#x201c;revert&#x201d; may be understood as return or reset, e.g., to a former state. For example, the at least one processor may reset the values for the set of display parameters, which were modified after receiving the first input, back to the original (e.g., initial) values assigned to the set of display parameters before the first input was received. Continuing with the second example given above, the navigation buttons were initially displayed using a plain white format with accompanying text below. Upon receiving the first input (e.g., from the cognitively disabled user), the at least one processor added one or more descriptive images to the navigation buttons to assist the cognitively disabled user to navigate the website. However, the images may not be of much help to the visually disabled user, who may be better assisted by a screen reader vocalizing the text. Thus, on receiving the second input (e.g., from the visually disabled user), the at least one processor may reset the values for the display parameters for the navigation buttons to restore the original (e.g., initial) values, for example by removing the descriptive images that were added after receiving the first input.

For example, the set of display parameters defined for a website (e.g., associated with the website) may include default settings for text and graphics, but may not define a minimum window size. The second website display change (e.g., corresponding to visual impairment profile) may adjust all of the default text, graphics, and additionally may enlarge the window size displaying the webpage, e.g., to conform with a recommended minimum window size for the visual impairment profile. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary implementation for a second website display change adjusting all of the display parameters in the set associated with a webpage, as well as a parameter not included in the set of display parameters. While webpage <b>1004</b> may be associated with display parameters for text and page layout (e.g., the set of display parameters), webpage <b>1004</b> may not have a minimum window size defined for rendering content.

The previously collected data may be stored in memory, and analyzed, for example via a pattern recognition or learning algorithm to reveal an inclination or preference for certain display parameter settings over others. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary implementation of determining at least one value of the plurality of display parameters based on previously collected data, consistent with disclosed embodiments. For example, based on previous uses of accessibility GUI <b>1008</b>, processor <b>210</b>A may determine a pattern among users with mild visual impairment preferring a font size of 16 points, versus users with heavier visual impairment who prefer a font size of 20 points.

This may save the user considerable time in not having to select a profile for each session. The user may select a profile once and the profile may follow the user.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">Some embodiments also involve systems, methods, and non-transitory computer readable media that perform operations for causing disability-related changes in website presentations across multiple browsing sessions.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0215">A disability-related change may refer to any change in a website's display that may make it easier for an internet user who suffers from a disability to navigate a website. Disability-related changes may include, for example, one or more of content adjustments, including font sizing and text alignment adjustments; color adjustments, such as saturation and contrast adjustments; and/or orientation adjustments, including muting sound and stopping website animations. These changes may apply across multiple browsing sessions. A browsing session may refer to a time period during which an internet user peruses one or more websites. A browsing session may extend over any range of time, from as short as a few seconds to as long as multiple hours at a time. An internet user may also leave his or her computing device (e.g., a computer or mobile phone) and may return to his or her computing device to browse the internet later in the day. Thus, it may be desirable to keep any disability-related changes consistent across multiple browsing sessions.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0216">The internet is comprised of a vast array of websites, which display a variety of content that may include inanimate and animate content such as photos, graphics, charts, and videos. Some websites may also include an audio component. Internet users who suffer from a disability may be unable to easily access portions of these websites. Some disclosed embodiments describe various profiles that streamline how users interact with these websites depending on the user's disability.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">It may be also desirable to store a user's preferences across multiple browsing sessions, so that the user does not have to re-enter his or her disability preferences each time the user opens an internet browser or wants to use a different website. Some disclosed embodiments describe various web accessibility profiles based on a user's disability, and systems and methods of storing that information across various browsing sessions.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0218">Some embodiments involve receiving, during a first website browsing session having an associated set of default values for display parameters, a web accessibility profile selection associated with a particular disability, the web accessibility profile selection having an associated set of disability profile values for the display parameters, the disability profile values differing from the default values. The first website browsing session may refer to a time period during which a user accesses a website after entering their login information or selecting a profile from the list of available profiles. This time period may precede other time periods during which the user may access the same website or different websites. The first browsing session may also refer to a time period during which a user downloads the accessibility interface. Or the first browsing session may refer to any browsing session that precedes a second browsing session. A user may access the internet multiple times in a day or across a multiple-day period. Thus, after a user selects an accessibility profile in a first browsing session, the user may return for a second browsing session. The second browsing session may refer to any subsequent browsing session that a user engages in after closing out of the first browsing session. Or the second browsing session may refer to any subsequent initiated browsing session in instances where a user may be running multiple browsing sessions in parallel. To save a user time when accessing various websites, it may be desirable to save a user's accessibility profile so that they do not have to enter their login information each time they want to access the internet.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0219">Across the internet, different websites may display content with varying display parameters. The website display parameters (or simply display parameters) may include properties whose values provide constraints on a presentation of a website or a webpage on a screen associated with a computing device of the user. Examples of website display parameters may include content scaling, readable font, highlight titles, highlight links, text magnifier, font size, line height, letter spacing, align center, align left, align right, contrast, monochrome, saturation, text colors, title colors, background color, mute sounds, hide images, read mode, reading guide, stop animation, highlight hover, and/or cursor appearance.</p><p id="p-0221" num="0220">Default values may refer to values of the one or more display parameters used to display content on a website before an accessibility profile is selected or when no alternative is specified by a user or by a programmer who created the website. The default values may be defined in a code associated with the website. For example, a default value for a website parameter may include the size of the font that is automatically displayed on the website. As another example, a default value for a website parameter may include the size of the window that is automatically displayed on the website. In another example, a default value for a website parameter may include the color theme that is automatically applied to the website. By way of example, the set of default values may indicate that a first title on the website has a font size of 14 pt. and a second title on the website has a font size of 18 pt. In another example, the set of default values may indicate that a website has a default color scheme, comprising text colors, title colors, and background colors. Here, the default values may indicate that the default text title is black, the title colors are black, and the background colors are white. In yet another example, the default values may indicate that a website contains sound or animated content.</p><p id="p-0222" num="0221">An accessibility profile may include any type of data that may be used to adjust one or more website parameters to enable a user having a particular disability to access a website. In some embodiments, the values of the one or more website parameters stored in the accessibility profile may be different from the default values of the web display parameters. The values of the one or more website display parameters stored in the accessibility profile may constitute disability profile values. A user may suffer from a disability such as visual impairment, cognitive impairment, epilepsy, ADHD, or another disability that inhibits a user's ability to access a particular website. After an accessibility profile is selected, one or more display parameter default values may be modified based on the selected accessibility profile. A first website browsing session having an associated set of default values for display parameters may refer to, but is not limited to, the time period wherein a user is accessing the internet but has not yet selected a disability profile. Here, the website that the user is accessing may be displayed unaltered. In one example, a website may have text that is displayed at 12 pt and may include background animation.</p><p id="p-0223" num="0222">Receiving a web accessibility profile selection associated with a particular disability may refer to a user using a computing device, such as a computer, consisting of an input device such as a mouse or touchpad and a keyboard, or a mobile device, to select an accessibility profile in a graphic user interface consisting of multiple accessibility profiles. If the user is accessing a website on a computer, the user may select the web accessibility profile by moving a cursor and clicking on a particular selection and/or may use a keyboard to select the profile via typing in commands. If the user is accessing a website on his or her mobile device, he or she may access the website by selecting a profile using a finger and/or voice command. Thus, receiving a web accessibility profile selection may include receiving a signal, data, alarm, alert, or any other sign in response to a user's selection of the accessibility profile using, for example, his or her computing device.</p><p id="p-0224" num="0223">The disability profile values may differ from the default display parameters and may be based on website content. Thus, for example, disability profile values may include values for content scaling, title size, font size, line height, letter spacing, and/or text alignment. The disability profile values may specify values for one or more of the display parameters discussed above. For example, the disability profile values may include color adjustments, including one or more of saturation adjustments (e.g., displaying the website at a high or low color saturation), contrast adjustments (e.g., high contrast, dark contrast, or light contrast), adjusting to a monochrome color scheme, or adjusting the appearance of text, title, and/or background colors. As another example, the disability profiles may include orientation adjustments, including one or more of muting sounds, hiding images, stopping animations, implementing a reading guide or mask, or adjusting cursor size.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">In one example, a user may select a profile that may make it easier for a visually impaired person to navigate a website. Such a profile may be comprised of content adjustments, including one or more of increasing content scaling and adjusting the font so that it is more readable, and color adjustments, such as increasing color saturation.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">In some embodiments, the web accessibility profile selection is associated with at least a first predefined value of a first display parameter addressing a first aspect of the particular disability of the user and a second predefined value of a second display parameter addressing a second aspect of the particular disability of the user. Depending on a website user's disability, more than one display parameters may be adjusted based on selection of a web accessibility profile. For example, based on a user's disability, a certain display parameter may have a predefined value that may be different from a default value of that display parameter. A predefined value may refer to a stored display parameter value within a memory device associated with a user's computing device or a server.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0226">In one example, a user may select a visually impaired profile wherein a first predefined value of a first display parameter addressing a first aspect of the disability may be increased color saturation and a second predefined value of a second display parameter addressing a second aspect of the particular disability may be increasing content scaling. Users who suffer from visual impairment may have more difficulty discerning website elements from one another. To address this user's disability, it may be desirable to increase display parameters such as color saturation and content scaling to make website elements brighter, more colorful, and larger, in order to aid the user in navigating a website.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0227">In another example, a user may select an epilepsy-safe profile wherein a first predefined value of a first display parameter addressing a first aspect of the disability may be reduced color saturation, and a second predefined value of a second display parameter addressing a second aspect of the particular disability may be stopping animations. Users who suffer from epileptic seizures may be more sensitive to high-intensity color combinations, i.e., high-saturation and contrast color combinations, and flashing or blinking animations. To address this user's disability, it may be desirable to reduce the risk of high-contrast color combinations by reducing color saturation and by stopping all animations on the website.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0228">Some embodiments involve changing, based on the web accessibility profile selection, the default values for the display parameters to the disability profile values to thereby cause, during the first website browsing session, the website to be accessible to a user with the particular disability. Different websites on the internet may have different default display parameters, such as default content scaling, font size, line height, letter spacing, text alignment, color contrast and saturation, animations, and/or cursor size. Depending on which accessibility profile a user selects, the default values of one or more display parameters may be changed to make the website accessible to the user with a disability associated with the selected accessibility profile. Different display parameter values may be associated with different accessibility profiles. In one example, a user may select a visually impaired profile, which may automatically adjust the default content scaling and color saturation display parameter values. In another example, a user may select an epilepsy-safe profile, which may automatically adjust the default color saturation display parameter value and may also stop on-screen animations. Changing the default values of one or more display parameters may make a website more accessible to a user with a particular disability because the website default values are replaced with adjusted display parameters based on a user's disability. For example, for a user with visual impairment, the value associated with a content size display parameter for images, photos, or graphics, may be increased by 100% from a default value to enable display of the content to the user in a magnified or zoomed manner. As another example, display parameters such as saturation or contrast may take values that are larger than their respective default values. When the saturation is increased, website elements appear brighter. When the contrast is increased, the difference in brightness between foreground and background colors is increased. In one example, hue numbers, which govern how saturated a color is in a website display, range from 0 to 255. Color saturation may also be determined by how much white or gray is present in a color. In this example, a high color saturation website display may be comprised of website elements wherein all displayed colors have hue numbers of <b>255</b>. By contrast, accessibility profiles that aim to reduce color saturation, such as the epilepsy-safe profile, may reduce the default display hue number for saturation, for example to 50 or less.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0229">In some embodiments, display parameter values associated with particular accessibility profiles may be stored in the memory of either the user's computing device via the hard drive, RAM, and/or ROM, in the browser via cookies, or in a memory device or database associated with a server. The modified display parameters that are associated with a particular accessibility profile may replace the default website display parameters. A user may wish to further modify display parameters at subsequent browsing sessions and may do so by selecting a different accessibility profile or choose to adjust individual display parameters such as content scaling via the accessibility GUI.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0230">Some embodiments involve causing the web accessibility profile selection to be stored in memory in association with the user. Storing the web accessibility profile selection may refer to any method of saving, filing, or placing in a storage device the values of one or more display parameters associated with the web accessibility profile selected by the user. When an accessibility profile selection is stored, the display parameters associated with the accessibility profile may be stored so that when a user returns to his or her computer device for a second or subsequent browsing session, the default website displayed parameters may be automatically replaced with the display parameters associated with the previously selected accessibility profile. Methods of storing the web accessibility profile selection may include web storage, private clouds, public and hybrid cloud storage, cookies, and on a local backup drive. Web storage may refer to any method of storing client-side data that allows for greater storage capacity than cookies. A private cloud may refer to a cloud computing environment in which all hardware and software resources are dedicated exclusively to, and accessible only by, a single customer. Cloud computing may refer to the on-demand availability of computer system resources, such as data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. In contrast to private cloud storage, public cloud storage may be accessible by more than one user and may be offered based on a subscription service, A hybrid cloud is a type of data center infrastructure that combines private and public cloud elements, i.e., on-premises storage and cloud storage. In some embodiments, the web accessibility profile may be stored in a private cloud, a public cloud, and/or a hybrid cloud. The web accessibility profile selection may be stored in association with the user based on a user's log-in information, subscription information, and/or any other means of verifying a user's identity. Thus, for example, a user's log-in information, subscription information, and/or any other identifying information of the user may be linked to the web accessibility profile. Depending on the method of storage, a single user's accessibility profile may be stored, or a plurality of users' accessibility profiles. For example, a single user's accessibility profile may be stored in the user's computing device, web browser, or browser cookie. However, multiple users' accessibility profiles may be stored in a remote server via the cloud because that method of data storage has greater storage capability than an individual user's web browser, hard drive, RAM, and/or ROM.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0231">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates a timeline <b>1300</b> between a first browsing session and a second browsing session, wherein a user opens a website <b>1302</b>, which executes a script received from a server. The computing device, which may be a computer, mobile phone, or tablet, may receive a command <b>1306</b> to open the accessibility graphic user interface (GUI). The accessibility GUI may be a downloadable browser extension that provides users with a plurality of predefined accessibility profiles to choose from, wherein each accessibility profile may alter one or more website display parameters, and also provides users with the option to individually customize website display parameters to optimize their internet browsing experience.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0232">In step <b>1308</b>, an internet user may open the accessibility GUI. In step <b>1310</b>, the user may select a predefined accessibility profile based on the user's disability using the accessibility GUI. The user may select an accessibility profile by selecting it with a cursor, or, in the scenario that the user is blind, with a keyboard command with the assistance of a screen reader. After the user selects an accessibility profile, that profile may be stored at step <b>1312</b>. One or more display parameters may be modified based on the selected predefined accessibility profile. The default values for the display parameters, i.e., how the website content was displayed before the user selected an accessibility profile, are replaced at step <b>1314</b> with the modified parameters that are part of the accessibility profile that the user selected. The user may then close the website at step <b>1316</b>, thus ending the first browsing session.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0233">In some embodiments, the memory is associated with a computing device used by the user to access the website. The accessibility profile selection may be stored in a hard drive, RAM, and/or ROM associated with a computing device being used by the user to access the website. The computing device may include, for example, a phone, a tablet, a laptop computer, a desktop computer, a smartphone, a smart watch, smart glasses, or any other computational device used by the user to access the website. A user's accessibility profile selection may also be stored in a web cookie associated with a user's computing device and the user's chosen web browser. When a user visits a website using his or her computing device, the server transfers a small packet of data into the computing device's browser. This cookie is designed to store information about the user, including a record of website visits and activity. In some embodiments, such information about the user may include a user's web accessibility profile selection.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">In some embodiments, the memory may be associated with a remote server configured to store web accessibility profiles of multiple users. Whereas cookies or other web storage may be desirable for single users, additional storage may be needed to store multiple accessibility profiles. A remote server may be able to store the accessibility profile data of multiple users. A remote server is a server that is dedicated to handle users that are not on the local area network but need remote access. Users typically access a remote server via the internet. A remote server differs from a computation device because instead of being stored on a local device, data is stored on a server outside the local area network that a plurality of users may have access to. Examples of remote servers include Dropbox, Microsoft One Drive, and Google Drive. Accessibility profile data may also be stored on a network of servers, such as the cloud. A cloud is a pooled, centralized server resource that may be hosted and delivered over a network, such as the internet, and accessed on demand by multiple users at once. The remote server may be either a private server or public remote server and may store a user's accessibility profile in a variety of different data structures, such as an array, a linked list, a stack, a queue, a hash table, a tree, a heap, or a graph.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">Some embodiments involve performing, during a second website browsing session of the user, a lookup in memory of the web accessibility profile selection of the user. Performing a lookup may refer to any algorithm or method used to retrieve previously stored accessibility profile information, stored via cookies, public and/or hybrid clouds, private clouds, web storage, and/or local backup drives. Examples of search algorithms may include a linear search, a binary search, a jump search, an interpolation search, and exponential search, a sub-list search, and/or a Fibonacci search. The lookup algorithm selects the particular user's accessibility profile and retrieves it from the data structure in which it is stored, either locally via hard drive, ROM, or RAM, or remotely via an individual server or the cloud. To perform the lookup, the algorithm may retrieve a user's ID and password or a user's computer ID (including an IP address and/or MAC address) from the data structure in which it is stored. For example, an internet user selects an accessibility profile from the accessibility GUI during a first browsing session. When the same user logs onto his or her computing device prior to the second browsing session, the lookup algorithm may retrieve the user's ID, which may be comprised of a username and password. The user ID may be associated with the accessibility profile selected during the first browsing session and may be automatically applied to the second browsing session.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">Some embodiments involve determining, during the second website browsing session and prior to applying the web accessibility profile selection, whether a user associated with the second website browsing session is a same user that made the web accessibility profile selection during the first website browsing session. Determining whether a user associated with the second website browsing session is a same user that made the web accessibility profile selection during the first website browsing session may be based on a profile associated with the browser, may be based on a profile associated with the operating system, may be based on user actions prior to the second browsing session, and/or may be based on user log-in service to a service or email account. The determination may be based on a profile associated with the internet browser. The determination may also be made based on a profile associated with the particular operating system. For example, Windows or Mac computers provide users with an option to select a user profile, wherein each user profile contains the user's saved documents, files, and/or customized browsing settings. The determination may also be based on a log-in to a service or email account. For example, a user may enter log-in information associated with the accessibility GUI and may use his or her email to do so. Thus, the determination of whether the user is the same user may be based on log-in and email information.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">In some embodiments, to determine whether the user between the first and second browsing sessions is the same user, the username and password information entered by the user during the second browsing session may be compared with similar information entered during the first browsing session. If the information matches, it may be determined that the user is the same and the selected accessibility profile selected during the first browsing session may be retrieved and automatically applied during the second browsing session. In another example, the e-mail login information entered by the user during the second browsing session may be compared with similar information entered during the first browsing session. If the entered information, i.e., username and password information, is the same between browsing sessions, then the accessibility profile may be automatically applied during the second browsing session.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates a graphical user interface (GUI) and wherein a user may select from a variety of different predefined accessibility profiles in a first browsing session <b>1400</b>. In first browsing session <b>1400</b>, the website may be also modified based on the accessibility profile the user selected. A user may select the available accessibility adjustments via graphic user interface <b>1402</b>. In addition to having the option to select an accessibility profile, a user may also have the option to reset the website display settings to the default display settings and also may have the option to hide the interface. A user may reset settings if they are borrowing someone else's computing device, such as a computer, mobile phone, or tablet, to use the accessibility GUI. A user may also reset settings if they accidentally adjust settings not to their liking or they select a profile that they do not like. As illustrated in the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, accessibility GUI may contain five different accessibility profiles that a user may select. A user may select an epilepsy-safe profile (seizure-safe profile) <b>1404</b>, which may eliminate flashes and reduce color contrast. Users who suffer from epilepsy or other seizure disorders are more sensitive to light and sudden movements than other users, so it is desirable to eliminate flashes and blinking lights and to minimize movement. The epilepsy-safe profile may also limit the movement on a website to prevent blinking animations. The user may also have the ability to turn the epilepsy-safe profile <b>1404</b> on and off.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">By way of another example, a user may select a vision-impaired profile <b>1406</b>, which may enhance a website's visuals. Users who suffer from degrading eyesight, tunnel vision, cataracts, glaucoma, or any other eye or vision condition may select the vision-impaired profile <b>1406</b>. The vision-impaired profile <b>1406</b> may increase the size of website elements, and also may increase brightness and contrast between website elements. The user may have the ability to turn the visually impaired profile <b>1406</b> on and off.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">By way of another example, a user may select a cognitive disability profile <b>1408</b>, which may assist with reading and focusing. Users who suffer from cognitive disabilities such as autism, dyslexia, a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and/or any cognitive condition may select the cognitive disability profile <b>1408</b>. Cognitive disability profile <b>1408</b> may increase the scale of text and headers and also may highlight text and links. In first browsing session <b>1400</b>, a user may select the cognitive disability profile disability profile <b>1408</b>. Here, the key features of a website, such as header <b>1410</b>, are highlighted. The user may have the ability to turn the cognitive disability profile <b>1408</b> on and off.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">By way of another example, a user may select neurodevelopmental disorder profile (ADHD Friendly Profile) <b>1412</b>, which may provide more focus and fewer distractions. Users who suffer from neurodevelopmental disabilities such as ADHD may select neurodevelopmental disorder profile <b>1412</b>. Neurodevelopmental disorder profile <b>1412</b> may significantly reduce distractions to help people with ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders browse, read, and focus on the essential elements of a website more easily. In doing so, neurodevelopmental disorder profile <b>1412</b> may provide users with a reading mask. A reading mask may refer to an apparatus used to help users focus on specific text. Specifically, the reading mask may only highlight certain text at a time, and other text may appear darker to the user. Depending on the content displayed on the website, the reading mask may be wider or narrower. The reading mask may follow the user's cursor when browsing a website. When the user selects the ADHD-friendly profile, website text may also appear larger to the user. The user may have the ability to turn the ADHD-friendly profile <b>1412</b> on and off.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">By way of another example, a user may select screen-reader profile <b>1414</b>, which may allow a blind user to navigate a website using a screen reader. The screen-reader profile may adjust the website to be compatible with screen readers such as JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and TalkBack. Blind users may install screen readers prior to using the accessibility GUI, and the GUI may prompt automatically to screen readers.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0243">By way of another example, a user may select a keyboard navigation profile, which may allow motor-impaired persons to operate a website using a keyboard in lieu of a cursor. Users may be able to operate a website by using the keyboard Tab, Shift+Tab, and Enter keys. Users may also use shortcuts such as &#x201c;M&#x201d; to access menus, &#x201c;H&#x201d; to access headings, &#x201c;F&#x201d; to access forms, &#x201c;B&#x201d; to access buttons, and &#x201c;G&#x201d; to access graphics, i.e., jump to specific elements.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">Some embodiments involve, upon determining that the first and second website browsing sessions are associated with the same user, applying the web accessibility profile selection without user intervention. During a first website browsing session, a user may select an accessibility profile via the accessibility GUI. The accessibility profile selection may be stored in association with that user. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to prevent unnecessary user intervention, i.e., a user should not have to re-enter his or her preferred accessibility profile in each browsing session. After determining the user in the second browsing session is the same as the first browsing session, the accessibility profile stored in association with that user may be applied automatically. For example, a user opens his or her laptop computer and logs onto the internet. After opening the browser, the user is prompted to select a profile associated with the user's email address. After the user selects a profile, the processor associated with the accessibility GUI recognizes that the selected profile matches the profile that the user selected during the first browsing session. The processor thus determines that the users between the first browsing session and the second browsing session are the same, and accordingly, applies the same accessibility profile that the user selected during the first browsing session.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">Some embodiments involve, upon determining that the first and second website browsing session are associated with different users, applying the associated set of default values for display parameters. Different users may share the same computer, or a user may desire to log onto the internet at a work computer or computer that they do not typically use, such as a computer at a library or internet caf&#xe9;. Here, different users may access the computer at different times, i.e., the same user may not always be using the computer. Thus, it may be desirable to replace the display parameters values that a selected accessibility profile modifies with default display parameter values if the two users are not the same between browsing sessions.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">Display parameter values may refer to a website's content scaling, titles, titles, font size, line height, letter spacing, and/or text alignment. Specifically, default display parameter values may refer to how the website content was displayed before the user selected an accessibility profile. In one example, a user is browsing the internet on a shared computer using an accessibility profile that he or she selected based the user's disability. Based on the accessibility profile that the user selected, website display parameters are adjusted accordingly. The user logs off the shared computer, and another user, for example, the user's family member, logs onto the shared computer. The second user selects the appropriate user profile at login. The processor may recognize that the two users between the first and second sessions are not the same user, and instead of displaying website content based on the accessibility profile the first user selected, the processor may display website content at the website's default display parameters, pending input from the second user.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0247">Some disclosed embodiments involve applying the web accessibility profile selection during the second website browsing session to thereby cause the second website browsing session to be accessible to the user with the particular disability. The first browsing session may, for example, refer to the first time a user accesses a website after entering their login information or selecting a profile from the list of available profiles. The first browsing session may also refer to the first time that a user interacts with the accessibility interface or may refer to any browsing session that precedes a second browsing session. The second browsing session may refer to any subsequent browsing session that a user engages in after closing out of the first browsing session. To save a user time when accessing various websites, it may be desirable to save a user's accessibility profile so that they do not have to enter their login information each time they want to access the internet. In the second browsing session, the accessibility profile that the user selected during the first browsing session is automatically applied. For example, in a first browsing session, a user selects the epilepsy-safe profile. During the second browsing session, the epilepsy-safe accessibility profile may be automatically applied. Additionally, the same epilepsy-safe profile may be applied to any subsequent browsing session unless a user customizes a feature of the epilepsy-safe profile, such as slowing animations and decreasing color saturations. From that point forward, the newly customized version of the epilepsy-safe profile may be applied.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0248">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, a user may reopen the internet browser during a second browsing session <b>1318</b>. In doing so, the website may execute a script received from a server at step <b>1320</b>. At step <b>1322</b>, the default values for the display parameters may be automatically changed to the display parameter values that the user selected during the first browsing session. At step <b>1324</b>, the user may close a website, thus ending the second browsing session. The accessibility profile settings from the first browsing session may still be stored across subsequent browsing sessions until a user modifies them.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0249"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> depicts an exemplary illustration of a second browsing session <b>1500</b>, wherein the accessibility profile selected from the first browsing session is saved in the second browsing session. Here, header text <b>1502</b> is highlighted because the user in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> selected the cognitive disability profile. The processor associated with the accessibility interface scans and analyzes the visual appearance of the website as well as the website's code. When a user selects the cognitive display profile, titles and links are highlighted, and content scaling is increased by at least 5%. Background image <b>1504</b> and background text <b>1506</b> are not highlighted because the processor associated with the accessibility interface has determined that such website elements are not headers or links, and thus not critical to navigating the website based on the selected accessibility profile.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0250">In some embodiments, during the second website browsing session, a display of the website is automatically modified to conform with the particular disability of the user without manually receiving a selection of the web accessibility profile during the second website browsing session. To avoid unnecessarily inhibiting a user's internet browsing experience, it is desirable to save the user's accessibility profile preference between browsing sessions. Accordingly, the display of a website may be automatically modified to conform with a previously entered accessibility profile without requiring the user to reenter their login information or accessibility preferences. Such modifications may be based on a website's display parameters, including a website's content scaling, font, titles, links, line height, line spacing, text alignment, color scheme, color contrast and saturation, text colors, title colors, background colors, and/or animations.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0251">For example, a user may select a visually impaired profile from the accessibility interface during a first browsing session. When the user logs onto his or her computational device (which may be a computer or mobile device) for a second browsing session, the visually impaired profile that the user selected during the first browsing session may be automatically applied. In this example, display parameters that are modified based on the visually impaired profile, which includes creating readable font, increasing content scaling, and increasing saturation, are automatically applied to the website during the second browsing session. In accordance with some disclosed embodiments, a user does not need to manually select the accessibility profile he or she selected during the first browsing session during the second browsing session.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0252">In some embodiments, the first website browsing session and the second website browsing session involve the same website. A user may select an accessibility profile during a first browsing session, such as the epilepsy-safe profile, and return to his or her computing device for a second browsing session. In one example, the user may return to the same website that he or she visited during the first browsing session for the second browsing session. Here, the display of the website during the second browsing session may be automatically modified to conform with the epilepsy-safe profile that the user selected during the first browsing session without the user having to manually select the same accessibility profile during the second browsing session. Display parameters that may be modified based on an epilepsy-safe profile may be reducing color saturation and stopping animations. These display parameters may be automatically modified without user input during the second browsing session.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0253">In some embodiments, applying the web accessibility profile selection during the first website browsing session changes a first visual presentation displayed on the website, and applying the web accessibility profile selection during the second website browsing session changes a second visual presentation displayed on the website. Even though the website that the user navigates between the first and second browsing sessions is the same, the displayed content between sessions may differ. Visual presentation may refer to how different display parameters, for example, a website's content scaling, font, titles, links, line height, line spacing, text alignment, color scheme, color contrast and saturation, text colors, title colors, background colors, and/or animations are arranged on a particular website. For example, even though the website between the first and second browsing session remains the same, different text and other visual elements may be presented in a different way. In this example, when a user first visits a website, the website may only display text and no animated content. Such a website may be a news outlet website that initially displays text content, such as headers and then displays video content as the user scrolls down further. Here, when the user scrolls through the website, the website may display less text and more animated content. Furthermore, depending on the accessibility profile that a user selects during the first browsing session, different display parameters may be modified. In one example, the user may select an epilepsy-safe profile during the first browsing session, which reduces color saturation and stops animations. Here, the first visual presentation on the displayed website may refer to reducing color saturation for the website's background, and the second visual presentation on the displayed website may refer to stopping animations when the user scrolls further down the website.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0254">In another example, a user may select a neurodevelopmental disorder profile during a first browsing session, wherein content scaling is increased, color saturation is increased, animations are stopped, and a reading mask is implemented. A reading mask may highlight certain portions of a webpage while darkening other portions of a webpage to assist a website user in focusing on only a small portion of a website at a time. The processor as part of the accessibility interface may scan the website and the website code to determine what portions of the website are text and what portions are images to aid in determining how wide the reading mask should be. Websites that are comprised of predominately text, such as a website dedicated to news or scholarly publications, may have a narrower reading mask so that the user can focus on a small amount of text at a time. On the other hand, websites that have more photos, graphics, or animate content, such as an online shopping website, may have a wider reading mask because the images may take up more space on the website. In this example, wherein the user selects a neurodevelopmental disorder profile during a first browsing session, the selected website may be a website, comprising mostly text. Here, the reading mask may be narrow to allow the user to focus on a smaller portion of text at a time, and the color saturation may be increased to allow the user to discern website elements more easily. Either the reading mask or the increased color saturation may be the first visual presentation of the website that is modified. During the second website session, the user may visit an online shopping website comprised of images and animate content. Here, the selected neurodevelopmental disability profile may stop animations on a webpage to assist a user in navigating a website. In this example, stopping animations is the second visual presentation that is modified.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0255">In yet another example, a user may select a visually impaired profile wherein content scaling is increased and font size may also be increased. In this example, the first website that the user visits may be a news website that displays articles for users to read. When the selects the visually impaired profile, the size of the displayed texts automatically increases by 100% during the first browsing session. The user may return to the same website during the second browsing session and select a second article to read, either via scrolling down the website or by clicking a hyperlink for the article on the website. Here, the text of the second article automatically increases in size to address the user's disability. The second article may or may not be available to the user the first time.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0256">In some embodiments, the first website browsing session and the second browsing session involve differing websites. A user may select an accessibility profile during a first browsing session, and that accessibility profile selection is stored for subsequent browsing sessions. The user may then return to his or her computing device for a second browsing session and may desire to visit a different website from the website that the user visited. For example, a user may visit a news website during a first browsing session and a shopping website during a second browsing session. The two websites may have varying display parameters, i.e., the first website may be comprised of predominately text content and minimal graphic or animate content, whereas the second website may have the opposite.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0257">In some embodiments, applying the web accessibility profile selection during the first website browsing session changes a first visual presentation of the first website, and applying the web accessibility profile selection during the second website browsing session changes a second visual presentation of the second website. Visual presentation may refer to how different display parameters, such as a website's content scaling, font, titles, links, line height, line spacing, text alignment, color scheme, color contrast and saturation, text colors, title colors, background colors, and/or animations are arranged on a particular website. Visual presentation of various website elements, such as text and graphics, may differ between two different websites. For example, a scholarly publication website that primarily presents text content may have a different visual presentation than an online shopping website that may be comprised of various photos, graphics, and/or even animations.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0258">In one example, a user may visit a first website dedicated to scholarly publications during a first browsing session. The website may only display text and no animated content. The user may visit a second website that is dedicated to online shopping during a second browsing session. Unlike the first website in the first browsing session wherein the displayed content, i.e., the visual presentation, was primarily comprised of text content, the second website may be comprised of minimal text and more photos, graphics, or animated content. Depending on the accessibility profile that a user selects during a first browsing session, the visual presentation of the website may change, i.e., different display parameters are modified between sessions.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0259">In one example, the user may select an epilepsy-safe profile during the first browsing session, which reduces color saturation and stops animations. Here, the first visual presentation on the first website may refer to reducing color saturation for the website's background, which may affect the displayed text color and background color of any images. The epilepsy-safe profile also stops animation on the webpage, but because in this example the first website primarily involves scholarly publications, the website may not be modified. However, the second website in this example, which is dedicated to online shopping, may include animations, i.e., a second visual presentation, as well as photos and graphics showing what the website sells. The second website may contain animations, which were not present on the first website. Therefore, the epilepsy-safe profile may change the second visual presentation on the second website, the animations.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0260">In another example, a user may select a neurodevelopmental disorder profile during a first browsing session, wherein content scaling is increased, color saturation is increased, animations are stopped, and a reading mask is implemented. Wherein the user selects a neurodevelopmental disorder profile during a first browsing session, the first website may be a website dedicated to scholarly publications, comprising mostly text. Here, the reading mask may be narrow to allow the user to focus on a smaller portion of text at a time, and the color saturation may be increased to allow the user to discern website elements more easily. Either the reading mask or the increased color saturation may be the first visual presentation of the website that is modified. During the second website session, the user may visit an online shopping website comprised of images and animate content. Here, the selected neurodevelopmental disability profile may stop animations on a webpage to assist a user in navigating a website. In this example, stopping animations is the second visual presentation that is modified.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0261">Some embodiments involve, during the first website browsing session, receiving a profile customization selection to personalize a presentation of the website and thereby address specific accessibility needs of the user, and applying the web accessibility profile selection and the profile customization selection during the second website browsing session.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0262">While previously described embodiments in the specification involve selecting one of a set group of accessibility profiles with predefined display setting changes, some embodiments involve selecting one of these accessibility profiles and further customizing it. In doing so, a user, after selecting one of a plurality of accessibility profiles, may select one of a plurality of further content adjustments. These content adjustments may include adjusting content scaling, font sizing, line height, and letter spacing. A user may also elect to highlight titles, links, may magnify text, select a more readable font (i.e., one that is bold), and may align the website text center, left, or right. A user may also elect to make a plurality of further color adjustments. These color adjustments may include adjusting the contrast, e.g., high contrast, dark contrast, or light contrast, adjusting the color saturation, e.g., high saturation or low saturation, and may also adjust whether the website is displayed in monochrome. A user may also adjust the individual text, title, and background colors to his or her liking. A user may also elect to make a plurality of further orientation adjustments, which may refer to any website adjustments that are not content (e.g., text size and content scaling) or color (e.g., saturation or contrast) adjustments. The orientation adjustments may include muting sounds, hiding images, toggling a reading guide, stopping animations, toggling a reading mask, or adjusting the size of the cursor. A reading guide replaces the user's cursor with a long bar that is meant to underline text in a sentence. A user may make the individual customizations in the accessibility interface. As with the accessibility profiles themselves, a user's selected individual customizations may be stored in the user's computing device, such as in the hard drive, RAM, and/or ROM. The user's selected customizations may also be stored in the user's browser via cookies or may be stored in a data structure on a remote server consistent with embodiments disclosed in this specification. Any adjustment is automatically saved between a first and second browsing session.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0263">For example, a user may select a cognitive disability profile that, by default, increases content scaling, highlights titles and links, and stops animations. However, a user may also choose to customize the selected accessibility profile by adjusting the font sizing, selecting a more readable font, i.e., a font that is bold and stands out more to the reader, or may adjust color saturation or contrast settings.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0264">In some embodiments, the profile customization selection may be configured to cause a supplemental change in a display parameter included in a group of display parameters associated with the web accessibility profile. Each accessibility profile may be comprised of adjustments to one or more display parameters. In some embodiments, a user may further adjust content, color, and orientation via the accessibility interface after selecting an accessibility profile. Some disclosed embodiments may permit the user to adjust one or more display parameters that may have already been modified based on the selected accessibility profile.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0265">In one example, a user may select an accessibility profile from a list of profiles, such as the visually impaired profile. The visually impaired profile may be comprised of various predefined content and color adjustments, but no orientation adjustments. For example, the content adjustments may be comprised of increasing content scaling by 100% and selecting a readable font, by default. The color adjustments are comprised of increasing the saturation by default. The described embodiments permit the user to make further content and color adjustments. In this example, a user may desire to make further content adjustments, such as increasing or decreasing the content scaling, highlighting titles and links, adjusting font sizing, adjusting line height, magnifying text, or adjusting alignment. Regarding color adjustments, a user may choose to increase contrast in addition to the high saturation that was increased by default.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0266">In some embodiments, the profile customization selection may be configured to cause a supplemental change in a display parameter excluded from a group of display parameters associated with the selected web accessibility profile. Each accessibility profile may be comprised of adjustments to one or more display parameters. In some embodiments, a user may further adjust content, color, and orientation via the accessibility interface after selecting an accessibility profile. Some disclosed embodiments may permit the user to adjust one or display parameters that may not have already been modified based on the selected accessibility profile.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0267">In one example, a user may select an accessibility profile from a list of profiles, such as the cognitive disability profile. The cognitive disability profile is comprised of various predefined content and orientation adjustments, but no color adjustments. Specifically, the content adjustments may be comprised of increasing content scaling by 25% and highlighting titles and links, by default. The orientation adjustments may be comprised of stopping animations, by default. The described embodiments permit the user to make further content and orientation adjustments, but also permit a user to make adjustments to display parameters typically excluded from a group of display parameters associated with the selected web accessibility profile. In this example, a user may therefore make color adjustments as needed, in addition to any desired content and orientation adjustments. Here, a user may choose to increase or decrease color saturation or contrast, may elect to display a website in monochrome, or may adjust text, title, and/or background colors.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0268">Some disclosed embodiments involve a method for causing disability-related changes in website presentations across multiple browsing sessions. The method may include, during a first website browsing session having an associated set of default values for display parameters, receiving a web accessibility profile selection associated with a particular disability, the web accessibility profile selection having an associated set of disability profile values for the display parameters, the disability profile values differing from the default values. The method may also include, based on the web accessibility profile selection, changing the default values for the display parameters to the disability profile values to thereby cause, during the first website browsing session, the website to be accessible to a user with the particular disability. The method may also include causing to be stored in memory in association with the user, the web accessibility profile selection. The method may also include, during a second website browsing session of the user, performing a lookup in memory of the web accessibility profile selection of the user; and applying the web accessibility profile selection during the second website browsing session to thereby cause the second website browsing session to be accessible to the user with the particular disability.</p><p id="p-0270" num="0269">Users may select an accessibility profile in a first browsing session and return to their computing device later for a second browsing session. It is desirable to keep a user's selecting settings uniform between subsequent browsing sessions. In some embodiments, a web accessibility profile selected during a first website browsing session is a vision impairment profile, and during the second website browsing session, content scaling and display intensity may be increased to address the user's accessibility needs. Content scaling and display intensity may also be increased during the first website browsing session. Visually impaired website users may have difficulty discerning different website elements from one another. Therefore, it may be desirable to increase the display intensity, by adjusting the color saturation and contrast, of different website elements so that a user may be able to navigate between different website elements more easily. Additionally, increasing the size of the displayed website content may assist a visually impaired user in navigating a website.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0270">For example, a user may select an accessibility profile in a first browsing session, in which website elements, such as pictures, text, videos, and/or other content, are presented unaltered before selection of the accessibility profile. After the visually impaired accessibility profile is selected, one or more website elements may be displayed at a size larger than they were originally, and the website elements may also be displayed at a higher intensity (e.g., at a high color saturation and contrast) so as to make it easier to discern between two website elements. When the user returns to his or her device for a second browsing session, it may be desirable to maintain the settings that the user entered during the first browsing session. Thus, during the second browsing session, content scaling and website element display intensity may be automatically increased to address the user's accessibility needs.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0271">In some embodiments, a web accessibility profile selected during a first website browsing session is a cognitive disability profile, and the second website browsing session may include automatically highlighting titles and actionable objects to address accessibility needs of the user. Website users who suffer from cognitive disabilities may have difficulty focusing on the essential elements of a website, such as, main headers, interactive tabs, and/or search bars. Therefore, it may be desirable to automatically highlight titles and actionable objects to assist such a user in navigating the website. Highlighting titles and actionable objects such as a search bar or website tabs may ensure that the essential elements of a website become more noticeable and less important elements, such as background photos, advertisements, or smaller text, are not as much of a distraction. The processor associated with the accessibility GUI may scan the website and the website's source code to determine what content is text, headings, images, graphics, videos, and/or animations. Within the cognitive disability profile, movement of background elements may also be paused so as to reduce distractions. When the user returns to his or her device for a second browsing session, it may be desirable to maintain the settings that the user entered during the first browsing session. Therefore, during the second or subsequent browsing session, titles and actionable objects may be automatically highlighted to address the user's accessibility needs.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0272">In some embodiments, a web accessibility profile selected during a first website browsing session is an epilepsy-safe profile, and the second website browsing session may include automatically decreasing display intensity and limiting animation movement on a display to address accessibility needs of the user. Website users who suffer from epilepsy may be more sensitive to certain rates of flashing lights or contrasting light and dark patterns than other users. Therefore, it may be desirable to decrease display intensity (i.e., color saturation and/or contrast) between website elements so as to avoid triggering an epileptic seizure. For example, in a first browsing session, website elements, such as pictures, text, videos, and/or other website content, may be presented unaltered before selection of an accessibility profile. After the epilepsy-safe accessibility profile is selected, color intensity may be reduced so that two website elements, for example, two photos, appear less saturated to the user and there is less contrast. Additionally, animate content, such as an embedded video playing in the background of a website, may appear inanimate or stationary to further reduce contrast between website elements to an epileptic user. When the user returns to his or her device for a second browsing session, it may be desirable to maintain the settings that the user entered during the first browsing session. Thus, during a second or subsequent browsing session, display intensity and animation movement may be automatically limited to address the user's accessibility needs.</p><p id="p-0274" num="0273">In some embodiments, a web accessibility profile selected during a first website browsing session is a neurodevelopmental disorder profile, and the second website browsing session may include automatically increasing content scaling and limiting animation movement to address accessibility needs of the user. Content scaling may also be automatically increased, and animation movement limited during the first browsing session. The neurodevelopmental disorder accessibility profile reduces distractions and provides more focus to certain website elements, which may be helpful to website users who suffer from ADHD or other similar neurodevelopmental disorders. In one example, a website user may wish to read an article. The neurodevelopmental disorder accessibility profile may aid the website user in reading the article by only highlighting a few lines of text at a time as the user moves through the article. The text that the user is not currently reading may appear less bright than the relevant text. In some embodiments, the function of highlighting certain text and not highlighting other text may be referred to as a reading mask. The portion of text that is highlighted by the reading mask may differ between browsing sessions. When the user returns to his or her device for a second browsing session, it is desirable to maintain the settings that the user entered during the first browsing session. Here, display intensity (i.e., color saturation and contrast) and animation movement are automatically limited to address the user's accessibility needs.</p><p id="p-0275" num="0274">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an exemplary method <b>1600</b> for changing an accessibility profile that impacts multiple sessions.

The system may include a memory configured to store values of various website display parameters associated with a plurality of web accessibility profiles; and at least one processor configured to: during a first website browsing session having an associated set of default values for display parameters, receive a web accessibility profile selection associated with a particular disability, the web accessibility profile selection having an associated set of disability profile values for the display parameters, the disability profile values differing from the default values; based on the web accessibility profile selection, change the default values for the display parameters to the disability profile values to thereby cause, during the first website browsing session, the website to be accessible to a user with the particular disability; cause to be stored in memory in association with the user, the web accessibility profile selection; during a second website browsing session of the user, perform a lookup in memory of the web accessibility profile selection of the user; and apply the web accessibility profile selection during the second website browsing session to thereby cause the second website browsing session to be accessible to the user with the particular disability.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0276">Customizing a website for a disabled user may involve modifying a multitude of parameter settings, which may be inconvenient for some users. To alleviate at least some of the inconvenience, a specific web accessibility profile corresponding to a specific disability may be associated with one or more predefined parameter settings for the website, for example to address needs typically associated with the specific disability. When a user selects the specific web accessibility profile (e.g., via an accessibility GUI), one or more changes may be automatically made to a website corresponding to the one or more predefined display settings, e.g., to adapt the website to accommodate typical needs of users having the specific disability. However, some disabled users may have needs that diverge from the typical needs associated with the specific disability. Such users may benefit from an accessibility GUI that allows users to further customize a website, for example by changing or overriding one or more of the predefined settings. The accessibility GUI may thereby balance between efficiency (e.g., provided by the predefined settings) and customization (e.g., provided by the capability to change or override one or more predefined settings).</p><p id="p-0278" num="0277">For example, a cognitive display profile associated with cognitive disability may include predefined display settings to increase the content scaling by 25% and highlight titles and links. However, a specific cognitively impaired user may require the content scaling to be increased by 40%. Thus, the accessibility GUI may implement the predefined settings upon selection of the cognitive display profile (e.g., automatically) by a specific user, while allowing the specific user to further personalize the website, such as by changing additional display parameters, and/or overriding one or more of the predefined changes already implemented. The personalized settings may be stored for subsequent use by the specific user or a user with similar needs to the specific user, e.g., to save time and effort the next time the user, initiates a browsing session.</p><p id="p-0279" num="0278">As another example, typical users with ADHD (e.g., a specific disability) may benefit from modifications to a website that halt the rendering of video content and block pop-up windows. Accordingly, an ADHD accessibility profile may be associated with predefined changes to website display parameters to halt the playing of video content and block the display of pop-up windows, e.g., to accommodate typical needs of users with ADHD. However, a specific user with ADHD (e.g., a non-typical user) may require the blocking of pop-up windows but may tolerate the rendering of video content. The specific user may request to change or override the display setting halting of the video content via the accessibility GUI. After defining the display settings for the specific user, the display settings may be stored for implementing during a subsequent browsing session by the specific user. For example, the next time the specific user with ADHD initiates a browsing session, pop-up windows may be blocked, e.g., implementing one of the predefined settings, but video content may be played, e.g., overriding another predefined setting.</p><p id="p-0280" num="0279">The description that follows relates to displaying an accessibility graphical user interface (GUI) for modifying a plurality of display parameters of a website. The accessibility GUI may present a plurality of web accessibility profiles, each associated with differing disabilities. An initial input may be received via the accessibility GUI indicative of a selection of a specific web accessibility profile, (e.g., associated with a specific disability). Based on the initial input, a plurality of predefined changes may be implemented (e.g., automatically) in a group of display parameters of the website. The plurality of predefined changes may be configured to address a disability (e.g., the specific disability) associated with the selected web accessibility profile. For example, the plurality of predefined changes may accommodate needs typically associated with the disability. The accessibility GUI may present information to indicate the plurality of implemented changes in the display parameters, and thereby inform the user of the changes made. This may allow the user to accept, reject or modify one or more of the changes made, and/or to make additional changes. On receiving additional input via the accessibility GUI to make at least one alteration to at least one of the predefined changes, the predefined change may be overridden. The two-step approach provided by the accessibility GUI, of first prompting the user to select a web accessibility profile to implement a set of predefined changes (e.g., to address typical needs associated with the web accessibility profile), followed by prompting the user to modify or override one or more of the predefined changes (e.g., to address individual needs of a specific user) may enable users to personalize the display of web content to accommodate their specific needs in an efficient and convenient manner.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0280">In some instances, the description that follows may refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>19</b></figref> which illustrate an exemplary implementation of an accessibility graphical user interface (GUI) <b>1702</b> enabling a user to customize a web accessibility profile, consistent with some disclosed embodiments. Accessibility GUI <b>1702</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>19</b></figref> is intended merely to facilitate the conceptualizing of one exemplary implementation for an accessibility GUI enabling a user to customize a web accessibility profile and does not limit the disclosure to any particular implementation.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0281">Some embodiments involve a non-transitory computer readable medium containing instructions that when executed by at least one processor cause the at least one processor to perform operations for enabling a user to customize a web accessibility profile. The term &#x201c;web accessibility profile&#x201d; may be understood as described earlier. A computer program (e.g., a software application) may be provided for execution by at least one processor to enable a user to personalize (e.g., customize) a web accessibility profile. The computer program may be operable with a web browser configured to display web content according to one or more standard display settings (e.g., configured for non-disabled users). Executing the computer program may cause the at least one processor to display an accessibility GUI (e.g., alongside a website) and prompt a user to select one of multiple web accessibility profiles. Each web accessibility profile may be associated with one or more predefined (e.g., default) changes to display parameters that may override one or more of the standard display settings. The predefined changes may be configured (e.g., in advance) to address typical needs associated with disabilities corresponding to the web accessibility profile. The at least one processor may implement the predefined changes associated with a specific web accessibility profile upon selection of the specific web accessibility profile by a user. The at least one processor may allow the user to personalize the selected web accessibility profile, for example to accommodate specific needs of the user that differ from the typical needs (e.g., addressed by the predefined changes). For example, the user may select to implement additional changes not included in the predefined changes, or to modify or override any of the predefined changes.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0282">Some embodiments involve displaying an accessibility graphical user interface (GUI) for modifying a plurality of display parameters of a website, wherein the accessibility GUI presents a plurality of web accessibility profiles associated with differing disabilities. The terms &#x201c;GUI,&#x201d; &#x201c;display parameter&#x201d; and &#x201c;website&#x201d; may be understood as described earlier. The term &#x201c;modifying a plurality of display parameters of a website&#x201d; may refer to adjusting or changing multiple display characteristics of the website to alter the appearance of the website, where &#x201c;display parameters&#x201d; may relate to any format, feature, or characteristic for conveying information. Such display parameters may impact one or more of visual, audio, and tactile media, and may be associated with a computer interface capable of enabling user interaction or display. Examples of display parameters may include parameters relating to text (e.g., font size, type and style, line spacing and height, margin size, text alignment), parameters relating to color (e.g., saturation, brightness, contrast, background color), parameters relating to images (e.g., image size, position, hiding or showing images, halting or playing an animated video), parameters relating to audio (e.g., to mute sounds, increase or decrease volume or speed, apply filters), and any other parameters that may affect the display of content. According to some embodiments, the display parameters may also include parameters affecting the navigation of a website (e.g., cursor style and size, hover style, selection indication, link style). When a user initiates a browsing session (e.g., by causing at least one processor to execute a web browser), at least one processor (e.g., the same or different processor as the processor executing the web browser) may retrieve the accessibility GUI from a server, (e.g., an accessibility service host) and display the accessibility GUI, e.g., inside or alongside the browser window. The accessibility GUI may present multiple different web accessibility profiles, each associated with a different disability and configured to accommodate a website for the associated disability, e.g., by modifying one or more display parameters of the website. For example, selecting a blind user profile may automatically invoke a screen reader to accommodate typical blind persons, and selecting a cognitive display profile may automatically increase the content scaling to accommodate typical cognitively impaired users, thereby modifying display parameters of the website.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0283">By way of a non-limiting example, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, an accessibility GUI <b>1702</b> may be displayed alongside a website <b>1704</b> to allow modifying one or more display parameters of website <b>1704</b>. For example, processing device <b>210</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (e.g., at least one processor) may retrieve accessibility GUI <b>1702</b> from accessibility service host <b>130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) via communications network <b>140</b> and display accessibility GUI <b>1702</b>, in response to any of users <b>110</b>A, <b>1108</b>, or <b>110</b>C opening a web browser application on computing devices <b>170</b>A, <b>170</b>B, <b>170</b>C, respectively, to view website <b>1704</b>. Accessibility GUI <b>1702</b> may present a variety of web accessibility profiles for selection, each associated with a different disability. Selecting one of the web accessibility profiles may cause processing unit <b>210</b>A to implement one or more predefined changes to one or more display parameters of website <b>1704</b>.

It is to be noted that these profiles are intended as exemplary only, and the accessibility GUI may present a different set of web accessibility profiles, including additional and/or fewer web accessibility profiles. Processing device <b>210</b>A may enable any of users <b>1108</b>, <b>110</b>A or <b>110</b>C to customize any of the web accessibility profiles presented by GUI <b>1702</b>.

For example, the cognitive display profile <b>1712</b> may allow user <b>110</b>B to modify display parameters of website <b>1704</b>, such as the font size, font color, highlighting of titles, links, which may facilitate user <b>1108</b> in navigating website <b>1704</b>.</p><p id="p-0286" num="0285">According to some embodiments, the plurality of web accessibility profiles involve at least three of vision impairment, epilepsy, color blindness, mobility impairment, hearing difficulties, seizures, photosensitivity, cognitive impairment, or dyslexia. The accessibility GUI may provide a diverse range of web accessibility profiles to suit a wide range of disabled users, each web accessibility profile associated with a set of predefined changes to assist in adapting website to suit the needs of different categories users. Additionally, the accessibility GUI may enable users to customize any of the web accessibility profiles to personalize their interface with a website. This may enable the accessibility GUI to address a wide range of disabilities efficiently while enabling users to further personalize the display. By way of a non-limiting example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an accessibility GUI presenting six different web accessibility profiles, such a Seizure Safe profile to address epilepsy, seizure, and photosensitivity, a Vision Impaired profile to address vision impairment, color blindness and/or photosensitivity, a cognitive display profile to address cognitive impairment, an ADHD Friendly profile to address dyslexia, a Blind Users profile to address blindness, and a Keyboard Navigation profile to address motor impairment. Similarly, the accessibility GUI may present a Hearing-Impaired profile to address hearing difficulties, and additional profiles to address additional disabilities. In some embodiments, the accessibility GUI may present web accessibility profiles for at least three of: of vision impairment, epilepsy, color blindness, mobility impairment, hearing difficulties, seizures, photosensitivity, cognitive impairment, or dyslexia. For example, presenting three or more profiles may provide a sufficiently diverse range of accommodations for differing disabilities without overcrowding the accessibility GUI and overwhelming disabled users with too many choices. For example, a facility serving blind and visually impaired persons may provide an accessibility GUI presenting web accessibility profiles for vision impairment, color blindness, and photosensitivity, but may omit web accessibility profiles for epilepsy, mobility impairment, hearing difficulties, and cognitive impairment to simplify the accessibility GUI, since these profiles may not be relevant to the users of the facility.</p><p id="p-0287" num="0286">Some embodiments involve receiving initial input via the accessibility GUI indicative of a selection of a specific web accessibility profile. The term &#x201c;receiving&#x201d; may refer to acquiring, obtaining, retrieving, or otherwise gaining access to information, e.g., via a user interface, as described earlier. The term &#x201c;input&#x201d; may include any type of data provided by a user via an input device, as described earlier. The input may include text, voice, images, gestures, selection of web element, and any other format for data. For example, the accessibility GUI may display web elements, such as an interactive button, graphic, or icon, associated with each web accessibility profile. An event listener may notify the at least one processor when a specific web element associated with a web accessibility profile has been selected. As another example, the accessibility GUI may provide voice recognition and/or gesture recognition capabilities to receive voice and/or gesture inputs as a selection of a web accessibility profile, respectively. In this manner, the at least one processor may receive a first input as a selection of a specific web accessibility profile.</p><p id="p-0288" num="0287">By way of a non-limiting example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary implementation for receiving an initial input via accessibility GUI <b>1702</b> indicating a selection of a specific web accessibility profile, consistent with some disclosed embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> illustrates accessibility GUI <b>1702</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> after a user (e.g., user <b>1108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) has selected cognitive display profile <b>1712</b> (e.g., a specific web accessibility profile) by selecting the ON setting for a button <b>1720</b> associated with cognitive display profile <b>1712</b>.

An event listener may notify processing device <b>210</b>A of the selection, thereby processing device <b>210</b>A may receive the initial input via accessibility GUI <b>1702</b> indicative selection of cognitive display profile <b>1712</b>.</p><p id="p-0289" num="0288">Some embodiments involve, based on the initial input, implementing a plurality of predefined changes in a group of display parameters of the website to address a disability associated with the specific web accessibility profile. The term &#x201c;implementing a plurality of predefined changes in a group of display parameters of the website&#x201d; may refer to refer to modifying, replacing, substituting, or otherwise altering a rendering of one or more visual elements of the website according to one or more settings defined in advance, e.g., for the specific web accessibility profile. The term &#x201c;address a disability&#x201d; may refer to targeting the disability for the purpose of facilitating or assisting an individual having that disability, for example to accommodate a website for navigation by the disabled individual, as described earlier. Thus, on receiving the first input indicating the selection of a specific web accessibility profile, multiple default (e.g., predefined) changes associated with the specific web accessibility profile may be (e.g., automatically) implemented, such as to accommodate needs typical to users associated with the specific web accessibility profile. For example, a typical blind user may benefit from a screen reader and a voice-enabled interface (e.g., predefined changes to a group of display parameters). Selecting the Blind Users accessibility profile may automatically invoke the screen reader and voice-enabled interface to accommodate a typical blind user. As another example, a typical cognitively disabled person may benefit from an increase in content scaling and displaying contextual graphic images on navigation buttons. Selecting the Cognitive Display accessibility profile may automatically increase the content scaling and display descriptive graphic images to accompany text. Similarly, selecting the ADHD accessibility profile may block pop-up windows and animation videos to assist typical users with ADHD, and selecting the keyboard navigation accessibility profile may display and enable keypress sequences for navigating a website to assist typical users with motor impairment. According to some embodiments, the predefined changes for each of the web accessibility profiles may be stored at an accessibility service host with the accessibility GUI.</p><p id="p-0290" num="0289">By way of a non-limiting example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>18</b></figref> together, illustrate an implementation of a plurality of predefined changes to display parameters for a website, based on the selection of a specific web accessibility profile, consistent with some disclosed embodiments.

The interface may include display-based elements (e.g., interactive buttons, slide bars, dials, text boxes, and the like) and non-display-based means (e.g., voice and/or gesture-based interface) as described earlier. The interface may allow the user to make alterations to one or more of the changes already implemented (e.g., the predefined changes) and/or to change other display parameters of the website not affected by the predefined changes. This capability may allow the user to personalize (e.g., customize) the display of the website to accommodate the individual needs and preferences of the user, e.g., that may not have been addressed by the predefined changes.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0293">For example, selecting the blind user profile may cause several predefined changes to be implemented to address blindness, such as to hide some displayed content and invoke a screen reader as a substitute. However, a specific blind user (e.g., accompanied by a seeing assistant) may wish to restore at least some of the hidden content (e.g., make an alteration to one of the predefined changes). Additionally, or alternatively, the blind user may wish to increase the font size of displayed content by 20% (e.g., change a display parameter not included in the group of display parameters associated with the blind user profile). To enable this customization, the accessibility GUI may present an interface allowing the blind user to individually adjust one or more of the display parameters. At least a portion of the interface may be associated with the predefined changes for the blind user profile. For example, selecting the blind user profile may automatically invoke a microphone to detect voice commands, allowing the blind user to adjust settings for the screen reader and hidden content (e.g., the predefined changes). The blind user may request (e.g., via the microphone) to restore the hidden content and thereby alter one of the predefined changes. In this manner, the processor may receive additional input via the accessibility GUI to alter one of the predefined changes. Additionally, or alternatively, the blind user may request to increase the font size by 20% to implement a change not included in the group of predefined changes associated with the blind user profile.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0294">By way of a non-limiting example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary implementation for receiving additional input via accessibility GUI <b>1702</b> to alter one of the predefined changes, consistent with disclosed embodiments.

For example, user <b>110</b>B may decide to keep the increase in content scaling and the highlighting of the titles of website <b>1704</b> by leaving these parameters settings unchanged. However, user <b>110</b>B may decide to reject the highlighting of links of website <b>1704</b> (e.g., implement an alteration to one of the predefined changes) by deselecting the highlight links button <b>1736</b>. Accordingly, content adjustments box <b>1706</b> of accessibility GUI <b>1702</b> indicates the content scaling is still set to +25%, and the highlight titles button is still selected (e.g., user <b>1108</b> did not make alterations to two of the three predefined changes), but the highlight links button <b>1736</b> is now deselected (e.g., user <b>110</b>B made an alteration to one of the three predefined changes).

For example, after receiving the additional input via the accessibility GUI, an alteration may be made to one of the predefined changes implemented earlier, for example to accommodate specific needs that diverge from the typical needs addressed by the predefined changes. This may allow personalizing (e.g., customizing) the display of the website to suit the individual requirement and needs of the user. Returning to the example of the blind user, on receiving the voice command to restore content hidden in response to the selection of the blind user profile, the at least one processor may restore the hidden content, thereby overriding at least one of the predefined changes associated with the blind user profile.

As an example, display parameters such as color saturation and content scaling may be defined as a percent of a maximum possible value. Other display parameters, such as font size, line height, or letter spacing may be defined by a value within a range of minimum and maximum values. The additional input may therefore be a selection of a specific value, or it may involve the sliding a slider or the use of some other interface control through which the additional input is provided.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0298">By way of a non-limiting example, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the content scaling slide bar <b>1732</b> of content adjustments box <b>1706</b> of accessibility GUI <b>1702</b> is set to 25%, indicating a degree of adjustment to the content scaling.

By contrast, the highlight links button <b>1736</b> has only a binary (e.g., on/off) setting that may be set by selecting or deselecting the button, respectively.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0299">According to some embodiments the additional input is indicative of a selection to cancel at least one of the predefined changes in the group of display parameters. For example, informing the user of the implemented predefined changes may allow a specific user to reject (e.g., cancel) one of the predefined changes, e.g., if the predefined change does not suit the specific user. For example, a user may cancel a predefined change by deselecting a button associated with the predefined change (e.g., switching the button to &#x201c;OFF&#x201d;), by adjusting a slide bar to revert the value of a display parameter to an original value (e.g., before the predefined change was implemented), by selecting the original value for the display parameter from a menu, by typing the original value for the display parameter into a text box, or by using any other interfacing means to cancel the predefined change (e.g., by pressing on a &#x201c;Cancel Changes&#x201d; button).</p><p id="p-0301" num="0300">By way of a non-limiting example, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, the deselection of the highlight links button <b>1736</b> of content adjustments box <b>1706</b> (e.g., additional input) may indicate to processing device <b>210</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) to cancel the predefined change to highlight links, associated with the cognitive display profile. Accordingly, while link <b>1710</b> is displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> highlighted, link <b>1710</b> is displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> without highlight, e.g., the predefined change has been cancelled.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0301">According to some embodiments, the additional input is further indicative of an additional selection of a change other than one of the predefined changes. In addition to the predefined changes associated with a given web accessibility profile, the accessibility GUI may allow users to personalize other display parameters, not included in the group of predefined changes. For example, selecting an ADHD accessibility profile may automatically cause pop-up windows and animation videos to be blocked, (e.g., predefined changes to parameter settings to address typical needs of ADHD users). However, a specific user with ADHD may suffer from poor color perception and may thus wish to alter the color saturation and color contrast settings which are not included in the predefined changes for users with ADHD. The accessibility GUI may provide the user with an interface for adjusting additional parameters other than the predefined changes, such as the color saturation and contrast.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0302">By way of a non-limiting example, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, user <b>110</b>B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) has selected the readable font button <b>1722</b> and align center button <b>1726</b> of content adjustment box <b>1706</b>, which were not included in the group of predefined changes for the cognitive display profile. User <b>1108</b> may thus provide additional input indicating a selection to make a change other that one of the predefined changes.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0303">Some embodiments may involve determining, based on the additional input, a first value for a first display parameter and a second value for a second display parameter. For example, the accessibility GUI may allow a user to change multiple different display parameters. Returning the ADHD example above, after selecting the ADHD accessibility profile to implement the predefined changes, the specific user with ADHD may provide additional input via the accessibility GUI, for example to adjust the color settings to address poor color perception. The additional input may affect multiple different display parameters related to the display of color. For example, the additional input may include multiple values to update the color saturation, the color contrast, and highlight links when displaying the website.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0304">By way of a non-limiting example, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, after selecting the cognitive display profile (e.g., the first input), user <b>1108</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may provide additional input via content adjustments box <b>1706</b> such as to deselect highlight links button <b>1734</b> and to select align center button <b>1726</b>. Thus, processing unit <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may determine to display link <b>1710</b> in website <b>1704</b> not highlighted (e.g., the first value for the first display parameter) and center aligned (e.g., the second value for the second display parameter). It is to be noted that the first and second values for the first and second display parameters may relate to the same or different display elements. For example, the user may set two setting affecting the display of the title, such as align center and highlight. Thus, the first and second values may both relate to the same display element.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0305">According to some embodiments, the first value is a binary, and the second value defines a range value. For example, some display parameters (e.g., highlight links, highlight titles, block pop-ups) may be set as binary values, such as an ON/OFF toggle or by selecting or deselecting a button associated with a display parameter. Other display parameters may be set as a value within a range of possible values (e.g., a range value) to indicate a degree of adjustment. For example, display parameters such as content scaling, color saturation, and font size may be defined as a value or percentage within a range of possibilities. Whereas display parameters such as highlighting links and titles may take on binary (e.g., ON/OFF) values. The accessibility GUI may allow the user to adjust parameter settings that take on binary values and values within a range of values. Returning to the ADHD example above, after selecting the ADHD accessibility profile (e.g., the first input) the user with ADHD may provide additional input to (i) highlight links and (ii) increase the color saturation to 80%. The user may select a highlight links button as a binary value (e.g., ON/OFF) and may set the color saturation to 80% by maneuvering a slide bar.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0306">By way of a non-limiting example, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, after selecting cognitive display profile <b>1712</b> (e.g., the first input), user <b>110</b>B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may provide additional input via content adjustments box <b>1706</b> by selecting readable fonts button <b>1722</b> (e.g., a binary value) and adjusting the slide bar of content scaling <b>1732</b> (e.g., a range value).</p><p id="p-0308" num="0307">Some embodiments include using the initial input and the additional input for modifying a display of at least one additional website. For example, after customizing the display of a first website via the accessibility GUI, e.g., based on the first and additional inputs, when the user navigates to a second website, such as via a link on the first website, the display of the second website may be modified similarly to the modification made to the first website, e.g., based on the first and additional inputs. For example, a blind user may select the blind user profile to automatically invoke a screen reader for navigating the first website. When the blind user navigates to the second website (e.g., via a link in the first website), the screen reader may continue to be invoked for the second website in accordance with the predefined changes made for the first website. As another example, the display parameters defined by a user (e.g., via the first and additional inputs) for navigating a first website may be stored for a subsequent browsing. For example, the display parameters may be stored locally at the computer of the user for a subsequent browsing session by the user at the same computing device. Alternatively, the display parameters may be stored remotely, e.g., at an accessibility server, for a subsequent browsing session on the same or a different computing device. On initiating a new browsing session via a web browser to navigate a new website, the display parameters from the previous browsing session may be retrieved from memory and implemented for the new browsing session, e.g., to modify the display of the new website based on the first and additional inputs. The display parameters may be stored in association with the user, the computing device of the user, the web accessibility profile of the user, or any other criterion that may assist in modifying a website for a web accessibility profile.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0308">By way of a non-limiting example, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, after selecting cognitive display profile <b>1712</b> (e.g., the first input), multiple predefined changes may be made.

However, user <b>110</b>B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may further modify display parameters by deselecting highlight links button <b>1736</b> and selecting readable font and align center buttons <b>1722</b> and <b>1726</b>, respectively. The web browser may adjust the display of website <b>1704</b> on computing device <b>1708</b> to reflect these modifications. The updated display settings may be stored in memory (e.g., in RAM or memory device <b>220</b>A of computing device <b>1708</b> or in data structure <b>250</b>B of server <b>136</b>). When user <b>110</b>B presses on link <b>1710</b> (e.g., Learn More) to navigate to another website, different than website <b>1704</b>, the web browser may apply the same parameter settings (e.g., retrieved from storage in memory) to display the other website. Thus, the content scaling of the other website may be increased by 25%, and the highlight titles, readable font and align center buttons <b>1734</b>, <b>1722</b> and <b>1726</b> may be selected to highlight titles, change font and center align text, respectively.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0309">Some embodiments may involve saving the display parameter settings for subsequent use by the specific user. Thus, some embodiments may involve causing storage of first data indicative of a web accessibility profile selection corresponding to the received input and causing storage of second data indicative of a profile customization selection corresponding to the received additional input. As noted, the adjustments made by a user to the predefined changes associated with a specific web accessibility profile may be stored for subsequent use. This may simplify the experience for the specific user and spare the specific user from having to repeatedly adjust the parameter settings for each session. Thus, both the web accessibility profile selected by the user (e.g., the first input) and the adjustments made by the user to the predefined changes associated with the selected web accessibility profile (e.g., the additional input) may be stored in memory (e.g., locally at the computing device used by the user, or remotely at a cloud storage facility). The first and additional input may be stored in association with a unique identifier for the user and/or optionally, the computing device of the user. On identifying the user and/or the computing device of the user during a subsequent session, the selected web accessibility profile and any modification made to predefined changes associated therewith may be retrieved and implemented.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0310">By way of a non-limiting example, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, processing device <b>210</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may store the selection by user <b>110</b>B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the cognitive display profile (e.g., first data corresponding to the first input) and the deselection of the highlight links button and the selection of the readable font and align center buttons <b>1722</b> and <b>1726</b> (e.g., second data indicating profile customization) at data structure <b>2508</b> of accessibility service host <b>130</b> or alternatively at memory device <b>220</b>A of computing device <b>170</b>B.

As described earlier, a computing device may include all possible types of devices capable of exchanging data in a communications network such as the Internet. For example, some display parameter settings may be stored at a local memory device of the computing device used by the user, e.g., to navigate the website. This may be useful in situations where a user has exclusive use of the computing device but may also be useful when the computing device is shared by multiple users with similar accessibility needs. Local storage may also facilitate quick retrieval and implementation of the parameter settings. Thus, the web accessibility profile selected by the user (e.g., first data) and/or modifications made to predefined changes associated therewith (e.g., second data) may be stored at the computing device used by the user for displaying the website, e.g., to facilitate retrieval for subsequent implementation.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0312">By way of a non-limiting example, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, processing device <b>210</b>A may store the selection of the cognitive display profile (e.g., first data) and/or the deselection of the highlight links button and the selection of the readable font and align center buttons (e.g., second data) locally at computing device <b>170</b>B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) used by user <b>110</b>B to display website <b>1704</b>.

For example, in situations where the user does not have exclusive use of a computing device, or when the user wishes to transfer display parameters defined on one computing device to another computing device (e.g., from a desktop computer to a mobile device), it may be useful to store one or more display parameters at a cloud storage facility accessible by multiple devices via a network. This may allow the user to access the display parameters from any computing device in communication with the remote server. The display parameters may be stored in any suitable format such as in a table, as cookies (e.g., small text files), as source code instructions (e.g., for injecting into source code for a website), in a database, in a linked list, and any other format for storing display parameters.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0314">By way of a non-limiting example, user <b>110</b>B may use computing device <b>1708</b> to select cognitive display profile <b>1720</b> (e.g., first data), deselect highlight links button <b>1738</b>, and select readable font and align center buttons <b>1722</b> and <b>1726</b> (e.g., second data).

The term &#x201c;browsing session&#x201d; may refer to a continuous period of user activity in a web browser, where a web browser is a software application for accessing digital content on the World Wide Web or on a local internet site. For example, a browsing session may last for 30 minutes, but may be shorter or longer than 30 minutes. A browsing session may be initiated by opening a web browser on a computing device. The web browser may retrieve source code for a webpage, e.g., from a remote website host, and execute the source code (e.g., on the computing device) to render the digital content of the webpage on the computing device (e.g., a first browsing session). The first browsing session may be terminated when the user closes the browser application or after a period of time that it was not used. Reopening the browser application may initiate a new, e.g., second browsing session. The second browsing session may be initiated by the same user and on the same device as the first browsing session, by the same user on a different device as the first browsing session, by a different user on the same device as the first browsing session, or by a different user on a different device as the first browsing session. One or more display parameters set during the first browsing session may be stored in memory and retrieved for the second browsing session. For example, the display parameters (e.g., the web accessibility profile customized by the additional input) may be stored in association with an identifier of the user and/or the computing device of the first browsing session. The display parameters may be retrieved for the second browsing session by querying for the identifier. The display parameters may be stored in a table, as small text files or cookies, as source code instructions for injecting into source code of a website, in a database, in a linked list, and any other format for storing display parameters.</p><p id="p-0317" num="0316">Thus, after the user customizes the display parameters during the first browsing session, the display parameters e.g., including the selected web accessibility profile (the initial input) and additional input overriding one or more predefined changes (e.g., the second data) may be stored in memory (e.g., locally, or remotely). After the first browsing session terminates (e.g., by closing the web browser), upon initiation of the second browsing session (e.g., by opening the same or different web browser), the display parameters may be retrieved from memory. The retrieved display parameters may be applied for the second browsing session to continue to provide a customized accessibility experience for the second browsing session. For example, a first blind user may customize display parameters for a blind user profile during a first browsing session on a first computing device. The customized display parameters may be stored on the first computing device (e.g., as cookies). During a subsequent browsing session on the first computing device (e.g., by the same blind user or another blind user) the customized display parameters may be retrieved and implemented to continue providing a customized accessibility experience for the first and/or second blind users. As another example, a cognitively impaired user may customize display parameters for a cognitive display profile during a first browsing session on a desktop computer. The customized display parameters may be stored at a remote (e.g., cloud) storage device (e.g., as cookies). During a subsequent browsing session by the same cognitively impaired user on a mobile device, different than the desktop computer, the customized display parameters may be retrieved (e.g., based on the identifier of the cognitively impaired user) and implemented on the mobile device to continue providing the customized accessibility experience to the cognitively impaired user on the mobile device.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0317">By way of a non-limiting example, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, after terminating the browsing session to navigate website <b>1704</b>, processing device <b>110</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may store the selection of the cognitive display profile (e.g., first input), the deselection of the highlight links button (e.g., second input overriding one of the predefined changes associated with the cognitive display profile) and the selection of the readable font and align center buttons (e.g., second inputs not included in the predefined changes), e.g., at computing device <b>170</b>B in association with user <b>1108</b>. When user <b>110</b>B initiates a new browsing session (e.g., the same user on the same computing device), processing device <b>110</b>A may automatically retrieve the parameter settings from storage and implement the corresponding changes, accordingly.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0318">According to some embodiments, during the second browsing session and before applying the web accessibility profile selection including the profile customization selection, the operations further include confirming that a user associated with the second browsing session is a same user that provided the initial input and the additional input. For example, in situations where one computing device is shared across multiple users, such as in a library, a home, a workplace, or hostel, it may be beneficial to confirm the identify of a user before implementing changes. This may prevent implementing inappropriate modifications, for example implementing changes suitable for blind users on a computing device used by a cognitively impaired user or implementing customized changes for one blind user on a computing device used by a different blind user. For example, each user may be associated with a unique identifier allowing the at least one processor to retrieve the customized settings for each specific user. The unique identifier may be based on biometric data, personal data (e.g., birthday, home address), a username, a password, a personal identity code (PIN), an email address, a phone number, a one-time password (e.g., for use with a cryptographic hash function), or any other type of uniquely identifying data. The display parameters may be stored in association with the unique identifier in a database, and retrievable by querying the database with the unique identifier. Before implementing changes associated with a specific user, the at least one processor may first confirm the identity of the specific user, to ensure that the implemented changes are suitable for the specific user. For example, the user may be prompted for a password, (e.g., a one-time password sent to a personal email address or mobile device of the user), for biometric data (e.g., as a finger press on a touch sensitive display), personal data, or any other technique for verifying the identity of the user. Similarly, an image sensor such as a camera associated with the computing device may capture one or more images of a user's face or hands, to thereby confirm the identity of the user as a basis for implementing a set of web accessibility parameters. In a similar way, voice patters or keystroke patterns of the user may be detected in order to confirm the user's identity (e.g., by comparing the patterns to prior known patterns associated with the user.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0319">According to some embodiments, during the second browsing session and before applying the web accessibility profile selection and the profile customization selection, the operations further include avoiding application of the web accessibility profile selection and the profile customization selection when the second browsing session is associated with a second user different from the user that provided the initial input and the additional input. For example, if the current user is different than a previous user, changes associated with the previous user may not be implemented. For example, a first visually impaired user may use a computing device during a first browsing session to customize parameter settings for the visually impaired user profile. The customization may invoke the screen reader only for text content included in navigation links and titles, but not for other text displayed in the website. The customizes parameter settings for the first visually impaired user may be stored for a subsequent browsing session by the first visually impaired user. A second visually impaired user may use the same computing device during a second browsing session. However, the customized settings for the first visually impaired user may not suit the second visually impaired user who may wish to invoke the screen reader for all text content in the website. Thus, before implementing the changes associated with the first visually impaired user the identity of the current user of the computing device may be confirmed. If the current user is the second visually impaired user (e.g., different than the first visually impaired user) the implementation of the customized parameter settings may be avoided.</p><p id="p-0321" num="0320">By way of a non-limiting example, during a first browsing session on device <b>170</b>A, user <b>110</b>A who is visually impaired may select a Visually Impaired profile (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) and may further customize the Visually impaired profile by increasing color saturation to 80%. Following the first browsing session, user <b>1108</b> who is cognitively impaired may also use device <b>170</b>A for a browsing session (e.g., a second browsing session). However, the display settings defined by user <b>110</b>A may not suit user <b>110</b>B. For example, the increased color saturation may disturb user <b>110</b>B, and user <b>110</b>B may benefit by the addition of descriptive graphic images to accompany text. Processing unit <b>210</b>A may detect that user <b>110</b>B is different than user <b>110</b>A (e.g., based on a password or biometric identification) and may thus avoid applying changes corresponding to the Visually Impaired profile and any customization to the same.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0321">Some embodiments involve enabling a user to customize a web accessibility profile.

The term &#x201c;vision impairment profile&#x201d; may be designed for disabilities such as degrading eyesight, tunnel vision, cataract, glaucoma, and others, as described earlier. For example, increasing content scaling and increasing display intensity may address needs typically associated with vision impairment. Thus, the predefined changes associated with the vision impairment profile may automatically implement changes to accommodate typical vision impaired users. However, vision impairment may vary widely between different users. For example, some users may have only mild vision impairment, requiring only a few display adjustments, whereas other users may have more severe vision impairment, requiring significant display adjustments. Thus, the degree of visual impairment may impact the degree of adjustment needed. Accordingly, after automatically implementing the predefined changes associated with vision impairment, the accessibility GUI may allow a specific visually impaired user to customize the vision impairment profile.

Default website display parameters may include limits, characteristics, variables, constraints, elements, or attributes that are preselected or adopted by a computer program or other mechanism when no alternative is specified by the user or programmer. For example, a default website display parameter may include the size of the font that is automatically displayed on the website. As another example, a default website display parameter may include the size of the window that is automatically displayed on the website. In another example, a default website parameter may include the color theme that is automatically applied to the website. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is an example of a website <b>2110</b> presented with default website display parameters, consistent with some embodiments of the present disclosure. In the default view, website <b>2110</b> is presented with no modifications to the default website display parameters. Altering default website display parameters may include replacing, varying, exchanging, shifting, or in any other way changing the default website display parameters. For example, altering default website display parameters may include replacing a color image with a black and white image on a website display.</p><p id="p-0339" num="0338">Conforming with a neurodevelopmental disorder profile may include changing or modifying certain website display parameters to match neurodevelopmental disorder-friendly website display parameters, reducing the amount or impact of certain website display parameters that are not desirable for users with a neurodevelopmental disorder, or in any other way changing a website to make the website more similar to a neurodevelopmental disorder profile. For example, conforming with a neurodevelopmental disorder profile may include increasing content scaling on a website to match a content scaling parameter of a neurodevelopmental disorder profile. In some embodiments, the neurodevelopmental disorder includes at least one of: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, learning disabilities, intellectual disability, conduct disorders, or cerebral palsy. It may be desirable to implement predefined templates to conform with the needs of users with such disorders because these types of disorders may make websites more difficult for these users to navigate and understand.</p><p id="p-0340" num="0339">An epilepsy-safe profile may include any profile that may be beneficial for or compatible with individuals that suffer from epilepsy. Individuals with photosensitive epilepsy may experience seizures triggers by displays that flicker, flash, or blink, especially with flashing that has a high intensity and is within certain frequency ranges. This is particularly a problem with the use of animated GIFs and videos in websites. Thus, an epilepsy-safe profile may refer to a profile that reduces or avoids any of these aspects of websites. In one example, an epilepsy profile may include a profile that does not contain any content that flashes more than three times in any one second period. A flash may include a sudden brief burst of an image, video, light, or color. In another example, an epilepsy-safe profile may include any content that does not flash below certain flash thresholds, or certain red flash thresholds. A flash threshold may include a maximum number, frequency, magnitude, or intensity of flashes associated with an epilepsy-safe profile. Other examples of an epilepsy-safe profile include a profile that includes one or more of reducing contrast for any flashing content, avoiding fully saturated red colors for any flashing content, reducing the number of flashes, preventing flashing content from flashing before it begins, slowing down content to avoid rapid flashes, freezing an image momentarily when the image is configured to have a certain number of flashes in one second, reducing the contrast ratio when there are a certain number of flashes in one second, and providing a warning if certain website content is not safe for individuals with epilepsy. Conforming with an epilepsy-safe profile may include changing or modifying certain website display parameters to match epilepsy-safe website display parameters, reducing the amount or impact of certain website display parameters that are not epilepsy-safe, or in any other way changing a website to make the website more similar to an epilepsy-safe profile. For example, conforming with an epilepsy-safe profile may include changing the color of a video on a website to match a video color parameter of an epilepsy-safe profile. In another example, conforming with an epilepsy-safe profile may include changing the color of text on a website to reduce contrast.</p><p id="p-0341" num="0340">Conforming with a visual impairment profile may include changing or modifying certain website display parameters to match visual impairment-friendly website display parameters, reducing the amount or impact of certain website display parameters that are not desirable for visually impaired users, or in any other way changing a website to make the website more similar to a visual impairment profile.

For example, a profile may include a characterization of certain templates that are appropriate for an individual with a neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability. In another example, a profile may include templates that are appropriate for use with a mobile device. A general profile of an individual with a neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability may include a profile that affects or concerns all or most individuals with the neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability. As such, a general profile of an individual with a neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability may include website display parameters that may benefit all or most individuals with the neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability. It may be desirable for the predefined template to be associated with a general profile of an individual with a neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability to reduce processing load and improve efficiency by not requiring a separate profile for each individual with a neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability who accesses the website.</p><p id="p-0369" num="0368">When using a general profile of an individual with a neurodevelopmental disorder, values of the multiple default website display parameters may be determined based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), such as WCAG 2.1. For example, the predefined template may be associated with a general profile of an individual with a neurodevelopmental disorder to double the spacing between sentences in text on the website.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0369">In some embodiments, the predefined template is associated with a general profile of an epileptic individual. As an example, the predefined template may be associated with a general profile of an epileptic individual to pause all animations including flashing images.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0370">In some embodiments, the predefined template is associated with a general visually impaired individual profile. When using a general visually impaired individual profile, values of the multiple default website display parameters may be determined based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), such as WCAG 2.1. For example, the predefined template may be associated with a general visually impaired individual profile to resize text to 200 percent.</p><p id="p-0372" num="0371">In some embodiments, the predefined template is associated with a general profile of an individual with cognitive disability. When using a general profile of an individual with cognitive disability, values of the multiple default website display parameters may be determined based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), such as WCAG 2.1. For example, the predefined template may be associated with a general profile of an individual with cognitive disability to double the spacing between sentences in text on the website.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0372">In some embodiments, the predefined template is associated with a customized profile of the user with the neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability and values of the multiple default website display parameters are determined based on previous user interactions with an accessibility graphical user interface (GUI). A customized profile may include a profile that is specific to an individual user with a neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability. It may be desirable for the predefined template to be associated with a customized profile of the user with the neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability so that a user is presented with a display that is personalized to that user's needs, as opposed to users in a general population with the neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability.</p><p id="p-0374" num="0373">For instance, a customized profile may be desirable in situations where one user with a neurodevelopmental disorder requires more spacing between letters than the general population with a neurodevelopmental disorder. As an example, the predefined template may be associated with a customized profile of a user with a neurodevelopmental disorder, who requires a letter spacing that is double the size of the font in order to read and comprehend the text. In this example, values of default website display parameters such as a letter spacing parameter are determined based on the user's previous interactions with the accessibility GUI. In an example customized profile, values of the multiple default website display parameters may be determined based on previous user interactions with an accessibility GUI, such as values of website display parameter modifications that were previously requested by the user. These previous user interactions may include any aspect of the interactions, such as duration, frequency, or type of interaction. For example, the processor may determine that the user has adjusted letter spacing to be double the size of the font for every previous session. Based on this determination, the letter spacing parameter associated with the customized profile of the user with a neurodevelopmental disorder may be configured to set the letter spacing to be double the size of the font.</p><p id="p-0375" num="0374">In other instances, a customized profile may be desirable in situations where one epileptic user is more sensitive to certain types or frequencies of flashing than the general epileptic population. As an example, the predefined template may be associated with a customized profile of the epileptic user that is only susceptible to seizures when faced with more than six flashing red images in a second. In this example, values of default website display parameters such as initiating a stop command when a video contains more than six flashing red images in a second and greying out red-colored content are determined based on the user's previous user with the accessibility GUI. A stop command may include any instruction in the website code that instructs a movie or animation on the website to pause or stop on a particular frame, rather than continuing to the end of the movie or animation or cycling endlessly, as described herein. In an example customized profile, values of the multiple default website display parameters may be determined based on previous user interactions with an accessibility GUI, such as values of website display parameter modifications that were previously requested by the user. These previous user interactions may include any aspect of the interactions, such as duration, frequency, or type of interaction. For example, the processor may determine that the user has adjusted the font size to a specific value, such as 20 pt, for every previous session. Based on this determination, the font associated with the customized profile of the epileptic user may be set at 20 pt.</p><p id="p-0376" num="0375">In other instances, a customized profile may be desirable in situations where one visually impaired user requires a larger text size than the general visually impaired population. As an example, the predefined template may be associated with a customized profile of a visually impaired user, who requires text to be resized to 300 percent to read the text. In this example, values of default website display parameters such as text resizing percentage are determined based on the user's previous interactions with the accessibility GUI. In an example customized profile, values of the multiple default website display parameters may be determined based on previous user interactions with an accessibility GUI, such as values of website display parameter modifications that were previously requested by the user. These previous user interactions may include any aspect of the interactions, such as duration, frequency, or type of interaction. For example, the processor may determine that the user has adjusted the font to be resized to a specific percentage, such as 350 percent, for every previous session. Based on this determination, the font associated with the customized profile of the visually impaired user may be resized to 350 percent.</p><p id="p-0377" num="0376">In other instances, a customized profile may be desirable in situations where one cognitively disabled user requires more highlighting of titles than the general cognitively disabled population. As an example, the predefined template may be associated with a customized profile of a cognitively disabled user, who requires both titles and subtitles to be highlighted in order to read and comprehend the text. In this example, values of default website display parameters such as text highlighting are determined based on the user's previous interactions with the accessibility GUI. In an example customized profile, values of the multiple default website display parameters may be determined based on previous user interactions with an accessibility GUI, such as values of website display parameter modifications that were previously requested by the user. These previous user interactions may include any aspect of the interactions, such as duration, frequency, or type of interaction. For example, the processor may determine that the user has adjusted both titles and subtitles to be bolded for every previous session. Based on this determination, the highlighting associated with the customized profile of the cognitively disabled user may be configured to bold both titles and subtitles.</p><p id="p-0378" num="0377">Implementing the predefined template may include adjusting a content scaling parameter in website code on a user session basis to increase content scaling; executing a stop animation command in the website code on a user session basis to limit movement on a display; and at least one of: adjusting a saturation parameter in the website code on a user session basis to increase display intensity; adjusting a font type parameter in the website code on a user session basis to cause a readability increase; adjusting a font size parameter in the website code on a user session basis to modify font scaling; adjusting a line height parameter in the website code on a user session basis to increase spaces between text lines; adjusting a letter spacing parameter in the website code on a user session basis to modify spaces between letters text; and adjusting text color parameter in the website code on a user session basis to modify a contrast between text and background.</p><p id="p-0379" num="0378">Adjusting a content scaling parameter in website code on a user session basis to increase content scaling may be desirable to improve content visibility, since individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder may require larger scaling to perceive and understand content. A content scaling parameter may include a number, percent, decimal, ratio, or any other manner of making graduated changes to the presentation of any content, such as text, images, or videos, on the website. For example, adjusting a content scaling parameter in website code on a user session basis to increase content scaling may include doubling the size of all images on the website. As another example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, implementing the predefined template may include changing a content scaling parameter <b>3112</b> from normal to high.</p><p id="p-0380" num="0379">Executing a stop animation command in website code on a user session basis to limit movement on a display may include executing any instruction in the website code that instructs a movie or animation on the website to pause or stop on a particular frame, rather than continuing to the end of the movie or animation or cycling endlessly. A stop animation command may be targeted towards a specific type of animation or may be used to stop all types of animation on a website. For example, a stop animation command may instruct a website to stop all animation on a website. As another example, a stop animation command may instruct a website to stop only animation with flashes on a website. Limiting movement on a display may include stopping, pausing, slowing down, or in any other way restricting motion on a display. For individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder, moving images such as decorative animations impair recall and are a source of extraneous cognitive load. It can be more difficult for users to read, comprehend, or remember the information they've read, if the content features animations that increase their cognitive load. Thus, it may be desirable to reduce cognitive load by limiting movement on a display. For example, limiting movement on a display may include pausing a GIF. As another example, limiting movement on a display may include slowing down a GIF to reduce cognitive load. As another example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, implementing the predefined template may include changing a stop animation command parameter <b>3114</b> from ON to OFF.</p><p id="p-0381" num="0380">Adjusting a saturation parameter in the website code on a user session basis to increase display intensity may be desirable to make certain content stand out from other content for a user with a neurodevelopmental disorder who may not be able to distinguish between all of the content. A saturation parameter may include any measure of the intensity of color in an image. 100% saturation may mean there is no addition of gray to the color. In this case, the color may be completely pure. At the other extreme, a color with 0% saturation may appear as a medium gray. The more saturated (closer to 100%) a color is, the more vivid or brighter it may appear. Desaturated colors, on the other hand, may appear duller. For example, adjusting a saturation parameter in the website code on a user session basis to increase display intensity may include changing the saturation of an image from 50% to 70% to make the image look more vivid. As another example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, implementing the predefined template includes changing a saturation parameter <b>3116</b> from normal to high.</p><p id="p-0382" num="0381">Adjusting a font type parameter in the website code on a user session basis to cause a readability increase may be desirable to allow a user with a neurodevelopmental disorder to better read text. A font type parameter may include any attribute of a set of printed letters, numbers, or other symbols of the same style. For example, adjusting a font type parameter in the website code on a user session basis to cause a readability increase may include changing text from Edwardian Script style to Arial style, to make the text easier to read.</p><p id="p-0383" num="0382">Adjusting a font size parameter in the website code on a user session basis to increase font scaling may be desirable to allow a user with a neurodevelopmental disorder to better read text on the website. A font size parameter may include a height, width, length, thickness, or any other measure of the dimensions of the text. For example, adjusting a font size parameter in the website code on a user session basis to increase font scaling may include increasing the font size from 8 pt to 12 pt.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0383">Adjusting a line height parameter in the website code on a user session basis to increase spaces between text lines may be desirable to make the text easier to read for a user with a neurodevelopmental disorder. A line height parameter may include any measure of a distance between two or more lines of text, such as a number, length, or percentage. In some instances, the line height parameter may be the same for all font sizes. In other instances, the line height parameter may be relative to the font size. For example, adjusting a line height parameter in the website code on a user session basis to increase spaces between text lines may include increasing the line height from 150% of the font size to 200% of the font size.</p><p id="p-0385" num="0384">Adjusting a letter spacing parameter in the website code on a user session basis to increase spaces between letters may be desirable to make the text easier to read for a user with a neurodevelopmental disorder.

A text color parameter may include any measure of the light reflected by an object, such as hue, saturation, and brightness. For example, adjusting a text color parameter in the website code on a user session basis to increase a contrast between text and background may include changing grey text against a black background to white text.</p><p id="p-0387" num="0386">Website code may include any code that is used to structure a web page or its content, such as HTML, Java, JavaScript, or CSS. A user session basis may refer to a specific user session. Limiting website operations on a user session basis may be desirable to prevent uniform alteration of default website display parameters for all users, whether or not a user has a neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability. Thus, a user who has a neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability may view and interact with a website using a neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability profile, while a user that does not have a neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability may view and interact with that same website in a different user session without adjustments for a neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability. Limiting website operations on a user session basis may also be desirable to allow the same user to choose different disability profiles, or even no disability profile, for different sessions. For example, adjusting a website display parameter in website code on a user session basis may include executing that website code command only when a user who has a neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability is using the website. In this example, the website code execution is stopped once that user stops using the website and another user starts using the website.</p><p id="p-0388" num="0387">Implementing the predefined template may include adjusting a content scaling parameter in website code on a user session basis to increase content scaling; executing a stop animation command in the website code on a user session basis to limit movement on a display; and at least one of the other adjustments described herein.

In another example, implementing the predefined template may include doubling the size of all images on the website, pausing a GIF, changing the saturation of an image from 50% to 70%, and changing grey text against a black background to white text.</p><p id="p-0389" num="0388">Implementing the predefined template may include executing a stop animation command in website code on a user session basis to limit movement on a display. A stop animation command in website code may include any instruction in the website code that instructs a movie or animation on the website to pause or stop on a particular frame, rather than continuing to the end of the movie or animation or cycling endlessly. A stop animation command may be targeted towards a specific type of animation or may be used to stop all types of animation on a website. For example, a stop animation command may instruct a website to stop all animation on a website. As another example, a stop animation command may instruct a website to stop only animation with flashes on a website. For example, executing a stop animation command in website code on a user session basis may include executing that command only when a user who has epilepsy is using the website, and stopping the execution once that user stops using the website and another user starts using the website. Limiting movement on a display may include stopping, pausing, slowing down, or in any other way restricting motion on a display. For individuals with epilepsy, flashing lights or images may trigger seizures. Thus, it may be desirable to reduce or eliminate such flashing by limiting movement on a display. For example, limiting movement on a display may include pausing a video containing flashing images. As another example, limiting movement on a display may include slowing down a video containing flashing images to reduce the frequency of flashing. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, implementing the predefined template includes changing a stop activation command <b>2212</b> from ON to OFF.</p><p id="p-0390" num="0389">In some embodiments, limiting the movement on the display includes preventing blinking animation. Blinking animation may involve a movie, GIF, or any other moving image that includes an image being flashed more than once. It may be desirable to prevent blinking animation to prevent seizures, since individuals with photosensitive epilepsy may experience seizures triggered by displays that flicker, flash, blink, or present any other sudden brief burst of an image, video, light, or color. For example, limiting the movement on the display may include preventing a GIF from playing if that GIF contains a blinking animation, such as flashing lights.</p><p id="p-0391" num="0390">In some embodiments, limiting the movement on the display includes altering animations on the website such that the altered animations have a frame speed of no greater than three frames per second. Frame speed may include the frequency or rate at which consecutive images or frames are displayed. It may be desirable to limit an amount of movement on the display by decreasing the frame speed to no greater than three frames per second to prevent seizures, since a greater frame speed may trigger a seizure in individuals with epilepsy, particularly photosensitive epilepsy. For example, limiting the movement on the display may include altering animations on the website such that the altered animations have a frame speed of two frames per second.</p><p id="p-0392" num="0391">Implementing the predefined template may include adjusting a value of at least one web display parameter.

For example, adjusting a value of at least one web display parameter may include changing the display of red-colored content to black or white. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, adjusting a value of at least one web display parameter includes changing a saturation parameter <b>2214</b> from normal to low.</p><p id="p-0393" num="0392">Implementing the predefined template may include at least two of: adjusting a content scaling parameter in website code on a user session basis to increase content scaling; adjusting a font type parameter in the website code on a user session basis to cause a readability increase; adjusting a saturation parameter in the website code on a user session basis to increase display intensity; adjusting a font size parameter in the website code on a user session basis to increase font scaling; adjusting a line height parameter in the website code on a user session basis to increase spaces between text lines; adjusting a letter spacing parameter in the website code on a user session basis to increase spaces between letters text; and adjusting a text color parameter in the website code on a user session basis to increase a contrast between text and background.</p><p id="p-0394" num="0393">Adjusting a content scaling parameter in website code on a user session basis to increase content scaling may be desirable to improve content visibility, since visually impaired individuals may require larger scaling to see content clearly.

For example, implementing the predefined template may include doubling the size of all images on the website, increasing the font size from 8 pt to 12 pt, and increasing the line height from 150% of the font size to 200% of the font size.</p><p id="p-0406" num="0405">Implementing the predefined template may include at least two of: executing a highlighting titles command in website code on a user session basis to highlight titles depicted on the website; executing a highlighting actionable objects command in website code on a user session basis to highlight actionable objects depicted on the website; adjusting a content scaling parameter in website code on a user session basis to increase content scaling: and executing a stop animation command in website code on a user session basis to limit movement on a display.</p><p id="p-0407" num="0406">Executing a highlighting titles command in website code on a user session basis to highlight titles depicted on the website may be desirable to emphasize the context of long passages of text, which may be difficult for an individual with a cognitive disability to comprehend. A highlighting titles command may include any instruction in the website code that instructs the processor to accent, embolden, accentuate, feature, call attention to, spotlight, or in any other way emphasize a title in the website. Non-limiting examples of highlighting titles may include underlining, coloring, resizing, bolding, and italicizing titles. A title may include any descriptive name, phrase, or sentence, such as a banner, caption, subtitle, heading, subheading, or headline. For example, executing a highlighting titles command may include changing the font of titles to bold. In another example, executing a highlighting titles command may include increasing the size (e.g., doubling) of titles. As another example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>, implementing the predefined template includes changing a highlight titles command <b>2812</b> from ON to OFF.</p><p id="p-0408" num="0407">Executing a highlighting actionable objects command in website code on a user session basis to highlight actionable objects depicted on the website may be desirable to make the actionable objects more accessible for users with cognitive disabilities. An actionable object may include one or more of an activatable button, hyperlink, a picklist, a field to be filled-out, links, menus, dropdowns, combination boxes, URLs, or any other website element seeking a user's input or interaction. For example, users with cognitive disabilities may have difficulty identifying actionable objects and/or may struggle with cognitive fatigue when completing complex, multi-stage processes such as filling out forms, entering data correctly or finding the content or feature that they need. Such users may need support to minimize errors and complete their task through the use of highlighted actionable objects. In some instances, users with cognitive disabilities may need clear literal language and may not understand metaphors or non-literal text and new icons. For such users, highlighting actionable objects may help them understand which objects are actionable and which are not when the distinction is not readily obvious. A highlighting actionable objects command may include any instruction in the website code that instructs the processor to accent, accentuate, feature, call attention to, spotlight, or in any other way emphasize an actionable object in the website. Non-limiting examples of highlighting actionable objects may include underlining, coloring, resizing, bolding, and italicizing actionable objects. In a first instance, if actionable items are not already identified or recognized, code running on a processor may scan the website or a page thereof to find the actionable items. For example, actionable items usually contain telltale signs such as embedded links or input fields. Code running on a processor may find such telltales signs to identify the actionable items. In some instances, the actionable items may be preidentified. Thus, in some instances, executing an actionable items command may include identifying the actionable items, and in other instances, identification may not be part of the execution. For example, executing a highlighting actionable objects command may include emphasizing buttons, such as by changing the coloring of all buttons in the website to a noticeable color such as red. In another example, executing a highlighting actionable objects command may include underlining, bolding and/or increasing font size (e.g., doubling the size) of links on the website. As another example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>, implementing the predefined template may include changing a highlight actionable objects command <b>2814</b> from ON to OFF.</p><p id="p-0409" num="0408">In some embodiments, highlighting titles or actionable objects includes applying at least one of: framing, changing colors, adding shading, adding a pattern, changing font size, changing style, adding outlines, or adding an icon. Framing may include incorporating a border, enclosure, outline, shell, box, line, or any other structure to surround or enclose a title or actionable object. For example, highlighting a title may include placing a dark border around the title. As another example, highlighting an actionable object may include placing a box around a button. Changing colors may include any modification of an intensity, glow, saturation, tint, or any other attribute of a hue of a title or actionable object. For example, highlighting a title may include changing the color of a title to red. As another example, highlighting an actionable object may include changing the color of a button to green. Adding shading may include modifying the color or intensity of a color of a title or actionable item. For example, highlighting a title may include increasing the intensity of red hues in a mildly red title. As another example, highlighting an actionable object may include increasing the intensity of green hues in a mildly green button. Adding a pattern may include incorporating any repeated design into a title or actionable object, such as a dotted pattern or a striped pattern. For example, highlighting a title may include providing a dotted pattern within the text of the title. As another example, highlighting an actionable object may include providing a striped pattern within a button. Changing font size may include increasing or decreasing any dimension of the text of a title or actionable object. For example, highlighting a title may include doubling font size. As another example, highlighting an actionable object may include tripling the font of the text within a button. Changing style may include modifying any distinctive visual attribute of the title or actionable attribute, such as bolding, italicizing, or underlining. For example, highlighting a title may include bolding the title. As another example, highlighting an actionable object may include italicizing the text within a button. Adding outlines may include incorporating a line or set of lines enclosing or indicating the shape of a title or actionable object. For example, highlighting a title may include adding a line around the shape of the title. As another example, highlighting an actionable object may include adding a dotted line around a button. Adding an icon may include incorporating a picture, image, symbol, sign, or any other representation associated with a title or actionable object. For example, highlighting a title may include adding a star next to a title. As another example, highlighting an actionable object may include adding a check mark inside a button.</p><p id="p-0410" num="0409">Adjusting a content scaling parameter in website code on a user session basis to increase content scaling may be desirable to improve content visibility, since cognitively disabled individuals may require larger scaling to perceiving and understand content. A content scaling parameter may include a number, percent, decimal, ratio, or any other manner of making graduated changes to the presentation of any content, such as text, images, or videos, on the website. For example, adjusting a content scaling parameter in website code on a user session basis to increase content scaling may include doubling the size of all images on the website.</p><p id="p-0411" num="0410">Executing a stop animation command in website code on a user session basis to limit movement on a display may include executing any instruction in the website code that instructs a movie or animation on the website to pause or stop on a particular frame, rather than continuing to the end of the movie or animation or cycling endlessly. A stop animation command may be targeted towards a specific type of animation or may be used to stop all types of animation on a website. For example, a stop animation command may instruct a website to stop all animation on a website. By way of non-limiting examples, animation types that may be subject to a stop animation command may include videos, user interface animations, animated icons, animated titles, infographics, presentations, broadcast graphics, and/or GIFs. As another example, a stop animation command may instruct a website to stop only animation with flashes on a website. Limiting movement on a display may include stopping, pausing, slowing down, or in any other way restricting motion on a display. For individuals with a cognitive disability, moving images such as decorative animations impair recall and are a source of extraneous cognitive load. It can be more difficult for users to read, comprehend, or remember the information they've read, if the content features animations that increase their cognitive load. Thus, it may be desirable to reduce cognitive load by limiting movement on a display. In a first instance, if animations are not already identified or recognized, code running on a processor may scan the website or a page thereof to find the animations. For example, actionable items usually contain telltale signs such as successive frame changes, successive changes in display intensity, movement of text or graphical elements, or instructions for accomplishing any of the forgoing. Code running on a processor may find such telltales signs to identify the animations. In some instances, the animations may be preidentified. Thus, in some instances, executing a stop animation command may include identifying the animations, and in other instances, identification may not be part of the execution. A stop animation command may completely stop, pause, or slow a successive display of frames. For example, limiting movement on a display may include pausing a GIF. As another example, limiting movement on a display may include slowing down a GIF to reduce cognitive load.</p><p id="p-0412" num="0411">Implementing the predefined template may include at least two of the adjustments disclosed herein. For example, implementing the predefined template may include changing the font of titles to bold and pausing a GIF. In another example, implementing the predefined template may include changing the coloring of all buttons in the website to red and doubling the size of all images on the website. In yet another example, implementing the predefined template may include underlining and doubling the size of all links on the website, and slowing down a GIF.</p><p id="p-0413" num="0412">In some embodiments, implementing the predefined template may be configured to impact presentation of content on a computing device of the user with the neurodevelopmental disorder without impacting presentation of content on other computing devices of other simultaneous users of the website.</p><p id="p-0414" num="0413">Executing the stop animation command and adjusting the value of the at least one web display parameter may be configured to impact presentation of content on a computing device of the user with the epileptic disability without impacting presentation of content on other computing devices of other simultaneous viewers of the website.</p><p id="p-0415" num="0414">In some embodiments, implementing the predefined template is configured to impact presentation of content on a computing device of the visually impaired user without impacting presentation of content on other computing devices of other simultaneous users of the website.</p><p id="p-0416" num="0415">There may be more than one user accessing the same website. For example, there may be two users, only one of whom has a neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability. Each may be accessing the website via their respective computing devices. In such situations, the website may be presented to the user with the neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability by modifying the display parameters associated with the website on the computing device of that user. However, the parameters on the computing device of the other user may not be altered. Thus, the presentation of the website to the second user, who does not have a neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability may not be impacted.</p><p id="p-0417" num="0416">For example, implementing the predefined template may include doubling the size of all images on the website, pausing a GIF, and changing the saturation of an image from 50% to 70% on the computing device of the user with the neurodevelopmental disorder. In this example, the images and GIFs on the other computing devices of other simultaneous viewers of the website may be presented without a change in scaling, saturation, or pausing.</p><p id="p-0418" num="0417">In another example, a video containing flashing images may be paused and red-colored content may be changed to black or white on the computing device of the user with the epileptic disability. In this example, the video containing flashing images and the red-colored content on the other computing devices of other simultaneous viewers of the website may be maintained.</p><p id="p-0419" num="0418">In another example, text size and image size may be doubled on the computing device of the user with the visual impairment. In this example, the text and images on the other computing devices of other simultaneous viewers of the website may be presented without doubling in size.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0419">In another example, implementing the predefined template may include changing the coloring of all buttons in the website to red and doubling the size of all images on the computing device of the user with the cognitive disability. In this example, the buttons and images on the other computing devices of other simultaneous viewers of the website may be presented without changing their color or size.</p><p id="p-0421" num="0420">Some embodiments include selecting the predefined template out of a plurality of predefined templates based on a type of computing device used by the user with the neurodevelopmental disorder, epilepsy, visual impairment, and/or cognitive disability. Different types of computing devices may be used with the systems, methods, and non-transitory computer readable media disclosed herein, Such computing devices may include, for example, computers, mobile phones, tablets, laptops, smart watches, smart glasses, or other types of devices capable of accessing websites or other content. It may be desirable to provide different types of presentations on the different devices because computing devices vary in size, computing power, audio and visual capabilities, and/or availability of certain types of software.</p><p id="p-0422" num="0421">For example, a plurality of predefined templates may include a first predefined template with a low content scaling parameter and a second predefined template with a high content scaling parameter. The type of the computing device used by the user with the neurodevelopmental disorder may be determined by the processor or based on an input by the user. In some instances, the processor may determine that a computer is being used based on receiving an indication from the computer regarding its device specifications. In other instances, the processor may determine that a mobile phone is being used based on the selection of a button by the user. In one example, the content may be scaled by a factor of four when displayed on desktop computers and the content may be scaled by a factor of two when displayed on mobile devices, such as smartphones.</p><p id="p-0423" num="0422">In another example, the first title on the website may have a font size of 14 pt when displayed on desktop computers and font size of 8 pt when displayed on mobile devices, such as smartphones. In another example, an entire article may be displayed on desktop computers, while only a portion of the article may be displayed on mobile devices, such as smartphones.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0423">In another example, the title may be bolded when displayed on desktop computers and italicized when displayed on mobile devices, such as smartphones.</p><p id="p-0425" num="0424">In some embodiments, implementing the predefined template further includes introducing a window movable on a display of the website together with the adjustment of the content scaling parameter, the execution of the stop animation command, and the adjustment of the saturation parameter. A window may include a box, rectangle, square, circle, or any other enclosed, bounded, defined or specified shape or area presented on the display. A movable window may include a window that is movable along any of its dimensions, including on either the horizontal or vertical axis. In some instances, the movable window may also be moved along one or more of its edges, sides, points, or corners. Using a movable window may be desirable to focus the attention of a user with a neurodevelopmental disorder, since such individuals may find it difficult to focus on a specific part of the website. As an example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, implementing the predefined template includes introducing a window <b>3120</b> that is movable on the display of the website. The window may be moved based on one or more inputs, including inputs from devices such as a mouse or keyboard. For example, the movable window may move in conjunction with scrolling the screen using a mouse. As another example, the movable window may move in conjunction with the movement of the mouse without clicking. In another example, the movable window may move in conjunction with the movement of the mouse when the mouse is clicked and dragged. In yet another example, the movable window may move in conjunction with the user pressing any of the up, down, right, or left arrows on a keyboard.</p><p id="p-0426" num="0425">In some embodiments, a presentation relation between information outside the window and information inside the window is set to focus user attention on information within the window. A presentation relation may include a ratio, parameter, percent, or any other relationship between information outside the window and information inside the window. For example, a presentation relation may include decreasing the opacity of information outside the window in relation to the opacity of information inside the window. As another example, a presentation relation may include increasing a font size of information inside the window in relation to the font of the information outside the window (e.g., doubling the font size inside as compared to outside). It may be desirable to use a presentation relation to focus user attention to standardize the way that information is highlighted within the window as opposed to outside the window throughout the website. Returning to the example above, a presentation relation may include decreasing the opacity of information outside the window in relation to the opacity of information inside the window by a factor of two. In this example, the presentation relation may decrease the opacity by a factor of two regardless of where the window is moved on the display of the website. This may limit confusion for a user with a neurodevelopmental disorder by restricting an amount that the display changes when the window is moved to another position on the display of the website.</p><p id="p-0427" num="0426">In some embodiments, the window follows eye movement of the user. Eye movement of the user may include saccades, smooth pursuit movements, vergence movements, vestibulo-ocular movements, or any other motion of one or both of the user's eyes. Eye movement may be determined using head-stabilized eye tracking, remote eye tracking, mobile eye tracking, integrated or embedded eye tracking systems, or any other device capable of detecting or measuring the movement of one or both of the user's eyes. For example, eye movement may be determined using the EyeLink&#xae; 1000 Plus system. As another example, eye movement may be determined using a camera and IR source positioned near the computer. In another example, eye movement may be determined using a camera or a mirror positioned in the visual path of one or both eyes, and an additional camera that records the scene or field of view. In yet another example, eye movement may be determined using an augmented reality or virtual reality headset. It may be desirable for the window to follow the user's eye movement so that a user with a neurodevelopmental disorder is not faced with the additional cognitive load of moving the window with an input device such as a mouse or keyboard. For example, a camera and IR source positioned near the computer may be used to determine that the user is moving their eyes in smooth pursuit in a downward direction. Based on this determination, the window may move down the display of the website in conjunction with the user's eye movement.</p><p id="p-0428" num="0427">In some embodiments, a size of the window is adjustable. It may be desirable to use an adjustable window size so that the user can modify the amount of information that they need to focus on. The size of the window may be adjustable along any dimension, including height, width, and length. For example, a user with a neurodevelopmental disorder may be presented with a window having a height of two inches. The user may determine that the size of the window causes too much information to be focused on in the window. Thus, the user may adjust the size of the window to have a height of one inch. In this example, less information is highlighted in the window, which may make it easier for the user with the neurodevelopmental disorder to comprehend the information inside the window.</p><p id="p-0429" num="0428">In some embodiments, a specific one of the multiple default website display parameters has a range value, and the predefined template includes a specific value for the specific default website display parameter. A range value may include a value that may vary within an upper and lower limit of values. Providing a range of values for a display parameter may allow the website to be optimized for the general population. However, a particular user may prefer to use a specific value for a display parameter. A predefined template for that user may include a specific value of the display parameter that may be selected from the range of values specified for that display parameter. For example, a font parameter for a website may have a range value between 8 pt font and 20 pt font. This range of font sizes may be optimized for the general population, allowing different users to view the website using their preferred font size. For example, younger users might prefer a smaller font size while older users might prefer a larger font size. In this example, a predefined template may include a specific value of 18 pt for the font parameter, for example for an older user, so that the text on the website is visible to that user. Alternatively, a predefined template for general users may have a specific value of 12 pt for the font parameter to allow the general population to view the website with a font size of 12 pt.</p><p id="p-0430" num="0429">In some embodiments, implementing the predefined template associated with the epilepsy-safe profile further includes adjusting the saturation parameter in the website code to cause a decrease in color intensity of at least one actionable object, at least one image, and at least one title. The saturation parameter may include any parameter associated with the intensity of color in an image. Color intensity may include any measure of the brightness or dullness of any color in an image. An actionable object may include any object whose properties may be changed. For example, an actionable object may include a button that a user may click to change the color of its display. A title may include any text on the website describing another object or text on the website. It may be desirable to adjust the saturation parameter in the website code to cause a decrease in color intensity of at least one actionable object, at least one image, and at least one title to prevent seizures, since epileptic individuals may experience seizures at certain color intensities. For example, implementing the predefined template associated with the epilepsy-safe profile may further include adjusting the saturation parameter in the website code to cause a decrease in intensity of the color red of a button, a picture, and the title of that picture.</p><p id="p-0431" num="0430">In some embodiments, adjusting the value of the at least one web display parameter includes adjusting a saturation parameter in the website code on a user session basis to decrease color intensity; adjusting a content scaling parameter in website code on a user session basis to modify content scaling; adjusting a font type parameter in the website code on a user session basis to cause a readability increase; adjusting a font size parameter in the website code on a user session basis to modify font scaling; adjusting a line height parameter in the website code on a user session basis to modify spaces between text lines; adjusting a letter spacing parameter in the website code on a user session basis to modify spaces between letters text; and adjusting a text color parameter in the website code on a user session basis to modify a contrast between text and background. Adjusting a saturation parameter in the website code on a user session basis to decrease color intensity may be desirable to prevent seizures, since epileptic individuals may experience seizures at certain color intensities. For example, adjusting a saturation parameter in the website code on a user session basis to decrease color intensity may include decreasing the intensity of a red color on the website. Adjusting a content scaling parameter in website code on a user session basis to modify content scaling may be desirable to prevent seizures, since epileptic individuals may experience seizures when presented with larger flashing images, as opposed to smaller ones. For example, adjusting a content scaling parameter in website code on a user session basis to modify content scaling may include decreasing the size of animated GIFs. Adjusting a font type parameter in the website code on a user session basis to cause a readability increase may be desirable to allow an epileptic user to better read text without triggering a seizure. For example, adjusting a font type parameter in the website code on a user session basis to cause a readability increase may include changing red font to black font. Adjusting a font size parameter in the website code on a user session basis to modify font scaling may be desirable to allow an epileptic user to better read text on the website even if other components are sized down to prevent triggering a seizure. For example, adjusting a font type parameter in the website code on a user session basis to modify font scaling may include increasing the font size from 8 pt to 12 pt. Adjusting a line height parameter in the website code on a user session basis to modify spaces between text lines may be desirable to present a uniform line height for epileptic users. For example, adjusting a line height parameter in the website code on a user session basis to modify spaces between text lines may include modifying varying line heights in the website to conform to a single line height throughout the website. Adjusting a letter spacing parameter in the website code on a user session basis to modify spaces between letters text may be desirable to present a uniform letter spacing for epileptic users. For example, adjusting a letter spacing parameter in the website code on a user session basis to modify spaces between letters text may include modifying varying letter spacing in the website to conform to a single letter spacing throughout the website. Adjusting a text color parameter in the website code on a user session basis to modify a contrast between text and background may be desirable to prevent seizures, since epileptic individuals may experience seizures when presented with higher-contrast content. For example, adjusting text color parameter in the website code on a user session basis to modify a contrast between text and background may include reducing a contrast between text and background. Adjusting the at least one web display parameter as disclosed herein may be performed only in a session associated with an epileptic user. The adjustment may not be performed with a different user that does not have epilepsy. By doing so, each user would be presented a website suitable to their particular needs.</p><p id="p-0432" num="0431">In some embodiments, the operations further include identifying in a website code tagged titles; and identifying on a page of the website elements used as titles but untagged as titles; wherein highlighting titles includes highlighting the tagged titles and the elements used as titles. Tagged titles in a website code may include text that is labeled as a title in the website code. For example, when using HTML website code, the &#x3c;title&#x3e; tag defines the title of the document. Elements used as titles but untagged as titles may include identifying text in the website that is not labeled as a title in the website code. For example, a block of text may be preceded by a descriptive phrase, acting as a title, even though that phrase itself is not defined using the &#x3c;title&#x3e; tag in the HTML code. Other non-exhaustive examples of website portions used as titles but untagged as titles may include those that are in larger font, bolded, underlined, italicized, located at the top of the page. Highlighting both the tagged titles and the elements used as titles may be desirable to ensure that a cognitively disabled user more clearly understands the context of the displayed text, whether or not the website code labels a certain portion of text as a title. For example, a website may include a first title &#x201c;Subject A&#x201d; describing portion A of the text and a second title &#x201c;Subject B&#x201d; describing portion B of the text. In the HTML website code, only the first title &#x201c;Subject A&#x201d; may be tagged as a title with a &#x3c;title&#x3e; tag. In this example, it may be desirable to highlight not only first title &#x201c;Subject A,&#x201d; but also second title &#x201c;Subject B&#x201d; because they both provide context that a cognitively disabled user may need to comprehend respective portions A and B of the text. Thus, in this example, highlighting titles may include doubling the size of both first title &#x201c;Subject A&#x201d; and second title &#x201c;Subject B.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0433" num="0432">In some embodiments, the operations further include identifying in a website code tagged actionable objects; and identifying on the page of the website elements used as actionable objects but untagged as actionable objects; wherein highlighting actionable objects includes highlighting the tagged actionable objects and the elements used as actionable objects. Tagged actionable objects in a website code may include any actionable object that is labeled as an actionable object in the website code. For example, when using HTML website code, the &#x3c;link&#x3e; tag defines an object that is a link to an external resource. As another example, when using HTML website code, the &#x3c;button&#x3e; tag defines an object that is a pressable link. Elements used as actionable objects but untagged as actionable objects may include any actionable object in the website that is not labeled as an actionable object in the website code. For example, a link may act as a button since it is pressable, even though that link itself is not defined using the &#x3c;button&#x3e; tag in the HTML code. Highlighting both the tagged actionable objects and the elements used as actionable objects may be desirable to ensure that a cognitively disabled user more clearly understands which objects are actionable, whether or not the website code labels a certain portion of text as an actionable object. For example, a website may include a link and a button, both of which are pressable. In the HTML website code, only the button may be tagged as a button with a &#x3c;button&#x3e; tag. In this example, it may be desirable to highlight not only the button, but also the link because they both provide pressable objects that may not be readily apparent to a cognitively disabled user. Thus, in this example, highlighting actionable objects may include doubling the size of both the link and the button. In another example, a website may include a menu that is not tagged as an actionable object in the website code. In this example, the menu may still be used as an actionable item since a user is able to interact with the menu. Therefore, highlighting actionable objects may include also highlighting the menu, for example, by presenting a box around the menu.</p><p id="p-0434" num="0433">In some embodiments, operations include using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify titles and actionable objects in the website code; and implementing the predefined template includes highlighting the titles and actionable objects. AI may include any application of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers. In some embodiments, machine learning algorithms (also referred to as machine learning models) may be trained using training examples. Some non-limiting examples of such machine learning algorithms may include classification algorithms, data regressions algorithms, image segmentation algorithms, visual detection algorithms (such as object detectors, face detectors, person detectors, motion detectors, edge detectors, etc.), visual recognition algorithms (such as face recognition, person recognition, object recognition, etc.), speech recognition algorithms, mathematical embedding algorithms, natural language processing algorithms, support vector machines, random forests, nearest neighbors algorithms, deep learning algorithms, artificial neural network algorithms, convolutional neural network algorithms, recursive neural network algorithms, linear machine learning models, non-linear machine learning models, ensemble algorithms, and so forth. For example, a trained machine learning algorithm may include an inference model, such as a predictive model, a classification model, a regression model, a clustering model, a segmentation model, an artificial neural network (such as a deep neural network, a convolutional neural network, a recursive neural network, etc.), a random forest, a support vector machine, and so forth. In some examples, the training examples may include example inputs together with the desired outputs corresponding to the example inputs.

In yet another example, a trained machine learning algorithm may include a clustering model, the input may include a sample, and the inferred output may include an assignment of the sample to at least one cluster. In an additional example, a trained machine learning algorithm may include a classification algorithm, the input may include one or more images, and the inferred output may include a classification of an item depicted in the images or whether the images are associated with motion or animation. In yet another example, a trained machine learning algorithm may include a regression model, the input may include one or more images, and the inferred output may include an inferred value for an item depicted in the images (such as a characterization of motion in the images). In an additional example, a trained machine learning algorithm may include an image segmentation model, the input may include images, and the inferred output may include a segmentation of the image. In some examples, the trained machine learning algorithm may include one or more formulas and/or one or more functions and/or one or more rules and/or one or more procedures, the input may be used as input to the formulas and/or functions and/or rules and/or procedures, and the inferred output may be based on the outputs of the formulas and/or functions and/or rules and/or procedures (for example, selecting one of the outputs of the formulas and/or functions and/or rules and/or procedures, using a statistical measure of the outputs of the formulas and/or functions and/or rules and/or procedures, and so forth).</p><p id="p-0436" num="0435">In some embodiments, artificial neural networks may be configured to analyze inputs and generate corresponding outputs.

Using AI to identify titles and actionable objects in the website code may include implementing an artificial neural network algorithm on the processor to identify tags corresponding to titles and actionable objects. For example, the neural network may be trained to identify specific HTML tags such as &#x3c;title&#x3e; and &#x3c;button&#x3e;. The neural network may be trained with example sets including text identified as titles or buttons and associated website code. Then, the trained model may be configured to identify the titles and buttons when presented with the website code or the text. In this example, implementing the predefined template may include doubling the size of the website content that is labeled using the tags &#x3c;title&#x3e; and &#x3c;button&#x3e;, as identified by the trained neural network.</p><p id="p-0438" num="0437">In some embodiments, the operations further include using image processing and a neural network to identify in a website code first elements used as titles but untagged as titles and second elements used as actionable objects but untagged as actionable objects; and implementing the predefined template includes highlighting the first elements and the second elements. Image processing may include any use of a computer to process images through an algorithm, such as object detection. A neural network may include any computational model that consists of several processing elements that receive inputs and deliver outputs based on their predefined activation functions, such as a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. Using image processing and a neural network to identify such elements may be desirable to identify specific objects and text within a website as a title or actionable object more easily and accurately without human intervention. For example, an image processing algorithm may be used to detect titles by searching the website for images of a word or phrase that precedes a large block of text. Other non-exhaustive examples of title-detection using an image processing algorithm include searching for images of a word or phrase in large font, different font, bolded font, italicized font, underlined font, or in a different-colored font. The image processing algorithm may be used to detect actionable objects by searching the website for images of shapes, colors, fonts, styles, and other characteristics of actionable objects, such as buttons, menus, links, and other interactive objects. For example, the image processing algorithm may be used to detect actionable objects, such as buttons, by searching the website for images of a colored, geometric shape. A neural network, such as a LSTM model, may be trained to identify the titles and buttons based on the detection of objects and/or text by the image processing algorithm. In this example, implementing the predefined template may include doubling the size of the titles and buttons identified by the LTSM model.

In another example, the visually impaired user may also have epilepsy. For example, implementing the predefined template may include increasing the size of the font on the website from 12 pt to 14 pt following a first input in the form of a user clicking on an option for a visual impairment profile from the accessibility GUI. In this example, the visually impaired user may enter a second input indicating that the visually impaired user also has epilepsy by additionally clicking on an option for a seizure safe profile from the accessibility GUI, whereby moving images such as GIFs may be paused to prevent seizures.</p><p id="p-0459" num="0458">In some embodiments, the predefined template is implemented in response to receipt of a first input from the visually impaired user, and after implementing the adjustment, receiving a second input from the visually impaired user, and based on the second input, causing a display of the website to revert to a default presentation mode. Receiving a first input and receiving a second input from the visually impaired user may be desirable to allow for continued adjustment of website content based on user needs. Causing a display of the website to revert to a default presentation mode based on the second input may be desirable if the user does not want to view the website in a visual impairment mode. For example, after implementing the predefined template, a user may realize that they do not require the visual impairment modifications on that particular website, depending on the extent and nature of the user's individual visual impairment. In this example, the second input may cause a display of the website to revert to a default presentation mode so that the user can view and interact with the website without any restrictions. In one example, implementing the predefined template may include increasing the size of the font from 12 pt to 20 pt. In this example, the user may realize that they do not require 20 pt font to read the text clearly. This user may click on a button on the website to revert to the default presentation mode including 12 pt. in another example, implementing the predefined template may include doubling the size of images on the website. In this example, the user may realize that they do not require the images to be larger than their original size to view them clearly. This user may click on a button on the website to revert to the default presentation mode without the images doubled in size.</p><p id="p-0460" num="0459"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> illustrates a flowchart <b>2600</b> of alternative responses to a second input from the visually impaired user, consistent with some embodiments of the present disclosure.

For example, screen readers are commonly used by blind or visually impaired persons navigating a website. As another example, screen readers may be used in areas of poor reception or low bandwidth as a substitute for loading visual content. A screen reader may audibly present content that is otherwise only presented visually, allowing users to consume visual content audibly. However, to audibly present the web elements of a website a screen reader may require accompanying descriptive text. The description that follows relates to altering website code to conform with a screen reader profile.</p><p id="p-0474" num="0473">In some embodiments, the altered website code may be stored at a website host, such that the altered website code may be available to users requesting to navigate the website. In some embodiments, the altered website code may be stored locally on a specific device associated with screen reader usage. A software application may be provided to detect screen reader usage for navigating and consuming website content on a specific device. For example, a user selecting a web accessibility profile associated with the screen reader (e.g., the Screen Reader profile) may indicate screen reader usage. Based on the indication, a predefined template may be implemented to make multiple changes to the website code for conforming the website code with accessibility needs. For example, the website code may be updated to conform with the needs of blind users using a screen reader. Multiple elements may be identified in the website code corresponding to objects for displaying on the website. For example, the website code may include references to image, text, and video content and any other visually presentable content. Accessibility information may be determined for at least some of the objects displayed on the website. For example, accessibility information may be determined based on context, via a textual analysis, via an image analysis of text, and/or via an analysis of image content associated with the website. The website code may then be updated based on the accessibility information. The updates may be configured to only change an audible presentation of the website. For example, the updates may be applicable to a screen reader invoked on a specific computing device, while not impacting a simultaneous rendering of the website on a different computing device. For example, the updates may be added as alternate text to references of images. A web browser running on a first computing device associated with screen reader usage may provide the alternate text to the screen reader for recitation. However, a web browser running on a different computing device not associated with screen reader usage may ignore the alternate text and merely display the images.</p><p id="p-0475" num="0474">In some instances, the description that follows may refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>A, and <b>35</b>B</figref> which illustrate an exemplary implementation for altering website code of a website to conform with a screen reader profile, consistent with some disclosed embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>34</b>, <b>35</b>A, and <b>358</b></figref> are intended merely to facilitate the conceptualizing of one exemplary implementation for altering website code to conform with a screen reader profile and does not limit the disclosure to any particular implementation.</p><p id="p-0476" num="0475">Some embodiments involve a non-transitory computer readable medium containing instructions that when executed by at least one processor cause the at least one processor to perform operations for altering website code to conform with a screen reader profile. The term &#x201c;non-transitory computer-readable medium&#x201d; may include any medium capable of storing data in any memory in a way that may be read by any computing device with a processor to carry out methods or any other instructions stored in the memory, as described earlier. The term &#x201c;instructions&#x201d; may refer to program code instructions (e.g., a first set of computer code instructions) that may be executed by a computer processor. The instructions may be written in any type of computer programming language, such as an interpretive language (e.g., scripting languages such as HTML and JavaScript), a procedural or functional language (e.g., C or Pascal that may be compiled for converting to executable code), object-oriented programming language (e.g., Java or Python), logical programming language (e.g., Prolog or Answer Set Programming), or any other programming language. In some embodiments, the instructions may implement methods associated with machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, digital image processing, optimization algorithms, and any other computer processing technique. The term &#x201c;website&#x201d; may refer to any public, private, or semi-private web property including a collection of content to be presented to the public or to a limited audience, as described earlier. The term &#x201c;website code&#x201d; may include software, firmware, and/or microcode, and may refer to programs, routines, functions, classes, data structures, and/or objects, as described earlier. In other words, the website code may include a second set of computer code instructions, different than the first set of computer code instructions. Executing the website code on a computing device via a web browser application may render digital content of the website on the computing device. The term &#x201c;altering website code&#x201d; may refer to adding, removing, editing, or modifying one or more instructions of the website code, a parameter, variable, and/or value referred to or used by the website code. For example, the first set of computer code instructions may alter the website code such that executing the altered website code via the web browser results in a different user experience than executing the original (e.g., unaltered) website code. The term &#x201c;screen reader&#x201d; may refer to a software application that translates textual and/or graphical information displayed on a screen (e.g., visual media) and present it to a user as audio media, e.g., using synthesized speech, as described earlier. The term &#x201c;Screen Reader profile&#x201d; may refer to a predefined set of parameter settings, instructions or definitions that may affect a user experience via a screen reader.</p><p id="p-0477" num="0476">Thus, executing the first set of program code instructions (e.g., of the disclosed embodiments) may cause alterations to a second set of program code instructions (e.g., the website code). The alterations to the website code may adapt the (e.g., original, unaltered) website code for a screen reader. For example, executing the original website code via a conventional web browser may cause a visual rendering of the content of the website, such as a visual presentation of images and/or text on a computer display. While visual rendering of content may be suitable for visually abled users, a visual format may be less suitable for users associated with a Screen Reader profile, such as blind users, visually impaired users, or users having poor reception (e.g., in area of low communications bandwidth). To accommodate users associated with the Screen Reader profile, the disclosed alterations to the website code may facilitate the screen reader in producing an audio rendering of the content of the website. For example, text content may be converted to an audio format via a speech synthesizer configured with the screen reader. However, converting non-text content to an audio format, such as graphic content including images, may require additional processing, such as alterations to the website code, for example to add descriptive terms or phrases for the screen reader to recite.</p><p id="p-0478" num="0477">By way of a non-limiting example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary interface <b>3400</b> including an accessibility GUI <b>3402</b> presented with a website <b>3404</b> (e.g., a home page for the website).

In particular, accessibility GUI <b>3402</b> may include a Screen Reader profile <b>3406</b> configured to address needs of users benefiting from a screen reader when navigating website <b>3406</b>. For example, website <b>3404</b> may include source code instructions (e.g., HTML, CSS and JavaScript) that when executed by processing device <b>210</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of computing device <b>170</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), may cause a visual rendering of images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, and <b>3412</b> on display <b>180</b>A of computing device <b>170</b>A.

Selecting Screen Reader profile <b>3406</b> may cause an execution of a software application (e.g., computer code instructions) that modifies (e.g., makes alterations) the website code of website <b>3404</b> to enable an audio rendering of images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, and <b>3412</b>, and thereby cause the website code to conform with screen reader profile <b>3406</b>.</p><p id="p-0479" num="0478">Some embodiments involve obtaining an indication of screen reader usage to navigate and consume website content on a specific device. &#x201c;Obtaining&#x201d; may occur in any manner where an indication is received in a way that is detectable by or understandable to a processor. An indication may include one or more of a signal, cue, communication, token, cookie, command, user input, or other information conveying screen reader usage. The term &#x201c;navigate&#x201d; may refer to the act of proceeding or flowing from one section of web content (e.g., the navigation source) to another (e.g., the navigation targe). Website navigation may begin from any website source and flow to any website target. Thus, a user may navigate from one website to a different website, from a page of a website to a different page of the same website, or from a section on a page of a website to a different section on the same page of the same website. Additionally, or alternatively, website navigation may begin from one software application (e.g., a browser application) and proceed to a different software application (e.g., an email, messaging or phone client). Website navigation may be enabled via links displayed at the navigation source of a website. The link function may be a pointer that takes a user from the navigation source to the navigation target upon selecting the link (e.g., via an electronic mouse, keyboard press, electronic pen, touching a touch-sensitive screen, voice command, gesture or eye tracking, or any other selection technique). Links may be defined in the website code using identifying labels or tags, for example within the HTML elements &#x3c;a&#x3e; and &#x3c;/a&#x3e;, using the &#x201c;href&#x201d; attribute to define a hyperlink pointing to the navigation target. For example, the HTML instruction &#x201c;&#x3c;a href=navigation target&#x3e;LABEL&#x3c;/a&#x3e;&#x201d; may cause a web browser to display the word &#x201c;LABEL&#x201d; on the website, such that selecting the &#x201c;LABEL&#x201d; web element causes the web browser to display content referenced by the hyperlink defined by navigation target. The term &#x201c;consume&#x201d; may refer to acquiring website content, for example by reading text content, seeing color, format, image and video content, hearing audio content, feeling tactile content via haptic interaction, and/or any other method of receiving information from a website. A screen reader may assist users facing challenges in any of navigating and/or consuming website content, for example due to reading disabilities or vision impairment. For example, to assist in website navigation, the screen reader may recite a text describing the content, context, subject, or purpose of the navigation target associated with a link on the website. Similarly, to assist a user in consuming content presented by a website, the screen reader may recite a text describing an image, a color, a position, a size, or a format of content, or any other visual characteristic of the content. The screen reader may be invoked on the specific device of a particular user to assist the particular user navigate and consume website content on the specific computing device.</p><p id="p-0480" num="0479">The indication of screen usage may be obtained for example upon detecting the installation of a screen reader on a computing device and/or in association with a particular user, upon invocation of the screen reader on the computing device and/or in association with the user, based on a history of previous screen reader usage on the computing device and/or in association with the user, based on a history of queries associated with screen reader usage, or any other indication of screen reader usage. For example, according to some embodiments, obtaining the indication of screen reader usage occurs based on input from an accessibility graphical user interface (GUI) associated with the website. The term &#x201c;accessibility GUI&#x201d; may refer to an interface that allows users to customize website display parameters through graphical elements or links, as described earlier. Upon selection of a Screen Reader profile of the accessibility GUI, an event listener associated with the Screen Reader profile may notify a processor (e.g., of the specific device or a different computing device) of the selection, thereby obtaining an indication of screen reader usage to navigate and consume website content on a specific device. The selection of the Screen Reader profile may be performed using any suitable input interface technique, such as via a keyboard, touch on a touch sensitive screen, electronic mouse or pen, voice command, gesture recognition, eye tracking, and any other input interface method.</p><p id="p-0481" num="0480">By way of a non-limiting example, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>, accessibility GUI <b>3402</b> may include Screen Reader profile <b>3406</b>.

In the exemplary implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>, the selection of Screen Reader profile <b>3406</b> is indicated by the &#x201c;ON&#x201d; status of button <b>3414</b> of Screen Reader profile <b>3406</b>. An event listener (e.g., integrated with a web browser configured to display accessibility GUI <b>3402</b> alongside website <b>3404</b>) may detect the selection of Screen Reader profile <b>3406</b> and notify processing device <b>210</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Processing device <b>210</b>A may thus obtain an indication of screen reader usage for navigating and consuming website content, for example to allow visually impaired user <b>110</b>A to navigate website <b>3404</b> via links <b>3416</b> to <b>3428</b> and consume the digital content of images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, <b>3412</b>.</p><p id="p-0482" num="0481">According to some embodiments, obtaining the indication of screen reader usage occurs based on detection of a predefined sequence of keystrokes. The term &#x201c;predefined sequence of keystrokes&#x201d; may refer to a particular order of selections of keys of a keyboard interface configured with a computing device, e.g., by pressing a mechanical keyboard (e.g., a braille keyboard), touching a keyboard displayed on a touch sensitive display, selection of keys via gesture recognition, eye tracking, voice command, or any other key selection technique. For example, a particular sequence of keystrokes may be associated with opening a browsing application, e.g., to navigate and consume website content. Examples of predefined sequences of keystrokes include Ctrl+A (e.g., to save a document), Ctrl+C (e.g., to copy data to a clipboard in memory), and Ctrl+V (e.g., to paste data copied to a clipboard in memory). Additionally, or alternatively, a particular sequence of keystrokes may be associated with opening a website. The website may be a generic website or a particular website assisting individuals who may benefit from improved website accessibility (e.g., to navigate and consume website content). As another example, a particular sequence of keystrokes may be defined in advance (e.g., as a keyboard shortcut) to invoke a screen reader on a computing device, e.g., via an accessibility option of a settings menu for the computing device. The predefined sequence of keystrokes may be stored in a memory (e.g., associated with a local or remote computing device) to allow comparing a detected sequence of keystrokes with the predefined sequence and the indication of screen reader usage may be obtained based on the comparison.</p><p id="p-0483" num="0482">By way of a non-limiting example, processing device <b>210</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of computing device <b>170</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may detect a sequence of key selections by user <b>110</b>A on a braille keyboard configured with input interface <b>240</b>, for example to display website <b>3404</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>). Processing device <b>210</b>A of computing device <b>170</b>A may compare the detected sequence with a predefined sequence of keystrokes associated with screen reader usage and stored in memory device <b>220</b>A.

For example, the voice command may be received via a microphone and voice-user interface (VUI) configured on a computing device. The VUI may include voice recognition software to discern words or terms for invoking a screen reader. For example, a particular expression (e.g., including one or more words and/or commands) may be associated with opening a browsing application, (e.g., to navigate and consume website content), with opening a website (e.g., a generic website or a particular website assisting individuals benefiting from improved website accessibility), with invoking a screen reader, or with any other indication of screen reader usage. The particular expression may be stored in a memory (e.g., associated with a local or remote computing device) to allow comparing a detected expression (e.g., via the VUI) with the particular expression to thereby obtain the indication of screen reader usage.</p><p id="p-0485" num="0484">By way of a non-limiting example, processing device <b>210</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of computing device <b>170</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may detect a voice command (e.g., &#x201c;screen reader&#x201d;) via a microphone configured with input interface <b>240</b>. Processing device <b>210</b>A may analyze the voice command via a VUI configured with computing device <b>170</b>A and determine a request to invoke a screen reader, thereby obtaining an indication for screen reader usage.</p><p id="p-0486" num="0485">According to some embodiments, obtaining the indication of screen reader usage occurs based on data retrieved from the computing device. For example, installation of a screen reader in a memory of a computing device may indicate screen reader usage. Upon opening a browser or website on a computing device, the browser and/or website may query the memory of the computing device to detect installation of the screen reader. The response to the query (e.g., data retrieved from the computing device) may indicate screen reader usage. As another example, a history or pattern of prior screen reader usage may be stored in a memory of the computing device. The prior screen reader usage may be associated with a history (e.g., a browsing history) associated with the computing device, and/or with a specific account or specific user. When a session is initiated on the computing device (e.g., via a browser), the history (e.g., data) may be retrieved from the memory of the computing device to determine the prior screen reader usage, thereby obtaining the indication.</p><p id="p-0487" num="0486">By way of a non-limiting example, processing device <b>210</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of computing device <b>170</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may store in memory device <b>220</b>A a screen reader application, e.g., in association with user <b>110</b>A. When user <b>110</b>A initiates a session on computing device <b>170</b>A (e.g., a browsing session), processing device <b>210</b>A may identify user <b>110</b>A in association with the screen reader application stored in local memory device <b>220</b>A, thereby obtaining the indication.</p><p id="p-0488" num="0487">According to some embodiments, obtaining the indication of screen reader usage occurs based on data retrieved from a remote server. For example, a history or pattern of prior screen reader usage may be stored at a cloud storage facility associated with a remote server. The prior screen reader usage may be associated with a previous session (e.g., a browsing history) of a specific user, a specific account, and/or a specific computing device. When a new session (e.g., browsing session) is initiated, the history (e.g., data) may be retrieved from the remote server to determine the prior screen reader usage, thereby obtaining the indication. According to some embodiments, the remote server may be an accessibility server configured to facilitate accessibility to consume content and navigate websites.</p><p id="p-0489" num="0488">By way of a non-limiting example, a history of screen reader usage associated with user <b>110</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may be stored at data structure <b>136</b> of accessibility host <b>130</b> via network <b>140</b>. When user <b>110</b>A initiates a session (e.g., on computing device <b>170</b>A), server <b>133</b> of accessibility host <b>130</b> may identify user <b>110</b>A and retrieve the history of screen reader usage (e.g., data) from data structure <b>136</b>. Server <b>133</b> of accessibility host <b>130</b> may provide the data as an indication of screen reader usage to processing device <b>210</b>A of computing device <b>170</b>A via network <b>140</b>.

The term &#x201c;predefine template&#x201d; may refer to one or more of a series of changes defined in advance to adapt one or more websites to accommodates needs of a specific disability in a manner that is uniform and consistent across multiple pages of a single website or multiple websites. Implementing the predefined template may provide multiple benefits. For example, the predefined template may facilitate in automating the accommodation of web content for a specific disability, allowing to universally accommodate many webpages and/or website. In addition, the predefined template may ensure that the accommodations are applied consistently and uniformly, allowing disabled users to adapt to the accommodations easily and efficiently. In some embodiments the predefined template may be implemented across a bundle of webpages and/or websites. For example, the template may be implemented across multiple webpages included in a single website (e.g., under the same domain address) or linked to another website (e.g., associated with a different domain address), and navigable from each other via links included therein. Implementing the template across an entire bundle of linked webpages may facilitate a user in web navigation. The term &#x201c;make multiple changes to the website code&#x201d; may refer to adding, removing, editing, and/or modifying one or more instructions of the website code, or one or more parameters, variables, or values referred to or used by the website code. The changes may be made to any portion of the website code, such as to a main section, a function, a procedure, a declaration, a definition, a reference (e.g., to an internal or external library), metadata associated with the website code, comments associated with the website code, a CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Java or Python file associated with the website code, and/or any other piece of information that may affect the rendering of the website content via the web browser on a specific device. The term &#x201c;conform with accessibility needs&#x201d; may refer to accommodating the website code to suit needs associated with a specific accessibility profile, for example, by ensuring that the website code allows a user associated with the screen reader profile to navigate and consume any content of the website. Thus, the multiple changes to the website code may allow the screen reader to audibly present visual content, and to audibly present information (e.g., topic, content, context, purpose, role) about the navigation targets associated with any links of the website.</p><p id="p-0491" num="0490">By way of a non-limiting example, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>A</figref>, an interface <b>3500</b> is shown displaying website <b>3404</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref> and a corresponding source code window <b>3502</b> for website <b>3404</b>. Source code window <b>3502</b> contains (e.g., at least) elements <b>3504</b>, <b>3506</b>, <b>3508</b> (e.g., website code) for displaying images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, and <b>3412</b>, respectively, and element <b>3510</b> for displaying link <b>3416</b> on website <b>3404</b>. Elements <b>3504</b>, <b>3506</b>, and <b>3508</b> include location information for retrieving images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, and <b>3412</b>, e.g., to visually render images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, and <b>3412</b>, e.g., on display <b>180</b>A of device <b>170</b>A for user <b>110</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) but lack descriptive text that may be recited by a screen reader to allow visually impaired user <b>110</b>A to consume the visual content of images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, and <b>3412</b> as audio content. Similarly, element <b>3510</b> includes a hyperlink to allow navigating to a different webpage from the homepage of website <b>3404</b> (e.g., by selecting link <b>3416</b>) but lacks descriptive text that may be recited by a screen reader to assist user <b>110</b>A in deciding if content presented via the navigation target associated with link <b>3416</b> is relevant. Thus, visually impaired, user <b>110</b>A may fail to fully navigate and consume the content of website <b>3504</b>, e.g., rendered according to elements <b>3504</b>, <b>3506</b>, <b>3508</b>, and <b>3510</b>. To facilitate user <b>110</b>A in navigating and consuming the content of website <b>3404</b>, processing device <b>210</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of computing device <b>170</b>A may make changes to the website code according to the predefined template. For example, the predefined template may call for the addition of descriptive text to elements <b>3504</b>, <b>3506</b>, <b>3508</b>, <b>3510</b>, e.g., inside an &#x201c;alt&#x201d; attribute, to conform with the accessibility needs of visually impaired users. For example, the added text may allow user <b>110</b>A to consume the visual content of images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, and <b>3412</b> as audio content, and may further allow user <b>110</b>A to decide if to navigate to another webpage via link <b>3416</b>.</p><p id="p-0492" num="0491">According to some embodiments, implementing the predefined template includes identifying in the website code a plurality of elements corresponding to multiple objects displayed on the website. The term &#x201c;elements&#x201d; may refer to any content defined in the website code, e.g., for presenting on a website. For example, an HTML document may define multiple web elements delineated between a start tag (e.g., &#x201c;&#x3c;tag&#x3e;&#x201d;) and an end tag (e.g., &#x201c;&#x3c;/tag&#x3e;&#x201d;). Each web element may be associated with an object of the website, and may defined characteristics for rendering the object, such as display characteristics, audio characteristics, haptic characteristics, and any other characteristic of the element. Identifying elements may occur in any manner resulting in recognition of associated objects. The template itself may be implemented by running code associated with the predefined template. The term &#x201c;objects displayed on the website&#x201d; may refer to content presented on the website corresponding to each element, for example links, images, tables, paragraphs, forms, fields, text boxes, buttons, video, menus, pop-up windows, lists, regions of a webpage or website, margins, and/or any other content that may be presented via the website. The website code may define elements, such that when a web browser executes (or interprets) the element, the object corresponding to the element is presented according to element definition. For example, the website code may include an element (e.g., HTML source code element) for a navigation link (e.g., a corresponding object). The element may be identifiable (e.g., via a parser) as corresponding to a navigation link object by the &#x3c;a&#x3e; and &#x3c;/a&#x3e; tags surrounding the HTML element definition (e.g., as opposed to a different type of object, such as an image). The HTML element definition may include characteristics for presenting the object (e.g., position, format, size, color, shape, accompanying text, highlight, select status), e.g., via the web browser. As another example, the website code may include an HTML source code element to display an image object on the website. The element may be identifiable as corresponding to an image object by the &#x3c;img src=&#x201c; . . . &#x201d;&#x3e; tag included in the HTML element definition. Thus, to conform the website code to accessibility needs, web elements (e.g., in the website code) corresponding to objects presented by the website, may be identified. It is to be noted that the HTML examples given are intended merely to conceptualize elements and corresponding objects and do not limit the disclosure to any specific implementation. For example, elements may be defined using other languages, such as XML, JavaScript, Java Applets, Java, Objective-J, PHP, Adobe Flash, or any other language or specification for defining elements.</p><p id="p-0493" num="0492">By way of a non-limiting example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>A</figref> illustrates elements <b>3504</b>, <b>3506</b>, <b>3508</b> (e.g., HTML image definitions) corresponding to images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, and <b>3412</b> (e.g., image objects), respectively, and element <b>3510</b> (e.g., HTML link definition) corresponding to link <b>3416</b> (e.g., a link object) of website <b>3404</b>. For example, image <b>3408</b> may visually present a testing swab, image <b>3410</b> may present a testing strip, and image <b>3412</b> may present a vial containing liquid for performing a rapid Covid-19 testing, and link <b>3416</b> may allow navigating to a different webpage or website to obtain additional information about Covid-19 testing. A parser configured with a software application executed by processing device <b>210</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may scan the website code for website <b>3404</b> and identify elements <b>3504</b>, <b>3506</b>, <b>3508</b> as corresponding to images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, and <b>3412</b>, respectively, e.g., by the &#x3c;img src=&#x201c; . . . &#x201d;&#x3e; tag included in the element definition.

In this manner, processing device <b>110</b>A may identify multiple elements (e.g., HTML elements) corresponding to multiple object (e.g., images and links) displayed on website <b>3404</b>.</p><p id="p-0494" num="0493">According to some embodiments, implementing the predefined template includes determining accessibility information for at least some of the multiple objects displayed on the website. The term &#x201c;accessibility information&#x201d; may refer to descriptive terms, words, labels, tags, or phrases associated with one or more objects presented by a website. For example, accessibility information associated with visual content, such as an image object, may be used by a screen reader to substitute a visual presentation of the visual content with an audible presentation. The audible presentation of visual content may make a website more accessible, such as visually impaired users, or users who choose to turn off the display of image content, for example due to low communication bandwidth (e.g., to allow a webpage to load faster) or to address other disabilities (e.g., AHDH, epilepsy, seizure). As another example, accessibility information may facilitate in rendering elements that serve a function but are not tagged as such, such as a text displayed as a title but not tagged as a title, or an actionable object (e.g., a clickable button) not tagged as an actionable object, as described earlier. For example, accessibility information may be included in an element as alternative text, for example via the HTML tag &#x201c;alt.&#x201d; Thus, after identifying elements in the website code corresponding to multiple objects of the website, a parser may further analyze each identified element to determine if accompanying accessibility information is included in the definition for the element.</p><p id="p-0495" num="0494">By way of a non-limiting example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>A</figref> illustrates an exemplary of implementation for determining accessibility information for objects displayed on a website, consistent with some disclosed embodiments.

For example, elements <b>3504</b>, <b>3506</b>, <b>3508</b> and <b>3510</b> lack alternative text (e.g., as an &#x201c;alt&#x201d; tag followed by one or more terms, words, or phrases for recitation by a screen reader). Processing device <b>210</b>A may thus determine that the accessibility of website <b>3404</b> may be improved for use with a screen reader. To remedy this, processing device <b>110</b>A may determine accessibility information for each of elements <b>3504</b>, <b>3506</b>, <b>3508</b> and <b>3510</b>, e.g., to include as alternate text for recitation by the screen reader. The accessibility information may assist user <b>110</b>A in consuming the content of images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, and <b>3412</b>, and in navigating to a different website or webpage via link <b>3416</b>, thereby improving the accessibility of website <b>3404</b> for user <b>110</b>A. Processing device <b>210</b>A may determine accessibility information using any suitable technique, such as by performing a textual analysis of the website code of website <b>3404</b>, for example by analyzing source code instructions, metadata, tags, labels, comments, descriptive terms (e.g., for use by a search engine), prominently displayed text, such as headings, links, or titles, and any other textual analysis for determining accessibility information.

For example, the website code may be updated such that executing (or interpreting) the updated website code (e.g., via a web browser) may produce a different user experience, such as a different rendering or presentation of the content of the website. Thus, the determined accessibility information may be used to modify the website code such that executing (or interpreting) the modified (e.g., updated) website code causes a different rendering of the content of the website to make the website more accessible.

The term &#x201c;audible presentation&#x201d; may refer to a rendering of audio content, e.g., via a speaker. For example, audio content such as sound alerts, music, and speech may be audibly presented to a user via a speaker. As another example, a screen reader may produce an audible presentation of non-audio content (e.g., visual content such as text and images) by reciting alternative text describing the non-audio content via speaker. The term &#x201c;simultaneous display of the website content on other computing devices&#x201d; may refer to a concurrent serving (e.g., by a website host) and display (e.g., via a browser application) of the website content on multiple computing devices via a communications network. Thus, multiple computing devices (e.g., located in multiple separate locations) may access the content of the website at the same time, for example by simultaneously retrieving the website code from the website host and executing the website code locally. The term &#x201c;without impacting the simultaneous display of the website content&#x201d; may refer to the updated code not affecting a concurrent display of the website content on computing devices not associated with screen reader usage, such that a user viewing the website content on a computing device that has not invoked the screen reader may be indifferent to the updating. Thus, the updated website code may simultaneously execute differently on different devices, depending on screen reader usage. For example, executing the updated website code on a first computing device that has invoked the screen reader (e.g., in response to selecting a Screen Reader profile) may produce an audible presentation of visual content.

The processes may include reasoned decision making, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the manipulation of objects (e.g., robotics). AI techniques may include optimization algorithms and heuristics, formal logic, neural networks, statistical and probabilistic methods, and applications from economics, psychology, linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy. The term &#x201c;rules&#x201d; may include inference rules, reasoning rules, logical rules, rules targeting optimization, rules targeting efficiency, and any other rules that may facilitate in automating the updating of website code (e.g., via a machine).

The term &#x201c;image processing&#x201d; may include the application of mathematical convolutions, Fourier transforms, statistical correlations, edge detection, pattern recognition, color analysis, and any other computing technique to analyze digital images. The term &#x201c;contextual information&#x201d; may include information relating one or more pixels or clusters of pixels (e.g., a neighborhood of pixels, or a pattern formed by pixels) in a digital image with other pixels or clusters of pixels, either in the same digital image, a different digital image, or in a database of pixel clusters. The relation between the pixels or clusters thereof may be based on spatial and/or spectral (e.g., color) information, statistical correlation, Bayesian dependency, and/or any other technique to determine a relationship <b>7</b> between one or more pixels or clusters of pixels. Additionally, or alternatively, the contextual information may include information associated with text displayed prominently in a website, in proximity to one or more images, in the metadata of the website, or any other text that may be associated with images displayed on a website. A &#x201c;neural network&#x201d; may refer to a connected mesh (e.g., network) of artificial neurons (e.g., digitally synthesized neuron units) intended to mimic the interconnectivity of neurons in a biological brain (e.g., human or other). The processing performed by the aggregate of the neurons in a neural network may mimic a learning process for artificial intelligence, for example by determining relationships and associations between images, text, and any other content of the website. Thus, visual content (e.g., images) associated with the identified elements of the website code may be retrieved (e.g., via addresses or locations included in the identified elements) and undergo image processing techniques and/or analysis by a neural network to determine contextual information. The contextual information may be used to determine a meaning, objective, or function for each of the elements, for example in conveying the website content for consumption by a user. The contextual information may thus reflect a purpose of each of the identified elements, for example in conveying the website content. The contextual information may be used to determine the accessibility information, e.g., to facilitate the conveying of the website content to users associated with screen reader usage.</p><p id="p-0504" num="0503">By way of a non-limiting example, when upon receiving a request from user <b>110</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) to open website <b>3404</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>), server <b>133</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of accessibility host <b>130</b> may retrieve from website host <b>120</b> images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, and <b>3410</b> referenced via elements <b>3514</b>, <b>3516</b>, and <b>3518</b>, respectively, of the website code for website <b>3404</b>.

Thus, for at least one of the identified elements in the website code, the determined accessibility information may include an attribute that complies with a technical specification associated with an ARIA set of standards. For example, the at least one ARIA attribute includes at least one of a role, a state, or a property for the at least one element in the website code. For example, the ARIA role may define a purpose of a web element (e.g., a checkbox, menu, header, navigation), an ARIA state may define a current mode of an interactive web element (e.g., selected, hidden, highlighted), and an ARIA property may define the relationship of a web element with other web elements of the website (e.g., descendant, labelled by).

The term &#x201c;description of images&#x201d; may refer to terms, words or expressions that replicate or characterize visual information embedded in an image, for example to allow expressing the visual information via a non-visual medium, such as words expressed by a screen reader, or sounds expressed via a speaker. For example, the description may include colors, sizes, proportions, contexts, and positions of features included in the image (e.g., a large shiny ball held by a small child), and relationships between the different features of the image (e.g., girl picking a flower), actions or movement conveyed in the image (e.g., large furry dog running down a hill), sounds alluded to in the image (e.g., lighting cracking the sky), textures expressed in the image (e.g., ragged rock overhanging a smooth surface of a lake), and any other description that may express visual information of the image using a non-visual media. According to some embodiments, the description of images depicted on the website contains information directed to the blind to thereby describe images in words. For example, the description may tell a story or narrative in words that corresponds to the story or narrative told visually by the image allowing a blind person to understand the information in the image without seeing the image. For example, a web element for an image of a dog jumping to greet a child may include the description &#x201c;dog jumping to greet child.&#x201d; A blind user wishing to consume the content of the image may receive an audible description of the image via a screen reader reciting the accessibility information added to the web element for the image. As another example, a web element for a navigation link for receiving additional information about dogs may include the description &#x201c;select this to learn more about dogs.&#x201d; A visually impaired user wishing to learn more about dogs may be assisted in navigating via the link using a screen reader reciting the description added to the web element as accessibility information.</p><p id="p-0508" num="0507">By way of a non-limiting example, elements <b>3514</b>, <b>3516</b>, and <b>3518</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>B</figref> include the descriptive phrases &#x201c;nasal testing swab for obtaining a test sample&#x201d;, &#x201c;test strip for determining infection&#x201d;, and &#x201c;vial containing liquid for at-home testing&#x201d;, corresponding to images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, and <b>3412</b>, respectively.

For example, a website may include one or more active elements allowing users to interact with the website, such as navigation links (e.g., for navigating to a different location on the webpage or to a different webpage or website), buttons, menus, checkboxes, and fields for providing input to the website or receiving a response from the website, and any other web element allowing to interact with the website. A non-visually impaired user may interact with the website by targeting the position on a computer display where an interactive element is displayed. For example, a button may be selected by touching a touch-sensitive screen at the location where the button is displayed. However, a visually impaired user may face difficulty in locating the element for the purpose of interacting with the website and may thus be assisted by the screen reader for this purpose. Accordingly, the accessibility information may include text directed to the screen reader (e.g., screen reader text) that allows the user to target one or more elements of the website for the purpose of interacting with the website. The screen reader text may be indicated by an &#x201c;alt&#x201d; tag. The accessibility information may thus include descriptive words, terms, or phrases to explain the interactive capability for a web element, e.g., to allow visually impaired or blind users to perform one or more actions available on the website, and thereby interact with the website. For example, a website for a clothing outlet may include a button to add a size large cotton sweater to a shopping cart. A visually abled user may add the sweater to her shopping cart by clicking the location of the screen where the button is displayed via an electronic mouse. To assist a visually impaired user who cannot locate the button on the screen, the accessibility information for the button may include screen reader text that causes the screen reader to recite (&#x201c;if you want to add a size large cotton sweater to your shopping cart, please say YES, otherwise say NO&#x201d;).

Processing device <b>210</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of computing device <b>170</b>A may execute the updated website code, including updated elements <b>3514</b>, <b>3518</b>, <b>3518</b>, and <b>3520</b>, to cause an audible presentation of objects <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, <b>3412</b> and <b>3416</b>, respectively, where executing the original website code (e.g., including original elements <b>3504</b>, <b>3506</b>, <b>3508</b>, and <b>3510</b>) produced only a visual presentation of objects <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, <b>3412</b> and <b>3416</b>, respectively. The updated website code thus changes an audible presentation of website <b>3404</b> at computing device <b>170</b>A. Concurrent (e.g., simultaneous) with executing the website code at computing device <b>170</b>A, computing device <b>170</b>B may receive the updated code for website <b>3404</b> via network <b>140</b>. Computing device <b>170</b>A does not have a screen reader installed and/or invoked for presenting website <b>3404</b>. Thus, executing the updated website code (e.g., including updated elements <b>3514</b>, <b>3518</b>, <b>3518</b>, and <b>3520</b>) causes a visual presentation of objects <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, <b>3412</b> and <b>3416</b>, respectively, that is substantially like the visual presentation of objects <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, <b>3412</b> and <b>3416</b> that would be produced by executing the original (e.g., not updated) website code for website <b>3404</b>. The updates made to the website code thus do not impact the simultaneous display of the website content (e.g., objects <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, <b>3412</b> and <b>3416</b>) on other computing devices (e.g., computing device <b>170</b>B).</p><p id="p-0522" num="0521">According to some embodiments, updating the website code includes associating the plurality of elements with attributes for enabling interaction with the multiple objects displayed on the website. For example, before updating the website code, an object may be accessible to visually abled users who may interact with the object by selecting the object upon locating the object displayed on the website. However, the object may not be accessible to users who have difficulty locating the object (e.g., blind or visually impaired users, photo sensitive users, users with poor reception or bandwidth), and thus may not be able to interact with the object. Updating the website code may add text and/or sounds as attributes to the element associated with the object. A screen reader may recite the text and a speaker may play the sound, allowing such users to interact with the object.</p><p id="p-0523" num="0522">For example, and as described earlier, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>B</figref>, updated elements <b>3514</b>, <b>3516</b>, <b>3518</b>, and <b>3520</b> of the website code for website <b>3404</b> include attributes with descriptive text that may be audibly presented to user <b>110</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) by a screen reader. Consequently, user <b>110</b>A, who is visually impaired, may interact with corresponding images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, <b>3412</b> and link <b>3416</b> displayed on website <b>3404</b>.</p><p id="p-0524" num="0523">According to some embodiments, an interaction with at least one of the multiple objects displayed on the website includes navigating to the at least one object and providing an audible description of the at least one object. For example, a screen reader may audibly describe a website to a user by reciting text descripting of each object of the website. For example, the screen reader may advance through a plurality of objects of a website by navigating a tree (e.g., a DOM tree) defining a hierarchy for the objects of the website, to ensure that each object is audibly described to the user.</p><p id="p-0525" num="0524">For example, and as described earlier, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>B</figref>, a screen reader configured with computing device <b>170</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may sequentially focus on each of images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, <b>3412</b> and link <b>3416</b> (e.g., navigate to each object) and audibly describe images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, <b>3412</b> and link <b>3416</b> to user <b>110</b>A based on the accessibility information added to updated elements <b>3514</b>, <b>3516</b>, <b>3518</b>, and <b>3520</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0526" num="0525">According to some embodiments, an interaction with at least one of the multiple objects displayed on the website includes executing a function associating with the at least one object. For example, some objects may cause actions to be performed upon selecting the object (e.g., playing a song, or adding an item to a shopping cart). The actions may be defined as functions inside the website code, such that selecting the object causes the corresponding function (e.g., to play the song or to add the item to the shopping cart) to be executed.</p><p id="p-0527" num="0526">For example, and as described earlier, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>B</figref>, upon hearing the audible description for link <b>3416</b>, user <b>110</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may select link <b>3416</b> (e.g., via a voice command) and navigate to another webpage providing additional information on testing for Covid-19, thereby interacting with link <b>3416</b> by executing a navigation function associated with link <b>3416</b>.</p><p id="p-0528" num="0527">According to some embodiments, the determined attributes enable the user to interact with the multiple objects displayed on the website using predefined keystrokes. For example, the updates to the website code may add attributes to objects to accommodate the website for use with a non-visual interface with as a braille keyboard. For example, a first keystroke sequence may be defined to play a song and a second keystroke sequence may be defined to halt the playing of the song.</p><p id="p-0529" num="0528">For example, and as described earlier, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>B</figref>, user <b>110</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may have access to a braille keyboard configured with input interface <b>240</b> of computing device <b>170</b>A. Upon executing the updated website code for website <b>3404</b>, a screen reader configured with computing device <b>170</b>A may audibly present the description for images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, and <b>3412</b> (e.g., included in the &#x201c;alt&#x201d; attributes) and the description for link <b>3416</b> (e.g., included in the &#x201c;alt&#x201d; and &#x201c;role&#x201d; attributes). User <b>110</b>A may use a first predefined keystroke on the braille keyboard to cause the screen reader to repeat the audio presentation of images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, and <b>3412</b>, and may user a second predefined keystroke on the braille keyboard to navigate via link <b>3416</b>.</p><p id="p-0530" num="0529">According to some embodiments, the attributes enable the user to interact with the multiple objects displayed on the website using predefined hand gestures. For example, for example, the updates to the website code may add attributes to objects to accommodate the website code for use with a non-visual interface such as gesture recognition software operative with a camera. For example, a first hand gesture may be defined to navigate to the bottom of the website and a second hand gesture may be defined to return to the top of the website.</p><p id="p-0531" num="0530">For example, and as described earlier, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b>B</figref>, computer <b>170</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may be configured with a camera and gesture recognition software integrated with input interface <b>240</b> of computing device <b>170</b>A. Upon executing the updated website code for website <b>3404</b>, a screen reader configured with computing device <b>170</b>A may audibly present the description for images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, and <b>3412</b> (e.g., included in the &#x201c;alt&#x201d; attributes) and the description for link <b>3416</b> (e.g., included in the &#x201c;alt&#x201d; and &#x201c;role&#x201d; attributes). User <b>110</b>A may use a first hand gesture to cause the screen reader to repeat the audio presentation of images <b>3408</b>, <b>3410</b>, and <b>3412</b>, and may use a second hand gesture to navigate via link <b>3416</b>.</p><p id="p-0532" num="0531">A user with disabilities may search for information using a search engine and receive results tailored to the user's specific disabilities. The search results may include one or more websites and the websites may be categorized based on a level of accessibility of the websites. The search results may be presented to the user based on the categorization that accounts for the level of accessibility. For example, websites that may be more accessible may be displayed at the top of the list of search results, while websites that may be less accessible may be displayed towards the bottom of the list of search results.</p><p id="p-0533" num="0532">Some disclosed embodiments involve providing search results to client-side computing devices. A client may create a search on a computing device to obtain an output. A client may create a search query by providing a term to a search engine to obtain results related to that term. A term may be a single word or a string of words. Search results may include a list, catalog, index, table, or any other type of output created by search engines in response to the term. For example, a client may provide the term &#x201c;restaurant&#x201d; to a search engine. In response, the search engine may provide a list of restaurants to the client. A search engine may be a program that searches for and identifies items in a database that correspond to keywords or characters specified by the client. For example, a search engine may be Google, Yahoo!, Bing, or any other type of program capable of searching for information in response to a search query. A search engine may display results on a client-side computing device. A client-side computing device may include a computing device used by the client. A client may be a user of a search engine or any other person. A client-side computing device may include a laptop, tablet, phone, desktop computer, hand-held computer, smartphone, smartwatch, smart glasses, or any other type of computing device capable of receiving a search query and performing a search using a search engine.</p><p id="p-0534" num="0533">Some disclosed embodiments involve receiving information categorizing a plurality of websites. Search results may include an output, for example, a list of websites, a link to a list of websites, and/or text defining a category of websites. The websites may be grouped or categorized together based on information associated with or included in the websites. The information may include, for example, text, images, sounds, audio, videos, or other types of digital content present on a website. Each website from the plurality of websites may be assigned a category based on the information associated with or included in the website. It is also contemplated that some websites may be included in more than one grouping and, therefore, may be assigned more than one category. The information categorizing a plurality of websites may be received by a client-side computing device, a host computer, a server, a network, or any other type of device used to receive information. Such information may be received from a website, a server, a network, a computer, or any other type of device used to send information.</p><p id="p-0535" num="0534">By way of example, websites including audio information may be grouped together and may be assigned a category &#x201c;audio.&#x201d; As another example, websites including color may be grouped together and may be assigned a category &#x201c;color.&#x201d; As another example, websites including videos may be grouped together and may be assigned a category &#x201c;video.&#x201d; By way of another example, a website that includes audio information and color images may be included in the group of websites that have audio and also in the group of websites that have color images. In this case, the website that includes audio information and color images may be assigned two categories &#x201c;audio&#x201d; and &#x201c;color.&#x201d; In some exemplary embodiments, the list of websites may be ranked based on the information. For example, websites with audio may be ranked higher than websites with text. In some exemplary embodiments, websites may be categorized alphabetically, in chronological order, by popularity, or by any other type of organization method. By way of another example, websites may be categorized by subject matter. For example, in response to a search request for &#x201c;shoes,&#x201d; shoe vendors may be grouped together in a shoe shopping group, and shoe manufacturers may be grouped separately in a manufacturers group. Similarly, a &#x201c;shoe&#x201d; search may result in separate groupings for men's, women's, and children's shoes.</p><p id="p-0536" num="0535">Some disclosed embodiments involve storing in at least one data structure the information categorizing the plurality of websites. A data structure consistent with the present disclosure may include any collection of data values and relationships among them. The data may be stored linearly, horizontally, hierarchically, relationally, non-relationally, uni-dimensionally, multidimensionally, operationally, in an ordered manner, in an unordered manner, in an object-oriented manner, in a centralized manner, in a decentralized manner, in a distributed manner, in a custom manner, or in any manner enabling data access. By way of non-limiting examples, data structures may include an array, an associative array, a linked list, a binary tree, a balanced tree, a heap, a stack, a queue, a set, a hash table, a record, a tagged union, ER model, and a graph. For example, a data structure may include an XML database, an RDBMS database, an SQL database or NoSQL alternatives for data storage/search such as, for example, MongoDB, Redis, Couchbase, Datastax Enterprise Graph, Elastic Search, Splunk, Solr, Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB, Scylla, HBase, and Neo4J. A data structure may be a component of the disclosed system or a remote computing component (e.g., a cloud-based data structure). Data in the data structure may be stored in contiguous or non-contiguous memory. Moreover, a data structure, as used herein, does not require information to be co-located. It may be distributed across multiple servers, for example, a data structure may be owned or operated by the same or different entities. Thus, the term &#x201c;data structure&#x201d; as used herein in the singular is inclusive of plural data structures.</p><p id="p-0537" num="0536">The stored data may relate to websites and the websites may be categorized based on the stored information, as discussed above. For example, a link to each website may be stored in the data structure in association with the one or more categories assigned to that website. It is contemplated that other methods of associating the categories with the respective websites (e.g., relational tables, or linked tables) may be employed when storing the information categorizing the plurality of websites. It is also contemplated that in some embodiments the list of websites may be indexed using the one or more categories as a way of storing the information categorizing the plurality of websites.</p><p id="p-0538" num="0537">Some disclosed embodiments involve receiving information indicating a level of accessibility for each of the plurality of websites. A level of accessibility may refer to a degree to which a website address needs of persons with disabilities. For example, if a website only addresses some disabilities, the level of accessibility might be indicated as low. If a website addresses all common disabilities, the degree of accessibility might be indicated as high. Similarly, within particular disabilities, access levels can range. Websites with more effective tools for addressing a particular disability may receive a ranking level higher than those with lesser effective tools. A ranking system for a level of accessibility may be based on discrete levels of accessibility (e.g., low, mid-low, medium, mid-high, high), or may be based on a continuous ranking (e.g., scale of 1-10). Information indicating a level of accessibility may be received in a data structure, as described earlier. The information may be derived through manual or automated reviews of the websites.</p><p id="p-0539" num="0538">By way of more specific non-limiting examples, certain websites may be easier to navigate relative to other websites, particularly for users with disabilities. A website may be deemed accessible if all types of users (e.g., those with disability and those without disability) can navigate and use the website. Additionally, or alternatively, a website may be deemed partially accessible if only some types of users can navigate and use the website. Additionally, or alternatively, a website may not be accessible at all if no users can navigate or use the website. Websites may have different levels of accessibility based on what types of users can navigate and use a website. For example, a website that may be useable by all types of users may have a high level of accessibility. As another example, a website that may be usable by only some type of users may have a medium level of accessibility. As another example, a website that may not be usable by any user may have no level of accessibility. Information relating to a website may include the level of accessibility of the website. Information relating to the level of accessibility of a website may be received by a client-side computing device from a website. The client-side computing device may use machine learning models to determine what type of information may be available on a website to determine the level of accessibility. For example, a machine learning model may determine that a website contains audio. The model may determine that the presence of audio indicates the website is accessible to visually impaired users. As another example, a client-side computing device may use algorithms to determine the level of accessibility. For example, an algorithm may determine that a website contains contrasting colors. The algorithm may determine that the presence of contrasting colors indicates the website is accessible to colorblind users. Alternatively, or additionally, a separate computing device may contain a machine learning model or algorithm to determine the level of accessibility of a website and the separate computing device may transmit the information to a client-side computing device.</p><p id="p-0540" num="0539">In some embodiments, the level of accessibility is reflective of whether each website is disability accessible or disability non-accessible. As discussed previously, a correlation may exist between the level of accessibility assigned to a website and the actual accessibility of the website. Thus, the level of accessibility may be said to reflect whether a website is disability accessible or disability non-accessible. A website that is disability accessible may be coded to include features making it accessible to a user with a particular disability or to different users with differing disabilities. For example, a website may be coded such that it includes a font type that individuals with cognitive disabilities find it easy to read and a font size that individuals with visual impairment find it easy to read. In general, a disability accessible website is one that follows a web accessibility standard (e.g., WCAG 2.1). A website that is disability non-accessible may be coded in a manner that it lacks features that may make it accessible to a user having any disability A level of accessibility may describe whether the website is accessible to users with disabilities. Users with disabilities may be unable to navigate certain websites based on the nature of the disability. For example, a user with epilepsy may be unable to navigate a website with flashing colors. As another example, a user who is visually impaired may be unable to navigate a website that does not contain any audio. As another example, a user who is colorblind may be unable to navigate a website with certain colors. A website with a high level of accessibility may be accessible to users with different types of disabilities. An accessible website may be one that complies with a web standard (e.g., Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1). For example, a website that provides visual and audio cues may have a high level of accessibility since a user who is visually impaired and a user who is hearing impaired may be able to navigate the website. Therefore, the website may be disability accessible. As another example, a website that provides only text content may have a low level of accessibility since a user who is visually impaired may not be able to navigate the website. Therefore, the website may be disability non-accessible.</p><p id="p-0541" num="0540">In some embodiments, the level of accessibility includes a composite score associated with a disability accessibility compliancy ranking. A website may be ranked based on a plurality of criteria to determine how accessible a website is to user's with different disabilities. A score may be assigned to the website for each of the criteria on which the website is evaluated. A composite score may be determined for the website based on the individual scores assigned for the different criteria. The criteria may include, for example, how many different types of users can navigate the website, how many different types of disabilities the website accommodates, how many colors the website uses, how many audio cues the website uses, or any other type of criteria that determines how well the website accommodates one or more types of disability. A composite score may use all, some, or one of these criterion to determine which websites are the most accessible. A composite score may be calculated as a sum, an average, a median, a maximum, or minimum value, or some other statistical or mathematical calculation. For example, a website that is accessible to visually impaired users may have a medium composite score, while a website that is accessibly to visually and hearing-impaired users may have a high composite score. A composite score may relate to a disability accessibility compliancy ranking. A disability accessibility compliancy ranking may indicate how many different users with different types of disabilities are able to navigate a website. A disability accessibility compliancy ranking may be determined by a web standard, such as WCAG. For example, a WCAG Level A ranking may be given to websites that use color. As another example, a WCAG Level AA ranking may be given to websites that uses color and has contrast between the colors used. A composite score may be determined based off the criteria described above and/or a disability compliancy ranking.</p><p id="p-0542" num="0541">Some disclosed embodiments involve storing in the at least one data structure the information indicating the level of accessibility. Information related to the level of accessibility of a website may be received and stored in a data structure in order to retrieve the information at a later time. The information may be a composite score, disability compliancy ranking, a level of accessibility or any other type of information. The information may be stored in a table, as an index, in association with the website, as a link, in a lookup table, or by another other storage means.</p><p id="p-0543" num="0542">Some disclosed embodiments involve receiving a search query from a particular client-side computing device. As defined above, a client may use a computing device to create a search. A search may use a search query. A search query may include a phrase or keyword combination a user may enter into a search engine provided by the client-side computing device. A search query may include a single word or a group of words. Additionally, or alternatively, a search query may include numbers, marks, symbols, images, or any other type of character. A client may enter a search query into a client-side computing device in order to obtain search results. Thus, for example, the search query may be received at a server from the client-side device. The search query may be received over a network, such as the internet. Alternatively, the search query may be received on the client-side following user input on the client side. In this alternative, processing of the query, on whole or in part may occur on the client side.</p><p id="p-0544" num="0543">Some disclosed embodiments involve performing a look up in the data structure for websites associated with the search query. Performing a look up may involve using the search query to interrogate a data structure. As discussed, in some disclosed embodiments the data structure stores information related to websites. When a user enters a search query, the query term or terms may be compared to stored information to find websites that are associated with the search query. Websites that are associated with the search query may include websites that contain the exact word, that contain words used in the search query, that use similar words to the search query, or that are otherwise associable with the search query (e.g., artificial intelligence may associate with certain combinations of words). Additionally, or alternatively, websites that are associated with the search query may include websites that contain portions of the word or words used in the search query, or some combination of the words used in the search query. In some embodiments, the search engine may also search for websites based on synonyms or other words related to the word or words in the search query. For example, a user may search for &#x201c;restaurants.&#x201d; In response to the search query, the search engine may retrieve, from the data structure, a list of websites that contain information about restaurants. As another example, a user may search for &#x201c;doctors near me.&#x201d; In response to the search query, the search engine may retrieve, from the data structure, a list of websites that contain information about doctors near the user's location.</p><p id="p-0545" num="0544">Some disclosed embodiments involve presenting on the particular client-side computing device website search results, wherein the website search results include links to websites matching the search query and wherein the website search results are presented in a preferential manner that takes into account the level of accessibility of the plurality of websites. Presenting may include sending electronic signals to the client-side computing device to cause an associated presentation on a display associated with the client-side computing device. For example, signals sent to a client-side computing device may result in display of website search results relating to the search query. Websites that may be associated with the search query, as described above, may be presented as website search results. The website search results may display the websites in a horizontal list, a vertical list, a numbered list, a bulleted list, a cloud, or any other type of display format capable of displaying an ordered or ranked set of search results. The list may include links to the websites. A link may be an HTML object that allows a user to click on the object and be taken to a website associated with the link. A link may include words, numbers, characters, or other types of symbols. Within the list, the search results may be presented in a specific order based on the level of accessibility of the website. For example, a website that may have a high level of accessibility may be higher up on the list than a website that has a low level of accessibility. As another example, a website that may be accessible to a visually and hearing-impaired user may be higher up on the list than a website that is only accessible to visually impaired users. It is also contemplated that in addition to the position of the website in the list, a website having a higher level of accessibility may be displayed in larger font size, in a different color, with highlighting, or with other visual or audio cues to indicate that the website has a higher level of accessibility relative to other websites in the search results.</p><p id="p-0546" num="0545">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref> illustrates an example of a visually impaired user performing a search query and an accessible website being displayed to the user. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref>, system <b>3720</b> may include a website host <b>3710</b> communicating with an accessibility service host <b>3719</b> over communications network <b>3714</b>. The accessibility service host <b>3719</b> and the website host may include servers <b>3718</b> and <b>3711</b> and data structures <b>3717</b> and <b>3712</b>. The accessibility service host <b>3719</b> may obtain default website display <b>3713</b> from website host <b>3710</b> and store default website display <b>3713</b> in data structure <b>3717</b>. A visually impaired user <b>3715</b> may run a search query on client-side computing deice <b>3716</b>. Accessibility service host <b>3719</b> may perform a look up in data structure <b>3717</b> for default website displays <b>3713</b> associated with the search query. Accessibility service host <b>3719</b> may determine which default website displays <b>3713</b> may be accessible to visually impaired user <b>3715</b>. Accessibility service host <b>3719</b> may communicate only default website displays <b>3713</b> that are also visually impaired accessible websites to client-side computing device <b>3716</b>, based on the user's disability.</p><p id="p-0547" num="0546">In some embodiments, presenting the website search results in a preferential manner includes providing an indication of website search results associated with disability accessible websites. Accessible websites responsive to the search query may be presented in a specific way. The preferential manner may include an indication that shows the website is disability accessible. The indication may include a position, color, tag, presentation format, order, notation, audible indication, visual indication, or any other types of indication to distinguish a website that is disability accessible from websites that are disability accessible to a smaller degree or not at all. Disability non-accessible websites may not include an indication. Providing such an indication may allow a user to determine which websites are disability accessible and which websites are disability non-accessible. Providing an indication may include displaying the indication on a presentation on a display associated with the client-side computing device. For example, a disability accessible website may be positioned near the top of the search result display, while a disability non-accessible website may be positioned towards the bottom of the search result display. As another example, a disability accessible website may include a check-mark tag, while a disability non-accessible website may include an &#x201c;x&#x201d; tag.</p><p id="p-0548" num="0547">In some embodiments, providing an indication includes presenting visual indicators associated with first website search results identifying accessible websites, the visual indicators distinguishing the first website search results from second website search results identifying non-accessible websites. In some embodiments, the indication described above may include a visual indicator. A visual indicator may include color, text, position, icons, or any other type of visual marker. In some embodiments, a visual indicator may only be associated with accessible websites. The search results described above may include disability accessible and disability non-accessible websites. The accessible websites may be presented as a group of first search results and the non-accessible websites may be presented as a group of second search results so a user may be able to differentiate between accessible and non-accessible websites. For example, disability accessible websites may be grouped into first website search results and disability non-accessible websites may be grouped into second website search results. A visual indicator may be used to distinguish the accessible websites from the non-accessible websites. For example, accessible websites may be colored blue and non-accessible websites may be colored black. As another example, accessible websites may be in 20 pt. font while non-accessible websites may be in 12 pt font.</p><p id="p-0549" num="0548">In some embodiments, presenting the website search results in a preferential manner includes ordering the website search results based at least in part on the level of accessibility of the plurality of websites. Website search results may be displayed to a user in many different ways. A preferential manner may include listing the websites based on the websites level of accessibility. A website with a higher level of accessibility may be listed higher (e.g., near a top of the list of websites) than a website with a lower level of accessibility. For example, a website with visual and audio cues may be ordered higher (e.g., near a top of the list of websites) than a website with only visual cues. As another example, a website with visual cues may be ordered higher (e.g., near a top of the list of websites) than a website with no cues.</p><p id="p-0550" num="0549">In some embodiments, ordering the website search results includes prioritizing website search results associated with accessible websites such that first website search results associated with accessible websites are presented ahead of second website search results associated with non-accessible websites. As described above, accessible websites may be presented as a group of first search results and the non-accessible websites may be presented as a group of second search results. The search results may be presented as a list, such as a numbered, ordered, bulleted, alphabetical, or any other type of list or presentation style. The first group of website search results (e.g., results including disability accessible websites) may be presented before the second group of website search results (e.g., results including disability non-accessible websites). For example, the search results may be presented as a numbered list and the first group of search results may be identified with numbers that are smaller while the second group of search results may be identified with numbers that are larger than the numbers used to identify the first group of search results. As another example, the search results may be presented as a bulleted list and the first search results may appear above the second search results.</p><p id="p-0551" num="0550">In some embodiments, presenting the website search results in a preferential manner includes presenting, in an accessible manner, first website search results associated with accessible websites and second website search results associated with non-accessible websites. Website search results may also be provided to a user in an accessible manner. An accessible manner may be a manner that complies with a web standard, e.g., Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1. Providing search results in an accessible manner may include providing audio, providing color contrast, providing sign language interpretation for audio or video content, removing flashing visual media, or by using other types of accessible means for displaying the websites or the links to the websites. For example, a user may be visually impaired, and the website search results may be displayed with audio options for the user to be read the search results. As another example, a user may be color blind, and the website search results may be displayed with a color contrast.</p><p id="p-0552" num="0551">In some embodiments, in response to an indication that a user is visually impaired, presenting website search results in an accessible manner includes providing an audible presentation of text descriptive of the website search results and providing an audible presentation of textual description of an image associated with the website search results. A user may indicate that they have a certain disability by clicking a button, using specific presentation styles, using a profile associated with their account, or by other means. A response may include the presentation of the website search results changing based on the indication. For example, a user may click a button that says &#x201c;Visual&#x201d; to indicate the user is visually impaired. As another example, a user may enlarge the text of a page to indicate the user is visually impaired. As another example, a user may indicate in their profile that they are hearing impaired. The website search results may be displayed in an accessible manner based on the indication. For example, the user may indicate they are visually impaired, and the website search results may include a way for the text of the results to be presented audibly. Website search results may include images, text, colors, or other visual elements. Accessible search results may include an audio presentation of the images, text, color, or other visual elements of the search results.</p><p id="p-0553" num="0552">Some embodiments include determining that a user of the particular client-side computing device is associated with a particular disability, and wherein presenting the website search results emphasizes websites with accessibility conforming to the particular disability. Determining may include deciding that a user of a client-side computing device may have a disability. For example, a user may be visually impaired, hearing impaired, have epilepsy, or may have another type of disability. A particular disability of a user may be determined, as described below, based on a user profile, the type of search engine the user selects, the search query the user performs, the type of software the user utilizes, or through other means. Certain websites may be more accessible to users with a specific disability. For example, a website having enlarged text may be accessible to a visually impaired user. As another example, a website having contrasting colors may be accessible to a colorblind user. As another example, a website may have audio and may be accessible to a visually impaired user but not accessible to a hearing-impaired user. A user may run a search query and the website search results may be ranked based on the user's disability. For example, the website search results may display websites that are accessible to a colorblind person if a user is colorblind. As another example, the website search results may display websites that are accessible to a visually impaired person if the user is visually impaired.</p><p id="p-0554" num="0553">In some embodiments, the determination that the user is associated with a particular disability is based on a user profile stored in memory. A user of a client-side computing device may create a profile on the device that may be stored in the memory of the device. The profile may include information such as a name of the user, a disability of the user, website preferences of the user, or any other user information. A user may run a search query and the website search results may be displayed to the user based on the disability information stored in the user's profile. For example, a user may indicate in their profile that the user is visually impaired, Based on the user profile, instead of presenting all the websites in the website search results, only websites that are accessible to visually impaired users may be presented to the user.</p><p id="p-0555" num="0554">In some embodiments, the determination that the user is associated with a particular disability is based on the search query. A user of a client-side computing device may run a search query that indicates the user's disability. The search query may indicate the user's disability based on the term or terms the user uses in the search query. For example, a user may search for &#x201c;car dealership hearing impaired&#x201d; indicating that the user is hearing impaired. Based on the search query, instead of presenting all the websites associated with the terms car dealership, only car dealership websites that are accessible to hearing impaired users may be presented to the user. As another example, a user may search for &#x201c;eye doctors near me,&#x201d; indicating that the user is visually impaired. Based on the search query, instead of presenting all the websites in the website search results, only websites that are accessible to visually impaired users may be presented to the user</p><p id="p-0556" num="0555">In some embodiments, the determination that the user is associated with a particular disability is based on a user selection to invoke a dedicated accessible search engine. A user using a client-side computing device to run a search query may have the option to pick from different search engines. For example, a user may run a search on Google, Yahoo!, Bing, accessFind, or any other type of search engine. Some search engines may be disability accessible. A user may choose to run a search on a search engine that is disability accessible. The user's selection may indicate that the user has a particular disability. For example, a user may select the search engine accessFind to run a search query. Selection of the accessFind search engine may indicate that the user wishes to search for only visually impaired accessible websites. Selection of the accessFind search engine may indicate that the user is visually impaired.</p><p id="p-0557" num="0556">In some embodiments, the determination that the user is associated with a particular disability is based on detection of software running on the particular client-side computing device. A user may use software to aid in creating a search query. Software may include speech to text, text to speech, screen reader, accessibility browser extension, keyboard and mouse alternatives, screen magnification, optical character recognition, braille display, eye tracking, or other types of software. The type of software used to generate the search query may indicate the disability of a user. For example, a user may use a speech to text software to generate the search query. Use of the speech to text software may indicate the user is visually impaired. As another example, the user may use a screen reader to generate the search query. Use of the screen reader may indicate the user is hearing impaired.</p><p id="p-0558" num="0557">Some embodiments include obtaining an indication that a user of the particular client-side computing device has a particular disability; and presenting the website search results in a preferential manner that addresses the particular disability. Obtaining may include receiving an indication that a user may have a specific disability. The website search results may be presented to the user in a manner that takes into account that disability. For example, a user may be visually impaired, and the website search results may be presented in a manner that lists the visually impaired accessible websites above non-visually impaired accessible websites. A website that includes a text to audio converter may be a visually impaired accessible website and may be listed higher than a website that does not include a text to audio converter. As another example, a user may be hearing impaired, and the website search results may be presented in a manner that lists the hearing-impaired accessible websites above non-hearing impaired accessible websites. A website that includes images may be a hearing-impaired accessible website and may be listed higher than a website that does not include images.</p><p id="p-0559" num="0558">In some embodiments, the indication that the user of particular client-side computing device has a particular disability is based on an input from an accessibility graphical user interface (GUI). Input from an accessibility GUI may include text, sounds, speech, hand gestures, body gestures, or tactile information. An input from an accessibility GUI may correlate to a particular disability. For example, a user may provide an input by clicking on a speaker icon for the text to be converted to audio. The input may indicate that the user is visually impaired, and the website search results may be presented in a manner that lists the visually impaired accessible websites above non-visually impaired accessible websites. A website that contains audio may be a visually impaired accessible website and may be listed higher than a website that does not contain audio. As another example, a user may provide an input by clicking on an option to change the color of the text. The input may indicate that the user is color blind, and the website search results may be presented in a manner that lists the colorblind accessible websites above non-colorblind accessible websites. A website that includes contrasting colors may be a hearing-impaired accessible website and may be listed higher than a website that does not include contrasting colors.</p><p id="p-0560" num="0559">By way of example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref> illustrates an example of website search results with an input option for a user to indicate that the user has a particular disability. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>, a user may enter terms into a search query box <b>3810</b>. For example, a user may enter the search query &#x201c;Online Car Dealers&#x201d; in the search query box <b>3810</b>. In response to the search query, website search results <b>3812</b> may be presented to a user with associated images <b>3813</b>-<b>3815</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>, the website search results <b>3812</b> may include a listing of car dealers in response to the search query &#x201c;Online Car Dealers.&#x201d; The results may also be accompanied by images of cars as shown in images <b>3813</b>-<b>3815</b>. A user may use an input <b>3811</b> to indicate the user has a particular disability. In response, the website search results <b>3812</b> may be presented to the user based on the indication. For example, if the user selects &#x201c;Visual&#x201d;, the website search results may be rearranged so only websites that may be accessible by a visually impaired user may be presented.</p><p id="p-0561" num="0560">In some embodiments, presenting the website search results in a preferential manner that addresses the particular disability includes presenting the website search results in a format addressing the particular disability by altering default display parameters to conform with an accessibility profile associated with the particular disability. An accessibility profile may include information on a particular disability of a user. Website search results may be displayed, using default display parameters, to a user who does not have an accessibility profile. In some embodiments, when a user has an associated accessibility profile, the display parameters may be adjusted based on the user's associated accessibility profile. By way of example, display parameters of website search results may include color, text, images, sound, size, or any other parameter. For example, a user may have a seizure safe accessibility profile and the display parameters of the website search results may be adjusted to exclude flashing lights and/or videos. As another example, a user may have a vision impaired profile and the display parameters of the website search results may be adjusted to play audio of the text of the search results.</p><p id="p-0562" num="0561">In some embodiments, presenting the website search results in a preferential manner that addresses the particular disability includes displaying first search results of websites accessible to the particular disability and omitting second search results of websites non-accessible to the particular disability. For example, a user may enter term or terms in a search query and multiple websites may match the search results. A user who may have a particular disability may only wish to view the website search results that include websites accessible to that particular disability. The website search results may be displayed to the user so only the websites that are accessible to the user's disability are displayed to the user. For example, a user may be visually impaired. A user may run a search, and only websites that are accessible to visually impaired users may be presented to the user. Websites that are presented to the user may include websites with audio. As another example, a user may be colorblind. A user may run a search, and only websites that are accessible to colorblind users may be presented to the user. Websites that are presented to the user may include websites having content in contrasting colors.</p><p id="p-0563" num="0562">In some embodiments, presenting the website search results in a preferential manner includes presenting website search results of accessible websites ahead of website search results of non-accessible websites. For example, a user may enter term or terms in a search query and multiple websites may match the search results. A user who may have a particular disability may wish to view website search results that include websites accessible to the particular disability before viewing websites that are not accessibly to the particular disability. The website search results obtained in response to the search query may be displayed to the user, so the accessible websites are presented before (e.g., nearer the top of the list of websites) the non-accessible websites. For example, a user may be visually impaired. A user may run a search, and websites that are accessible to visually impaired users may be presented to the user ahead of websites that are non-accessible to visually impaired users. For example, the search may contain ten websites. Four of those websites may be accessible to visually impaired users. The four websites that may be accessible to visually impaired users may be shown ahead of the remaining six websites that are not accessible to visually impaired users. As another example, a user may be colorblind. A user may run a search, and websites that are accessible to colorblind users may be presented to the user ahead of websites that are non-accessible to colorblind users. For example, the search may contain five websites. Three of those websites may be accessible to colorblind users. The three websites that may be accessible to colorblind users may be shown ahead of the remaining two websites that are not accessible to colorblind users.</p><p id="p-0564" num="0563"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref> illustrates a flow chart of an exemplary method <b>3910</b> that may be executed by a processor to perform operations for providing search results to client-side computing devices.
