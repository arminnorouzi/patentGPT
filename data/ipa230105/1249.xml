Long-term retardants may be available as wet or dry concentrates that are mixed with water thereby improving water's effectiveness and ability to cling to fuels, over a long period of time. Long-term retardants may be colored with iron oxide, fugitive pigments, or remain uncolored.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the &#x201c;Ecological Risk Assessment of Wildland Fire-Fighting Chemicals: Long-Term Fire Retardants&#x201d; (September 2017), hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, the United States Forest Service (&#x201c;USFS&#x201d;) has established a chemical toxicity risk assessment for fire-fighting chemicals currently approved for use by the USFS. The USFS uses a variety of fire-fighting chemicals to aid in the suppression of fire in wildlands. These products can be categorized as long-term retardants, foams, and water enhancers. This chemical toxicity risk assessment of the long-term retardants examines their potential impacts on terrestrial wildlife, plant, and aquatic species.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, in Specification 5100-304d (Jan. 7, 2020), Superseding Specification 5100-304c (June 2007), Superseding Specification 5100-304b (July 1999), Superseding Specification 5100-00304a (February 1986), entitled &#x201c;Specification for Long Term Retardant, Wildland Fire, Aircraft or Ground Application,&#x201d; hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, the United States Department of Agriculture (&#x201c;USDA&#x201d;) Forest Service has established the maximum allowable corrosion rates for 2024T3 aluminum, 4130 steel, yellow brass and Az-31-B magnesium. The corrosivity of forest fire retardants, in concentrate, to aluminum, steel, yellow brass and magnesium must not exceed 5.0 milli-inches (&#x201c;mils&#x201d;) per year as determined by the &#x201c;Uniform Corrosion&#x201d; test set forth in Section 4.3.5.1 of the USDA Forest Service Specifications. The Forest Service Specifications identify the maximum amount of corrosion acceptable when both the retardant concentrate and its diluted solutions are exposed to each metal indicated above at temperatures of 70&#xb0; Fahrenheit (&#x201c;F&#x201d;) and 120&#xb0; F. in both totally and partially immersed configurations. The maximum allowable corrosivity of aerially applied fire-retardant diluted solutions to aluminum is 2.0 mils per year (&#x201c;mpy&#x201d;) and the maximum corrosivity to brass and steel is 2.0 mpy when partially immersed and 5.0 when tested in the partially immersed condition. In the partially immersed configurations, one-half of the coupon is within the solution and one-half is exposed to the vapors in the air space over the solution.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 10,550,483 to Khosla et al. discloses &#x201c;fire-retardant concentrate compositions comprising a mixture of ammonium phosphates&#x201d; wherein &#x201c;the mixture of ammonium phosphates has a molar ratio of ammoniacal nitrogen to phosphorus (N/P molar ratio) in a range of from about 1.1 to about 1.9.&#x201d; (2:7-13.) Khosla et al. is limited to this outer range of N/P molar ratios of about 1.1 to about 1.9, and values within this range, because all its examples (Examples 1-5) are limited to mixtures of monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and diammonium phosphate (DAP). Such mixtures of MAP and DAP, by definition, exclude any N/P molar ratio below about 1.1 (e.g., where N/P=1 for MAP alone) or above about 1.9 (e.g., where N/P=2 for DAP alone). Moreover, it was explained during prosecution of Khosla et al. that &#x201c;Applicants have discovered that controlling the N/P molar ratio within the claimed range of from 1.4 to about 1.9 for mixture of ammonium phosphate fire-retardants provides the required magnesium alloy corrosion rate.&#x201d; (Applicant's Response at p. 9, filed on Sep. 18, 2019, in U.S. Ser.

The non-fugitive component of the colorant is present in an amount sufficient to improve the aerial visibility of the composition when it is first applied to the vegetation.

The final diluted composition <b>103</b> and/or <b>202</b> is a thickened water retardant which contains water to cool and suppress the fire.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0210">Indirect Attack</p><p id="p-0270" num="0211">In an indirect attack, the final diluted composition <b>103</b> and/or <b>202</b> is applied in fire containment lines at a significant distance from the fire line. The indirect fire lines are built, and the fire is allowed to burn into them. The long-term fire retardant must be effective even after the water in the composition has evaporated. In an indirect attack, the final diluted composition <b>103</b> and/or <b>202</b> is applied to vegetation. As the water in the final diluted composition <b>103</b> and/or <b>202</b> evaporates, the salt concentration increases until it reaches its saturation level.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0212">Field Handling and Measurement</p><p id="p-0272" num="0213">The forest fire retardant composition of Examples 1-10 and 12-28 can be delivered to the field either as the dry concentrate <b>101</b>, liquid concentrate <b>102</b>, or as the final diluted composition <b>103</b> and/or <b>202</b>. The forest fire retardant composition of Example 11 can be delivered to the field either as the liquid concentrate <b>201</b> or as the final diluted composition <b>202</b>. The final diluted compositions <b>103</b> and/or <b>202</b> of Examples 1-28 can be tested prior to application in the field to confirm proper salt content and/or proper N/P molar ratio. A refractometer can be used to test the salt content. Density can also be used to determine the salt content.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0214">Field Mixing Procedures and Ratios</p><p id="p-0274" num="0215">Batch preparation of final diluted composition <b>202</b> may be accomplished by slowly feeding the liquid concentrate into a well-stirred mix tank containing a predetermined amount of water. Mix tank agitation may be provided via an overhead mechanical stirring apparatus or alternatively by a circulation pump sized to provide turbulent mixing.

The dry concentrate <b>101</b> should be kept dry during cleaning to minimize color staining that may occur when the dye is hydrated. When the dry concentrate <b>101</b> is exposed to water, the product can be cleaned with the use of a granular chemical absorbent material, or if proper drainage is available, by rinsing surfaces clean with adequate amounts of water. Dye coloration may be removed from surfaces by treatment with liquid or dry detergent. The final diluted composition <b>103</b> can be cleaned with soap or liquid detergent and water.
