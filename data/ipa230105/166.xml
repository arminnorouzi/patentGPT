All of the aforementioned patent applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to an aerosol generating device, in particular to a dual-airway intake structure, a power supply device, and an aerosol generating device.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aerosol generating device is also known as electronic atomizer. Its working principle is that after the power switch is turned on, the power supply device supplies power to the atomizer, and after the atomizer is powered, it heats the aerosol-forming substrate to generate smoke for the user to inhale.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">At present, most of the aerosol generating devices on the market are equipped with sensors. When the user sucks, the sensor senses the gas pressure difference on both sides thereof. Further, the power supply device is controlled to supply power to the atomizer. When the sucking action is stopped, the power supply device stops supplying power to the atomizer. In this way, the automatic use is realized, which is convenient for the user to operate.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the air intake of traditional aerosol generating devices usually adopts single air intake. When the user touches, packs or transports the aerosol generating device, the space for installing the sensor is likely to be squeezed, resulting in a gas pressure difference between the two sides of the sensor. As a result, the aerosol generating device is triggered unintentionally and causes the waste of electric energy and the aerosol-forming substrate, and it also brings certain safety hazards to the user's packaging, transportation and use.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Based on this, it is necessary to provide a dual-airway intake structure that can
