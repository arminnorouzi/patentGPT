An end of the first conductive contact pad <b>13</b> facing toward the second conductive contact pad <b>23</b> is a first contact surface <b>14</b>, an end of the second conductive contact pad <b>23</b> facing toward the first contact surface <b>14</b> is a second contact surface <b>24</b>, an area occupied by the first conductor group <b>131</b> on the first contact surface <b>14</b> is larger than an area occupied by the first connection group <b>132</b> on the first contact surface <b>14</b>, and an area occupied by the second conductor group <b>231</b> on the second contact surface <b>24</b> is larger than an area occupied by the second connection group <b>232</b> on the second contact surface <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The semiconductor structure according to an embodiment of the present disclosure includes the first chip <b>10</b> and the second chip <b>20</b>. The first conductive connection wire <b>12</b> of the first chip <b>10</b> is connected to the first conductive contact pad <b>13</b>; the second conductive connection wire <b>22</b> of the second chip <b>20</b> is connected to the second conductive contact pad <b>23</b>; the first conductive contact pad <b>13</b> includes the first conductor group <b>131</b> and the first connection group <b>132</b>, and the second conductive contact pad <b>23</b> includes the second conductor group <b>231</b> and the second connection group <b>232</b>. The first conductor group <b>131</b> is directly opposite to the second conductor group <b>231</b>, the first connection group <b>132</b> is directly opposite to the second connection group <b>232</b>, the melting point of the first conductor group <b>131</b> is higher than that of the first connection group <b>132</b>, and the melting point of the second conductor group <b>231</b> is higher than that of the second connection group <b>232</b>. Therefore, the first connection group <b>132</b> and the second connection group <b>232</b> can be melted and connected at a first temperature, thus implementing a pre-connection between the first conductive contact pad <b>13</b> and the second conductive contact pad <b>23</b>. Then, the pre-connected first chip <b>10</b> and second chip <b>20</b> are transferred to an annealing condition at a second temperature for bonding, to achieve reliable bonding between the first conductive contact pad <b>13</b> and the second conductive contact pad <b>23</b>. Because the first chip <b>10</b> and the second chip <b>20</b> have been pre-connected before being transferred, relative movement between the first chip <b>10</b> and the second chip <b>20</b> is avoided, which ensures the subsequent alignment of the first chip <b>10</b> and the second chip <b>20</b> to be reliable, thereby improving the performance of the semiconductor structure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It should be noted that, at the first temperature, the first connection group <b>132</b> and the second connection group <b>232</b> are melted, while the first conductor group <b>131</b> and the second conductor group <b>231</b> are not melted. In this case, the first connection group <b>132</b> and the second connection group <b>232</b> can be connected, and various materials of the first conductive contact pad <b>13</b> and the second conductive contact pad <b>23</b> can be interpenetrated and fused. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a compound is thus formed, thereby implementing the pre-connection between the first conductive contact pad <b>13</b> and the second conductive contact pad <b>23</b>. Because the first conductive contact pad <b>13</b> and the second conductive contact pad <b>23</b> are pre-connected, relative slippage of the first chip <b>10</b> and the second chip <b>20</b> is avoided in the subsequent process of transferring the first chip <b>10</b> and the second chip <b>20</b>, ensuring that the first chip <b>10</b> and the second chip <b>20</b> are bonded under the annealing condition at the second temperature while the first chip <b>10</b> and the second chip <b>20</b> are connected with reliable alignment. Therefore, the first conductive contact pad <b>13</b> and the second conductive contact pad <b>23</b> are bonded reliably, and a reliable bonding structure is formed between the first conductive contact pad <b>13</b> and the second conductive contact pad <b>23</b>. In the related art, the first chip <b>10</b> and the second chip <b>20</b> are directly placed in a high-temperature environment for bonding, and the alignment is affected by the slippage during the transfer process, thus affecting the performance of the semiconductor structure.
