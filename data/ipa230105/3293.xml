By adjusting the inter-axis distance between the input shaft and the output shaft, a preload is generated on the contact surface between the bearing and the cam, and backlash between the input and output can be eliminated. The contact of the bearing with the cam causes friction between the bearing and the cam, so that the bearing and cam wear.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent Literature 1 discloses a rotation transmission mechanism including a motor, a gear driven by the motor, a lubricant for cooling the gear, and lubricant storage means for storing the lubricant and immersing the gear in the lubricant. The gear includes a first spur gear, a second spur gear, a driven shaft, a worm gear (or a roller gear cam), a worm wheel (or a turret around which a plurality of bearings engaging with the roller gear cam are arranged radially and at equal intervals), and a rotating shaft. The lubricant is stored in the lubricant storage means so that the first spur gear, the second spur gear, and the worm gear are completely immersed in the lubricant. Heat generated from the motor is transferred to the gear, and the transferred heat is transferred to the lubricant in which the gear is immersed, thereby cooling the gear.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">PATENT LITERATURE 1: JP-A-2014-101989</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the rotation transmission mechanism of Patent Literature 1, the lubrication of the gear is performed by the lubricant stored in the lubricant storage means. However, when the gear is driven by the motor and the turret rotates through the roller gear cam, there is a problem that the lubricant moves in a direction away from the roller gear cam and the turret due to centrifugal force, so that the contact surface between the bearing and the cam is put into a state where no lubricant-based membrane remains on the contact surface. Further, when a large amount of the lubricant is stored in the lubricant storage means, there is a problem that the stirring resistance of the lubricant increases and heat is generated. Still further, when the lubricant storage means has been filled with the lubricant, it causes a problem that the lubricant may leak out of the lubricant storage means.</p><p id="p-0007"

However, the present invention is not limited to those embodiments.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Various embodiments of a transmission mechanism <b>101</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>29</b></figref>. The transmission mechanism <b>101</b> includes a housing <b>102</b>, and a first rotating member <b>103</b> which is accommodated in the housing <b>102</b> and is rotatable about a first rotating member axis <b>107</b>. The transmission mechanism <b>101</b> further includes a lubricating member which is accommodated in the housing <b>102</b> and contains lubricating member <b>104</b>. The lubricating member <b>104</b> is fixed to the housing <b>102</b>. While the first rotating member <b>103</b> rotates about the first rotating member axis <b>107</b> with respect to the lubricating member <b>104</b>, the lubricating member <b>104</b> comes into contact with a part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> while applying a preload to the part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> based on an elastic force, whereby the lubricating member <b>104</b> coat the lubricant on the part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> to lubricate the part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> with the lubricant.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In order to suppress heat to be generated due to friction caused by the contact between the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the lubricating member <b>104</b>, the elastic force may be adjustable so that the lubricating member <b>104</b> applies an appropriate preload to the first rotating member <b>103</b>. For example, the elastic force may be adjusted so that the preload decreases when the first rotating member <b>103</b> rotates at high speed with respect to the lubricating member <b>104</b>, whereas the preload increases when the first rotating member <b>103</b> rotates at low speed with respect to the lubricating member <b>104</b>. By rotating the first rotating member <b>103</b> with respect to the lubricating member <b>104</b> while applying a preload, it is possible to efficiently secure a lubricant-based membrane on the first rotating member <b>103</b> with a small amount of lubricant contained in the lubricating member <b>104</b> and lubricate the first rotating member <b>103</b>, so that abrasion of the first rotating member <b>103</b> can be suppressed. Further, since the amount of the lubricant can be reduced to the minimum, an environmental load can be reduced, so that the risk of leakage of the lubricant can be reduced. The lubricant may have a cleaning action, and the lubricant can remove dust which is caused by abrasion and adheres to the first rotating member <b>103</b>, and enables the first rotating member <b>103</b> to rotate efficiently. Further, the lubricant may have a cooling action, and the lubricant can lower the temperature of the first rotating member <b>103</b>, and enables the first rotating member <b>103</b> to rotate efficiently.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The first rotating member <b>103</b> may include bearings <b>106</b> as a component for transmitting power. While the bearings <b>106</b> rotate about the first rotating member axis <b>107</b> with respect to the lubricating member <b>104</b>, the lubricating member <b>104</b> comes into contact with the bearings <b>106</b> passing across the lubricating member <b>104</b> while applying a preload to the bearings <b>106</b> based on an elastic force, whereby the lubricating member <b>104</b> coats the lubricant on the outer surfaces of the bearings <b>106</b> to lubricate the bearings <b>106</b> with the lubricant. The bearings <b>106</b> pass longer across the lubricating member <b>104</b> along the direction of rotation of the first rotating member <b>103</b>, whereby the lubricating member <b>104</b> can more efficiently coat the lubricant on the outer surfaces of the bearings <b>106</b>, and enables the bearings <b>106</b> to be lubricated with the lubricant. Any member may be used as the lubricating member <b>104</b> as long as it can lubricate the bearings <b>106</b> with lubricant while the bearings <b>106</b> rotate about the first rotating member axis <b>107</b> with respect to the lubricating member <b>104</b>, and it may be located below the bearings <b>106</b> in the axial direction of the first rotating member axis <b>107</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>6</b></figref>, or may be located above the bearings <b>106</b> in the axial direction. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>11</b></figref>, the lubricating members <b>104</b> may be located on both the lower and upper sides of the bearings <b>106</b> respectively in the axial direction of the first rotating member axis <b>107</b>, whereby the lubricating members <b>104</b> more efficiently coat the lubricant on the outer surfaces of the bearings <b>106</b> to lubricate the bearings <b>106</b> with the lubricant. Depending on the arrangement of the bearings <b>106</b>, the lubricating member <b>104</b> may be located outside or inside the bearings <b>106</b> in the radial direction of the rotation of the first rotating member <b>103</b> about the first rotating member axis <b>107</b>, or may be located both inside and outside the bearings <b>106</b> in the radial direction.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Any member may be used as the first rotating member <b>103</b> as long as it can transmit power, and for example, it may include a gear. The lubricating member <b>104</b> comes into contact with a tooth portion of the gear passing across the lubricating member <b>104</b> while applying a preload to the tooth portion based on an elastic force, whereby the lubricating member <b>104</b> coats the lubricant on the tooth portion to lubricate the tooth portion with the lubricant.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The lubricant contained in the lubricating member <b>104</b> may include at least one of a liquid lubricant, a semi-solid lubricant, a solid lubricant, a liquid crystal lubricant, and a gel-like lubricant. For example, the lubricant may be grease, oil, or the like. The lubricant contained in the lubricating member <b>104</b> can be selected as needed. The lubricating member <b>104</b> may include an absorbent member such as a porous material impregnated with lubricant. The absorbent member may be, for example, a member having high absorbency for lubricant, such as sponge or felt.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The lubricating member <b>104</b> may be configured such that the lubricating member <b>104</b> itself is an elastic material. The lubricating member <b>104</b> comes into contact with a part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> while applying a preload to the part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> based on the elastic force of the lubricating member <b>104</b> itself, whereby the lubricating member <b>104</b> coats the lubricant on the part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> to lubricate the part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> with the lubricant. The lubricating member <b>104</b> can be installed in an existing dead space of the transmission mechanism <b>101</b>. Further, the transmission mechanism <b>101</b> may further include an elastic member. The elastic member is arranged, for example, between the housing <b>102</b> and the lubricating member <b>104</b>, and the lubricating member <b>104</b> is pressed against a part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> based on the elastic force of the elastic member. The lubricating member <b>104</b> comes into contact with a part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> while applying a preload to the part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> based on the pressing force of the elastic member, thereby coating the lubricant on the part of the first rotating member <b>103</b>, so that the part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> is lubricated with the lubricant. The elastic member can also be installed in an existing dead space of the transmission mechanism <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The lubricating member <b>104</b> may deform itself by applying a preload to a part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> to circulate the lubricant inside the lubricating member <b>104</b>. As described above, the first rotating member <b>103</b> includes components for transmitting power such as the bearings <b>106</b> and the tooth portion, and the lubricating member <b>104</b> can deform itself as if it undulates due to the preload based on the elastic force each time each component passes across the lubricating member <b>104</b>. This deformation causes a pumping action in the lubricating member <b>104</b>, and the lubricant can circulate inside the lubricating member <b>104</b>. By circulating the lubricant, the lubricant can be efficiently coated on a part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> to lubricate the part of the first rotating member <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The lubricating member <b>104</b> may absorb heat from the first rotating member <b>103</b> by its contact with the first rotating member <b>103</b>, and transfer the heat to the housing <b>102</b>. Although the first rotating member <b>103</b> generates heat due to its rotation for transmitting power, the lubricating member <b>104</b> may have a cooling action for absorbing the generated heat by its contact with the first rotating member <b>103</b> and transmitting the absorbed heat by its contact with the housing <b>102</b>. Since the heat generated by the first rotating member is dissipated to the outside of the transmission mechanism <b>101</b> via the lubricating member <b>104</b> and the housing <b>102</b>, the lubricating member <b>104</b> can lower the temperature of the first rotating member <b>103</b>, and enables the first rotating member <b>103</b> to rotate efficiently. Further, as described above, the lubricant circulates inside the lubricating member <b>104</b>, thereby enhancing the cooling action of the lubricating member <b>104</b> on the first rotating member <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Heat conduction and convection occur with the lubricant as a medium in the lubricating member <b>104</b> due to heat generated in the transmission mechanism <b>101</b>, and the generated heat is dissipated from the housing <b>102</b> to the atmosphere via the lubricant. In the lubricating member <b>104</b>, as the convection of the lubricant, forced convective heat transfer by stirring which is caused by rotation of the first rotating member <b>103</b> around the first rotating member axis <b>107</b> occurs in addition to natural convective heat transfer. In the forced convection, the heat transfer coefficient of the medium is higher as the viscosity of the medium is lower. Therefore, a lubricant having a lower viscosity (for example, a lubricant having fluidity, a liquid lubricant) can be more expected as a lubricant having a cooling effect by forced convection, and it is preferable as a medium. However, since even such lubricant has a lower heat conductivity than steel, nonferrous metal, resin, and the like, it may be difficult to dissipate heat from the transmission mechanism <b>101</b>. Further, since the heat transfer coefficient is affected by the heat conductivity and surface area of the medium, in order to increase the heat transfer coefficient, the medium should be made thinner, the surface area of the medium should be increased, and a medium having excellent heat conduction should be selected. It is preferable that the first rotating member <b>103</b> is efficiently cooled and further cooled with a small amount of lubricant. However, when the amount of lubricant is small and the following contaminants such as dust intervene, the degree of contamination of the lubricant tends to increase, so it is necessary to take measures against the contaminants, and it is also important to consider that the cooling effect of forced convection by stirring is not impaired. Therefore, in order not to impair the cooling effect of forced convection by stirring, it may be considered to adopt a lubricating member <b>104</b> that secures a minimum space for cooling the first rotating member <b>103</b> in the housing <b>102</b>, adopt a lubricating member <b>104</b> having such a high heat conductivity (material (steel, nonferrous metal, resin, and the like), shape, and the like), and/or adopt a lubricating member <b>104</b> having a cleaning action on contaminants. In this way, an optimum lubricating member <b>104</b> can be adopted by selecting lubricant to be contained in the lubricating member <b>104</b>, the material, shape, and the like of the lubricating member <b>104</b> for containing the lubricant. Further, by making the amount of lubricant small, maintenance such as refueling and waste oil treatment is economical, and it is expected that the environmental load will be reduced.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The lubricating member <b>104</b> may adsorb dust from the first rotating member <b>103</b> by its contact with the first rotating member <b>103</b>. Although the first rotating member <b>103</b> generates dust due to abrasion when transmitting power, the lubricating member <b>104</b> may have a cleaning action for adsorbing dust through the contact between the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the lubricating member <b>104</b>. Since the dust from the first rotating member <b>103</b> is adsorbed on the lubricating member <b>104</b>, the lubricating member <b>104</b> can reduce the abrasion of the first rotating member <b>103</b>, and enables the first rotating member <b>103</b> to efficiently rotate. Further, the maintenance cycle of the transmission mechanism <b>101</b> can be extended, and the life of the transmission mechanism <b>101</b> can be extended. Further, as described above, the lubricant circulates inside the lubricating member <b>104</b>, whereby the cleaning action on dust in the lubricating member <b>104</b> can be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The lubricating member <b>104</b> may adsorb dust having small particle sizes according to the distance from a portion thereof in contact with the first rotating member <b>103</b>. The lubricating member <b>104</b> may have a pre-filtration function of adsorbing dust having a large particle size at a portion close to the portion in contact with the first rotating member <b>103</b>, and adsorbing dust whose particle size gradually decreases as the distance from the portion in contact with the first rotating member <b>103</b> increases. For example, the lubricating member <b>104</b> includes a porous material impregnated with lubricant, and may be configured so that the sizes of pores of the porous material are coarse at a portion close to the portion in contact with the first rotating member <b>103</b>, and gradually decrease as the distance from the portion in contact with the first rotating member <b>103</b> increases.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">At least one groove may be provided at the portion of the lubricating member <b>104</b> that is in contact with the first rotating member <b>103</b>. While the first rotating member <b>103</b> rotates about the first rotating member axis <b>107</b> with respect to the lubricating member <b>104</b> by the groove, the lubricating member <b>104</b> can change the preload to be applied to a part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> based on the elastic force thereof, and accumulate dust in the groove, so that the groove can enhance the cleaning action on the dust in the lubricating member <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The lubricating member <b>104</b> may be detachable from the housing <b>102</b>. The contact of the lubricating member <b>104</b> with the first rotating member <b>103</b> reduces the lubricant in the lubricating member <b>104</b>. However, the lubricating member <b>104</b> can be detached from the housing <b>102</b>, replenished with lubricant, and then accommodated in the housing <b>102</b>, or can be replaced by a new lubricating member <b>104</b> to be accommodated in the housing <b>102</b>. Further, the lubricating member <b>104</b> is clogged due to adsorbing dust from the first rotating member <b>103</b>. However, the lubricating member <b>104</b> can be detached from the housing <b>102</b>, washed, and then accommodated in the housing <b>102</b> again, or can be replaced by a new lubricating member <b>104</b> to be accommodated in the housing <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the lubricating member <b>104</b> may have various shapes according to the magnitude of a preload, a direction in which the preload is applied, the size of a space in which the lubricating member <b>104</b> is arranged, the property of a material to be used for the lubricating member <b>104</b>, the amount of heat to be absorbed from the first rotating member <b>103</b>, the size and/or amount of dust from the first rotating member <b>103</b>, and the like. For example, the lubricating member <b>104</b> may have a substantially U-shaped cross-section as shown in (a) when the lubricating member <b>104</b> is deformed by a minute preload, may have a shape in which a reinforcing portion having a substantially U-shaped cross-section is added as shown in (b) as the preload increases, or may be an integrated type having a substantially rectangular cross-section as shown in (c). The lubricating member <b>104</b> included in the transmission mechanism <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>11</b></figref> is an integrated type having a substantially rectangular cross-section as shown in (c). Further, the lubricating member <b>104</b> may be an axial flow type as shown in (d) when the lubricating member <b>104</b> is stable because the load change caused by the displacement in the axial direction is little, and a valley serving as a pool of lubricant is provided at a portion to be in contact with the first rotating member <b>103</b>, or may be a depth-pleated type (radial flow type) as shown in (e) when the lubricating member <b>104</b> is shaped such that dust is easily adsorbed by the flow in the rotation direction of the first rotating member <b>103</b>. Further, the lubricating member <b>104</b> may be a multilayered type as shown in (f) when dust having large particle sizes is adsorbed at a portion close to the portion in contact with the first rotating member <b>103</b>, and dust having small particle sizes are adsorbed at a portion far from the portion in contact with the first rotating member <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The transmission mechanism <b>101</b> further includes a second rotating member <b>105</b> rotatable about a second rotating member axis <b>108</b>. Through the contact between the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the second rotating member <b>105</b>, the rotation of one of the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the second rotating member <b>105</b> enables the rotation of the other of the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the second rotating member <b>105</b>. For example, when the second rotating member <b>105</b> is rotated as an input shaft, the contact between the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the second rotating member <b>105</b> causes the first rotating member <b>103</b> as an output shaft to rotate. Further, when the first rotating member <b>103</b> is rotated as an input shaft, the contact between the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the second rotating member <b>105</b> causes the second rotating member <b>105</b> as an output shaft to rotate. In order to lubricate the contact portions between the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the second rotating member <b>105</b> with lubricant during the rotation of the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the second rotating member <b>105</b>, when a part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> is not in contact with the second rotating member <b>105</b>, the lubricating member <b>104</b> comes into contact with the part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> while applying a preload the part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> based on an elastic force, whereby the lubricating member <b>104</b> coats the lubricant on the part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> to lubricate the part of the first rotating member <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> which has been lubricated with the lubricant while the part of the first rotating member <b>103</b> is not in contact with the second rotating member <b>105</b> comes in contact with the second rotating member <b>105</b> due to the rotation of the first rotating member <b>103</b> about the first rotating member axis <b>107</b>, the contact portions of the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the second rotating member <b>105</b> can be lubricated with lubricant, so that it is possible to suppress the abrasion caused by the contact between the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the second rotating member <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The second rotating member <b>105</b> generates heat due to its rotation for transmitting power, and the generated heat is transferred to the second rotating member <b>105</b> by the contact between the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the second rotating member <b>105</b>. The lubricating member <b>104</b> may have a cooling action of absorbing the transferred heat by its contact with the first rotating member <b>103</b> and transferring the absorbed heat to the housing <b>102</b>. Since the heat generated by the second rotating member <b>105</b> is dissipated to the outside of the transmission mechanism <b>101</b> via the first rotating member <b>103</b>, the lubricating member <b>104</b>, and the housing <b>102</b>, the lubricating member <b>104</b> can reduce the temperatures of the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the second rotating member <b>105</b>, and enables the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the second rotating member <b>105</b> to rotate efficiently. Further, as described above, the lubricant circulates inside the lubricating member <b>104</b>, which makes it possible to enhance the cooling action of the lubricating member <b>104</b> on the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the second rotating member <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The lubricating member <b>104</b> may have a cleaning action in which dust adhering to the first rotating member <b>103</b> due to the abrasion caused by the contact between the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the second rotating member <b>105</b> is adsorbed by its contact with the first rotating member <b>103</b>. Since the dust caused by the contact between the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the second rotating member <b>105</b> is adsorbed by the lubricating member <b>104</b>, the lubricating member <b>104</b> can suppress the abrasion of the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the second rotating member <b>105</b>, and enables the first rotating member <b>103</b> and the second rotating member <b>105</b> to rotate efficiently. In addition, the lubricating member <b>104</b> can extend the maintenance cycle of the transmission mechanism <b>101</b>, and also extend the life of the transmission mechanism <b>101</b>. Further, as described above, the lubricant circulates inside the lubricating member <b>104</b>, so that the cleaning action on dust in the lubricating member <b>104</b> can be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The first rotating member <b>103</b> may include a plurality of bearings <b>106</b> along the direction of rotation thereof, and the second rotating member <b>105</b> may have a shape that can engage with the plurality of bearings <b>106</b>. The first rotating member <b>103</b> may include a gear having a tooth portion along the direction of rotation thereof, and the second rotating member <b>105</b> may have a shape that can engage with the tooth portion. During the rotation of the first rotating member <b>103</b> about the first rotating member axis <b>107</b> with respect to the lubricating member <b>104</b>, some of the plurality of bearings <b>106</b> are in contact with the second rotating member <b>105</b>, whereas the bearings <b>106</b> that are not in contact with the second rotating member <b>105</b> passes across the lubricating member <b>104</b>.

By increasing the number of bearings passing across the lubricating member <b>104</b> among the bearings which are not in contact with the second rotating member <b>105</b>, the lubricating member <b>104</b> can more efficiently coat the lubricant on the outer surfaces of the bearings <b>106</b>, and lubricate the bearings <b>106</b> with the lubricant.
