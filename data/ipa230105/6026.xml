In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide an understanding of various embodiments of the inventive subject matter. It will be evident, however, to those skilled in the art, that embodiments of the inventive subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In general, well-known instruction instances, protocols, structures, and techniques are not necessarily shown in detail.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a cross section of a liquid crystal display <b>100</b> according to an embodiment. The liquid crystal display <b>100</b> comprises a first layer <b>110</b> comprising an array substrate (including thin film transistors (TFTs) not shown); a second layer <b>120</b> of liquid crystal cells having a sealant <b>140</b> at an edge of the second layer <b>120</b>; a third layer of color filters comprising sets <b>180</b> of filters (e.g., red, green and blue) with first non-emitting spaces <b>190</b> between each set <b>180</b>. An edge of the third layer has a second non-emitting space <b>130</b> having a length L<b>1</b> less than a length L<b>2</b> of one of the first non-emitting spaces <b>190</b>. In an embodiment, the first and second non-emitting spaces <b>190</b> and <b>130</b> comprise black matrix. The sealant <b>140</b> and the second non-emitting space <b>130</b> have an approximate equal length (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%). In another embodiment, the sealant length is larger than L<b>1</b>. At a maximum, sealant length would be &#xbd; of L<b>2</b>. Note for ease of description, other elements of the LCD <b>100</b> known to one of ordinary skill in art, e.g., a polarizer, films, cover glass, etc. are not shown or described.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment the second non-emitting space <b>130</b> has a length L<b>1</b> of approximately (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) half of a length L<b>2</b> of one of the first non-emitting spaces <b>190</b>. In an embodiment, L<b>1</b> and be approximately 50-400 um and L<b>2</b> approximately 100-800 um. For example, for a 4 K <b>150</b>&#x2033;, the pixel pitch is 0.837 mm (837 um). L<b>1</b> can be 200 um, L<b>2</b> can be 400 um; or with larger emitting area L<b>1</b>:100 um, L<b>2</b> 200 um. For a 4 K <b>100</b>&#x2033;, the pixel pitch is 0.558 mm (558 um), L<b>1</b> can be 150 um, L<b>2</b> can be 300 um. In an embodiment, the emitting area is at least about 25% in a pixel, for example, 50%.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The LCD <b>100</b> also comprises a though hole conductive via <b>150</b> in the first layer <b>110</b> electrically connected to LCD driver circuitry <b>170</b> on a first surface of the first layer <b>110</b> and the thin film transistors on a second surface of the first layer <b>110</b>. The LCD driver circuitry <b>170</b> can be connected to the via <b>150</b> via an interconnect <b>160</b> also mounted on the first surface of the first layer <b>110</b> or located elsewhere and connect to the via <b>150</b> by flexible cable.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The via <b>150</b> can be conductor-filled or metal coated on an inside surface and bring the circuit connection to the back (first surface) of the array substrate <b>110</b>. A filler in the via <b>150</b> can be metal, Ag-epoxy or other electrical conducting materials. The via <b>150</b> can be made by laser drilling, wet or dry etching, or combination. The via may be located underneath first and/or second non-emitting spaces <b>190</b> and <b>130</b> so as to not block light at sets <b>180</b>. Note that while a single via <b>150</b> is illustrated, the LCD <b>100</b> may have multiple vias (e.g., one via per pixel). The via can be filled by dispensing, printing, electro-plating, vapor deposition, photolithography, direct writing and spraying of filler materials.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Interconnection circuitry <b>160</b> can be made by photolithography like semiconductor IC process or printed circuit board process. For example, the interconnect can be made by dispensing, printing, electro-plating, vapor deposition, photolithography, direct writing and masked spraying of conductive materials. Electronic components can be bonded to the printed circuit glass. Sealant structure <b>140</b> can be made by dispensing, screen printing, silk printing, photolithographic printing, etc. The Array substrate <b>110</b> can be glass, polymer, ceramic, silicon, etc.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an embodiment, each display <b>100</b> of a video wall (multi-panel display) can have a number of pixels needed to achieve final 4 k resolution over an entire video wall comprising a plurality of displays <b>100</b>. If the module <b>100</b> has a very high pixel resolution, the non-emitting space <b>190</b> is very small. For example a <b>55</b>&#x2033; 2 K LCD module the non-emitting space <b>190</b> between pixel is only about 100 um (pixel pitch is about 600 um). In an embodiment, a module with the final display resolution, say 4 k <b>165</b>&#x2033; (equivalent to 3&#xd7;3 LCD wall using <b>55</b>&#x2033; module), the pixel pitch of each module <b>100</b> need only be 900 um.
