No. 8,959,035, issued Feb. 17, 2015, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety and for all purposes.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application generally relates to rapidly and efficiently checking job applicant qualifications. More specifically, the present disclosure describes computerized systems, methods and apparatuses for automatically determining the suitability of an applicant for a particular position, which can then be used to decide whether and/or what additional resources should be devoted to assessing the applicant at a next level.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Checking a job or contractor applicant background is a common screening process. For many fields the type of information required to evaluate a candidate is well known and easy to establish. For example, qualifications for professional jobs are typically determined based on the candidate's education, previous employers, and areas of expertise. These qualifications are generally presented in a resume format. For accountants, attorneys, finance, marketing and other management professionals, this information has proven adequate to provide a fair indication of a professional's qualifications and possession of the required skills.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In many other industries, such as service based jobs, identifying and gathering relevant and credible information to establish an applicant's qualifications is difficult. This is particularly true where individuals work in small businesses, remote locations or in private homes. These work environments limit the available information about potential applicants. The ability to get reliable information about a candidate is especially problematic where a job does not have established educational programs, training or accreditation that can be used to demonstrate an applicant's job proficiency. This is typically true for many in-home service jobs, such as housekeepers and nannies, or other service industry workers, such as waiters and servers.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, the transition time from one job to the next tends to be fairly quick for service types jobs. When management professionals change jobs the process of job searching and interviewing often spans a number of weeks or months. This typically provides ample time to confirm the applicant's credentials and check the applicant's references. Basic service jobs, however, may have transitions where applicants change positions in a matter of few days. This presents a challenge to try and identify qualified applicants quickly because the best applicants may find a new assignment in a matter of days.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An innovative method of screening and processing an applicant's information is presented to solve the issue of the need for speed and a lack of standardized information sources. The disclosed system and methods are applicable to most service industries, such as, for example, hospitality, food and beverage service, personal care, housekeeping, childcare, eldercare, lawn and home maintenance and construction.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The disclosed systems and methods rely on criteria for which accurate information is readily available and creates fairly good initial insight without delaying the whole process. The information used for an initial rapid analysis is not seeking to determine the ultimate fit such that it completely excludes false positives and false negatives. Rather limiting the number false positives and false negatives provides efficiency by limiting the broader group of applicants considered by the system.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A computer system and method for efficiently gathering and reviewing applicant information for making employment decisions is provided to solve the many challenges of vetting service job employment applicants. A user interface is provided for collecting applicant background information from an applicant. In two particularly advantageous embodiments the user interface is provided via a Web server or a mobile app. A processing system receives the applicant background information (such as, skills, identification information, availability, references and experience). The processing system analyzes the received skills and experience information to perform a first test of suitability for the applicant. If the applicant receives a passing score on the first test of suitability, the processing system transmitting background check requests, via a network interface, based on the identification information. In a further embodiment, the applicant can be asked to pay for the cost of background checks if he or she receives an intermediate score on the first suitability test. The background check requests could include one or more of the following: Social Security validity check; credit report; drivers license check; driving record check; or criminal background check. The processing system receives the background check results for the applicant and analyzes the results to perform a second test of suitability for the applicant. If the applicant receives a passing score on the second test or a combined first and second test, suitability the applicant is presented an interview scheduling screen via the user interface.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The applicant can use the user interface to transmit a requested interview time, which is received and a confirmation is provided. In a particularly advantageous embodiment, a video chat can be initiated to conduct the applicant interview or reference interviews. In a further embodiment the interview with the applicant is rescheduled if a reference check is not conducted prior to the scheduled time of the applicant interview.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an exemplary overview of employment service system.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an exemplary overview process for applicant screening.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an exemplary interface for gathering applicant information.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>shows an exemplary process for making a rapid applicant evaluation.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>shows an alternative exemplary process for making a rapid applicant evaluation.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a computer systemization in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present disclosure describes a number of techniques and systems that develop information sufficient to rapidly evaluate the prospects for a job applicant. The present disclosure further describes computerized systems and methods for automatically evaluating the information developed about the applicant to decide whether and/or what resources to devote to pursuing a given applicant. These systems can be advantageously used to give applicants using on-line work applications rapid, or even instantaneous, assessment regarding how they stand in view of the screening service's applicant screening criteria, while maintaining a thorough and rigorous applicant evaluation process.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A first level of screening allows the job screening service to better allocate resources among potential candidates. In this way, costly and time-consuming resources, such as background checks and personal interviews, can be allocated to better candidates, or not wasted on poor candidates. In one advantageous embodiment, applicants receiving an intermediate rating after the initial screening are given the option to pay the costs of background checks performed in the secondary screening. Thus, the costs of the screening process are allocated more efficiently among the parties.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">This first level screening has the further advantage that high-ranking candidates can be given rapid feedback or fast-tracked. This encourages good candidates to stay with the process and increases the likelihood they will be retained. Thus, good candidates are promptly booked for secondary screening and placement. By getting the process to work faster it is less likely good candidates will find or even seek other employment before the screening service has processed them.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">This provides an advantageous solution to a difficult problem that faces employment services. On the one hand, it is advisable to be thorough when performing background checks and candidates detailed evaluations to make sure candidates are credibly qualified. But this takes time, on the other hand, the best candidates tend to find employment quickly and are likely to find jobs before a thorough check is completed through traditional processes. Thus, there is a natural tension between thoroughly and credibly vetting candidates and moving quickly to hire the best possible candidates.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The disclosed rapid screening procedure provides for a process that is both thorough and rapid. Properly performed, the first level of screening allows a relatively high confidence determination of a candidate's future fit or value after a full screening. Accordingly, candidates passing the first screening can be scheduled for personal interviews at this stage, while the further screening, such as reference checking, is completed. This shortens the amount of time required to process an applicant because the interview can be scheduled and conducted, while other checks are performed. Furthermore, by ordering more expensive background checks only after passing the first round of screening, resources are not expended on applicants with a low likelihood of successfully completing the screening process.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">There are generally six types of relevant information about applicants for service jobs: background, skills, experience, current situation, future desires/expectations and personality. Since service job workers often do not have college degrees or certifications, education is not typically a corner stone of the analysis. Education can be included in the future as more candidates have some sort of formal training, certification or education. If none of these six types of information are checked prior to an in person/video interview, significant amounts of time and other resources will be wasted on many applicants that do not have the qualifications required to be a good fit for a job. This is particularly true if one is applying high standards and only seeking the best candidates. However, if all six of these categories are thoroughly checked, it may take too much time to decide whether to ask a candidate for an in-person interview. This delay can cause good candidates to move on to other jobs. Accordingly, it is advantageous to quickly collect available and key information to evaluate first.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The disclosed approach enables the selection of candidates for in-person/video interviews based on rapidly available, accurate, granular information so that fewer of selected candidates are likely to be unsuitable upon final review.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an employment or job service system <b>100</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present system. The employment or job service system <b>100</b> is a processor based computerized environment for practicing the presently disclosed methods.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Advantageously, the employment or job service system is embodied on one or more server computers in a networked environment. As one skilled in the art would recognize, the various processes performed by the employment service system <b>100</b> could be distributed over a number of different connected processors or computers without departing from the teachings of the disclosed system. In particular, the arrows connecting various elements of the employment service system <b>100</b> disclose general information flow rather than specific hardware or network architectures.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Communications interface <b>101</b> receives information from applicant <b>500</b>. This information can preferably include, a request from the applicant to be considered for work or employment, and the information required to perform the candidate suitability analysis (discussed more fully below). Preferably, this aspect of the communications interface <b>101</b> is embodied by a web server that displays a web interface for accepting and receiving information from the applicant. Alternately, this aspect of the communications interface could be performed by a network connected application or App (such as, mobile application for iOS, Android, or Windows Phone). As a further alternative, the communications interface could be embodied by a user interface on a computer at an employment service. In this embodiment, the applicant physically travels to the computer to input the requested information or an employee of the employment service inputs the information directly into the system. Persons of skill in the art will readily recognize other possible input interfaces and apparatuses can be employed as necessary.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The communications interface <b>101</b> optionally performs an additional function of transferring information between the candidate acquisition system <b>120</b> and placement or Job system <b>700</b>. Placement system <b>700</b> represents the portion of the employment service that lists service employees or contractors for employment <b>720</b> and books <b>710</b> them once they are accepted by the candidate acquisition system. The placement system may perform other functions <b>750</b>. The detailed operation of placement system <b>700</b> is not relevant here and will not be described; advantageous embodiments of possible placement systems are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,301,478, U.S. patent applications 20070220123 and 20110202551 by the present inventor, which are hereby incorporated by reference. The communication interface <b>101</b> can pass relevant information from the placement system <b>700</b> to the candidate acquisition system <b>120</b>, such as number of open jobs and current skill levels of similar service professionals. Feedback from the placement system can also result in an increase of the ranking multipliers for certain skill bases that are in need in the placement system, thereby would improving the candidate acquisition system. For example, the placement system may indicate that waiters skilled in wine knowledge are in short supply. In response, the acquisition system could increase the weight in the primary screening criteria for wine knowledge and, thereby, allowing more of wine skilled waiter to be passed to secondary screening.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The candidate acquisition system <b>120</b> performs the functions of candidate evaluation in accordance with the present disclosure. Candidate evaluation is split into at least two screening processes primary screening <b>200</b> and secondary screening <b>300</b>. If a candidate passes primary screening <b>200</b>, secondary screening <b>300</b> is conducted. The secondary screening may include initiating more costly and time-consuming background checks, such as driving records searches and personal reference checking. The secondary screening may also include an interview of the applicant, which could take place in person, over the phone. These other potential lines of communication used during the secondary screening are reflected by the dotted line.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one advantageous embodiment, the applicant is directly connected, via a video chat interface, such as Skype, with a representative of the employment service system for a secondary screening interview if the primary screening is passed. For example, an applicant conducting the application process via a web browser could be immediately informed that they have passed primary screening and then be connected to a video chat within their web browser for a personal interview. Alternately, a video interview could be scheduled for a time at the candidate's convenience. In a further embodiment of this invention, the on-line or in person interview such conducted is available for review by those seeking candidates in the future in the form of video files.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an exemplary flow diagram for a method of performing the disclosed screening system. The process begins with the receipt of information from the applicant at step <b>200</b>. As discussed above, this information is preferably acquired via a web interface. This will allow the applicant to provide the information used by the system to evaluate the applicant, for example, name, social security number, work history, proof that the applicant is legal to work, skills, experience, future goals, current work situation, references (personal and employment), and personality profile. The required information can of course be tailored to the specific needs of the job in question or selected by applicant or the characteristics important to the screening service operator.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The next step in the process is to determine rapid criteria <b>210</b>. In one embodiment, the information provided by the applicant in step <b>200</b> is evaluated to determine what information provided by the applicant can be rapidly checked. A further determination is made whether there is sufficient information to make a rapid evaluation of the applicant. This occurs because different applicants might have different information available and strictly requiring certain information might not always be suitable. Accordingly, a test is conducted to determine whether the applicant has provided enough information to make a rapid evaluation. If enough information is not available, a notice is provided. An exemplary method for performing this test is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a</i></figref>. Applicant information is received; applicant information that can be checked in less than a predetermined rapid response time is identified; and a determination is made whether there is enough information to perform rapid screening. If there is enough information to perform a rapid screening it is performed, otherwise the applicant is notified that rapid screening is not available and, optionally, given an estimate of when primary screening will be complete.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Alternately, the information from the applicant can be evaluated to determine when a first check will be completed. This is done, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>, by looking at all the information that can be checked immediately. If there is sufficient information to make a determination of suitability then the process proceeds to the screening of rapid criteria. If the there is not sufficient information to make an immediate decision, the other information provided by the applicant is considered based on the length of time required to evaluate each item. To do so, the remaining non-immediately verifiable information is ordered from the quickest to check to longest to check. A determination is then made as to how much additional information is required to perform the rapid screening by going down the list starting at the quickest information to check. Once the information required to perform a primary screening has been determined, the time required to check the applicant can be determined.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">While the determination of rapid criteria <b>210</b> allows some flexibility to the process, this step is optional. In a preferred embodiment this step can be skipped and the rapid criteria screening <b>220</b> can be directly preformed with the information provided by the applicant in step <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The screen rapid criteria step <b>220</b> takes the information provided by the applicant that can be rapidly evaluated and creates an applicant score based on that information. For example, in one embodiment, the applicant is asked through a web interface for information pertaining to the position they are seeking. This information includes particular job tasks and skills. Points are awarded to the applicant based on the tasks they perform and skills they posses. Points may further be awarded based on the applicant's proficiency in each skill and sub-skill. Points may also be awarded from background information, such as the applicant's location, willingness to travel, or pay rate.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">It has been recognized that an applicant's driving record, criminal record and credit history are good predictors for overall job responsibility and performance, i.e., better credit evidences general responsibility and attention to detail in a work environment. Accordingly, applicant points can be awarded based on an applicant's credit report, when permitted under local law. It has further been recognized that information about the quality of an applicant can be gleaned from the way that they fill out the application forms (meta analysis). For example, applicants that fill out the required forms quickly and accurately are more likely to be good job candidate than those that are slow to fill out the forms and that make mistakes. Points can be awarded or subtracted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The points calculated for candidates can be totaled into one omnibus score for evaluation. Using one omnibus score allows a broad diversity of information to accumulate to the applicants benefit. For example, a very capable and responsible candidate can still be identified as valuable in an omnibus scoring system even if they are not highly proficient in a large number of job skills. This, for example, might be the case with a smart inexperienced applicant just starting out who scores very well on many areas but has not yet developed an extensive skill set.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Alternatively, the points can be segregated by category, e.g., skills, background and/or meta analysis. Splitting the points categorically has the advantage of being able to maintain a minimum proficiency for certain categories. In this way, an applicant can fail the rapid criteria screening if the applicant does not pass each or any one of the categories. This can be used to ensure that minimum standards are met for one or more categories, such as driving skills for Nannies, if they were to drive children.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In either of these regimes, or a combination of the two, certain applicant information can be absolutely required (e.g., being legal to work in the U.S. and/or living in the local area) or automatically result in a denial (e.g., sex offender in a childcare job).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the screening of rapid criteria can proceed in a loop with the receipt of the applicant's information. This demonstrates that the processes of receiving applicant information and screening rapid criteria need not occur serially such that all the information is received before the screening occurs. The calculation of the applicant's rapid screening score can occur simultaneously with the receipt of information.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">After the information from the applicant that was suitable for rapid screening has been tallied, the score achieved by the applicant is evaluated <b>240</b>. As shown, the evaluate score <b>240</b> step can be implemented as a pass-fail test. In this embodiment, if the applicant's rapid screening score does not meet the employment service's standards then the applicant is notified that he or she has been rejected <b>290</b>, and may apply if the situation changes. If the applicant's rapid screening score meets the standards the process proceeds to scheduling time-consuming screening <b>250</b>. In one embodiment, the rapid screening and scheduling of an interview is done in less than 24 hours. The particular scores that define pass or fail can be varied and set according to the standards and needs of the employment screening service. For example, depending on their target clientele some employment services might accept less experienced applicants than others. Or, even if two employment services had similar ultimate employment criteria, a particular employment service might be more or less willing to invest secondary screenings and could adjust it score evaluations accordingly. Moreover, the evaluation could be automatically adjusted based on feedback from the placement system <b>700</b>. For example, if the placement system has too many or two few service providers with particular skill sets, that information can be reported to the candidate acquisition system and the score evaluation could be moved up or down, accordingly.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In a preferred embodiment, the evaluate score step can have additional options beyond pass-fail. A middle level evaluation between pass and fail could be advantageously established to accommodate candidates who do not meet sufficient criteria to be a pure pass, but are not clear fail.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The middle level can be used advantageously in a number of ways. For example, applicants falling in the middle category could be asked to pay some or all of the expense of the secondary screening. Avoiding the cost of background checks (e.g., credit, driving, criminal) for too many applicants is a significant advantage of the rapid screening process for the employment service. However, otherwise suitable candidates might be cut out of the secondary screening based on cost considerations. These candidates could be given the opportunity to pay for these secondary screenings to have their full application considered. The middle level of evaluation could also be used to hold candidates for later&#x201d; evaluation. For example, if the pressure is to evaluate the best candidates as rapidly as possible, middle scoring applicants can be put into a queue to await evaluation on a somewhat longer schedule. The method could advantageously be used to ensure a steady supply of applicants, while moving the best candidates to the front of the evaluation. The middle level could, optionally, be reviewed by a person to make an evaluation whether to pass the applicant to the next level.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">For applicants that make it though the evaluation of the rapid screening the more time consuming and expensive applicant screening procedures are conducted. This includes ordering expensive or time-consuming background checks, interviewing the applicant's references, and scheduling an in-person interview <b>250</b>. If the in person interview is going to be conducted in the future, the applicant can preferably be provided with a calendar interface showing available interview slots. Alternately, a video chat interview can be immediately conducted.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Once the time-consuming screening <b>260</b> is completed, a final evaluation <b>270</b> can occur. The calculation of the final criteria can include all of the information from the prior rapid screening and the secondary screening. Or, the final evaluation can be just based on the second round of information. Or, the final evaluation can consist of a combination of some but not all of the two data sets. After the final evaluation the applicant is either notified of a rejection <b>290</b> or, if accepted, the applicant's information is passed to the placement system <b>280</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an exemplary interface embodiment for collecting information about an applicant through a web interface. In accordance with the practice of persons of skill in the art, a user interface can be developed and tailored to the particular types of information to be collected. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, text blocks are provided to collect information such as name <b>310</b>, locations <b>320</b>, or other information <b>330</b> or other information that is not suitable for use with pre-defined choices. Pull-downs can be used for items that are suitable to description using pre-defined choices, such as the job positions <b>340</b> that can be applied for by the applicant. Check boxes <b>350</b> can be employed for information, like skills, where there are a limited number of choices and an applicant may select multiple choices. Radio buttons <b>360</b> can similarly be used to where there are multiple limited choices and only one can be selected at a time, such as with years of experience.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In another embodiment of the interface, an applicant is allowed to apply for multiple positions or job types, for example a waiter and server, or nanny and housekeeper. Based on the multiple positions selected, appropriate skills (or sub-skills) choices are dynamically presented by the applicant interface for completion. These can be individually evaluated and/or in combination such that extra credit is provided to applicants skilled for multiple positions.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In a presently preferred embodiment, an applicant score is developed (Score A) based on (i) the hours they work (number of hours and/or whether they are available in high demand times), (ii) their flexibility to work outside their preferred hours, (iii) their location, (iv) their experience, and (v) their expected compensation.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A second score (Score B) is developed based on their work skills. For example, applicants applying for a housekeeper job would be asked to state their proficiency with respect to a number of relevant tasks such as ironing, cooking, childcare, driving, cleaning, organization, and maintaining silverware. It is recognized that it is advantageous to identify and inquire about many job tasks to get a substantial idea of the applicant's background. The particular areas of inquiry would be tailored to the job at issue, such that a personal assistant, nanny, chef, organizer and elder care applicant would get questions about tasks tailored to their job responsibilities.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Splitting the information considered in Score A and Score B as disclosed above has at least two notable advantages. One, it allows the determination of whether the candidate meets minimum requirements in two areas (i) general background and availability and (ii) job level skills. This allows the system to weed out applicants that have a low level of job skills (i.e., fail Score B) and/or applicants that have good skills but that are not flexible in their hours or that live too far away.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The particular weight of points for each item of information requested to develop Score A and Score B can be set and normalized by users of the employment system to suit their own expectations about applicants and the market they serve. In a preferred embodiment if the applicant meets minimum scores for both Score A and Score B, the applicant is passed on to the next stage of consideration. Notably, the information evaluated to develop Score A and Score B does not require the expenditure of any significant resources by the employment system. Thus, the Score A and Score B evaluation for the basis of a reasonable determination of whether to expend further resources evaluating the applicant.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">If an applicant has passing scores for Score A and Score B, another score (Score C) is developed based upon information that requires confirmation from outside sources and/or has an associated cost. For example, Score C is preferably developed based on the applicant's credit check, criminal background, social security check, reference check, and driving record check. These background checks are automatically requested electronically and received by the candidate acquisition system via the communications interface. Any of the Score C check results that can be delivered instantaneously, or prior to a predetermined deadline, can be used&#x2014;along with Score A and Score B&#x2014;to decide whether to offer the applicant an interview. If the applicant passes the evaluation of Score A, Score B and available Score C data, he or she is offered an interview in-person or via a video chat such as Skype. In a preferred method, the interview schedule is offered while the rapidly qualified applicant is still connected with the communication interface a one-step end-to-end experience.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The system can also automatically initiate the process of checking the applicant's references. During the information gathering process the applicant will be asked to provide personal and employment references. That information will be used by the system to send a text and/or email requesting the reference to select a suitable time to discuss the applicant, which could be supplied by return text or email. The text or email could also provide a link to website where the reference could see a calendar to schedule the discussion. The reference check is conducted at the appointed time by phone, video chat, or other communication channels known in the art.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a preferred embodiment, the timing of at least one of the reference checks occurs prior to the applicant interview. This can be accomplished in one of two ways. First, the reference check scheduling process can occur before the applicant is given an opportunity to select a time after reference check meeting. Preferably, the applicant is offered times after a suitable time has elapsed after the scheduled reference check meeting, such as if the reference check is scheduled for next Tuesday at 9 AM, the candidate is offered times starting with next Tuesday at 11 AM (two hours). Alternately, the applicant can be permitted to select a preferred interview schedule time prior to confirming the reference check meeting. But then the applicant can be asked to choose another interview time if the reference check meeting is later scheduled after the applicant's selected time.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In another embodiment, there could be primary, secondary and tertiary screening. For example, the application questions and information, as filled in by the applicant in the communication interface is scored to decide to a) offer free background check b) offer background check paid by the applicant or c) not to offer the background check and reject the application. This primary screening is followed by instantaneously sending the background check request for key elements of the background check and evaluating those that are immediately available. Based on the combination of the application and rapidly available background check information, one could offer the time consuming in-person or video interview and schedule this ahead of time, prior to other details of the applicant are fully available.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this process the screening is broken down into three stages. The first stage is based on the application alone, e.g., the skills, job, location and availability identified and meta-analysis. If the first stage is passed the background check of quickly available information is performed, e.g., credit report, social security, etc. If this second stage is passed. The applicant is offered an opportunity to schedule an interview. Prior to time of the scheduled interview a third stage screening is performed and the applicant's references are checked. If the reference check is satisfactory the applicant's interview is confirmed, otherwise the interview is canceled.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">A particularly advantageous embodiment of the present invention is obtained by using an employment service controller to embody the various features described above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates inventive aspects of an employment service controller <b>701</b> in a block diagram.

Automobile operation interface elements such as steering wheels, gearshifts, and speedometers facilitate the access, operation, and display of automobile resources, functionality, and status. Computer interaction interface elements such as check boxes, cursors, menus, scrollers, and windows (collectively and commonly referred to as widgets) similarly facilitate the access, operation, and display of data and computer hardware and operating system resources, functionality, and status. Operation interfaces are commonly called user interfaces. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as the Apple Macintosh Operating System's Aqua, iOS, Microsoft's Windows 8, or Unix's X-Windows provide a baseline and means of accessing and displaying information graphically to users.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">A user interface module <b>717</b> is stored program code that is executed by the CPU.

The user interface may allow for the display, execution, interaction, manipulation, and/or operation of program modules and/or system facilities through textual and/or graphical facilities. The user interface provides a facility through which users may affect, interact, and/or operate a computer system. A user interface may communicate to and/or with other modules in a module collection, including itself, and/or facilities of the like.

The Web browser may be a conventional hypertext viewing application such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator. Secure Web browsing may be supplied with 128 bit (or greater) encryption by way of HTTPS, SSL, and/or the like. Some Web browsers allow for the execution of program modules through facilities such as Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, and/or the like. Web browsers and like information access tools may be integrated into smart phones, tablets, PDAs, cellular telephones, and/or other mobile devices. A Web browser may communicate to and/or with other modules in a module collection, including itself, and/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the Web browser communicates with information servers, operating systems, integrated program modules (e.g., plug-ins), and/or the like; e.g., it may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and/or provide program module, system, user, and/or data communications, requests, and/or responses. Of course, in place of a Web browser and information server, a combined application may be developed to perform similar functions of both. The combined application would similarly affect the obtaining and the provision of information to users, user agents, and/or the like from the employment service enabled nodes. The combined application may be nugatory on systems employing standard Web browsers.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Employment Service Controller Module</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The employment service controller module <b>735</b> is stored program code that is executed by the CPU. The employment service controller module affects accessing, obtaining and the provision of employment service, and/or the like across various communications networks.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The employment service controller module enabling access of information between nodes may be developed by employing standard development tools such as, but not limited to: (ANSI) (Objective-) C (++), Apache modules, binary executables, database adapters, Java, JavaScript, mapping tools, procedural and object oriented development tools, PERL, Python, shell scripts, SQL commands, web application server extensions, WebObjects, and/or the like. The employment service controller module may communicate to and/or with other modules in a module collection, including itself, and/or facilities of the like. Most frequently, the employment service controller module communicates with an employment service database containing the data required to be stored by the system, operating systems, other program modules, and/or the like. The employment service controller module may contain, communicate, generate, obtain, and/or provide program module, system, user, and/or data communications, requests, and/or responses.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Distributed Employment Service Controller Module</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The structure and/or operation of any of the employment service controller components may be combined, consolidated, and/or distributed in any number of ways to facilitate development and/or deployment. Similarly, the module collection may be combined in any number of ways to facilitate deployment and/or development. To accomplish this, one may integrate the components into a common code base or in a facility that can dynamically load the components on demand in an integrated fashion.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The module collection may be consolidated and/or distributed in countless variations through standard data processing and/or development techniques. Multiple instances of any one of the program modules in the program module collection may be instantiated on a single node, and/or across numerous nodes to improve performance through load-balancing and/or data-processing techniques. Furthermore, single instances may also be distributed across multiple controllers and/or storage devices; e.g., databases. All program module instances and controllers working in concert may do so through standard data processing communication techniques.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The configuration of the employment service controller will depend on the context of system deployment. Factors such as, but not limited to, the budget, capacity, location, and/or use of the underlying hardware resources may affect deployment requirements and configuration. Regardless of if the configuration results in more consolidated and/or integrated program modules, results in a more distributed series of program modules, and/or results in some combination between a consolidated and distributed configuration, data may be communicated, obtained, and/or provided. Instances of modules consolidated into a common code base from the program module collection may communicate, obtain, and/or provide data. This may be accomplished through intra-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: data referencing (e.g., pointers), internal messaging, object instance variable communication, shared memory space, variable passing, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">If module collection components are discrete, separate, and/or external to one another, then communicating, obtaining, and/or providing data with and/or to other module components may be accomplished through inter-application data processing communication techniques such as, but not limited to: Application Program Interfaces (API) information passage; (distributed) Component Object Model ((D)COM), (Distributed) Object Linking and Embedding ((D)OLE), and/or the like), Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), process pipes, shared files, and/or the like. Messages sent between discrete module components for inter-application communication or within memory spaces of a singular module for intra-application communication may be facilitated through the creation and parsing of a grammar. A grammar may be developed by using standard development tools such as lex, yacc, XML, and/or the like, which allow for grammar generation and parsing functionality, which in turn may form the basis of communication messages within and between modules. Again, the configuration will depend upon the context of system deployment.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The entirety of this disclosure (including the Cover Page, Title, Headings, Field, Background, Summary, Brief Description of the Drawings, Detailed Description, Claims, Abstract, Figures, and otherwise) shows by way of illustration various embodiments in which the claimed inventions may be practiced.
