In one embodiment, this invention relates generally to compounds capable of stimulating or modulating an immune response in a subject. More particularly the invention pertains to novel combinations of antigens with small molecules to be used in vaccine therapies. The compounds in one embodiment can be used as adjuvants for prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines for infectious diseases and cancer. In another embodiment, they can be used as immunotherapeutics for cancer, infectious diseases, allergy/asthma, lung injury, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, fibrosis, retinopathy, neuropathy, neuroinflammatory diseases, acute kidney injury, necrotizing enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel diseases either alone or in combination with existing therapies. In a further embodiment, the invention pertains generally to methods of identifying small molecule immunomodulators, and, more particularly, to assays for detection of immunopotentiator and immunosuppressant by measurement of immunological markers, such as cytokines, chemokines, and/or growth factors.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0004">Without limiting the scope of the invention, its background is described in connection with diseases associated with inflammation and immune modulation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0005">Immunity. When the immune system is challenged by a foreign antigen it responds by launching a protective response. This response is characterized by the coordinated interaction of both the innate and acquired immune systems. These systems, once thought to be separate and independent, are now recognized as two interdependent parts that when integrated fulfil two mutually exclusive requirements: speed (contributed by the innate system) and specificity (contributed by the adaptive system).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0006">The innate immune system serves as the first line of defense against invading pathogens, holding the pathogen in check while the adaptive responses are matured. It is triggered within minutes of infection in an antigen-independent fashion, responding to broadly conserved patterns in the pathogens (though it is not non-specific, and can distinguish between self and pathogens). Crucially, it also generates the inflammatory and co-stimulatory milieu (sometimes referred to as the danger signal) that potentiates the adaptive immune system and steers (or polarizes it) towards the cellular or humoral responses most appropriate for combating the infectious agent (discussed in more detail below).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">The adaptive response becomes effective over days or weeks, but ultimately provides the fine antigenic specificity required for complete elimination of the pathogen and the generation of immunologic memory. It is mediated principally by T and B cells that have undergone germline gene rearrangement and are characterized by an exquisite specificity and long-lasting memory. However, it also involves the recruitment of elements of the innate immune system, including professional phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils etc.) and granulocytes (basophils, eosinophils etc.) that engulf bacteria, viruses and even relatively large protozoal parasites. Once an adaptive immune response has matured, subsequent exposure to the pathogen results in its rapid elimination (usually before symptoms of infection become manifest) because highly specific memory cells have been generated that are rapidly activated upon subsequent exposure to their cognate antigen.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0008">Interdependence of Innate and Adaptive Responses. It is now thought that the earliest events following pathogen invasion are affected by cellular components of the innate immune system. The response is initiated when resident tissue macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) encounter pathogen and become activated by signals generated by interaction between pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) and the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) shared by large groups of microorganisms. The activated macrophages and DCs are stimulated to release various cytokines (including the cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-1&#x3b2;, Il-6, IL-8, MIP-1&#x3b1; and MIP-1&#x3b2;), which constitute the &#x201c;danger signal&#x201d; and triggers an influx of Natural Killer (NK) cells, macrophages, immature dendritic cells into the tissues.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">Loaded with antigen, the activated DCs then migrate to lymph nodes. Once there, they activate immune cells of the adaptive response (principally na&#xef;ve B- and T-cells) by acting as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The activated cells then migrate to the sites of infection (guided by the &#x201c;danger signal&#x201d;) and once there further amplify the response by recruiting cells of the innate immune system (including eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, NK cells and granulocytes). This cellular trafficking is orchestrated by a large array of cytokines (particularly those of the chemokine subgroup) and involves immune cells of many different types and tissue sources (Luster 2002).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0010">Polarization of the Adaptive Immune Response. The adaptive immune response is principally affected via two independent limbs: cell-mediated (type 1) immunity and antibody-mediated or humoral (type 2) immunity.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">Type 1 immunity involves the activation of T-lymphocytes that either act upon infected cells bearing foreign antigens or stimulate other cells to act upon infected cells. This branch of the immune system therefore effectively contains and kills cells that are cancerous or infected with pathogens (particularly viruses). Type 2 immunity involves the generation of antibodies to foreign antigens by B-lymphocytes. This antibody-mediated branch of the immune system attacks and effectively neutralizes extracellular foreign antigens.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0012">Both limbs of the immune system are important in fighting disease and there is an increasing realization that the type of immune response is just as important as its intensity or its duration. Moreover, since the type 1 and type 2 responses are not necessarily mutually exclusive (in many circumstances an effective immune response requires that both occur in parallel), the balance of the type1/type 2 response (also referred to as the Th1:Th2 response ratio/balance by reference to the distinct cytokine and effector cell subsets involved in the regulation of each response-see below) may also play a role in determining the effectiveness (and repercussions) of the immune defense.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0013">In many circumstances the immune response is skewed heavily towards a type 1 or type 2 response soon after exposure to antigen. The mechanism of this type1/type 2 skewing or polarization is not yet fully understood, but is known to involve a complex system of cell-mediated chemical messengers (cytokines, and particularly chemokines) in which the type1/type 2 polarization (or balance) is determined, at least in part, by the nature of the initial PRR-PAMP interaction when the DCs and macrophages of the innate immune system are first stimulated and subsequently by the cytokine milieu in which antigen priming of na&#xef;ve helper T cells occurs.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0014">Two cytokines in particular appear to have early roles in determining the path of the immune response. Interleukin-1 (IL-1), secreted by macrophages, drives the type 1 response by stimulating the differentiation of Th1 cells, the helper cells that oversee the type 1 response. Another macrophage cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10) inhibits this response, instead driving a type 2 response.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0015">The type 1 and type 2 responses can be distinguished inter alia on the basis of certain phenotypic changes attendant on priming and subsequent polarization of na&#xef;ve helper T cells. These phenotypic changes are characterized, at least in part, by the nature of the cytokines secreted by the polarized helper T cells.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0016">Th1 cells produce so-called Th1 cytokines, which include one or more of TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-1, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-12 and/or IL-18. The Th1 cytokines are involved in macrophage activation and Th1 cells orchestrate Type 1 responses. In contrast, Th2 cells produce so-called Th2 cytokines, which include one or more of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13. The Th2 cytokines promote the production of various antibodies and can suppress the type 1 response.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0017">The involvement of Th1 and Th2 cells and cytokines in type 1:type 2 immune response polarization has given rise to the terms Th1 response and Th2 response being used to define the type 1 and type 2 immune responses, respectively. Thus, these terms are used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0018">There is an increasing realization that the type of immune response is just as important in therapy and prophylaxis as its intensity or its duration. For example, an excess Th1 response can result in autoimmune disease, inappropriate inflammatory responses and transplant rejection. An excess Th2 response can lead to allergies and asthma. Moreover, a perturbation in the Th1:Th2 ratio is symptomatic of many immunological diseases and disorders, and the development of methods for altering the Th1:Th2 ratio is now a priority.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0019">Vaccine adjuvants. Immune response to certain antigens that are otherwise weakly antigenic can be enhanced through the use of vaccine adjuvants. Such adjuvants potentiate the immune response to specific antigens and are therefore the subject of considerable interest and study within the medical community.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0020">Research has permitted development of vaccines possessing antigenic epitopes that were previously impossible to produce. For example, currently available vaccine candidates include synthetic peptides mimicking streptococcal, gonococcal, and malarial antigens. These purified antigens are generally weak antigens, however, that require adjuvants in order to evoke protective immunity. However, conventional vaccine adjuvants possess a number of drawbacks that limit their overall use and effectiveness. Again, this is fine for vaccines but no other uses.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0021">Substances that stimulate immune cells in vitro, exhibit similar immunostimulatory effects in vivo. These compounds, such as recombinant cytokines, pathogen products (e.g., toxins, lipids, proteins/peptides, carbohydrates and nucleic acids) and other mammalian-derived immunostimulatory molecules (e.g. heat shock proteins, complement, immune complexes and proteoglycans) all induce a measurable pro-inflammatory response both in vitro and in vivo.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0022">Historically, the classic adjuvants have been Freund's complete or incomplete (i.e., without mycobacteria) adjuvants. Edmund Coley described the potential of Coley's toxin for cancer immuno-therapy. Other materials, such as mineral oil and aluminum hydroxide, have also been used as adjuvants, but they invariably suffer from disadvantages. For example, mineral oil is known to produce tissue irritation and to be potentially oncogenic. Alum, the only approved adjuvant in the United States, can induce granulomas at the inoculation site and does not effectively induce cell-mediated immunity. Moreover, many of the adjuvants currently available have limited utility because they contain components, which are not metabolizable in humans. Additionally, most adjuvants are difficult to prepare in that they may require time consuming procedures and the use, in some cases, of elaborate and expensive equipment to formulate a vaccine and adjuvant system.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0023">Immunological adjuvants are described in &#x201c;Current Status of Immunological Adjuvants&#x201d;, Ann.

The use of immunomodulatory strategies aimed at improving resistance to bacterial infections could be beneficial in a variety of clinical scenarios in which the host is predisposed to infectious complications. Among those are patients with severe burns or major trauma, patients that have undergone major surgical procedures, or patients that have received immunosuppressive therapies for cancer or organ transplantation. The attractiveness of interventions that can improve the host response to infection is further enhanced by the increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance among bacteria, especially those that commonly cause nosocomial infections.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0025">Immunocompromised patients have a higher risk of developing bacterial infections in the central nervous system (CNS)(Safdieh, Mead et al. 2008). The list of the pathogens includes many organisms with low pathogenicity in the immunocompetent host. Moreover, the distribution of the pathogens also differs from the immunocompetent host and depends on the nature of the immune defect. Patients with a decrease in B-lymphocyte function or with a loss of splenic function have an increased risk of meningitis caused by encapsulated bacteria, while patients with an impaired T-lymphocyte-macrophage system are more susceptible to CNS infections caused by intracellular pathogens. One additional cause of this increased susceptibility to CNS infections probably is a decreased local immune defense.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0026">Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS; endotoxin) is a component of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall that has known immunomodulatory properties (Broad, Jones et al. 2006). LPS is recognized by Toll-Like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is expressed on a variety of leukocytes and activates both TRIF- and MyD88-dependent signaling pathways. Activation of TLR4 signaling induces the production of numerous proinflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and nitric oxide that facilitate the cardinal features of inflammation such as increased vascular permeability, edema formation, and leukocyte recruitment. Interestingly, prior exposure to LPS induces a state in which a subsequent challenge with LPS or bacteria results in markedly decreased production of proinflammatory mediators (Cavaillon, Adrie et al. 2003). The altered immunological phenotype that is elicited by priming with LPS has historically been referred to as endotoxin tolerance (Cross 2002). The induction of endotoxin tolerance has been shown to be highly effective in reducing both morbidity and mortality associated with subsequent challenge with a normally lethal dose of LPS (Murphey, Fang et al. 2008). Because LPS priming attenuates proinflammatory cytokine production in response to LPS or bacterial challenge, many investigators previously characterized LPS tolerance as a state of immunosuppression. However, few studies have examined the effects of LPS treatment on the host response to live bacterial infections. Studies have demonstrated that mice primed with LPS have improved resistance to bacterial infections (Wy, Goto et al. 2000, Wynn, Scumpia et al. 2008). However, the clinical applicability of LPS as a therapeutic or prophylactic agent is precluded by toxicity and a narrow therapeutic index in humans.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0027">Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPLA), an endotoxin derivative that is used as a vaccine adjuvant in humans (Thoelen, Van Damme et al. 1998) is a TLR4 agonist. Pretreatment of MPLA prevents hypothermia, improves survival, and improves bacterial clearance in mice with systemic infection (Romero, Varma et al. 2011). The protective effects of MPLA are mediated through TLR4. Post-infection treatment with MPLA enhances bacterial clearance but does not attenuate inflammatory cytokine production or prevent hypothermia.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0028">TLR7/8 agonist as immune stimulant. The transmembrane Toll-like receptors (TLR) have binding domains specific for different microbial and viral components (Takeda, Kaisho et al. 2003). TLR7/8 recognize single-stranded viral RNA (Diebold, Kaisho et al. 2004, Heil, Hemmi et al. 2004). Upon ligation of the receptor-ligand pair, intracellular signaling is initiated and downstream transcription factors activate genes of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1), type I interferons (IFN&#x3b1;) and co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86) (Lore, Betts et al. 2003, Russo, Cornella-Taracido et al. 2011, Desmet and Ishii 2012). The activation of these genes promotes maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), facilitating the presentation of antigen and stimulation of the ensuing adaptive immune response. The exact immune response generated depends upon the precise stimuli and resultant transcriptional and cellular changes. Cell-mediated immunity executed by CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes is enabled through accessory Th1 cells and the cytokines IFN&#x3b1;, IL-2 and IL-12 (Pennock, White et al. 2013). However, if innate, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF&#x3b1; are produced in excess both local and systemic inflammation results. Accordingly, to create a safe adjuvant, that augments the immune response to a given antigen, the proper combination of these signals must be generated.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0029">Several TLR7/8 agonists, including R848 and R837, have been investigated as potential vaccine adjuvants. Some of these agonists have found success as topically administered agents, but demonstrate dose-limiting toxicity when given orally or intravenously before ever reaching efficacious concentrations. This profile renders the current TLR7/8 agonists ineffective as systemic vaccine adjuvants (Pockros, Guyader et al. 2007). These agents were designed to be more potent than CL075 (TLR7/8 agonist) and induce lower inflammatory cytokine levels, thereby overcoming their issues as systemic adjuvants.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0030">Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of respiratory failure that develops in association with a variety of insults including massive hemorrhage, systemic infection, inhalation of noxious agents, bacterial infections, burns and blast trauma and has an overall mortality of 30-40%. It is estimated that 200,000 individuals develop ARDS each year in the United States (Rubenfeld, Caldwell et al. 2005, Villar, Blanco et al. 2016). One of the major complications of trauma-based morbidity in military combat is the development of ARDS, occurring in 8-82% of selected patient populations. These include patients with pulmonary contusions, severe trauma (Injury Severity Score &#x3e;25), head injury, notable blood transfusion requirement, and major orthopedic injuries such as long-bone and pelvic fractures. The presence of ARDS is associated with a significant increase in morbidity, an increased use of hospital resources, and up to a 4.3-fold increase in mortality (Salim, Martin et al. 2006).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0031">To date, there is no specific cure for ARDS. Current therapies only include supportive care, using a mechanical ventilator to support the lung until it fully recovers. Thus, new therapies for this disease are desperately needed.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0032">Another such disease is Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is the most common chronic respiratory disease in infants and is a devastating condition that disrupts the developmental program of the lung secondary to preterm birth. BPD occurs secondary to an interaction between genetic and environmental factors (hyperoxia, invasive mechanical ventilation and sepsis)(Bhandari and Bhandari 2009, Bhandari and Bhandari 2011, Jensen and Schmidt 2014). Although the definition of BPD has evolved over the past decade, it is currently defined as the need for oxygen (02) supplementation for 28 days of life and a &#x201c;physiologic&#x201d; assessment of the supplemental 02 requirement at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (Bhandari and Bhandari 2011, Trembath and Laughon 2012, Bancalari and Claure 2016). It is estimated that 10,000-15,000 new cases of BPD occur each year in the United States, and significantly, 97% of all BPD cases occur in infants with a birth weight less than 1250 grams (Bhandari and Bhandari 2011). Despite many advances in neonatal ventilation techniques, widespread use of surfactant and antenatal corticosteroids, as well as aggressive fluid management, the incidence of BPD has remained the same (Smith, Zupancic et al. 2005) or even increased slightly (Bhandari and Bhandari 2011, Trembath and Laughon 2012). Management of BPD takes a considerable toll on health services. Among preterm infants, the single costliest complication of hospitalization during infancy is BPD, with an average cost per discharge of $116,000 (Russell, Green et al. 2007). Additionally, BPD is associated with significant pulmonary and neurodevelopmental sequelae that continue to have health ramifications into adulthood (Bhandari and Bhandari 2011, Natarajan, Pappas et al. 2012, Bhandari and McGrath-Morrow 2013, Raju, Buist et al. 2017). It is thus important to understand the long-term consequences of BPD, as they are likely to have a significant impact on treatment and cost and application of health care during the lifetime of those born prematurely.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0033">The pathologic hallmarks of BPD include: hyperoxia-induced pulmonary inflammation (Bhandari 2014, Balany and Bhandari 2015, Harijith and Bhandari 2016), increased cell death (Li, Choo-Wing et al. 2011, Choo-Wing R 2013, Sureshbabu, Syed et al. 2015, Sureshbabu, Syed et al. 2016), dysregulated angiogenic factors (Bhandari, Choo-Wing et al. 2008, Sun H 2013, Sun H 2013, Syed, Choo-Wing et al. 2016) culminating in impaired alveolarization and dysregulated vascularization of the lung (Balany and Bhandari 2015). Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and hyperoxia exposure are common antecedents of BPD. The current standard-of-care therapeutic approach to treat RDS in premature neonates is exogenous surfactant and supplemental oxygen, however, there is no specific and effective method of prevention or treatment of BPD (Bhandari 2014). According to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development/National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NICHD/NHLBI), the identification of potential drugs to target BPD in preterm infants has been categorized as a &#x201c;research priority&#x201d; (McEvoy, Jain et al. 2014). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) workshop conducted under the auspices of the NHLBI of the NIH on the primary prevention of chronic lung diseases focused on BPD (McEvoy, Jain et al. 2014). In terms of &#x201c;promising near-term opportunities for primary BPD prevention research,&#x201d; specifically, &#x201c;clinical research priorities and specific clinical trials for BPD prevention,&#x201d; it was disappointing to note that only two specific drugs were named&#x2014;caffeine and inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) (Bhandari 2014).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0034">Reducing inflammation via activation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 will be therapeutic for acute lung injury (ALI), ARDS and BPD, which are characterized by overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-6, i-NOS and ROS as a result of bacterial infection, trauma, excess exposure to oxygen and noxious gases. These mediators induce endothelial and epithelial injury in lung, vascular leakage, edema, and vasodilatation, subsequently causing the development of ALI and ARDS (Densmore, Signorino et al. 2006). IL-10 primarily produced by T-helper 2 cells, B cells, monocytes, macrophages and keratinocytes is known to reduce the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and terminate inflammatory responses (Moore, Rousset et al. 1991). Low levels of IL-10 are found in patients with transfusion-related ALI (Kapur, Kim et al. 2017). Importantly, treatment with IL-10 alleviated lung injury induced by ischemia-reperfusion, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Bi, Wang et al. 2008), bleomycin and ozone; absence of endogenous IL-10 enhanced ALI induced by carrageenan. In addition to this, it was also reported that, pre-incubation of cultured fetal rat alveolar type II cells with recombinant IL-10 prior to 65% hyperoxia exposure decreased cellular necrosis and increased cell proliferation (Lee and Kim 2011). As reported by us (Bhandari 2008), and others (Li, Zhang et al. 2015), exogenous IL-10 treatment alleviated hyperoxia-induced ALI in mice, possibly by regulating neutrophil recruitment and the subsequent generation of cytokines, NO and matrix metalloproteinases.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0035">Acne vulgaris is a common disorder that affects 17 million people in the U.S. alone. Although acne is rarely life threatening, it is a disease that can have a significant effect on patients' physical and psychological well-being. The pathogenesis of acne is multifactorial, including hormonal, microbiological, and immunological mechanisms. One of the factors that contributes to the pathogenesis of acne is <i>Propionibacterium acnes</i>, part of normal skin flora that can be significantly increased in the pilosebaceous units of patients with acne (Leyden, McGinley et al. 1975). Although <i>P. acnes </i>is a gram-positive bacterium, it is variably and weakly Gram-positive. It is described as diphtheroid or coryneform because it is rod-shaped and slightly curved. A number of unique features of the <i>P. acnes </i>cell wall and outer envelope further distinguishes it from other Gram-positive bacteria. <i>P. acnes </i>synthesizes phosphatidylinositol, this is unlike almost all other bacteria, but is made by virtually all eukaryotes. The peptidoglycan of <i>P. acnes </i>is distinct from most Gram-positive bacteria, containing a cross-linkage region of peptide chains with L, L-diaminopimelic acid and Dalanine in which two glycine residues combine with amino and carboxyl groups of two L, L-diaminopimelic acid residues (Kamisango, Saiki et al. 1982).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0036"><i>P. acnes </i>contributes to the inflammatory nature of acne by inducing monocytes to secrete proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-1&#x3b2;, and IL-8 (Vowels, Yang et al. 1995). In particular, IL-8 along with other <i>P. acnes</i>-induced chemotactic factors may play an important role in attracting neutrophils to the pilosebaceous unit. In addition, <i>P. acnes </i>releases lipases, proteases, and hyaluronidases which contribute to tissue injury (Hoeffler, Ko et al. 1976, Hoeffler 1977). For these reasons, <i>P. acnes </i>has been a major target of therapy in inflammatory acne.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0037">The mechanism by which <i>P. acnes </i>activates monocyte cytokine release is unknown but is thought to involve pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)3 of the innate immune system. Recently identified Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are one example of PRR. Toll receptors were first identified in <i>Drosophila</i>, and mammalian homologues were found to mediate immune response to microbial ligands (Medzhitov, Preston-Hurlburt et al. 1997, Yang, Mark et al. 1998). Although it has been suggested that TLRs can discriminate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms (Underhill, Ozinsky et al. 1999), bacterial ligands from Gram-positive bacteria have been identified that can activate monocytes via TLR2 or TLR4 (Takeuchi, Hoshino et al. 1999).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0038">Reported evidence suggest that, <i>P. acnes </i>induces inflammatory cytokines in monocytes through a TLR2-dependent pathway. The expression of TLR2 in acne lesions indicates that activation of TLR2 can contribute to inflammation at the site of disease activity. Thus, a need remains for improved compositions and methods of treating these conditions.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0039">Psoriasis. Interleukin (IL)-10 is an important immunoregulatory cytokine. One of its main biological function seems to be the limitation and termination of inflammatory responses. Remarkably, a relative deficiency in IL-10 expression is found in psoriasis, a frequent inflammatory skin disease, characterized by a type 1 cytokine pattern. Induction of IL-10 expression was found by conventional antipsoriatic therapies, suggesting that IL-10 may be a key cytokine in psoriasis and that application of this cytokine may have therapeutic effects. In first clinical trials over 3-7 weeks in patients with established psoriasis IL-10 was well tolerated and clinical efficient. In a long-term trial in patients with psoriasis in remission, IL-10 therapy decreased the incidence of relapse and prolonged the disease-free interval. Laboratory investigations suggest that IL-10 exerts its anti-psoriatic activity by effects on different cell populations including antigen presenting cells and T-cells. IL-10 led to a lasting type 1/type 2 cytokine balance shift. Direct effects of IL-10 on keratinocytes, however, are unlikely to have contributed to the clinical response, since IL-10 unresponsiveness of keratinocytes was found in vitro. IL-10 seems to have major importance in psoriasis (Asadullah, Volk et al. 2002)</p><p id="p-0043" num="0040">So far, IL-10 as a cytokine is therapeutically has been used as a recombinant protein i.e., a large molecule. Therefore, it's quite expensive to produce, must be administered by injection, which is quite inconvenient for the patient, and the induction of neutralizing antibodies, which might limit their effect, has to be excluded for long term application. Identification of molecules mediating the effects of this cytokine which are suitable for pharmacological intervention with small molecules will, therefore, of increasing interest. Induction of IL-10 cytokine production with low molecular weight compounds represent novel therapeutic approaches.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0041">Arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder that is characterized by a chronic synovitis which often leads to joint destruction. It is now established that proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-0, IL-1, GM-CSF, and IL-6 are all produced by the synovial membrane in RA, and are considered to be important participants in the pathophysiology of the disease (Di Giovine, Nuki et al. 1988, Hirano, Matsuda et al. 1988, Miyasaka, Sato et al. 1988, Harris 1990).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0042">Both mRNA and protein for IL-10 are present in the RA and osteoarthritis (OA) synovium, and that IL-10 is an important participant in the cytokine network of the rheumatoid synovial membrane, playing an immunoregulatory role in inflammatory and possibly T cell cytokine production. Reciprocally, IL-10 itself is regulated by IL-1 and TNF-&#x3b1;, thus IL-10 appears to be an important component of the complex cytokine network of rheumatoid synovitis. Finally, exogenous IL-10 was shown to inhibit both TNF-&#x3b1; and IL-10 production by RA synovial membrane cultures. These findings raise the possibility of new therapeutic strategies of IL-10 upregulating agents for the treatment rheumatoid arthritis (Katsikis, Chu et al. 1994).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0043">Lung cancer. Worldwide, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths in men and women. Lung cancer mortality rates have been rising in recent decades. Chronic inflammatory disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), has been identified as a risk factor for lung cancer. Since TLR4 is also actively involved in the immune response against cancers, researchers have postulated that TLR4 exerts both a defensive role in normal cells and a negative role in cancer cells (Starska, Forma et al. 2012). However, the available evidence is still not conclusive on the link between TLR4 and lung cancer. A study of functional TLR-4 and mutated TLR4 in mice found that mice with the former had less lung capillary permeability, less weight loss, leukocyte inflammation, and primary tumor formation. Thus, the authors, Bauer et al, postulated that TLR4 inhibits lung carcinogenesis by inhibiting tumor progression. (Bauer, Dixon et al. 2005) The researchers proved TLR4 activation could protect the lungs from being inflamed during any potential tumorigenesis. (Bauer, Fostel et al. 2009) Elsewhere, a lower level of TLR4 in the nasal epithelium of a smoker compared with a nonsmoker was observed, with a profound reduction in patients with severe COPD. (MacRedmond, Greene et al. 2007) This finding suggests the potential role of TLR4 for airway inflammation and lung cancer progression. In vitro studies have also found that TLR4 is constantly expressed and upregulated on human lung cancer cells. (Zhang, He et al. 2009) In one study, the level of TLR4 was significantly linked with the production of immunosuppressive cytokines, production of proangiogenic chemokine, and with resistance to apoptosis by lung cancer cells. (He, Liu et al. 2007) Despite the reported significance of TLR-9 in lung cancer progression, (Droemann, Albrecht et al. 2005, Wang, Rayburn et al. 2006, Manegold, Gravenor et al. 2008, Ren, Wen et al. 2008) a positive correlation (P,0.05) of TLR4, but not TLR-9, with tumor differentiation in lung cancer patients was reported. (Zhang, He et al. 2009).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0044">Angiogenesis. Posterior segment neovascular ocular diseases, as exemplified by proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), are a growing and huge health threat which require new effective therapies. Retinal neovascularization associated with PDR is the leading cause of blindness in working age adults. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is responsible for 200,000 new cases of exudative AMD each year in the US rendering this neovascular pathology the leading cause of legal blindness in non-third world nations. The projected number of people with AMD in 2020 is 196 million, increasing to 288 million in 2040 [Wong et al, The Lancet Global Health 2014, 2, e106-e116]. Pathological angiogenesis associated with ROP is the major cause of blindness in children under the age of seven [Harrell et al, Neonatal Network 2007, 26, 371-378].</p><p id="p-0048" num="0045">Toll Like Receptor (TLR2/4) signaling may be associated with pathologic changes in retinal diseases [Cho et al, Investigative Ophthalmology &#x26; Visual Science 2009, 50, 5614-5618], including AMD eyes by oxidized lipids, lipofuscin and by drusen components. Once activated, TLR4 could contribute to the pathogenesis of AMD by multiple mechanisms such as release of TNF-&#x3b1;, interleukin-1&#x3b2;, and other pro-inflammatory mediators. TLR4 activation suppresses Wnt signaling, leading to reduced growth factor expression, secretion, and increased photoreceptor death in response to oxidative stress as well as can also lead to oxidative damage of photoreceptor outer segments. TLR4 has a direct effect on several inflammation-related signaling pathways including MAPK, NFk-B and Jak1/Stat1 and shown to mediate neuronal toxicity through caspase-3, neuronal iNOS and ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and p38. Interestingly, TLR4-mediated microglial activation by endogenous photoreceptor proteins in retinal inflammation can aggravate retinal cell death. Finally, release of high-mobility group box-1 in ischemic neural tissue has been shown to initiate TLR4-dependent responses that contribute to retinal neovascularization [He et al, Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology. 2013; 33:330-338].</p><p id="p-0049" num="0046">Accordingly, there exists a need for more effective treatments for inflammation and in particular for both dry and wet AMD pathogenesis. The compounds and methods described herein, therefore demonstrated that inhibition of TLR2/4 activity is of therapeutic value in ROP, DR, AMD and other retinal diseases. The compounds of present innovation are small molecules that can synergistically inhibit angiogenesis, inflammation and accelerate phagocytosis with therapeutic potential to treat these diseases.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0050" num="0047">The compounds of present invention possess chemical structures with easier synthetic route compared to MPLA and other TLR4 agonists (Adanitsch, Shi et al. 2018). The compounds of the present invention are found unexpectedly as TLR4, TLR6, TLR7 and TLR8 agonists. They enhance bacterial and viral clearance as well as decrease inflammatory cytokine production after post infection treatment demonstrating a balance in Th1 and Th2 cytokine production by these compounds, which is not shown by MPLA. Pretreatment of some of the compounds of present invention stimulated the human monocytes into macrophages and increase the intracellular phagocytosis of bacteria thus possess immune stimulant activity. Post treatment by some of the compounds of present invention decreased inflammatory cytokines in mouse models of BPD, ARDS, and prevent tissue injury thus possess anti-inflammatory activity. The compounds of the present invention are found unexpectedly as TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 antagonists. Treatment with some of these compounds of present invention arrest the lung cancer cell proliferation and decrease new tube formation in endothelial cells thus possess anti-cancer and anti-angiogenic activities respectively.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0048">As embodied and broadly described herein, an aspect of the present disclosure relates to a composition comprising a compound with Formula I:</p><p id="p-0052" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-C00002" he="25.91mm" wi="75.95mm" file="US20230000887A1-20230105-C00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0053" num="0000">wherein n=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5; X=NH, O, or S; Y=phenyl, or a phenyl group substituted with at least one methyl, a phenyl group substituted with at least one nitro, a phenyl group substituted with at least one nitrogen, a phenyl group substituted with at least one boron, aryl, substituted aryl, heteroaryl, four to six membered cycloalkyl, four to six membered heterocycloalkyl; R=H, C(O)R<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>R<sub>2</sub>; R<sub>1</sub>=H, C(O)R<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>R<sub>2</sub>; R<sub>2</sub>=Ethyl, methyl, isopropyl, n-propyl, t-butyl, n-butyl, NH<sub>2</sub>, NR<sub>3</sub>R<sub>4</sub>; R<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>4</sub>=Ethyl, methyl, isopropyl, n-propyl, t-butyl, n-butyl, three to six membered cycloalkyl, Z=NH, O, or none, and optionally wherein X and Z are not both S.

Biodegradable particles have been developed for the controlled-release and delivery of compounds, such as those disclosed herein. Langer, R., Science, 249: 1527-1533 (1990).</p><p id="p-0150" num="0122">The respiratory tract encompasses the upper airways, including the oropharynx and larynx, followed by the lower airways, which include the trachea followed by bifurcations into the bronchi and bronchioli. The upper and lower airways are called the conducting airways. The terminal bronchioli then divide into respiratory bronchiole, which then lead to the ultimate respiratory zone, the alveoli, or deep lung. The present invention can be formulated for delivery to any part of the respiratory tract, e.g., Gonda, I. &#x201c;Aerosols for delivery of therapeutic and diagnostic agents to the respiratory tract,&#x201d; in Critical Reviews in Therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems 6:273-313, 1990, relevant portions incorporated herein by reference. On one non-limiting example, the deep lung or alveoli are the primary target of inhaled therapeutic aerosols for systemic drug delivery of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0123">Inhaled aerosols have been used for the treatment of local lung disorders including asthma and cystic fibrosis and have potential for the systemic delivery of the compounds of the present invention. Pulmonary drug delivery strategies present many difficulties for the delivery of macromolecules, including: excessive loss of inhaled drug in the oropharyngeal cavity (often exceeding 80%), poor control over the site of deposition, irreproducibility of therapeutic results owing to variations in breathing patterns, the often too-rapid absorption of drug potentially resulting in local toxic effects, and phagocytosis by lung macrophages.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0124">Considerable attention has been devoted to the design of therapeutic aerosol inhalers to improve the efficiency of inhalation therapies and the design of dry powder aerosol surface texture. The present inventors have recognized that the need to avoid particle aggregation, a phenomenon that diminishes considerably the efficiency of inhalation therapies owing to particle aggregation, is required for efficient, consistent deep lung delivery.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0125">In one example for a formulation for pulmonary delivery, particles containing the active compound(s) of the present invention may be used with local and systemic inhalation therapies to provide controlled release of the therapeutic agent. The particles containing the active compound(s) permit slow release from a therapeutic aerosol and prolong the residence of an administered drug in the airways or acini, and diminish the rate of drug appearance in the bloodstream. Due to the decrease in use and increase in dosage consistency, patient compliance increases.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0126">The human lungs can remove or rapidly degrade hydrolytically cleavable deposited aerosols over periods ranging from minutes to hours. In the upper airways, ciliated epithelia contribute to the &#x201c;mucociliary escalator&#x201d; by which particles are swept from the airways toward the mouth. It is well known that, in the deep lung, alveolar macrophages are capable of phagocytosing particles soon after their deposition. The particles containing the active compound(s) provided herein permit for an effective dry-powder inhalation therapy for both short- and long-term release of therapeutics, either for local or systemic delivery, with minimum aggregation. The increased particle size consistency is expected to decrease the particles' clearance by the lung's natural mechanisms until drugs have been effectively delivered.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0127">PLGA encapsulated nanosuspension with extended drug release profile Nanoparticle formulation. Nanoparticle formulation can be carried out through a single or double emulsion technique. For example, for a single emulsion technique, 10 mg of compounds Or was dissolved in 3 ml of chloroform containing 100 mg of PLGA to form an oil phase. This solution was then added dropwise into 20 ml of 5% PVA solution (water phase) and emulsified at 50 W for 5 minutes to form the compound loaded nanoparticles. The final emulsion was stirred overnight to allow solvent evaporation. The nanoparticles were washed and collected by ultracentrifugation and lyophilized before use.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0128">For example of a double emulsion technique, 30 mg of poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) were dissolved in 1 mL of chloroform at 4&#xb0; C. Concurrently, 2 mL of a 2% w/v poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/distilled deionized water solution was formed. Upon solubilization of the PVA in water, 1 mL of ethanol or methanol was added as a non-solvent to the PVA solution. The active compound was then added to the PVA/ethanol solution at a concentration of 1 mM and stirred. A stock solution of active agent, e.g., 10 mg/ml, is formed by the dissolution of curcumin into water under alkaline conditions using, e.g., 0.5 M NaOH. The active agent is added to the PLGA/Chloroform solution at concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/mL per 150 microliters of aqueous volume. Formation of the primary emulsion is done by vortexing the active agent-PLGA/chloroform solution for 20 seconds, followed by tip sonication at 55 W for 1 minute on a Branson Sonifier model W-350 (Branson, Danbury, Conn.). The primary emulsion is then added to a BS3/PVA/ethanol solution to initiate formation of the secondary emulsion. Completion of the secondary emulsion is done through vortexing for 20 seconds and tip sonication at 55 W for 2 minutes. Stabile activated nanoparticles are then aliquoted into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 18,000 g. The chloroform and residual PVA supernatant were aspirated off and particles were resuspended by tip sonication in, e.g., 1 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.2. Following resuspension, nanoparticles were placed at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. for 1 hour and lyophilized overnight. Lyophilization can be carried out in an ATR FD 3.0 system (ATR Inc, St. Louis, Mo.) under a vacuum of 250 T. After lyophilization nanoparticles are stored at 4&#xb0; C. Upon use nanoparticles were weighed into eppendorf tubes and resuspended in 1 mL of PBS pH 7.4.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0129">The present invention includes composition and methods that use carbohydrate derived toll like receptor 2 and 4 (TLR2/4) antagonists to suppress skin inflammation useful in Acne, and related bacterial infections.

The toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) is one such signaling pathway involved in this process (Menden, Xia et al. 2016, Yao, Shi et al. 2017), especially with antenatal sepsis/inflammation leading to BPD (Glaser and Speer 2016).</p><p id="p-0200" num="0166">Chitin and chitosan are high molecular weight oligosaccharides with diverse biological activities having hypo-cholesterolemic, antimicrobial, immunostimulating, antitumorigenic, accelerating calcium and iron absorption, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties (Xia, Liu et al. 2011).

Instead of binding to the TLR4-MD2 complex like other antagonists such as Eritoran (Kim, Park et al. 2007), it binds directly to the active site of TLR4, thus inhibiting the downstream components. In addition, a novel series of compounds were designed and identified by SAR study such as Compounds 1, 3, 8 and 32 that also inhibit TLR4 in an in vivo model system using neonatal pups with BPD.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0168">Chitin and chitosan have excellent properties for ideal drugs delivery (Janes, Fresneau et al. 2001, Williams, Lansdown et al. 2003, Li, Zhuang et al. 2009).
