id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">Laundry detergent compositions, especially liquid laundry detergent compositions or unit dose articles providing improved care of coloured fabric.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Laundry detergent compositions are formulated to provide good cleaning to fabrics: To keep white fabrics white, and to keep coloured fabrics bright. The laundry detergent compositions are also typically formulated to remove stains and soils. However, in addition to removing soils, the laundry detergent compositions have been known to also remove dyes from coloured fabrics, resulting in fading of coloured fabrics. Furthermore, these removed dyes can transfer onto other fabrics during the laundry process, resulting in undesired fabric discoloration.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to limit the transfer of such dyes to co-washed fabrics, dye-transfer inhibiting (DTI) polymers are often incorporated into detergent compositions marketed for cleaning coloured fabrics. Typical dye-transfer inhibitors are typically based on polymers such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone homopolymers (PVP), polyvinylimidazole (PVI), polyvinyl pyrrolidone/polyvinyl imidazole copolymers (PVP/PVI), and poly-4-vinylpyridine N-oxide (PVNO), and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) co-poly(vinylpyridine-N-oxide) (PVP/PVNO) polymers, which have typically included relatively high levels of vinyl pyrrolidone (&#x201c;VP&#x201d;). However, while such DTI polymers reduce dye-transfer to co-washed fabric, they do not prevent dye bleeding from fabrics which leads to dye-fading. Indeed, it has been found that during laundering, many fabric-dyes partition between the fabric and wash-liquor, and further that the sequestering of dyes in the wash liquor by the DTI polymer has been found to increase the amount of dye partitioning into the wash liquour. As such, while DTI polymers prevent dye transfer to co-washed fabrics during laundering, they have been found to also increase dye-fading.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As such, a need remains for a detergent composition which provides reduced dye redeposition to co-washed fabrics, but also reduced dye fading during laundering.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO2010025116A1 relates to stable color maintenance and/or rejuvenation compositions comprising at least one cationic polymer and anionic surfactant, and methods for providing the same.

All percentages and ratios are calculated based on the total composition unless otherwise indicated.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0012">All measurements are performed at 25&#xb0; C. unless otherwise specified.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0013">As used herein, the articles including &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an&#x201d; when used in a claim, are understood to mean one or more of what is claimed or described.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0014">Laundry Detergent Composition:</p><p id="p-0020" num="0015">The laundry detergent composition can be in any suitable form, such as liquid, paste, granular, solid, powder, or in conjunction with a carrier such as a substrate. Preferred laundry detergent compositions are either liquid or granular, with liquid being most preferred.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0016">As used herein, &#x201c;liquid detergent composition&#x201d; refers to liquid detergent composition which is fluid, and preferably capable of wetting and cleaning a fabric, e.g., clothing in a domestic washing machine. As used herein, &#x201c;laundry detergent composition&#x201d; refers to compositions suitable for washing clothes. The composition can include solids or gases in suitably subdivided form, but the overall composition excludes product forms which are non-fluid overall, such as tablets or granules. The liquid laundry detergent composition preferably has a density in the range from 0.9 to 1.3 grams per cubic centimetre, more specifically from 1.00 to 1.10 grams per cubic centimetre, excluding any solid additives but including any bubbles, if present.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0017">The composition can be an aqueous liquid laundry detergent composition. For such aqueous liquid laundry detergent compositions, the water content can be present at a level of from 5.0% to 95%, preferably from 25% to 90%, more preferably from 50% to 85% by weight of the liquid detergent composition.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0018">The pH range of the detergent composition is from 6.0 to 8.9, preferably from pH 7 to 8.8.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0019">The detergent composition can also be encapsulated in a water-soluble film, to form a unit dose article. Such unit dose articles comprise a detergent composition of the present invention, wherein the detergent composition comprises less than 20%, preferably less than 15%, more preferably less than 10% by weight of water, and the detergent composition is enclosed in a water-soluble or dispersible film. Such unit-dose articles can be formed using any means known in the art. Suitable unit-dose articles can comprise one compartment, wherein the compartment comprises the liquid laundry detergent composition. Alternatively, the unit-dose articles can be multi-compartment unit-dose articles, wherein at least one compartment comprises the liquid laundry detergent composition.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0020">Dye Transfer Inhibiting Polymers:</p><p id="p-0026" num="0021">The detergent composition comprises one or more dye transfer inhibiting polymer. The dye transfer inhibiting polymer comprises a graft copolymer. The graft copolymer can be present at a level of from 0.05% to 15%, or from 0.1% to 3.0%, and or from 0.2% to 1.0%, by weight of the detergent composition.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0022">Dye transfer inhibiting polymers are known in the art for reducing or preventing dye-transfer during the laundering process. However, it has been found that during laundering, many fabric-dyes partition between the fabric and wash-liquor, and the sequestering of dyes in the wash liquor using DTI polymers has been found to increase dye removal from fabrics, leading to increased dye-fading.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0023">The dye transfer inhibition polymer of use herein is a graft copolymer, the graft copolymer comprising: (a) polyalkylene oxide which has a number average molecular weight of from 1000 to 20,000 Daltons and is based on ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, or butylene oxide, (b) N-vinylpyrrolidone, and (c) vinyl ester derived from a saturated monocarboxylic acid containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, wherein the weight ratio of (a):(b) is from 1:0.1 to 1:2, preferably from 1:0.3 to 1:1, and wherein the amount, by weight, of (a) is greater than the amount of (c).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0024">The weight ratio of (a):(c) is from 1.0:0.1 to 1.0:0.99, or from 1.0:0.3 to 1.0:0.9. When the ratio of polyalkylene oxide to N-vinylpyrrolidone is too low, the polymer may form negative interactions with other composition ingredients and/or may lead to negative feel on fabrics, as well as reduced cleaning efficacy.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0025">The weight ratio of (b):(c) can be from 1.0:0.1 to 1.0:5.0, or to 1.0:4.0. Without wishing to be bound by theory, a ratio of N-vinylpyrrolidone-to-vinyl ester that is too high may lead to higher deposition on fabric causing the treated fabric to have a negative feel. Additionally, negative interactions with ingredients such as brighteners may occur.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0026">The amount, by weight of the polymer, of (a) is greater than the amount of (c). The polymer may comprise at least 50% by weight, preferably at least 60% by weight, more preferably at least 75% by weight of (a) polyalkylene oxide. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that relatively high levels of component (c) (e.g., vinyl acetate), particularly in relation to component (a), may result in decreased performance of dye transfer inhibition and/or relatively greater hydrophobicity, which can lead to formulation and/or stability challenges.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0027">The order of the addition of monomers (b) and (c) in the graft polymerization is immaterial.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0028">The graft copolymer comprises and/or is obtainable by grafting (a) a polyalkylene oxide which has a number average molecular weight of from 1000 to 20000 Da, or to 15000, or to 12000 Da, or to 10000 Da and is based on ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, or butylene oxide, preferably based on ethylene oxide, with (b) N-vinylpyrrolidone, and further with (c) a vinyl ester derived from a saturated monocarboxylic acid containing from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably a vinyl ester that is vinyl acetate or a derivative thereof.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0029">Suitable polyalkylene oxides may be based on homopolymers or copolymers, with homopolymers being preferred. Suitable polyalkylene oxides may be based on homopolymers of ethylene oxide or ethylene oxide copolymers having an ethylene oxide content of from 40 mol % to 99 mol %. Suitable comonomers for such copolymers may include propylene oxide, n-butylene oxide, and/or isobutylene oxide. Suitable copolymers may include copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, copolymers of ethylene oxide and butylene oxide, and/or copolymers of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, and at least one butylene oxide. The copolymers may include an ethylene oxide content of from 40 to 99 mol %, a propylene oxide content of from 1.0 to 60 mol %, and a butylene oxide content of from 1.0 to 30 mol %. The graft base may be linear (straight-chain) or branched, for example a branched homopolymer and/or a branched copolymer.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0030">Branched copolymers may be prepared by addition of ethylene oxide with or without propylene oxides and/or butylene oxides onto polyhydric low molecular weight alcohols, for example trimethylol propane, pentoses, or hexoses.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0031">The alkylene oxide unit may be randomly distributed in the polymer or be present therein as blocks.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0032">The polyalkylene oxides of component (a) may be the corresponding polyalkylene glycols in free form, that is, with OH end groups, or they may be capped at one or both end groups. Suitable end groups may be, for example, C1-C25-alkyl, phenyl, and C1-C14-alkylphenyl groups. The end group may be a C1-alkyl (e.g., methyl) group. Suitable materials for the graft base may include PEG 300, PEG 1000, PEG 2000, PEG 4000, PEG 6000, PEG 8000, PEG 10000, PEG 12000, and/or PEG 20000, which are polyethylene glycols, and/or MPEG 2000, MPEG 4000, MPEG 6000, MPEG 8000 and MEG 10000 which are monomethoxypolyethylene glycols that are commercially available from BASF under the tradename PLURIOL.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0033">Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that if the molecular weight of component (a) (e.g., polyethylene glycol), is relatively low, there may be a performance decrease in dye transfer inhibition. Additionally, or alternatively, when the molecular weight is too high, the polymer may not remain suspended in solution and/or may deposit on treated fabrics.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0034">The graft copolymers of the present disclosure may be characterized by relatively low degree of branching (i.e., degree of grafting). In the graft copolymers of the present disclosure, the average number of grafting sites may be less than or equal to 1.0, or less than or equal to 0.8, or less than or equal to 0.6, or less than or equal to 0.5, or less than or equal to 0.4, per 50 alkylene oxide groups, e.g., ethylene oxide groups. The graft copolymers may comprise, on average, based on the reaction mixture obtained, at least 0.05, or at least 0.1, graft site per 50 alkylene oxide groups, e.g., ethylene oxide groups. The degree of branching may be determined, for example, by means of <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy from the integrals of the signals of the graft sites and the &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>-groups of the polyalkylene oxide.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0035">The number of grafting sites may be adjusted by manipulating the temperature and/or the feed rate of the monomers. For example, the polymerization may be carried out in such a way that an excess of component (a) and the formed graft copolymer is constantly present in the reactor. For example, the quantitative molar ratio of component (a) and polymer to ungrafted monomer (and initiator, if any) is generally greater than or equal to 10:1, or to 15:1, or to 20:1.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0036">The polyalkylene oxides is grafted with N-vinylpyrrolidone as the monomer of component (b). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the presence of the N-vinylpyrrolidone (&#x201c;VP&#x201d;) monomer in the graft copolymers according to the present disclosure provides water-solubility and good film-forming properties compared to otherwise-similar polymers that do not contain the N-vinylpyrrolidone monomer. The vinyl pyrrolidone repeat unit has amphiphilic character with a polar amide group that can form a dipole, and a non-polar portion with the methylene groups in the backbone and the ring, making it hydrophobic. When the vinyl pyrrolidone content is too high, there may be negative effects on fabric softness and material cost is high with high vinyl pyrrolidone content.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0037">The polyalkylene oxides are grafted with a vinyl ester as the monomer of component (c). The vinyl ester may be derived from a saturated monocarboxylic acid, which may contain 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or from 1 to 2 carbon atoms, or 1 carbon atom. Suitable vinyl esters may be selected from the group consisting of vinyl formate, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrate, vinyl valerate, vinyl iso-valerate, vinyl caproate, or mixtures thereof. Preferred monomers of component (c) include those selected from the group consisting of vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, or mixtures thereof, optionally vinyl acetate.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0038">Conventionally, molecular weights are expressed by their &#x201c;K-values,&#x201d; which are derived from relative viscosity measurements. The graft copolymers may have a K value of from 5.0 to 200, optionally from 5.0 to 50, determined according to H. Fikentscher in 2% strength by weight solution in dimethylformamide at 25 C.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0039">The graft copolymers of the present disclosure may be characterized by a relatively narrow molar mass distribution. For example, the graft copolymers may be characterized by a polydispersity M<sub>w</sub>/M<sub>n </sub>of less than or equal to 3.0, or less than or equal to 2.5, or less than or equal to 2.3. The polydispersity of the graft copolymers may be from 1.5 to 2.2. The polydispersity may be determined by gel permeation chromatography using organic solvent such as hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) with multi-angle laser light scattering detection.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0040">The graft copolymers may be prepared by grafting the suitable polyalkylene oxides of component (a) with the monomers of component (b) in the presence of free radical initiators and/or by the action of high-energy radiation, which may include the action of high-energy electrons. This may be done, for example, by dissolving the polyalkylene oxide in at least one monomer of group (b), adding a polymerization initiator and polymerizing the mixture to completion. The graft polymerization may also be carried out semicontinuously by first introducing a portion, for example 10%, of the mixture of polyalkylene oxide to be polymerized, at least one monomer of group (b) and/or (c) and initiator, heating to polymerization temperature and, after the polymerization has started, adding the remainder of the mixture to be polymerized at a rate commensurate with the rate of polymerization. The graft copolymers may also be obtained by introducing the polyalkylene oxides of group (a) into a reactor, heating to the polymerization temperature, and adding at least one monomer of group (b) and/or (c) and polymerization initiator, either all at once, a little at a time, or uninterruptedly, optionally uninterruptedly, and polymerizing.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0041">In the preparation of the graft copolymers, the order in which the monomers (b) and (c) are grafted onto component (a) may be immaterial and/or freely chooseable. For example, first N-vinylpyrrolidone may be grafted onto component (a), and then a monomer (c) or a mixture of monomers of group (c). It is also possible to first graft the monomers of group (c) and then N-vinylpyrrolidone onto the graft base (a). It may be that a monomer mixture of (b) and (c) are grafted onto graft base (a) in one step. The graft copolymer may be prepared by providing graft base (a) and then first grafting N-vinylpyrrolidone and then vinyl acetate onto the graft base.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0042">Any suitable polymerization initiator(s) may be used, which may include organic peroxides such as diacetyl peroxide, dibenzoyl peroxide, succinyl peroxide, di-tert-butyl peroxide, tert-butyl perbenzoate, tert-butyl perpivalate, tert-butyl permaleate, cumene hydroperoxide, diisopropyl peroxodicarbamate, bis(o-toluoyl) peroxide, didecanoyl peroxide, dioctanoyl peroxide, dilauroyl peroxide, tert-butyl perisobutyrate, tert-butyl peracetate, di-tert-amyl peroxide, tert-butyl peracetate, di-tert-amyl peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, mixtures thereof, redox initiators, and/or azo starters. The choice of initiator may be related to the choice of polymerization temperature.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0043">The graft polymerization may take place at from 50&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C., or from 70&#xb0; C. to 140&#xb0; C. The graft polymerization may typically be carried out under atmospheric pressure, but may also be carried out under reduced or superatmospheric pressure.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0044">The graft polymerization may be carried out in a solvent. Suitable solvents may include: monohydric alcohols, such as ethanol, propanols, and/or butanols; polyhydric alcohols, such as ethylene glycol and/or propylene glycol; alkylene glycol ethers, such as ethylene glycol monomethyl and -ethyl ether and/or propylene glycol monomethyl and -ethyl ether; polyalkylene glycols, such as di- or tri-ethylene glycol and/or di- or tri-propylene glycol; polyalkylene glycol monoethers, such as poly(C2-C3-alkylene)glycol mono (C1-C16-alkyl)ethers having 3-20 alkylene glycol units; carboxylic esters, such as ethyl acetate and ethyl propionate; aliphatic ketones, such as acetone and/or cyclohexanone; cyclic ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran and/or dioxane; or mixtures thereof.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0045">The graft polymerization may also be carried out in water as solvent. In such cases, the first step may be to introduce a solution which, depending on the amount of added monomers of component (b), is more or less soluble in water. To transfer water-insoluble products that can form during the polymerization into solution, it is possible, for example, to add organic solvents, for example monohydric alcohols having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, acetone, and/or dimethylformamide. In a graft polymerization process in water, it is also possible to transfer the water-insoluble graft copolymers into a finely divided dispersion by adding customary emulsifiers or protective colloids, for example polyvinyl alcohol. The emulsifiers used may be ionic or nonionic surfactants whose HLB value is from 3.0 to 13. HLB value is determined according to the method described in the paper by W. C. Griffin in J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem. 5 (1954), 249.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0046">The amount of surfactant used in the graft polymerization process may be from 0.1 to 5.0% by weight of the graft copolymer. If water is used as the solvent, solutions or dispersions of graft copolymers may be obtained. If solutions of graft copolymers are prepared in an organic solvent or in mixtures of an organic solvent and water, the amount of organic solvent or solvent mixture used per 100 parts by weight of the graft copolymer may be from 5 to 200, optionally from 10 to 100, parts by weight.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0047">After the graft polymerization, the graft copolymer may optionally be subjected to a partial hydrolysis. In the graft copolymer, from 1.0 mol % to 60 mol %, preferably from 20 mol % to 60 mol %, more preferably from 30 mol % to 50 mol % of the grafted-on monomers of component (c) are hydrolyzed. For instance, the hydrolysis of graft copolymers prepared using vinyl acetate or vinyl propionate as component (c) gives graft copolymers containing vinyl alcohol units. The hydrolysis may be carried out, for example, by adding a base, such as sodium hydroxide solution or potassium hydroxide solution, or alternatively by adding acids and if necessary, heating the mixture. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that increasing the level of hydrolysis of component (c) increases the relative hydrophilicity of the graft copolymer, which in turn is believed to result in better suspension of the captured dyes.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0048">Surfactant System</p><p id="p-0054" num="0049">The laundry composition comprises a surfactant system at a level of from 2.5% to 60%, preferably from 5.0% to 25%, more preferably from 7.0% to 15% by weight of the composition.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0050">Suitable surfactants as used herein means surfactants or mixtures of surfactants that provide cleaning, stain removing, or laundering benefit to soiled material.
