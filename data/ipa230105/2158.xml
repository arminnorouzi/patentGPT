to a parcel station, to a parcel system and to a method for operating a parcel station.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Parcel stations face a growing market and there is demand for useful concepts for improving the handling and availability of parcel stations. Known concepts are mostly based on such parcel stations which have a housing and storage departments inside the housing for storing parcels. Typically, these departments have a fixed size and shape and standard sized parcels may be stored inside. It is possible to store parcels of different sizes, wherein the departments for the corresponding sizes are located at positions of the parcel station which have been predefined by the producer of the parcel station and are mostly located at the same place.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently department sizes in parcel stations may be selected when logistic companies order a new station.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Once fixed it is often not feasible to change the sizes adaptively to the respective parcel size. Such a system of size adaptation for parcel departments would be of increased interest.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">EP 2 876 614 A1 describes a parcel station which includes a parcel lock device for accepting and/or issuing parcels. A transport robot is movably arranged in at least three axes and the electric drive is designed to move the transport robot automatically along the three axes for picking up and dropping off a parcel contained in the parcel lock to one of the plurality of parcels.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The information disclosed in this Background of the Invention section is only for enhancement of understanding of the general background of the invention and may not be taken as an acknowledgement or any form of suggestion that this information forms the prior art already known to a person skilled in the art.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various aspects of the present invention are directed to providing a parcel station or a parcel system with an optimization of the space which may be used for the parcels.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another idea is to provide a parcel station or a parcel system with an improved way of picking up the parcels from the parcel station.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, various aspects of the present invention are directed to providing a parcel station, a parcel system and a method for operating a parcel station.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Various exemplary embodiments of the present invention are subject of the dependent claims and of the following description, referring to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a first aspect of the present invention, a parcel station for supplying parcels to a receptor includes a housing having a front cover which is slidable along at least one side, for example a front side, of the housing in an upward direction and/or a downward direction of the housing and which further includes a plurality of segments which are arranged, for example laterally and in upward and downward direction, next to each other along the upward direction and the downward direction when an internal space of the housing is closed by the front cover, and wherein the front cover is configured so that two neighboring segments among the plurality of segments are separable from each other to form an opening in the front cover to the internal and thereby to divide the front cover into an upper portion and a lower portion, wherein the in the upper portion is movable in the upward direction and the lower portion is movable in the lower direction to open the opening in the front cover; and a plurality of storage plates, which are arranged one above the other in the interior space of the housing with respect to planar extensions thereof and which are movable in a direction perpendicular to their planar extension, which can extend horizontally, and in the upper and/or lower direction thereof, wherein the opening extends between at least two neighboring storage plates among the plurality of storage plates and at current positions thereof.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The receptor may be a user which comes to the parcel station for picking up one or several parcels. The receptor can also leave a new parcel at the parcel station in one of the non-occupied departments which may be provided by moving the storage plates to corresponding heights and producing corresponding spaces between the storage plates. The front cover can have a width which is of at least the size of the horizontal extend of the storage plates, which all can have an equal width. The upward direction and the downward direction may be defined perpendicular to the horizontal direction thereof. The front cover may be slidable such that it may be rolled onto a roll in the top and/or bottom area of the housing, for example inside the housing. The housing can have various dimensions, from a few centimeters to few meters in height and/or width (horizontal) and/or length (horizontal). The segments can have a connection mechanism, for example one or more locking pins, by which two segments may be mechanically connected to each other and/or separated and then slided to open the front cover at the expected parcel location. The storing plates may be moved up- and downwards by an actuator or manually.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Various aspects of the present invention are directed to providing a parcel system including at least one parcel station according to various exemplary embodiments of the present invention, which is placed at a fixed position and/or which is mobile.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">By the mentioned parcel station it is possible to improve the efficiency of the parcel station itself by making the available space flexible to both small and large packages what in addition thereto considers an improvement of a user experience for users. In the present context the receptor is a user, wherein also the delivering service or person represents a user. Especially smaller persons and wheel chair users of mobile parcel stations can get an improved user experience since their expected parcel may be positioned at a lower height by moving the storage plated accordingly to lower heights of the housing and open a corresponding opening in the front cover also at lower heights. The parcel system may include communication devices and identification and payment systems for operating the parcel business for provider and user.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The parcel station may be placed at the fixed position somewhere in the city and/or on a vehicle.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Parcel stations will get more important in the future due to mobile parcel stations which may get transported and dropped in the city by purpose built vehicles, wherein the parcel station may be mobile and placed or operated by such a purpose built vehicle. A receptor can pick up parcels at a mobile parcel station, when he or she has time, for example after work. By the parcel station the storage size may be adapted between two storage plates and less place wasted inside the housing.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention can also be related to &#x201c;Purpose Built Vehicle&#x201d; (PBV) activities, wherein it is very likely that the mid-term future of (autonomous) parcel delivery will face the topic of parcel stations. A (mobile) parcel station therefore has adaptive storage size compartments (space between storage plates) that are adjustable in height to increase the number of packages in the parcel station and to improve the ergonomics of picking up parcels at the station for the end user.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Height adjustment of shelfs (space between storage plates) accompanied by an alternative door concept (segments which may be separated to provide openings in the front cover) may be used to provide access to adaptive size of the parcel station compartment. A double shutter system which is based on segments that can separate and move an upper portion of the front cover and a lower portion of the front cover with counter direction movement is proposed which is able to open a slot at any height and size of the parcel station column.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The height adjustment of the shelfs could be done automatically and thus propelled e.g., by an electric motor. Also a non-motorized version is feasible, where the shelf positions were changed manually or with the help of a device/robot (probably in the logistic center).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The described parcel station with the adaptive storage height can lead to a cost reduction per year. Furthermore, there is a measurable performance development.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">There is further an excellent marketability development achieved by the parcel station and its operation method since the parcel station market is growing.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further there is a high applicability achievable since all functions and components are of reliable technology.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Parcel station may be embodied in PBV or swappable PBV concept (with swappable parcel station). The parcel station may be operated autonomously, wherein PBV or a conventional LCV (light commercial vehicle) drops parcel stations which may be already filled at a desired destination or place.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A (mobile) parcel station therefore can have an adaptive storage size with compartments (departments) that are adjustable in height to increase the number of packages in the parcel station. Once the storage plates are not used they may be moved next to each other, several of them, to provide more free space in the interior space of the housing.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">It may be embodied that efficient to improve the ergonomics of picking up parcels at the station for the end user.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">A height adjustment of shelfs (storage spaces/departments defined by plates) may be accompanied by an alternative door concept to provide access to adaptive size of the parcel station compartment. A double shutter system (front cover dividable by separating of segments) with counter direction movement is proposed that is able to open a slot at any height and size of the parcel station column.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The height adjustment of the shelfs could be done automatically and thus propelled e.g., by an electric motor. Also a non-motorized version is feasible, where the shelf positions were changed manually or with the help of a device/robot (probably in the logistic center).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Regarding ergonomics, a parcel pick-up at the height of customer needs may be reached, in particular a good height therefore may be between 1.00 m and 1.50 m, and a reallocation feasible after first parcel is picked up is possible.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Regarding efficiency with an adaptive parcel shelf height it is feasible to accommodate more parcels in the same space.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Various aspects of the present invention are directed to providing a method for operating a parcel station for supplying parcels to a receptor, including the steps of providing a parcel station or a parcel system according to the present invention; receive information related to a dimension of a parcel and/or about a receptor and/or about a time of picking up of the parcel; providing a space in the interior space of the housing by moving the at least two neighboring storage plates so that a height according to the dimension of the parcel is provided; opening the front cover by separating two segments and providing the opening at the provided space for the parcel in the interior space, storing the parcel in the provided space and closing the opening; moving the parcel in the interior space to an intermediate position or keeping the parcel at a fixed initial position in the interior space; receiving a command from the receptor to provide an opening for picking up the parcel; and providing an opening at the position of the parcel by separating two neighboring segments in the front cover.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The information regarding the receptor may include the size of the receptor and the favorable height at which the receptor can pick up the parcel, for example tall persons, children or similar. The intermediate position or predetermined fixed initial position may be an average height at which the average sized adult human can most favorably pick up a parcel. The intermediate position may be a predefined or determined height of the housing which may be an average of the favorable heights of the expected receptors for the currently stored parcels, wherein such information may be available from the users when ordering the parcel services.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to various exemplary embodiments of the parcel station, the front cover is configured such that for closing the opening the upper portion is movable in the downward direction and the lower portion is movable in the upward direction until the opening is closed and the two neighboring segments are connected to each other when closing the opening.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The connection of the segments may be performed/achieved by, for example, at least one locking pin between or at one or both contacting segments which is configured to mechanically interlock or connect the segments in a fixed manner. In the instant way the opening may be easily, manually or automatically, be provided and/or closed at the particular position of the desired parcel for picking up or at the corresponding storage place for receiving the parcel by the station.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to various exemplary embodiments of the parcel station, the parcel station includes a segment actuator at each segment, wherein the segment actuator is configured to connect and/or disconnect the two neighboring segments from each other.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to various exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the parcel station includes a plate actuator at each storage plate, wherein the plate actuator is configured to move the storage plates in the upward direction and/or the downward direction inside the interior space of the housing.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The actuators may be operated automatically, for example by an electromotor, or manually.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to various exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the parcel station includes a controller which is connected to the segment actuator and/or to the plate actuator and which is configured to open and/or close the opening for the parcel and to adjust a height for a parcel in the interior space between two storage plates among the plurality of storage plates by moving at least one storage plate thereof in an upward direction and/or a downward direction thereof.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the instant way the size of the particular department may be provided.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to various exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the parcel station includes a communication unit connected to the controller and configured to receive or transmit information to a user and/or receptor about a parcel and/or a size of the parcel and/or about a favorable height position of the parcel in the interior space of the housing according to a user profile.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The mentioned information for communication to the controller may be provided by the receptor when ordering the parcel service. Then a preordering of parcels when filling the station may be done, wherein the parcels may be sorted from top to bottom or vice versa depending on their height and/or weight and may be stored from bottom to top with decreasing weight or by favorable picking up height of the receptor or in any other favorable order.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to various exemplary embodiments of the present invention, a plurality of parcels is registered to corresponding receptors and that dimensions and time of expected picking up of the parcels are registered, and that the parcels are sorted and/or placed in the interior space depending on height thereof and the time of expected picking up.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The height position may be adapted after the first parcel is picked up, for example the parcels above and below the department of the first parcel may be moved closer to an average favorable picking up height which can represent an average of the expected receptors.

The first parcel to be stored is then placed on a first storage plate P<b>1</b> (step II). Then the corresponding storage plate with the parcel moves upwards and provides another space (department) below it for the next parcel which is then placed on the next (lower) storage plate (second) and between the first and second storage plates P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b> at a correspondingly provided space with a height for the second parcel (step II). It is also possible to move first parcel to the top portion of the housing and then move the second parcel next to it as shown in step III and IV.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Furthermore, the second and the first parcel move upwards with the corresponding storage plates with them to provide a third space for the third parcel with a corresponding height between the second storage plate and the third storage plate below it, and the like for several storage plates and parcel heights (step IV).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in step V the parcel station has a front cover FC which is slidable along at least one side, for example a front side FS, of the housing in an upward direction and/or a downward direction of the housing and which further includes a plurality of segments (FCa, FCb, . . . , FCn) which are arranged laterally next to each other along the upward direction and the downward direction when an interior space of the housing is closed by the front cover FC. The front cover is configured so that two neighboring segments among the plurality of segments are separable from each other to form an opening in the front cover FC to the interior space of the housing and thereby to divide the front cover into an upper portion and a lower portion, wherein the upper portion is movable in the upward direction and the lower portion is movable in the lower direction to open the opening in the front cover FC; and a plurality of storage plates (P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b>, . . . , Pn), which are arranged one above the other in the interior space of the housing with respect to planar extensions thereof and which is movable in a direction perpendicular to the planar extensions and in the upper and/or lower direction thereof, wherein the opening extends at least between two neighboring storage plates among the plurality of storage plates and at current positions thereof.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The front cover FC may be closed when the segments are moved from the lower portions and upper portions towards each other and then open, when needed, at the particular position of the desired parcel for picking it up and providing it to the receptor.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In an alternative embodiment it is also possible to place the conveyor belt CB close to the top portion of the housing or at the middle of the height of the housing and fill the parcel station from this position.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Each column is loaded individually, several parcel stations can move horizontally for filling.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">A preorder of parcels may be done in the logistic center portion in terms of expected pickup time of customer, height of customer, weight of parcels (no heavy items in upper shelf).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Several parcel stations <b>10</b> may be placed on a vehicle as part of a mobile parcel system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> exemplarily shows details of a parcel station according to various exemplary embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> two parcel stations <b>10</b> are shown which are placed next to each other, wherein one is shown to be closed and the other is open having an opening in the front cover FC at the position of the particular parcel PC which is desired to be picked up, for example at a favorable height for the receptor and approximately in the middle of the housing H between its top and bottom.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The front cover FC with segments thereof can separate the segments FCa and FCb at the position of the desired parcel PC from each other, wherein the upper portion of the front cover can move upward (arrow) and the lower portion can move downward (arrow), in particular automatically or manually. The segments may be separated by releasing a connection pin or by opening any other locking mechanism for the segments. The upper storage plate P<b>1</b> can move up to an upper position hu of the particular department for the parcel and the lower storage plate P<b>2</b> can move down to a lower position hi providing the corresponding height of the particular parcel between the storage plates P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b>. Such an arrangement of departments with corresponding heights may be achieved also by the other storage plates and for the other parcels and at each such parcel position the corresponding opening in the front cover may be provided by separating the segments and moving the upper portion and the lower portion to corresponding positions to provide the corresponding size of the opening. The upper portion and/or the lower portion of the front cover FC may be rolled on a top and/or bottom portion of the housing or slide along the walls of the housing at bottom and/or top. The upper shutter FCb (segment) can move to an upper edge portion of the compartment (hu); the lower shutter FCa can move to the lower edge portion of compartment (hi); the shutters (segments) can move together until upper or lower edge portion of compartment is reached.

The parcel station may be filled and placed somewhere in public, for example in the city. The customer arrives at the parcel stations to pick up a parcel and request to open compartment (e.g., on smartphone).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Step II shows that after the first parcel has been picked up the remaining parcels and their departments start to rearrange before the next parcel is picked upwards. In this sense the storage plates P<b>1</b> and P<b>2</b>, which have defined the height of the department for the first parcel start moving towards each other so that the upper parcels are positioned at lower positions and the lower parcels are positioned at higher positions and all of them closer to a predetermined favorable height of an average user, wherein it is also possible to predefine any other favorable height position to which the parcels after rearrangement may be positioned as close as possible. The set of parcels, either the lower ones or the upper ones, which are closer to the predefined favorable height after the first parcel is picked up, can move less fast than the other set which is then further from the favorable height position. This is shown in step III of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. Then another parcel is picked up and the same rearrangement happens for the remaining parcels as shown in step IV. In the instant way mostly the best ergonomic position or any other predetermined position may be reached for some or all parcels (in average or really).</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> exemplarily shows a method of rearrangement of parcels after pick up according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Step I is similar to step I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> but the following rearrangement method is different. In step II the rearrangement starts only when the next receptor arrives and/or gives a command to open the opening for the particular parcel. Step II shows the example that the next receptor has the parcel which is placed on top of all parcels, then the upper parcels and their departments may be moved rapidly downwards and position the uppermost one as close to the most favorable height position of the current receptor as possible, the lower set of parcels can remain unmoved. When the next receptor arrives, step III shows the example that the receptor has the most lower parcel and then all parcels are moved upward rapidly until the lowest parcel comes as close to the favorable height of the current receptor as possible to open an opening there, what corresponds to the position in step IV.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> exemplarily show flowcharts of a method according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> shows an exemplary embodiment of the method as a flowchart which describes the possible pick-up process.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">A routine, for example executed by a controller configured for the front cover and for an actuator for the storage plates, can correspond to the following steps:</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">When the parcel station is placed, the customers may be informed about that the parcel arrived. When the receptor (customer) arrives at the parcel station, it may be show in an application of a mobile electronic device where the parcel is stored. The customer then can request the opening of the compartment. The system can determine the needed height of the upper (hu) and lower (hi) compartment edge and move the upper (segment) shutter to hu and the lower shutter to hi and open the compartment (storage place for the desired parcel). Then the controller can prove whether the parcel has been taken. If not, the opening can remain open for x seconds (e.g., 30 s), for the case that it has been taken the opening can close. The storage plates (shelfs) can rearrange.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> shows an exemplary embodiment of the method as a flowchart which describes the possible rearrangement process after pick up.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> a direct rearrangement after pick up is described.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">After a parcel is picked up it may be detected (by a controller) which parcel was picked up and which compartment is empty and it is then possible to acquire the height (hcomX) of this compartment.

If yes, then shelve <b>1</b> is moved down and shelves <b>3</b>-<b>5</b> (for the case of 5 compartments but also more or less are possible) are moved up and closer to ergonomic height. The numbering increases in the instant case from top of the housing of the parcel station downwards. If compartment <b>2</b> is not empty, then it is checked whether compartment <b>3</b> is empty. If yes, shelves <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> move downwards and shelves <b>4</b>-<b>5</b> move up closer to ergonomic height. If not, it is checked whether compartment <b>4</b> is empty.
