The in-vehicle system S<b>1</b> performs integrated processing of data from a plurality of sensors built in the vehicle and performs automatic driving and driving support control of the vehicle. The in-vehicle system S<b>1</b> includes a sensor module group <b>1</b>, the ECU <b>2</b> that is an electronic control unit, and a transmission path <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The sensor module group <b>1</b> includes a first sensor module <b>11</b>, a second sensor module <b>12</b>, and a third sensor module <b>13</b>. However, the number of sensor modules constituting the sensor module group <b>1</b> is not limited to three and may be two or more. The configurations of the respective sensor modules are common in the scope described below. The configuration of the first sensor module <b>11</b> will be described as a representative of the sensor module group <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The first sensor module <b>11</b> includes a sensor <b>111</b>, a parallel to serial conversion unit <b>112</b>, and a power supply unit <b>113</b>. A specific configuration of the sensor <b>111</b> is not particularly limited. This sensor is, for example, a camera, millimeter wave radar, laser imaging detection and ranging (LIDAR), or ultrasonic sensor. Although the sensor is not particularly limited, a sensor in which an increase or decrease in power consumption repeatedly occurs in a certain time period is particularly effective. The sensors built in the first sensor module <b>11</b>, the second sensor module <b>12</b>, and the third sensor module <b>13</b> may be of different types.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">However, in the present embodiment, the following configuration is assumed to describe a specific operation. That is, the description will be given assuming that the sensor included in the sensor module group <b>1</b> is a camera. In addition, it is assumed that the operation is performed 60 Hz and a photographed image obtained by photographing is output as a sensor output every 16.7 milliseconds. Hereinafter, one cycle in which the ECU <b>2</b> acquires a sensor output from the sensor module group <b>1</b> is also referred to as a &#x201c;data acquisition cycle&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The parallel to serial conversion unit <b>112</b> converts a parallel signal to a serial signal. The sensor <b>111</b> inputs and outputs a parallel signal, but the transmission path <b>4</b> can transmit only a serial signal. For this reason, the parallel to serial conversion unit <b>112</b> mediates between the parallel signal and the serial signal. The parallel to serial conversion unit <b>112</b> converts the sensor output, which is output as a parallel signal by the sensor <b>111</b>, into a serial signal and outputs the serial signal to the transmission path <b>4</b>. The parallel to serial conversion unit <b>112</b> extracts a clock signal included in the serial signal received from the transmission path <b>4</b> and outputs the clock signal to the sensor <b>111</b>. The parallel to serial conversion unit <b>112</b> is implemented by, for example, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The power supply unit <b>113</b> extracts power superimposed on the serial signal flowing through the transmission path <b>4</b> and supplies the power to the sensor <b>111</b> and the parallel to serial conversion unit <b>112</b>. The power supply unit <b>113</b> is, for example, an inductor.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The ECU <b>2</b> includes a conversion unit <b>21</b>, a power supply unit <b>22</b>, and an SoC <b>3</b>. The conversion unit <b>21</b> is a general term for a first conversion unit <b>211</b>, a second conversion unit <b>212</b>, and a third conversion unit <b>213</b>. Each conversion unit <b>21</b> converts the sensor output output from the corresponding sensor module into a parallel signal and outputs the parallel signal to a data processing unit <b>34</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the number of the conversion units <b>21</b> and the number of the sensor modules of the sensor module group <b>1</b> correspond to each other on a one-to-one basis, but they do not necessarily have to correspond to each other on a one-to-one basis.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The power supply unit <b>22</b> is, for example, a DC-DC converter, converts power input from the outside into an appropriate voltage, and supplies power to the conversion unit <b>21</b> and the sensor module group <b>1</b>. Although the power supplied from the outside to the power supply unit <b>22</b> is stable, it is inevitable that the voltage supplied by the power supply unit <b>22</b> is affected when the load of the sensor module group <b>1</b> fluctuates. In this case, radiation noise is generated from the transmission path <b>4</b> in accordance with the amount of change in the fluctuating voltage. For the purpose of reducing the radiation noise, a phase difference decision unit <b>32</b> adjusts the phase related to the operation of the sensor module group <b>1</b> as described later.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The SoC <b>3</b> is a system on a chip, that is, one semiconductor chip. However, it is not an essential requirement that the SoC <b>3</b> is constituted by one semiconductor chip. The SoC <b>3</b> may be implemented by a plurality of semiconductor chips or may be implemented by a microcomputer. The functional configuration described below may be implemented by a hardware circuit or may be implemented by a CPU (not illustrated) expanding a program stored in a ROM (not illustrated) in a RAM (not illustrated).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The SoC <b>3</b> includes an acquisition unit <b>31</b>, a phase difference decision unit <b>32</b>, a control unit <b>33</b>, a data processing unit <b>34</b>, and a vehicle travel control unit <b>35</b>. The control unit <b>33</b> is a general term for a first control unit <b>331</b>, a second control unit <b>332</b>, and a third control unit <b>333</b>. The acquisition unit <b>31</b> acquires a feature amount related to the magnitude of radiation noise from the sensor module group <b>1</b> via the power supply unit <b>22</b>. In the present embodiment, the variation amount of the voltage supplied by the power supply unit <b>22</b> is set as a feature amount. More specifically, the power supply unit <b>22</b> outputs the instantaneous value of an output voltage to the acquisition unit <b>31</b>, and the acquisition unit <b>31</b> calculates a variation amount.

For example, the amount of phase difference to be shifted per one time is determined, and the phase is shifted a plurality of times within a specified search range. The search range here is a data acquisition cycle, that is, 16.7 milliseconds in the example in the present embodiment.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In subsequent step S<b>73</b>, the phase difference decision unit <b>32</b> determines whether or not the feature amount calculated by the acquisition unit <b>31</b> has decreased due to the phase difference change in step S<b>72</b>.

The phase difference decision unit <b>32</b> proceeds to step S<b>74</b> upon determining that the voltage fluctuation amount has decreased and returns to step S<b>72</b> when determining that the voltage fluctuation amount has not decreased. In step S<b>74</b>, the phase difference decision unit <b>32</b> saves the information of the phase difference changed in step S<b>72</b> in a register or the like.

When the configuration information matching the acquired configuration information is not stored in the data saving unit <b>23</b>, the configuration verification unit <b>8</b> causes the phase difference decision unit <b>32</b> to perform calculation and adds the calculation result and the acquired configuration information to the data saving unit <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">According to the present modification, it is possible to read the phase difference calculated in the past, and it is not necessary to perform calculation by the phase difference decision unit <b>32</b> as long as the configuration is the same.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="1">Third Modification of Second Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The second embodiment has exemplified the case where the data saving unit <b>23</b> is built in the ECU <b>2</b>. However, a storage medium may be prepared outside the ECU <b>2</b> and used as the data saving unit <b>23</b>. In this case, the ECU <b>2</b> has a connection interface for the data saving unit <b>23</b> instead of the data saving unit <b>23</b>.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The third embodiment of an electronic control device will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. In the following description, the same components as those of the first embodiment are denoted by the same reference numerals, and differences will be mainly described. Those which are not specifically described are the same as in the first embodiment. The present embodiment is different from the first embodiment mainly in that phase adjustment is performed in accordance with the situation after the activation of the ECU.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is an overall configuration diagram of an in-vehicle system S<b>3</b> including an ECU <b>2</b> which is an electronic control device. The in-vehicle system S<b>3</b> is different in that a data processing unit <b>34</b> includes a change detection unit <b>341</b>. The change detection unit <b>341</b> detects a change in the operating condition of each sensor by using the sensor information received from a sensor module group <b>1</b>. Upon detecting a change in the operating condition of each sensor, the change detection unit <b>341</b> causes the phase difference decision unit <b>32</b> to adjust the phase difference. This is based on the idea that when the operating condition of the sensor changes, a processing period <b>51</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> changes and the timing at which the power consumption of each sensor module of the sensor module group <b>1</b> increases or decreases is also affected, and hence the phase needs to be adjusted again even after the activation of the ECU <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Various methods can be used for the detection of a change in operating condition by the change detection unit <b>341</b>. In this case, a case where the sensor <b>111</b> is a camera and a case where the sensor is a laser range scanner will be specifically exemplified.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the case where the sensor <b>111</b> is a camera and the sensor output is a captured image, the change detection unit <b>341</b> detects a change in operation condition with reference to the luminance of the captured image. For example, by detecting that the average value of the luminance of the captured image is low, it is estimated that the operation condition of the exposure time has changed. This is based on the premise that the exposure time is automatically adjusted to be long by automatic adjustment of the camera since the amount of light per unit time which enters the imaging device decreases when the surroundings become dark.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the case where the sensor <b>111</b> is a laser range scanner and the sensor output is a distance to an obstacle at a predetermined angular interval, the change detection unit <b>341</b> detects a change in operating condition with reference to the number of data included in the sensor output. This is because a change in the number of data means an increase or decrease in the scanning range of the laser range scanner, and hence the processing period <b>51</b> changes.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">According to the third embodiment described above, the following operational effects can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">(8) The ECU <b>2</b> includes the change detection unit <b>341</b> that detects a change in the operating condition of each of the plurality of sensors. When change detection unit <b>341</b> detects a change, the phase difference decision unit <b>32</b> decides a phase difference. Therefore, the ECU <b>2</b> can set the phase difference of the data acquisition cycle of the sensor module group <b>1</b> not only at the time of activation of the ECU <b>2</b> but also as necessary.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">(9) The sensors of the sensor module group <b>1</b> include a camera. The change detection unit <b>341</b> detects a change in the operating condition of the sensor by referring to the luminance of a captured image which is the sensor output of the sensor which is a camera. Therefore, for example, when the vehicle travels from a sunny environment into a dark tunnel and the exposure time of the camera becomes long, the phase difference of the data acquisition cycle is set again, and the radiation noise is reduced.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In the above-described embodiments and modifications, the configuration of the functional block is merely an example.
