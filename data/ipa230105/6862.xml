At process <b>201</b>, the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> receives a packet from an electronic device, such as desktop <b>121</b>, mobile device <b>122</b> and laptop <b>123</b>. The electronic device is connected to WAPR <b>101</b> through a first SSID. The first SSID is associated with a VPN, such as end-to-end connection <b>110</b>. It is possible that there is a plurality of SSID enabled and a plurality of VPN established. end-to-end connection <b>110</b> is created based on a first VPN profile. Alternatively, the first SSID is associated with the first VPN profile. As long as the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> is able to associate the first SSID with aggregated end-to-end connection <b>110</b>, the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> is then able to forward the packet to a network device, such as network device <b>102</b>, through the first VPN at process <b>202</b>. There is no difference whether the first SSID is associated with, assigned for or configured for the first VPN. There is also no difference whether the first VPN is associated with, assigned for or configured for the first SSID. As long as the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> is able to forward packets sent to the first SSID to the first VPN, association, assignment, configuration or similar actions may be performed between the first SSID and the first VPN. There is also no limitation that there is one SSID and one VPN association. For example, there may be a second SSID associated with a second VPN, such that the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> will forward packets sent to the second SSID to the second VPN.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Packets received from electronic devices connecting to the first SSID will all be forwarded to network device <b>102</b> through aggregated end-to-end connection <b>110</b>. Alternatively, the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> will forward some of the packets to network device <b>102</b> through aggregated end-to-end connection <b>110</b> and forward some of the packets not through aggregated end-to-end connection <b>110</b> based on one or more outbound policies.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In one example, the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> has assigned or created a logical network interface for the first SSID when the first SSID is enabled. The processor of WAPR <b>101</b> has also assigned or created another logical network interface for the VPN or the aggregated end-to-end connection when the VPN or the aggregated end-to-end connection is established. The processor of WAPR <b>101</b> may then forward packets received from the logical network interface for the first SSID to the logical network interface for the VPN or the aggregated end-to-end connection. Such that, there is no need to use VLAN or tag to distinguish the packets sent to the first SSID. There is also no need to create an outbound policy based on the internet protocol (IP) address or media access control (MAC) address of the electronic devices, which sends the packets to the first SSID.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a flowchart illustrating processes of enabling or disabling a SSID according to one of the embodiments of the present invention. At process <b>301</b>, the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> creates or receives a VPN profile. The VPN profile may be created according to the information inputted by the administrator of WAPR <b>101</b> or information received from a remote server. The VPN profile may also be received from the administrator of WAPR <b>101</b> or received from a remote server. The VPN profile may comprise information, such as IP address of WAPR <b>101</b>, WAN interface of WAPR <b>101</b>, IP address of network device <b>102</b>, security protocol, password and security certificate, to facilitate the creation of a VPN, For illustrative purposes, the VPN profile is to establish a VPN between WAPR <b>101</b> and network device <b>102</b>. In one example, the VPN profile comprises information to create an aggregated end-to-end connection, and the information may include IP addresses of a plurality of WAN interfaces of WAPR <b>101</b> and/or IP addresses of a plurality of WAN interfaces of network device <b>102</b>. In one example, the VPN profile comprises information to identify a cellular modem of WAPR <b>101</b> or the WAN connection established using the cellular modem.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">At process <b>302</b>, the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> creates a SSID based on a string and SSID related parameters, such as password, authentication server information and authentication method. The string and parameters may be provided by the administrator of WAPR <b>101</b> or retrieved from a remote server.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">At process <b>303</b>, the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> associates the SSID with the VPN profile. The association may be indicated by storing information in a computer-readable storage. The association may also be indicated by configuring the routing table of WAPR <b>101</b>. The association may also be achieved by creating an outbound policy. The association may also be achieved by forwarding packets received from the logical network interface of the SSID to the logical network interface of the VPN to be created according to the VPN profile.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">At process <b>304</b>, the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> creates a VPN according to the VPN profile. The VPN may comprise one tunnel only. A tunnel may be established between a WAN interface of WAPR <b>101</b> and a WAN interface of network device <b>102</b>. The VPN may comprise a plurality of tunnels, such that the VPN is aggregated end-to-end connection. The plurality of tunnels may be established using one or more WAN interfaces of WAPR <b>101</b> and one or more WAN interfaces of network device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">At process <b>305</b>, the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> decides whether the VPN is created and successfully established. If the VPN is successfully established, the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> will enable the SSID at step <b>306</b>. If the VPN is not successfully established, the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> will disable the SSID at process <b>307</b>. In one variant, process <b>305</b> is performed continuously in order to detect if the VPN is still established.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">When a SSID is enabled, the SSID may allow electronic devices to connect to it. The SSID may be broadcasted. Alternatively, the SSID may be hidden and only allow those electronic devices already know the SSID to connect to it. On the other hand, when the SSID is disabled, the SSID may not allow electronic devices to connect to it. The SSID may not be broadcasted. When the SSID is created at process <b>302</b>, the SSID may not be enabled yet.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one variant, processes <b>306</b> or <b>307</b> are not performed immediately after process <b>305</b>. The processor of WAPR <b>101</b> may wait for a time threshold in order to ensure the VPN is indeed established or not established. It is common that a VPN may be interrupted momentarily. If a SSID is immediately disabled after a VPN becomes unstable, electronic devices connected to the SSID may lose connection and may connect to another SSID. The preferred time threshold should be smaller than 3 seconds and not more than 5 minutes. The waiting time using the time threshold may help to reduce the possibility that the SSID is toggled between being enabled and being disabled in a short period of time.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, when the VPN is created using an aggregated end-to-end connection and one of the tunnels is established using a cellular connection, the performance of the aggregated end-to-end connections may fluctuate as performance of a cellular connection may not be stable. When the aggregated end-to-end connection is not established, the SSID may then be disabled. In one variant, even the aggregated end-to-end connections are still established but the network performance of the aggregated end-to-end is not satisfactory, the SSID may then be disabled. The network performance may be based on latency, packet drops, bandwidth and errors. The level of satisfaction may be configured by the administrator of WAPR <b>101</b> and/or retrieved from a remote server.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one variant, after processes <b>306</b> or <b>307</b>, process <b>305</b> will be performed again in order to monitor the status of the VPN and allow the SSID to be re-enabled or to be disabled as the status of VPN changes.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one variant, instead of disabling the SSID at process <b>307</b>, the SSID is still enabled but is not broadcasted. In one variant, instead of disabling the SSID at process <b>307</b>, the SSID is still broadcasted but will not accept connections. In one variant, instead of disabling the SSID at process <b>307</b>, the SSID is still broadcasted and accepts connections, but the processor will not forward packets.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">There is no limitation that all the processes must be performed sequentially or in the order illustrated. For example, process <b>302</b> may be performed before process <b>301</b>; and process <b>304</b> may be performed right after process <b>301</b>. Therefore, before a SSID is associated with the VPN profile/connection, the VPN based on the VPN profile is already established. In another example, processes <b>301</b> and <b>302</b> may be performed together and the administrator may create the VPN profile and SSID on the same web page or using one single command.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a flowchart illustrating processes of enabling or disabling a SSID according to one of the embodiments of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, except the addition of process <b>310</b>. At process <b>310</b>, an outbound policy is created or enabled to associate the SSID with the VPN by the processor of WAPR <b>101</b>. Alternatively, the outbound policy may be inputted by the administrator of WAPR <b>101</b> or retrieved from a remote server. In one variant, after the outbound policy is created, the outbound policy is not enforced until the VPN is established. The outbound policy may be a set of instructions for the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> directly, or a set of instructions to a network processor of WAPR <b>101</b>, a set of routing rules being executed by the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> or the network processor of WAPR <b>101</b>. It is also possible to have the outbound policy first being executed by the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> and then executed by the network processor of WAPR <b>101</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating processes of using outbound policy for forwarding packets according to the embodiments of the present invention. At process <b>401</b>, WAPR <b>101</b> receives a packet. At process <b>402</b>, the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> determines if the packet is received from a first SSID. If the packet is received from the first SSID, the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> determines if the packet satisfies all conditions of an outbound policy for the SSID, if there is a such outbound policy and the packet does not satisfy the conditions, process <b>411</b> will be performed. Otherwise process <b>404</b> will be performed to forward the packet to network device <b>102</b> through a VPN or an aggregated end-to-end connection, such as aggregated end-to-end <b>110</b>, configured for the SSID at process <b>303</b>. If the packet is not received from the first SSID, process <b>410</b> will be performed. The outbound policy at process <b>403</b> may be based on many factors, including destination IP address, source IP address, source IP port number, destination IP port number, MAC address of the electronic device sending the packet, protocol, time, and availability of a WAN interface. In one variant, the outbound policy is to forward all packets received by the first SSID to the VPN.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">At process <b>410</b>, the processor of WAPR <b>101</b> determines if the packet, which is not received by a SSID, satisfied all conditions of one of the outbound policies, If the packet satisfies with all conditions of one of the outbound policies, process <b>411</b> will be performed and the packet will be forwarded according to the satisfied outbound policy. If the packet does not satisfy any of the outbound policies, process <b>412</b> will be performed and the packet will be forwarded according to a default policy.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">When the packet satisfies all conditions of a plurality of outbound policy, the outbound policy that has the higher priority will be enforced.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates memory structure for logical network interfaces of a WAPR according to one of the embodiments of the present invention.
