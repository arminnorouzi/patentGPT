When the number of charge and discharge cycles reaches a specified number, the capacity retention is required to be a prescribed value or more. In the above-described power storage system, the target temperature range in the housing is determined in advance. However, the deterioration rate of the storage capacity may change in accordance with the temperature inside the housing. Therefore, from the viewpoint of securing the capacity retention at the specified number of cycles, there is a possibility that appropriate temperature management is not performed, and there is room for improvement.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure describes a power management device and a power storage system capable of improving temperature management in a housing.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A power management device according to one aspect of the present disclosure is a device for controlling a temperature inside a housing in a power storage system. The power storage system includes a power storage device including a storage battery and the housing for housing the power storage device. The power management device includes an acquisition unit that acquires status information indicating a status of the power storage system; a calculation unit that calculates a target temperature in the housing based on an allowable capacity deterioration rate of the storage battery; and an air volume control unit that controls an air volume of a fan provided in the housing based on the status information and the target temperature.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this power management device, the air volume of the fan is controlled based on the status information indicating the status of the power storage system and the target temperature in the housing. The target temperature in the housing is calculated based on the allowable capacity deterioration rate of the storage battery. Since the allowable capacity deterioration rate is set to a value capable of securing the capacity retention in the specified number of cycles, an appropriate target temperature can be obtained from the viewpoint of the capacity retention. As a result, the temperature management in the housing can be improved.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The acquisition unit may include a first acquisition unit that acquires an ambient temperature of the housing as the status information, and a second acquisition unit that acquires a calorific value in the housing as the status information. The ambient temperature of the housing and the calorific value in the housing may affect the temperature in the housing. Therefore, it is possible to further improve the temperature management in the housing by considering the ambient temperature of the housing and the calorific value in the housing.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The power management device may further include a charge/discharge control unit that controls charging and discharging of the storage battery. The calculation unit may further calculate an upper limit depth of charge of the storage battery based on the allowable capacity deterioration rate. The charge/discharge control unit may charge the storage battery at the upper limit depth of charge. The upper limit depth of charge of the storage battery may affect the deterioration rate of the storage capacity. Therefore, for example, by charging the storage battery at the upper limit depth of charge that satisfies the allowable capacity deterioration rate, it is possible to secure the capacity retention in the specified number of cycles.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The storage battery may include a plurality of battery cells. The charge/discharge control unit may charge each of the plurality of battery cells at the upper limit depth of charge. The upper limit depth of charge of the battery cell may affect the deterioration rate of the storage capacity of the battery cell. Therefore, by charging each battery cell at the upper limit depth of charge, it is possible to secure the capacity retention in the specified number of cycles.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The air volume control unit may calculate a required air volume based on the status information and the target temperature, and may control the fan based on the required air volume. For example, the temperature inside the housing can be set to the target temperature by adjusting the air volume of the fan to satisfy the required air volume.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The calculation unit may increase the target temperature within a range satisfying the allowable capacity deterioration rate when the required air volume cannot be obtained by the fan. The higher the target temperature is, the smaller the required air volume is. Therefore, by raising the target temperature, it is possible to increase the possibility of obtaining the required air volume.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A power storage system according to another aspect of the present disclosure includes a power storage device including a storage battery; a housing that houses the power storage device; a fan provided in the housing; and a power management device that controls a temperature in the housing. The power management device controls an air volume of the fan based on a target temperature in the housing calculated based on an allowable capacity deterioration rate of the storage battery and status information indicating a status of the power storage system.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this power storage system, the air volume of the fan is controlled based on the status information indicating the status of the power storage system and the target temperature in the housing.

In Example 2, since the number of operating fans was one, the electric power consumption was 0.25. In Examples 3 to 5, the number of operating fans was one, but the temperature in the rack was lower than the target temperature by 10 degrees C. or more, and the fans were temporarily stopped. Therefore, the electric power consumption of Example 3 was 0.22, and the electric power consumptions of Examples 4 and 5 were 0.17. As described above, compared with the electric power consumption of Comparative Example 1, in Examples 1 to 5, the electric power consumption could be reduced to half or less.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0111">In the power management device <b>10</b> and the power storage system <b>100</b> described above, the air volume of the fan <b>23</b> is controlled based on the status information indicating the status of the power storage system <b>100</b> and the target temperature in the rack <b>20</b>. The target temperature in the rack <b>20</b> is calculated based on the allowable capacity deterioration rate of the storage battery <b>71</b>. Since the allowable capacity deterioration rate is set to a value capable of securing the capacity retention in the specified number of cycles, an appropriate target temperature can be obtained from the viewpoint of the capacity retention (improvement in cycle characteristics). As a result, the temperature management in the rack <b>20</b> can be improved.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0112">The ambient temperature of the rack <b>20</b> and the calorific value in the rack <b>20</b> may affect the temperature in the rack <b>20</b>.

Therefore, by charging the storage battery <b>71</b> at the upper limit depth of charge that satisfies the allowable capacity deterioration rate, it is possible to secure the capacity retention in the specified number of cycles.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0114">The upper limit depth of charge of the battery cell may affect the degradation rate of the storage capacity of the battery cell.

Therefore, by raising the target temperature, it is possible to increase the possibility of obtaining the required air volume.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0117">Further, since the required air volume and the upper limit depth of charge are appropriately calculated according to the status of the power storage system <b>100</b>, it is possible to reduce the electric power consumptions of the fans <b>23</b>.
