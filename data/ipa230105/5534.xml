Information is stored by programing different states of a memory device. For example, binary devices have two states, often denoted by a logic &#x201c;1&#x201d; or a logic &#x201c;0.&#x201d; In other systems, more than two states may be stored. To access the stored information, a component of the electronic device may read, or sense, the stored state in the memory device. To store information, a component of the electronic device may write, or program, the state in the memory device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various types of memory devices exist, including magnetic hard disks, random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), dynamic RAM (DRAM), synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM), ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM), magnetic RAM (MRAM), resistive RAM (RRAM), flash memory, phase change memory (PCM), and others. Memory devices may be volatile or non-volatile. Non-volatile memory, e.g., FeRAM, may maintain their stored logic state for extended periods of time even in the absence of an external power source. Volatile memory devices, e.g., DRAM, may lose their stored state over time unless they are periodically refreshed by an external power source. FeRAM may use similar device architectures as volatile memory but may have non-volatile properties due to the use of a ferroelectric capacitor as a storage device. FeRAM devices may thus have improved performance compared to other non-volatile and volatile memory devices.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Improving memory devices, generally, may include increasing memory cell density, increasing read/write speeds, increasing reliability, increasing data retention, reducing power consumption, or reducing manufacturing costs, among other metrics. Access operations may result in a voltage transfer between adjacent selected and unselected memory cells due to bit lines being coupled with multiple word lines. Such a migration may result in reduced reliability relating to subsequent reading of the memory cell, and in some instances may result in data loss.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example of a memory array that supports self-selecting memory with horizontal access lines in accordance with examples of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrate an example self-selecting memory array that includes horizontal access lines in accordance with examples of the present disclosure</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> through <b>6</b></figref> illustrate example self-selecting memory arrays that include horizontal access lines in accordance with examples of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A through <b>7</b>E</figref> illustrate an example method of forming a self-selecting memory array that includes horizontal access lines in accordance with examples of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A through <b>8</b>E</figref> illustrate an example method of forming a self-selecting memory array that includes horizontal access lines in accordance with examples of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of a system including a memory array that supports self-selecting memory array with horizontal access lines in accordance with examples of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> through <b>13</b></figref> illustrate methods of forming self-selecting memory array with horizontal access lines in accordance with examples of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Selected and unselected memory cells may be susceptible to a voltage transfer between the cell groups. Accordingly, access operations may cause the unwanted voltage transfer, which may result in reduced reliability when reading the stored logic state of the memory cell. In some examples, the voltage transfer may result complete or partial data loss of one or more memory cells. Thus, an architecture that prevents, or minimizes, a voltage transfer between adjacent selected and unselected cells may allow for increased reliability during an access operation (e.g., a read operation), and may prevent data loss of the memory cell.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a first example, a memory array may include a plurality of first and second access lines extending in different directions. The access lines may intersect, resulting in a three-dimensional memory array that includes a plurality of memory cells. The memory cells may be located at (e.g., directly at, next to) each intersection (e.g., at an intersection of a first access line and a second access line), and may each include a self-selecting material in some cases. For example, a first memory cell may exist at or next to the intersection of a first access line of the first plurality of access lines and a first access line of the second plurality of access lines. And a second memory cell may exist at the intersection of the first access line and a second access line of the second plurality of access lines. As described above, each of the memory cells may include a self-selecting memory. Stated alternatively, the self-selecting memory of each memory cell may be in contact with each access line at the intersection of the lines (e.g., an intersection of a first access line and a second access line), and may possess certain resistive properties that affect access operations (e.g., reading from and writing to) relating to each memory cell.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some examples, a dielectric material may separate at least a first memory cell of a first plurality of memory cells and a second memory cell of a second plurality of memory cells in at least one direction (e.g., a horizontal direction). By including a dielectric material between the memory cells, each memory cell may be in contact with one first access line and one second access line. Stated alternatively, exactly one memory cell may be selected by activating a single word line (e.g., a second access line) and a single digit line (e.g., first access line). Accordingly, the presence of the dielectric material may isolate different memory cells (e.g., included as part of different pluralities of memory cells) that would otherwise be in communication via a shared access line.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In other examples, a memory array may be formed. The memory array may be formed by first forming a three-dimensional stack of materials, which may include a first, second, and third dielectric material. The dielectric materials may be formed (e.g., layered) such that the first dielectric material is located on a first side (e.g., the top) of the stack and the third dielectric material is located on a second side (e.g., the bottom) of the stack. A first material removal process may then occur, resulting in a plurality of lines etched through at least the first and second dielectric materials in a first direction (e.g., in an &#x201c;Y&#x201d; direction). Subsequently, a second material removal process may occur, resulting in plurality of lines etched through the first dielectric material in a second direction (e.g., a &#x201c;Z&#x201d; direction that goes in and out of the depicted page, such as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>). This may result in orthogonal lines (e.g., channels) etched in to the stack.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some examples, access lines (e.g., first access lines and second access lines as described above) may be formed within the orthogonal lines. For example, a first plurality of access lines may be formed that are in contact with remaining portions of the first dielectric material. A self-selecting material may be deposited, after the formation of the first plurality of access lines, to form a plurality of memory cells. Subsequently, a plurality of second access lines may be formed that are in contact with the self-selecting memory. Similar to the architecture described above, forming a memory array in such a manner may result in one memory cell located at the intersection of a single word line (e.g., a second access line) and a single digit line (e.g., a first access line). Accordingly, the presence of the dielectric material may isolate other, distinct memory cells (e.g., included as part of different groups or pluralities of memory cells) that would otherwise be in communication via a shared access line.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further features of the disclosure broadly introduced above are described below in the context of memory arrays that support self-selecting memory with horizontal access lines. These and other features of the disclosure are further-illustrated by and described with reference to apparatus diagrams, system diagrams, method-of-formation diagrams, and flowcharts that relate to self-selecting memory with horizontal access lines.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example memory array <b>100</b> that supports self-selecting memory with horizontal access lines in accordance with examples of the present disclosure. Memory array <b>100</b> may also be referred to as a memory device, or an electronic memory apparatus. Memory array <b>100</b> includes memory cells <b>105</b> that are programmable to store different states. In some examples, the memory cells <b>105</b> may be self-selecting memory cells. Each memory cell <b>105</b> may be programmable to store two states, denoted as a logic 0 and a logic 1. In some cases, memory cell <b>105</b> may be configured to store more than two logic states.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">A memory cell <b>105</b> may include a material, which may be referred to as a memory element, memory storage element, or a self-selecting memory storage element that has a variable and configurable electrical resistance (e.g., a variable and configurable threshold voltage) that is representative of the logic states. For example, a material with a crystalline or an amorphous atomic configuration may have different electrical resistances. A crystalline state may have a low electrical resistance and may, in some cases, be referred to as the &#x201c;set&#x201d; state. An amorphous state may have a high electrical resistance and may be referred to as the &#x201c;reset&#x201d; state. A voltage applied to the memory cell <b>105</b> may thus result in different currents depending on whether the material is in a crystalline or an amorphous state, and the magnitude of the resulting current may be used to determine the logic state stored by memory cell <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some cases, different internal states may be associated with a threshold voltage&#x2014;that is, current flows after the threshold voltage is exceed. For example, self-selecting memory may enhance differences in a threshold voltage of the memory cell between different programmed states. Thus, if the applied voltage is less than the threshold voltage, no current may flow if the memory element is in the amorphous (e.g., reset) state; if the memory element is in the crystalline (e.g., set) state, it may have a different threshold voltage and, thus, a current may flow in response to the applied voltage. In some examples, the memory element in the set state (e.g., having a low threshold voltage) may not be in a crystalline state, but rather may be in an amorphous state.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">To program a memory cell <b>105</b> with a self-selecting memory element, programming pulses of different polarities may be applied to the memory cell <b>105</b>. For example, to program a logic &#x201c;1&#x201d; state, a first polarity may be applied and to program a logic &#x201c;0&#x201d; state, a second polarity may be applied. The first polarity and the second polarity may be opposite polarities. To read a memory cell <b>105</b> with a self-selecting memory storage element, a voltage may be applied across memory cell <b>105</b> and the resulting current or the threshold voltage at which current begins to flow may be representative of a logic &#x201c;1&#x201d; or a logic &#x201c;0&#x201d; state. The crowding of charges, ions, and/or elements at one or another end of the memory storage element may affect the conduction properties and thus the threshold voltage. In some examples, a threshold voltage of a cell may depend on a polarity used to program the cell. For example, a self-selecting memory cell programmed with one polarity may have certain resistive properties and thus one threshold voltage. And that self-selecting memory cell may be programmed with a different polarity that may result in different resistive properties of the cell and thus a different threshold voltage. Thus, when a self-selecting memory cell is programmed, elements within the cell may separate, causing ion migration. Ions may migrate towards a particular electrode, depending on the given cell's polarity. For example, in a self-selecting memory cell, some ions may migrate towards the negative electrode. The memory cell may then be read by applying a voltage across the cell to sense which electrode ions have migrated towards.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In other cases, the memory cell <b>105</b> may have a combination of crystalline and amorphous areas that may result in intermediate resistances, which may correspond to different logic states (i.e., states other than logic 1 or logic 0) and may allow memory cells <b>105</b> to store more than two different logic states. As discussed below, the logic state of a memory cell <b>105</b> may be set by heating, including melting, the memory element.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Memory array <b>100</b> may be a three-dimensional (3D) memory array, where two-dimensional (2D) memory arrays are formed on top of one another. This may increase the number of memory cells that may be formed on a single die or substrate as compared with 2D arrays, which in turn may reduce production costs or increase the performance of the memory array, or both. According to the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the memory array <b>100</b> may include two decks of memory cells <b>105</b> and may thus be considered a three-dimensional memory array; however, the number of decks is not limited to two. Each deck may be aligned or positioned so that memory cells <b>105</b> may be approximately aligned with one another across each deck, forming a memory cell stack <b>145</b>. Alternatively, for example, memory array <b>100</b> may include two decks of memory cells <b>105</b> in which the pitch of the first deck may be different than the pitch of the second deck. The pitch of the first deck, for example, may be smaller than the pitch of the second deck.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to the example, of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, each row of memory cells <b>105</b> may be connected to an access line <b>110</b>, and each column of memory cells <b>105</b> may be connected to a bit line <b>115</b>. Access lines <b>110</b> may also be known as word lines <b>110</b>, and bit lines <b>115</b> may also be known as digit lines <b>115</b>. Word lines <b>110</b>, bit lines <b>115</b>, and digit lines <b>115</b> may each be referred to as access lines. References to word lines and bit lines, or their analogues, are interchangeable without loss of understanding or operation. Word lines <b>110</b> and bit lines <b>115</b> may be substantially perpendicular to one another to create memory array <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the two memory cells <b>105</b> in a memory cell stack <b>145</b> may share a common conductive line such as a digit line <b>115</b>. That is, a digit line <b>115</b> may be in electronic communication with the bottom electrode of the upper memory cell <b>105</b> and the top electrode of the lower memory cell <b>105</b>. In some cases, (not shown) each array may have its own access lines; e.g., each array may have word lines and digit lines that are not in commons with access lines coupled to different arrays. Other configurations may be possible; for example, a third layer may share a word line <b>110</b> with a lower layer.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some examples, each word line <b>110</b> may be in communication with a plurality of memory cells <b>105</b>. For example, a first plurality of memory cells <b>105</b> may be in contact with a first access line of a plurality of second access lines <b>110</b> (e.g., word lines <b>110</b>), and a second plurality of memory cells <b>105</b> may be in contact with a second access line of a plurality of second access lines <b>110</b> (e.g., word lines <b>110</b>). Each memory cell <b>105</b> may be further coupled (e.g., in contact with) a first access line <b>115</b> (e.g., a digit line) and separated by a dielectric material. Thus, in some examples, the first plurality of memory cells <b>105</b> and the second plurality of memory cells <b>105</b> may be positioned between the first access line of the plurality of second access lines <b>110</b> (e.g., word line <b>110</b>) and the second access line of the plurality of second access line <b>110</b> (e.g., word line <b>110</b>). Accordingly, the presence of dielectric material may ensure that each memory cell <b>105</b> is in contact with exactly one word line <b>110</b> and one bit line <b>115</b> such that different memory cells (e.g., of different memory cell groups) may be active and unselected at a same time.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In general, one memory cell <b>105</b> may be located at the intersection of two conductive lines such as a word line <b>110</b> and a bit line <b>115</b>. This intersection may be referred to as a memory cell's address. A target memory cell <b>105</b> may be a memory cell <b>105</b> located at the intersection of an energized word line <b>110</b> and bit line <b>115</b>; that is, a word line <b>110</b> and bit line <b>115</b> may be energized in order to read or write a memory cell <b>105</b> at their intersection. Other memory cells <b>105</b> that are in electronic communication with (e.g., connected to) the same word line <b>110</b> or bit line <b>115</b> may be referred to as untargeted memory cells <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">As discussed above, electrodes may be coupled to a memory cell <b>105</b> and a word line <b>110</b> or a bit line <b>115</b>. The term electrode may refer to an electrical conductor, and in some cases, may be employed as an electrical contact to a memory cell <b>105</b>. An electrode may include a trace, wire, conductive line, conductive layer, or the like that provides a conductive path between elements or components of memory array <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Operations such as reading and writing may be performed on memory cells <b>105</b> by activating or selecting a word line <b>110</b> and bit line <b>115</b>, which may include applying a voltage or a current to the respective line. Additionally, read and write operations may be performed on both the first memory deck and second memory deck by activating a word line <b>110</b> or a bit line <b>115</b>. Word lines <b>110</b> and bit lines <b>115</b> may be made of conductive materials, such as metals (e.g., copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), gold (Au), tungsten (W), titanium (Ti), etc.), metal alloys, carbon, conductively-doped semiconductors, or other conductive materials, alloys, or compounds. Accessing memory cells <b>105</b> may be controlled through a row decoder <b>120</b> and a column decoder <b>130</b>. For example, a row decoder <b>120</b> may receive a row address from the memory controller <b>140</b> and activate the appropriate word line <b>110</b> based on the received row address. Similarly, a column decoder <b>130</b> may receive a column address from the memory controller <b>140</b> and activate the appropriate bit line <b>115</b>. Thus, by activating a word line <b>110</b> and a bit line <b>115</b>, a memory cell <b>105</b> may be accessed.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Upon accessing, a memory cell <b>105</b> may be read, or sensed, by sense component <b>125</b> to determine the stored state of the memory cell <b>105</b>. Additionally, sense component <b>125</b> may determine the stored state of a memory cell <b>105</b>. Sense component <b>125</b> may include various transistors or amplifiers in order to detect and amplify a difference in the signals, which may be referred to as latching. The detected logic state of memory cell <b>105</b> may then be output through column decoder <b>130</b> as input/output <b>135</b>. In some cases, sense component <b>125</b> may be a part of column decoder <b>130</b> or row decoder <b>120</b>. Or, sense component <b>125</b> may be connected to or in electronic communication with column decoder <b>130</b> or row decoder <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">A memory cell <b>105</b> may be set, or written, by similarly activating the relevant word line <b>110</b> and bit line <b>115</b>&#x2014;i.e., a logic value may be stored in the memory cell <b>105</b>. Column decoder <b>130</b> or row decoder <b>120</b> may accept data, for example input/output <b>135</b>, to be written to the memory cells <b>105</b>. Additionally, a first memory deck and a second memory deck may be individually written by activating the relevant word line <b>110</b> and bit line <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some memory architectures, accessing the memory cell <b>105</b> may degrade or destroy the stored logic state and re-write or refresh operations may be performed to return the original logic state to memory cell <b>105</b>. In DRAM, for example, the logic-storing capacitor may be partially or completely discharged during a sense operation, corrupting the stored logic state. So the logic state may be re-written after a sense operation. Additionally, activating a single word line <b>110</b> may result in the discharge of all memory cells in the row; thus, all memory cells <b>105</b> in the row may need to be re-written. But in non-volatile memory, such as PCM and/or a self-selecting memory accessing the memory cell <b>105</b> may not destroy the logic state and, thus, the memory cell <b>105</b> may not require re-writing after accessing.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Some memory architectures, including DRAM, may lose their stored state over time unless they are periodically refreshed by an external power source. For example, a charged capacitor may become discharged over time through leakage currents, resulting in the loss of the stored information. The refresh rate of these so-called volatile memory devices may be relatively high, e.g., tens of refresh operations per second for DRAM, which may result in significant power consumption. With increasingly larger memory arrays, increased power consumption may inhibit the deployment or operation of memory arrays (e.g., power supplies, heat generation, material limits, etc.), especially for mobile devices that rely on a finite power source, such as a battery. As discussed below, non-volatile PCM and/or self-selecting memory cells may have beneficial properties that may result in improved performance relative to other memory architectures. For example, PCM and/or self-selecting memory may offer comparable read/write speeds as DRAM but may be non-volatile and allow for increased cell density.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The memory controller <b>140</b> may control the operation (read, write, re-write, refresh, discharge, etc.) of memory cells <b>105</b> through the various components, for example, row decoder <b>120</b>, column decoder <b>130</b>, and sense component <b>125</b>. In some cases, one or more of the row decoder <b>120</b>, column decoder <b>130</b>, and sense component <b>125</b> may be co-located with the memory controller <b>140</b>. Memory controller <b>140</b> may generate row and column address signals in order to activate the desired word line <b>110</b> and bit line <b>115</b>. Memory controller <b>140</b> may also generate and control various voltages or currents used during the operation of memory array <b>100</b>. For example, it may apply discharge voltages to a word line <b>110</b> or bit line <b>115</b> after accessing one or more memory cells <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In general, the amplitude, polarity, shape, or duration of an applied voltage or current discussed herein may be adjusted or varied and may be different for the various operations discussed in operating memory array <b>100</b>.
