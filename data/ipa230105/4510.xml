Although the present disclosure may be described in the context of a serial bus/interface, it will be understood that one or more features of the present disclosure may also be utilized in other applications. For example, the examples, embodiments, implementations, and/or features described herein may be utilized with an RF front-end (RFFE) bus, an Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) bus, a serial peripheral interface (SPI), and/or other types of serial buses/interfaces.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Many wireless communication devices (e.g., a cellular handset system) use a serial bus to communicate between modules and/or components of the wireless communication devices. The use of serial buses in these wireless communication devices may allow for increased complexity of the radio-frequency (RF) front-end components and the configuration of the RF front-end (RFFE) components used in the wireless communication devices. For example, multiple configuration modes, detailed feedback, and timing synchronization may be accomplished using interface signals shared amongst multiple RF devices/components. Examples of the devices/components on that may use a serial bus may include, but are not limited to, a power amplifier (PA), a RF power supply management component/module, a low-noise amplifiers (LNA), a diplexer, a filter, a load circuit, a matching circuit, an antenna switch, and an antenna tuner.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Many devices, modules, and/or components use a serial interface to reduce the number of package pins (e.g., lines, control lines, data lines, signal lines, etc.) and associated board-level routing. For example, an RF device component and/or module may generally use two signals to communicate data, a clock signal and a data signal, as discussed in more detail below. A serial interface may increase latency in transmitting, receiving, and/or processing data (e.g., commands). For example, in order to transmit a data (e.g., data such as a command, a frame, a message, etc.) that is eight bits long, a RF device, module, and/or component may use multiple clock cycles (e.g., eight clock cycles) to transmit the data. An RF device, module, and/or component may not be able to begin transmitting additional data (e.g., new data) until the previous data has been completely transmitted, due to the serial nature of the serial interface.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Described herein are examples of coupling and/or decouple devices, components, circuits, and/or modules based on data received via a serial interface/bus, such as the RFFE interface/bus (e.g., a Mobile Industry Processor Interface (MIPI) RFFE interface/bus). In one embodiment, a module may determine whether first data is detected on a first serial data line and may determine whether second data is detected on a second serial data line. The module may adjust the configuration of one or more switches (e.g., a set of switches) to couple and/or decouple one or more devices, circuits, and/or components of the module, based on whether the first data is detected/received and whether the second data is detected/received.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of device/components (e.g., RF devices/components) coupled together via a serial bus/interface (e.g., an RFFE bus/interface), according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.

As discussed above, data may be communicated between devices (e.g., RF devices/modules illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>) via the serial bus/interface (e.g., via the SDATA). For example, a master device may transmit data to a slave device. In another example, a slave device may transmit data to a master device. In a further example, a slave device may transmit data to a slave device. The serial bus/interface may include a CLK line (used to transmit/receive a clock or CLK signal) and a SDATA line used to transmit/receive the data such as bits, messages, frames, packets, etc.). The clock signal (e.g., CLK signal) may be used to control the timing of the serial bus/interface. For example, the SDATA line may be synchronized with the clock signal. In another example, the serial bus/interface may operate at the frequency of the signal CLK (e.g., the SDATA signal line may be synchronized with the signal CLK).</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The serial bus/interface may generally include two signals/lines, the CLK signal line (used to transmit/receive the signal CLK) and the SDATA signal line (used to transmit/receive the signal SDATA). As discussed above, a command may be transmitted by a master device and may be received/processed by a slave device. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the command may a (MIPI) RFFE Register 0 Write command. The command may be transmitted and/or received using the SDATA signal line. The RFFE Register 0 Write command may include a sequence start condition (SSC), 4-bits to identify/indicate a slave device (e.g., bits SA<b>3</b>, SA<b>2</b>, SA<b>1</b>, and SA<b>0</b> that may indicate/identify the RFFE slave), one bit to identify/indicate the command/operation (e.g., the register 0 write command), 7-bits to identify/indicate the data (e.g., bits D<b>6</b>, D<b>5</b>, D<b>4</b>, D<b>3</b>, D<b>2</b>, D<b>1</b>, and DO), and one bit to identify the parity of the command. Other commands (e.g., RFFE commands) may also include one or more bytes to identify/indicate the address and data to be written into the memory address of the slave device (e.g., RFFE slave).</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">As discussed above, the serial bus/interface may be a serial bus/interface that transmit each bit of data (e.g., each bit of the command) serially (e.g., sequentially). The command (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may take 15 clock cycles to transmit (e.g., the master device may take 15 clock cycles to completely transmit the RFFE command). Thus, the slave device may wait 15 clock cycles before the slave device may decode and/or process the command because the slave device is waiting for the master device to completely transmit the command. In one example, the RFFE bus interface may operate at a rate/frequency of 52 megahertz (e.g., the signal CLK has a frequency of 52 megahertz). If the serial bus/interface operates at 52 megahertz, the latency experienced by the slave device in receiving, decoding, and/or processing the command (e.g., the delay before the RFFE slave may receive, decode, and/or process the RFFE command) may be 288 nanoseconds. Commands transmitted using a serial bus/interface that includes two signal lines (e.g., the CLK signal line and the SDATA signal line) may be in a first format (e.g., a first command format). In one embodiment, the first format may be a standardized format (e.g., an industry standard format) such as the RFFE command format. In other embodiments, other types of commands may take a different number of clock cycles to transmit. For example, a command may take 16 clock cycles (e.g., 308 ns) to transmit. In addition, if multiple modules (e.g., multiple RFFE slaves) are to be reconfigured, commands may be transmitted to each of the multiple modules. Thus, the amount of time it takes for each command transmitted to each of the multiple modules (e.g., 288 ns for each command transmitted to each of the multiple modules) may also increase the latency e.g., delay) in transmitting, receiving, processing, and/or decoding commands and/or other data that is communicated using the serial bus/interface.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">With increasing complexity in modern wireless communication devices and with users demanding ever increased speed, it may be useful to decrease the latency (e.g., delay) in transmitting, receiving, processing, and/or decoding commands and/or other data that is communicated using the serial bus/interface.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> an example command (or message) that may be used with a serial bus/interface, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. In one embodiment, the serial bus/interface may be modified to include three signals/lines (or more than three signals/lines).

Generally, a first set of the PAs <b>635</b> (e.g., WiFi PAs) may be used for WiFi and a second set of the PAs <b>635</b> (e.g., eLAA PAs) may be used for eLAA. The first and second set of PAS <b>635</b> may be controlled and/or configured using a serial bus (which includes a SDATA line and a SB_DATA line), as discussed above. The eLAA PAs may be configured and/or controlled using the SDATA line of the serial bus and WiFi PAs may be configured and/or controlled using the SDATA line and SB_DATA lines.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0177">The module <b>600</b> may use both WiFi and LTE-LAA to transmit and/or receive data. Thus, the module <b>600</b> may use both 5-6 gigahertz signals (for WiFi) and signals with other frequencies for LTE-LAA (e.g., unlicensed frequencies). Generally, separate sets of PAs may be used to amplify RF signals transmitted to an antenna by the module <b>600</b> based on a mode of the module <b>600</b> (e.g., a first set of PAs for WiFi mode and a second set of PAs LTE-LAA mode). In one embodiment, the control component <b>650</b> may be a single chip (e.g., single semiconductor die), such as a Front-End Integrated Circuit (FEIC). Using a single chip for the FEIC may allow the module <b>600</b> to operate using WiFi or LTE-LAA in a manner that is conducive to lower cost, chip-scale packaging, and a smaller form factor (for the module <b>600</b>). Moreover, the combination of signal conditioning functions on the same die allow for the usage of the same antenna for LTE-LAA and WiFi modes of operation. The FEIC may use the same set of PAs <b>635</b> for both LTE-LAA and WiFi modes of operation.</p><p id="p-0180" num="0178">In one embodiment, a signal may be used to select the mode of operation of the FEIC. For example, the FEIC may operate in an LTE-LAA mode based on a signal (or a message/command) received by the FEIC. When operating in the LTE-LAA mode, a different RF amplifier transistor output stage periphery (and the associated load matching circuit commensurate with that periphery) may be used. For example, the same set of PAs <b>635</b> that is used for WiFi mode may be selected/used when the FEIC is operating in the LTE-LAA mode and different load matching circuits may be used based on the mode (e.g., LTE-LAA mode or WiFi mode). This may allow the module <b>600</b> to be to be consistent with the back-off peak to average power level needed for adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) or other LTE centric features/capabilities. In one embodiment, allowing the FEIC to operate in LTE-LAA mode (versus WiFi mode) may allow different performance metrics to be met in in accordance the different linearity requirements of LTE (as compared to WiFi). For example, the FEIC may select the LTE-LAA mode if the system (e.g., an electronic/wireless device) called for that mode of operation. In addition, the FEIIC may use the MIPI RFFE interface rather than the standard logical interface used by WiFi. In both cases, the interface logic may be contained within the single FEIC.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0179">In one embodiment, the set of PAs (that may be used in both WiFi and LTE-LAA modes) may be switched between different peripheries on an amplification stage (e.g., a final amplification stage). For example, a switch may selectively couple the set of PAs to a first set of periphery circuits/components that are used for LTE-LAA mode or to a second set of periphery circuits/components that are used for WiFi mode. The switch (e.g., a switch module, a switch component, a switch fabric) may also include load matching for the different sets of periphery circuits/components. The serial bus described herein may allow the switch to operate more quickly and/or efficiently (e.g., may allow the switch to couple different sets of periphery circuits/components within approximately 200 nanoseconds) which may allow the same set of PAs to be used for different modes of operation (e.g, for both WiFi and LTE-LAA modes).</p><p id="p-0182" num="0180">In one embodiment, the serial bus (which includes the SDATA line and the SB_DATA line) may allow for faster switching between devices/components (e.g., faster coupling/decoupling) and/or may allow for faster configuration and/or reconfiguration of devices/components. Thus, the serial bus described herein may allow a module (e.g., an RF module) to select the modulation (linearity, complexity of the constellation, QAM) or range of the RF signal. The serial bus described herein may also allow a semiconductor power amplifier with selectable periphery on the output stage (and commensurate selectable load matching circuits/components) to be incorporate into an FEIC. Implementing the semiconductor power amplifier with selectable periphery on the output stage (and commensurate selectable load matching circuits/components) into one FEIC may increase power efficiency and may provide a smaller form factor for the module <b>600</b>.

The FE-PMIC component <b>304</b> includes a supply <b>100</b> which may be a power supply (e.g., a battery, a voltage/power source) and/or may be coupled to a power supply. Other components such as a number of surface mount technology (SMT) devices <b>314</b> and an antenna switch module (ASM) <b>312</b> can also be mounted on the packaging substrate <b>302</b>.

In the context of a module having one or more features as described herein, such a module may be generally depicted by a RF module <b>300</b> (illustrated by the dashed box), and may be implemented as, for example, a front-end module (FEM). Such a module may include a RFFE module <b>104</b> having one or more features as described herein.

The transceiver <b>410</b> is shown to interact with a baseband sub-system <b>408</b> that is configured to provide conversion between data and/or voice signals suitable for a user and RF signals suitable for the transceiver <b>410</b>. The transceiver <b>410</b> can also be in communication with a power management component <b>406</b> that is configured to manage power for the operation of the wireless device <b>400</b>. Such power management can also control operations of the baseband sub-system <b>408</b> and the RF module <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0185">The baseband sub-system <b>408</b> is shown to be connected to a user interface <b>402</b> to facilitate various input and output of voice and/or data provided to and received from the user. The baseband sub-system <b>408</b> can also be connected to a memory <b>404</b> that is configured to store data and/or instructions to facilitate the operation of the wireless device, and/or to provide storage of information for the user.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0186">In the example wireless device <b>400</b>, outputs of the PAs <b>420</b> are shown to be matched (via respective match circuits <b>422</b>) and routed to their respective duplexers <b>424</b>. Such amplified and filtered signals may be routed to an antenna <b>416</b> through an antenna switch <b>414</b> for transmission. In some embodiments, the duplexers <b>424</b> can allow transmit and receive operations to be performed simultaneously using a common antenna (e.g., <b>416</b>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, received signals are shown to be routed to &#x201c;Rx&#x201d; paths (not shown) that can include, for example, a low-noise amplifier (LNA).</p><p id="p-0189" num="0187">A number of other wireless device configurations can utilize one or more features described herein.

The process <b>900</b> may be performed by processing logic that comprises hardware (e.g., circuitry, dedicated logic, programmable logic, microcode, etc.), software (e.g., instructions run on a processor to perform hardware simulation), or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, process <b>900</b> may be performed by an RF module and/or RF device, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, and <b>6</b></figref>. For example, the process <b>900</b> may be performed by the module <b>600</b> and/or the control component <b>650</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. In addition, the process <b>900</b> could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states via a state diagram or events.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0189">The process <b>900</b> begins at block <b>905</b> where the process <b>900</b> determines whether data is detected and/or received on a first line (e.g., a first serial data line). For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b></figref>, the process <b>900</b> may determine whether first data is detected and/or received on the SDATA line. If data is not detected on the first line, the process <b>900</b> continues to block <b>905</b>. If data is detected on the first line, the process <b>900</b> determines whether data is detected and/or received on a second line (e.g., a second serial data line). For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the process <b>900</b> may determine whether second data is detected and/or received on the SB_DATA line.

If data is detected on the second line, the process <b>900</b> proceeds to block <b>915</b> where the process <b>900</b> adjusts the configuration or one or more switches based on the data detected/received on the first line and the data detected/received on the second line. In one embodiment, the process <b>900</b> may adjust the positions of the one or more switches to coupled and/or decouple various components, devices, circuits, and/or modules, as discussed above. In another embodiment, the process <b>900</b> may also configure/reconfigure and/or change the operation of various components, devices, circuits, and/or modules at block <b>915</b>, as discussed above. For example, the process <b>900</b> may change the biasing of one or more power amplifiers.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0190">In one embodiment, the process <b>900</b> may adjust the configuration of one or more switches by identifying a register based on the data detected/received on the first line and/or the data detected/received on the second line, as discussed above. The process <b>900</b> may obtain state information from the identified register, as discussed above. The process <b>900</b> may adjust the configuration of one or more switches (and/or may adjust the configuration of one or more components, devices, circuits, and/or modules) based on the state information obtained from the identified register.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0191">The present disclosure describes various features, no single one of which is solely responsible for the benefits described herein.
