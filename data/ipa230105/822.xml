Two-thirds of young adults and 90% of patients over 60 die of their disease. There are about 30,000 new cases of AML diagnosed per year in the USA, and the incidence is rising given the aging of the population. Further, AML is emerging as the leading cause of leukemia-related deaths in the US (Siegel et al., Cancer Statistics, 2021. CA: a Cancer Journal for Clinicians. 2021, 71(1):7-33)</p><p id="p-0006" num="0004">AML is a heterogeneous disease characterized by cytogenetic and molecular markers, many of which cannot be specifically targeted to date. Current therapies have plateaued in their responses and new therapies with newer mode(s) of action are urgently needed, particularly among older patients since the median age at onset is 70 years (Thein et al., Cancer, 2013, 119(15): 2720-2727). The current standard-of-care repertoire of therapies is often able to achieve remission or partial remission, but disease relapse and progression occur in the majority of cases. Most newly developed targeted therapies such as bcl-2 or IDH1/2 inhibitors do not induce durable remissions when used in isolation or combination, and many older patients are not able to undergo intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation due to higher morbidity and mortality in older individuals.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0005">IQGAP1 is a 190 kDa scaffolding protein. It regulates multiple cellular activities such as cytoskeletal organization, cell-cell adhesion, migration, transcription, and signal transduction (White et al., Cellular Signaling, 2012, 24(4): 826-834). It is over expressed in primary human AML across cytogenetic subtypes compared to normal hematopoietic stem cell controls (BloodSpot, http://servers.binf.ku.bloodspot). It is also over expressed in solid tumors such as glioma, colon-, gastric- lung-, ovarian-, and head and neck cancer (Johnson et al., Cellular Signaling, 2009, 21(10): 1471-78). Over expression is associated with an aggressive clinical course in glioma, gastric- and ovarian cancer. However, IQGAP1 null mutant mice are born at normal frequency and show no obvious defects during development or for most of their adult life8 except late-onset gastric hyperplasia suggesting that inhibition of IQGAP1 by pharmacologic means may not be very toxic.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0006">Thus, there is a need in the art for improved compositions and methods for the treatment and prevention of acute myeloid leukemia. This invention satisfies this unmet need.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0007">In one aspect, the disclosure provides methods of treating cancer in a subject.

Carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties are blocked with base labile groups such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, and acetyl, in the presence of amines that are blocked with acid labile groups, such as t-butyl carbamate, or with carbamates that are both acid and base stable but hydrolytically removable.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0095">In one embodiment, carboxylic acid and hydroxy reactive moieties are blocked with hydrolytically removable protective groups such as the benzyl group, while amine groups capable of hydrogen bonding with acids are blocked with base labile groups such as Fmoc. Carboxylic acid reactive moieties are protected by conversion to simple ester compounds as exemplified herein, which include conversion to alkyl esters, or are blocked with oxidatively-removable protective groups such as 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl, while co-existing amino groups are blocked with fluoride labile silyl carbamates.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0096">Allyl blocking groups are useful in the presence of acid- and base-protecting groups since the former are stable and are subsequently removed by metal or pi-acid catalysts. For example, an allyl-blocked carboxylic acid is deprotected with a palladium-catalyzed reaction in the presence of acid labile t-butyl carbamate or base-labile acetate amine protecting groups. Yet another form of protecting group is a resin to which a compound or intermediate is attached. As long as the residue is attached to the resin, that functional group is blocked and does not react.

The powders are typically mixed with a binder material into larger permanent free-flowing agglomerates or granules referred to as a &#x201c;granulation.&#x201d; For example, solvent-using &#x201c;wet&#x201d; granulation processes are generally characterized in that the powders are combined with a binder material and moistened with water or an organic solvent under conditions resulting in the formation of a wet granulated mass from which the solvent must then be evaporated.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0143">Melt granulation involves the use of materials that are solid or semi-solid at room temperature (i.e., having a relatively low softening or melting point range) to promote granulation of powdered or other materials, essentially in the absence of added water or other liquid solvents. The low melting solids, when heated to a temperature in the melting point range, liquefy to act as a binder or granulating medium. The liquefied solid spreads itself over the surface of powdered materials with which it is contacted, and on cooling, forms a solid granulated mass in which the initial materials are bound together. The resulting melt granulation may then be provided to a tablet press or be encapsulated for preparing the oral dosage form. Melt granulation improves the dissolution rate and bioavailability of an active (i.e., drug) by forming a solid dispersion or solid solution.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0144">U.S. Pat.

However, small molecule inhibitors of IQGAP1 have yet to be developed.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0163">To target IQGAP1, a virtual screening was conducted of 212,966 small molecules with drug-like characteristics (MW between 100-800 g/mol) and four potential &#x2018;hits&#x2019; were selected. A focused library of close structural derivatives of the best hit was screened to select UR778Br (MW 418.29 g/mol), a potent small molecule inhibitor of IQGAP1. In this Example, proof-of-concept data is provided showing that UR778Br inhibits the proliferation and colony formation potential of leukemia cells. At similar concentrations it had limited effect of colony formation by normal bone marrow cells.

Female mice aged 8 to 10 weeks are used.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0181">Selection of Dose of UR778Br: UR778Br is the lead small molecule. Like many lead molecules it is active in micro molar concentrations. The focus of this investigation is to ascertain/confirm its activity first and then optimize the structure such that it is effective at lower concentrations. Since PK/PD studies have not been done, there is no reliable way to estimate the dose or route of administration to achieve comparable levels of UR778Br in the tissues. As it is a small molecule, UR778Br is expected to be absorbed orally as well as via an intraperitoneal (IP) route. To start, the IP route is used due to the ease and reliability of administration. UR778Br at 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg daily for 5 days per week is tested for up to 6 weeks to evaluate toleration. Six NSG mice are injected with UR778Br 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg IP each. The mice are monitored closely and the ones that appear sick are euthanized using approved protocols. If 2 of 6 mice are euthanized, that dose of UR778Br is considered dose limiting toxicity and a lower dose is considered as MTD. If all six mice tolerate UR778Br at 20 mg/kg, the dose is not escalated further. If administering UR778Br via IP route is toxic or inactive in the initial experiment(s), it is administered by gastric lavage. The same design as described above is used to select the dose. If UR778Br at 20 mg/kg/d is well tolerated, 20 mg/kg/d and 10 mg/kg/d is used. If the MTD is lower than 20 mg/kg MTD/d and 50% of MTD/d is used. For ease of reading 20 mg/kg/d and 10 mg/kg/d have been included as the doses in the text below.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0182">AML cell lines: Ten NOD-SCID IL-2Ry KO (NSG) mice are injected with 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>THIP1 (or U937) cells via tail vein.

Current therapies have plateaued in their efficacy and new therapies are urgently needed to control AML, particularly among older patients who are at the greater risk. Mortality rates from AML are rising as the population is aging.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0191">The process of transformation and maintenance of malignant phenotype utilizes a finite number of common pathways termed hallmarks of cancer. It is hypothesized that activation of these common pathways may result in expression of antigen(s) that are shared among a spectrum of acute leukemias. To test the hypothesis, previously published experiments were replicated that had shown that immunization of rabbits with human peripheral blood WBCs that had been incubated with fluorodinitrobenzene (FDNB) elicited high titer antibodies that agglutinated a broad spectrum of human leukemia cells.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0192">Herein it is reported that immunoaffinity purification of lysates of primary AML cells with serum from rabbits immunized with peripheral blood WBCs that had been incubated with FDNB identified the scaffolding protein IQGAP1 as part of the shared antigenic moiety. Analyses of gene expression profiles of human AML showed that IQGAP1 was overexpressed in primary human AML cells across cytogenetic subtypes compared to normal hematopoietic stem cells. shRNA knockdown of IQGAP1 in K562, MV411, and THP1 human leukemia cell lines suppressed their proliferation and colony formation potential. To develop small molecule inhibitors of IQGAP1, a virtual screening was conducted of 212,966 compounds to identify four highly ranked small molecule &#x201c;hits&#x201d;. Further screening of the library of the highest-ranked hits yielded UR778Br that inhibited proliferation, deceased viability, caused G2/M phase arrest, resulted in apoptosis, and inhibited colony formation potential of MOLM13, MV411, THP1 and U937 human leukemia cell lines. Exposure to UR778Br also resulted in decreased viability and colony formation by primary AML samples. UR778Br did not block colony formation by bone marrow from healthy individuals in similar dose range. The data presented suggest that IQGAP1 is a therapeutic target of interest in the treatment of AML and provides the impetus for optimization and development of UR778Br and its derivatives as first in class agents in the treatment of AML.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0193">Materials and Methods</p><p id="p-0208" num="0194">Cell lines, cell culture and reagents: K562, MOLM13, MV411, THP1 and U937 cells were maintained in complete RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/mL), and streptomycin (100 &#x3bc;g/mL) at 37&#xb0; C. with 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>in a humidified incubator.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0195">Immunization of Rabbits: The protocol for collecting peripheral blood samples from healthy volunteers was approved by the University of Rochester's Research Subject Review Board.

The healthy subjects signed an informed consent form. Blood was drawn by venipuncture into acid citrate dextran containing tubes. It was diluted with equal volume of phosphate buffered saline, without calcium or magnesium, pH 7.2. Red blood cells were sedimented by adding 6 ml of 6% dextran (Molecular weight 500,000, cat #9605D, Lot #A84991, Research Organics, Cleveland, Ohio) in PBS to 40 ml of the diluted blood and incubating at room temperature for 20 minutes.

Acoma St, Denver, Colo. 80223). The assay uses the Cdc42/Rac Interactive Binding (CRIB) region (also called the p21 Binding Domain, PBD) of the Cdc42/Rac effector protein, p21 activated kinase 1 (PAK). The CRIB/PBD protein motif binds specifically to the GTP-bound form of Rac and/or Cdc42 proteins. The PBD region of PAK has a high affinity for both GTP-Rac and GTP-Cdc42 and that PAK binding results in a significantly reduced intrinsic and catalytic rate of hydrolysis of both Rac and Cdc42 making it an ideal tool for affinity purification of GTP-Rac and GTP-Cdc42 from cell lysates. The PAK-PBD protein in kit corresponds to residues 67-150. It includes the highly conserved CRIB region (aa 74-88) plus sequences required for the high affinity interaction with GTP-Rac and GTP-Cdc42. The PAK-PBD is in the form of a GST fusion protein, which allows &#x201c;pull-down&#x201d; of the PAK-PBD/GTP-Cdc42 (or GTP-Rac) complex with glutathione affinity beads. The assay provides a simple means of quantitating Rac/Cdc42 activation in cells. The amount of activated Cdc42 is determined by a Western blot using a Cdc42 specific antibody.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0223">Results</p><p id="p-0239" num="0224">IQGAP1 is overexpressed in the majority of AML patients: Rabbits were immunized subcutaneously weekly&#xd7;16 weeks with FDNB modified as well as unmodified human WBC cells as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>.
