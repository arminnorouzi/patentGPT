The communication network <b>41</b> includes, for example, a bus, an in-vehicle communication network conforming to any standard such as a controller area network (CAN), a local interconnect network (LIN), a local area network (LAN), FlexRay (registered trademark), or Ethernet (registered trademark), and the like. Note that there is also a case where each unit of the vehicle control system <b>11</b> is directly connected by, for example, short-range wireless communication (near field communication (NFC)), Bluetooth (registered trademark), or the like without via the communication network <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0053">Note that, hereinafter, in a case where each unit of the vehicle control system <b>11</b> communicates via the communication network <b>41</b>, the description of the communication network <b>41</b> is to be omitted. For example, in a case where the processor <b>21</b> and the communication unit <b>22</b> perform communication via the communication network <b>41</b>, it is simply described that the processor <b>21</b> and the communication unit <b>22</b> perform communication.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0054">The processor <b>21</b> includes various processors such as, for example, a central processing unit (CPU), a micro processing unit (MPU), and an electronic control unit (ECU). The processor <b>21</b> controls the entire vehicle control system <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0055">The communication unit <b>22</b> communicates with various types of equipment inside and outside the vehicle, other vehicles, servers, base stations, and the like, and transmits and receives various data. As the communication with the outside of the vehicle, for example, the communication unit <b>22</b> receives, from the outside, a program for updating software for controlling an operation of the vehicle control system <b>11</b>, map information, traffic information, information around the vehicle <b>1</b>, and the like. For example, the communication unit <b>22</b> transmits information regarding the vehicle <b>1</b> (for example, data indicating a state of the vehicle <b>1</b>, a recognition result by a recognition unit <b>73</b>, and the like), information around the vehicle <b>1</b>, and the like to the outside. For example, the communication unit <b>22</b> performs communication corresponding to a vehicle emergency call system such as an eCall.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">Note that a communication method of the communication unit <b>22</b> is not particularly limited. Furthermore, a plurality of communication methods may be used.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">As the communication with the inside of the vehicle, for example, the communication unit <b>22</b> performs wireless communication with in-vehicle equipment by a communication method such as wireless LAN, Bluetooth, NFC, or wireless USB (WUSB). For example, the communication unit <b>22</b> performs wired communication with in-vehicle equipment through a communication method such as a universal serial bus (USB), a high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI, registered trademark), or a mobile high-definition link (MHL), via a connection terminal (not illustrated) (and a cable if necessary).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">Here, the in-vehicle equipment is, for example, equipment that is not connected to the communication network <b>41</b> in the vehicle. For example, mobile equipment or wearable equipment carried by a passenger such as a driver, information equipment brought into the vehicle and temporarily installed, and the like are assumed.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">For example, the communication unit <b>22</b> uses a wireless communication method such as a fourth generation mobile communication system (4G), a fifth generation mobile communication system (5G), long term evolution (LTE), or dedicated short range communications (DSRC), to communicate with a server or the like existing on an external network (for example, the Internet, a cloud network, or a company-specific network) via a base station or an access point.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">For example, the communication unit <b>22</b> uses a peer to peer (P2P) technology to communicate with a terminal (for example, a terminal of a pedestrian or a store, or a machine type communication (MTC) terminal) existing near the own vehicle. For example, the communication unit <b>22</b> performs V2X communication. The V2X communication is, for example, vehicle to vehicle communication with another vehicle, vehicle to infrastructure communication with a roadside device or the like, vehicle to home communication, vehicle to pedestrian communication with a terminal or the like possessed by a pedestrian, or the like.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">For example, the communication unit <b>22</b> receives an electromagnetic wave transmitted by a road traffic information communication system (vehicle information and communication system (VICS), registered trademark), such as a radio wave beacon, an optical beacon, or FM multiplex broadcasting.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">The map information accumulation unit <b>23</b> accumulates a map acquired from the outside and a map created by the vehicle <b>1</b>. For example, the map information accumulation unit <b>23</b> accumulates a three-dimensional high-precision map, a global map having lower accuracy than the high-precision map and covering a wide area, and the like.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0063">The high-precision map is, for example, a dynamic map, a point cloud map, a vector map (also referred to as an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) map), or the like. The dynamic map is, for example, a map including four layers of dynamic information, semi-dynamic information, semi-static information, and static information, and is supplied from an external server or the like. The point cloud map is a map including a point cloud (point group data). The vector map is a map in which information such as a lane and a position of a traffic light is associated with the point cloud map. The point cloud map and the vector map may be supplied from, for example, an external server or the like, or may be created by the vehicle <b>1</b> as a map for performing matching with a local map to be described later on the basis of a sensing result by a radar <b>52</b>, a LiDAR <b>53</b>, or the like, and may be accumulated in the map information accumulation unit <b>23</b>. Furthermore, in a case where the high-precision map is supplied from an external server or the like, in order to reduce a communication capacity, for example, map data of several hundred meters square regarding a planned path on which the vehicle <b>1</b> will travel is acquired from a server or the like.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0064">The GNSS reception unit <b>24</b> receives a GNSS signal from a GNSS satellite, and supplies to the travel assistance/automatic driving control unit <b>29</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0065">The external recognition sensor <b>25</b> includes various sensors used for recognizing a situation outside the vehicle <b>1</b>, and supplies sensor data from each sensor to each unit of the vehicle control system <b>11</b>. Any type and number of sensors included in the external recognition sensor <b>25</b> may be adopted.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0066">For example, the external recognition sensor <b>25</b> includes a camera <b>51</b>, the radar <b>52</b>, the light detection and ranging or laser imaging detection and ranging (LiDAR) <b>53</b>, and an ultrasonic sensor <b>54</b>. Any number of the camera <b>51</b>, the radar <b>52</b>, the LiDAR <b>53</b>, and the ultrasonic sensor <b>54</b> may be adopted, and an example of a sensing area of each sensor will be described later.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">Note that, as the camera <b>51</b>, for example, a camera of any image capturing system such as a time of flight (ToF) camera, a stereo camera, a monocular camera, or an infrared camera is used as necessary.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">Furthermore, for example, the external recognition sensor <b>25</b> includes an environment sensor for detection of weather, a meteorological state, a brightness, and the like. The environment sensor includes, for example, a raindrop sensor, a fog sensor, a sunshine sensor, a snow sensor, an illuminance sensor, and the like.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">Moreover, for example, the external recognition sensor <b>25</b> includes a microphone to be used to detect sound around the vehicle <b>1</b>, a position of a sound source, and the like.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">The in-vehicle sensor <b>26</b> includes various sensors for detection of information inside the vehicle, and supplies sensor data from each sensor to each unit of the vehicle control system <b>11</b>. Any type and number of sensors included in the in-vehicle sensor <b>26</b> may be adopted.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">For example, the in-vehicle sensor <b>26</b> includes a camera, a radar, a seating sensor, a steering wheel sensor, a microphone, a biological sensor, and the like. As the camera, for example, a camera of any image capturing system such as a ToF camera, a stereo camera, a monocular camera, or an infrared camera can be used. The biological sensor is provided, for example, in a seat, a steering wheel, or the like, and detects various kinds of biological information of a passenger such as the driver.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0072">The vehicle sensor <b>27</b> includes various sensors for detection of a state of the vehicle <b>1</b>, and supplies sensor data from each sensor to each unit of the vehicle control system <b>11</b>. Any type and number of sensors included in the vehicle sensor <b>27</b> may be adopted.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">For example, the vehicle sensor <b>27</b> includes a speed sensor, an acceleration sensor, an angular velocity sensor (gyro sensor), and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). For example, the vehicle sensor <b>27</b> includes a steering angle sensor that detects a steering angle of a steering wheel, a yaw rate sensor, an accelerator sensor that detects an operation amount of an accelerator pedal, and a brake sensor that detects an operation amount of a brake pedal. For example, the vehicle sensor <b>27</b> includes a rotation sensor that detects a number of revolutions of an engine or a motor, an air pressure sensor that detects an air pressure of a tire, a slip rate sensor that detects a slip rate of a tire, and a wheel speed sensor that detects a rotation speed of a wheel. For example, the vehicle sensor <b>27</b> includes a battery sensor that detects a remaining amount and a temperature of a battery, and an impact sensor that detects an external impact.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0074">The recording unit <b>28</b> includes, for example, a magnetic storage device such as a read only memory (ROM), a random access memory (RAM), and a hard disc drive (HDD), a semiconductor storage device, an optical storage device, a magneto-optical storage device, and the like. The recording unit <b>28</b> stores various programs, data, and the like used by each unit of the vehicle control system <b>11</b>. For example, the recording unit <b>28</b> records a rosbag file including a message transmitted and received by a Robot Operating System (ROS) in which an application program related to automatic driving operates. For example, the recording unit <b>28</b> includes an Event Data Recorder (EDR) and a Data Storage System for Automated Driving (DSSAD), and records information of the vehicle <b>1</b> before and after an event such as an accident.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0075">The travel assistance/automatic driving control unit <b>29</b> controls travel support and automatic driving of the vehicle <b>1</b>. For example, the travel assistance/automatic driving control unit <b>29</b> includes an analysis unit <b>61</b>, an action planning unit <b>62</b>, and an operation control unit <b>63</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0076">The analysis unit <b>61</b> performs analysis processing on a situation of the vehicle <b>1</b> and surroundings. The analysis unit <b>61</b> includes an own-position estimation unit <b>71</b>, a sensor fusion unit <b>72</b>, and the recognition unit <b>73</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0077">The own-position estimation unit <b>71</b> estimates an own-position of the vehicle <b>1</b> on the basis of sensor data from the external recognition sensor <b>25</b> and a high-precision map accumulated in the map information accumulation unit <b>23</b>. For example, the own-position estimation unit <b>71</b> generates a local map on the basis of sensor data from the external recognition sensor <b>25</b>, and estimates the own-position of the vehicle <b>1</b> by performing matching of the local map with the high-precision map. The position of the vehicle <b>1</b> is based on, for example, a center of a rear wheel pair axle.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0078">The local map is, for example, a three-dimensional high-precision map, an occupancy grid map, or the like created using a technique such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The three-dimensional high-precision map is, for example, the above-described point cloud map or the like. The occupancy grid map is a map in which a three-dimensional or two-dimensional space around the vehicle <b>1</b> is divided into grids of a predetermined size, and an occupancy state of an object is indicated in a unit of a grid. The occupancy state of the object is indicated by, for example, a presence or absence or a presence probability of the object. The local map is also used for detection processing and recognition processing of a situation outside the vehicle <b>1</b> by the recognition unit <b>73</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0079">Note that the own-position estimation unit <b>71</b> may estimate the own-position of the vehicle <b>1</b> on the basis of a GNSS signal and sensor data from the vehicle sensor <b>27</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0080">The sensor fusion unit <b>72</b> performs sensor fusion processing of combining a plurality of different types of sensor data (for example, image data supplied from the camera <b>51</b> and sensor data supplied from the radar <b>52</b>) to obtain new information. Methods for combining different types of sensor data include integration, fusion, association, and the like.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0081">The recognition unit <b>73</b> performs detection processing and recognition processing of a situation outside the vehicle <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0082">For example, the recognition unit <b>73</b> performs detection processing and recognition processing of a situation outside the vehicle <b>1</b> on the basis of information from the external recognition sensor <b>25</b>, information from the own-position estimation unit <b>71</b>, information from the sensor fusion unit <b>72</b>, and the like.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0083">Specifically, for example, the recognition unit <b>73</b> performs detection processing, recognition processing, and the like of an object around the vehicle <b>1</b>. The detection processing of the object is, for example, processing of detecting a presence or absence, a size, a shape, a position, a movement, and the like of the object. The recognition processing of the object is, for example, processing of recognizing an attribute such as a type of the object or identifying a specific object. However, the detection processing and the recognition processing are not necessarily clearly divided, and may overlap.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">For example, the recognition unit <b>73</b> detects an object around the vehicle <b>1</b> by performing clustering for classifying a point cloud on the basis of sensor data of the LiDAR, the radar, or the like for each cluster of point groups. As a result, a presence or absence, a size, a shape, and a position of the object around the vehicle <b>1</b> are detected.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0085">For example, the recognition unit <b>73</b> detects a movement of the object around the vehicle <b>1</b> by performing tracking that is following a movement of the cluster of point groups classified by clustering. As a result, a speed and a traveling direction (a movement vector) of the object around the vehicle <b>1</b> are detected.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">For example, the recognition unit <b>73</b> recognizes a type of the object around the vehicle <b>1</b> by performing object recognition processing such as semantic segmentation on an image data supplied from the camera <b>51</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">Note that, as the object to be detected or recognized, for example, a vehicle, a person, a bicycle, an obstacle, a structure, a road, a traffic light, a traffic sign, a road sign, and the like are assumed.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">For example, the recognition unit <b>73</b> performs recognition processing of traffic rules around the vehicle <b>1</b> on the basis of a map accumulated in the map information accumulation unit <b>23</b>, an estimation result of the own-position, and a recognition result of the object around the vehicle <b>1</b>. By this processing, for example, a position and a state of a traffic light, contents of a traffic sign and a road sign, contents of a traffic regulation, a travelable lane, and the like are recognized.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">For example, the recognition unit <b>73</b> performs recognition processing of a surrounding environment of the vehicle <b>1</b>. As the surrounding environment to be recognized, for example, weather, a temperature, a humidity, a brightness, road surface conditions, and the like are assumed.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">The action planning unit <b>62</b> creates an action plan of the vehicle <b>1</b>.

For example, in a case where the approaching person is recognized as a user (for example, a driver, a family member thereof, or the like) registered in advance, white light may blink. Whereas, for example, in a case where the recognition of the approaching person fails (in a case where the approaching person is not recognized as the user registered in advance), red light may blink.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0301">Note that, for example, in a case where an approach of the registered user is detected, the body system control unit <b>84</b> may automatically unlock a door.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0302">Furthermore, for example, a condition for turning on or blinking the light by an approach of a person may be limited. For example, only in a case where the power of the vehicle <b>1</b> is off or in a case where there is no person in the vehicle <b>1</b>, the light may be turned on or blink by an approach of a person.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0303">As described above, in a case where an approach of a person is detected, for example, by turning on or blinking an external light, a state where the vehicle <b>1</b> is monitoring the surroundings is appealed to the surroundings, and theft and destruction of the vehicle <b>1</b> can be prevented. Furthermore, in a case where an approach of a person is detected, for example, by turning on or blinking a light inside the vehicle, it is possible to appeal to the surroundings that the vehicle <b>1</b> is also monitoring the inside of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0304">&#x3c;Light Emission Pattern of Illumination <b>254</b> of Steering Wheel <b>253</b>&#x3e;</p><p id="p-0307" num="0305">Next, a light emission pattern of the illumination <b>254</b> of the steering wheel <b>253</b> will be described.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0306">For example, the light control unit <b>85</b> turns on or blinks the illumination <b>254</b> in a pattern according to a situation, on the basis of at least one of a situation of the vehicle <b>1</b>, a situation around the vehicle <b>1</b>, or a situation of the passenger.

Then, the entire illumination <b>254</b> blinks. As a result, the driver can reliably recognize that automatic driving is ready.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0308">Furthermore, for example, in a case where the vehicle <b>1</b> changes a lane by automatic driving, first, the entire illumination <b>254</b> is turned on. Thereafter, after the illumination <b>254</b> is turned off, the LED of the illumination <b>254</b> blinks in a direction in which the vehicle <b>1</b> moves for the lane change. Then, after the lane change is ended, the entire illumination <b>254</b> is turned on and then turned off. In this manner, the notification of the lane change is given from before the lane change until the lane change is completed, which makes it possible to give the passenger a sense of security.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0309">Moreover, for example, in a case of calling the driver's attention due to approaching an obstacle, dozing, or the like, an upper portion of the illumination <b>254</b> blinks in red.

The degree of activity is set on the basis of, for example, a volume of a conversation in the vehicle, a movement of a passenger, and the like.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0325">The metadata regarding the surrounding situation includes, for example, at least one of weather, a temperature, a humidity, a brightness, a position and a type of a surrounding object (for example, another vehicle, a pedestrian, an obstacle, a traffic sign, a landmark, or the like), a presence or absence of occurrence and a type of an event (for example, an accident, construction, or the like), or the like.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0326">Furthermore, for example, the metadata assignment unit <b>362</b> may assign metadata inputted by the user (a passenger) to the moving image data. For example, a movie button may be provided on the steering wheel <b>253</b>, and the driver may press the movie button in a case where a scene or the like for which moving image data is desired to be stored is being captured. As a case where a scene or the like for which moving image data is desired to be stored is being captured, for example, a case where a landscape around the vehicle <b>1</b> is good, a case where a trouble such as an accident occurs, and the like are assumed. For example, the metadata assignment unit <b>362</b> assigns metadata indicating that storage is necessary, to moving image data captured in a period designated by the user using the movie button.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0327">Note that a unit for assigning the metadata can be freely set.
