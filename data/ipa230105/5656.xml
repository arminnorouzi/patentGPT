When the inductor array <b>1</b> is used in a high frequency circuit, the relative permeability of the base body <b>10</b> may be lower. For example, when the inductor array <b>1</b> operates at a frequency of about 100 MHz, the lower limit of the relative permeability of the body portion <b>10</b>M may be 20 or higher. When the entire region of the base body <b>10</b> has a relative permeability of 100 or lower, it is possible to reduce the chance of magnetic saturation.

Therefore, since a high-permeability portion is disposed in an inter-conductor region between one internal conductor and another internal conductor adjacent thereto, the magnetic coupling between the adjacent internal conductors can be lessened. In other words, the coupling coefficient between the adjacent internal conductors can be reduced.

In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the high-permeability portions <b>10</b>A<b>11</b> to <b>10</b>A<b>13</b> occupy the entirety of the inter-conductor regions <b>10</b>R<b>11</b> to <b>10</b>R<b>13</b>, which contain the high-permeability portions <b>10</b>A<b>11</b> to <b>10</b>A<b>13</b>, respectively. As a result, the high-permeability portions <b>10</b>A<b>11</b> to <b>10</b>A<b>13</b> are positioned to contact adjacent internal conductors. For example, the high-permeability portion <b>10</b>A<b>11</b> is in contact with the internal conductor <b>25</b>A and the internal conductor <b>25</b>B both adjacent thereto. Each of the high-permeability portions <b>10</b>A<b>11</b> to <b>10</b>A<b>13</b> may be in contact with at least one of the adjacent internal conductors. For example, the high-permeability portion <b>10</b>A<b>11</b> may be in contact with only one of the internal conductor <b>25</b>A and the internal conductor <b>25</b>B both adjacent thereto and may be spaced apart from the other. When each of the high-permeability portions <b>10</b>A<b>11</b> to <b>10</b>A<b>13</b> is thus configured and positioned to contact one of the adjacent internal conductors, the magnetic flux generated from an internal conductor that is contacted by one of the high-permeability portions <b>10</b>A<b>11</b> to <b>10</b>A<b>13</b> is likely to pass through the high-permeability portion that is in contact with the internal conductor. Therefore, the coupling coefficient between each of the internal conductors <b>25</b>A to <b>25</b>D and other internal conductors can be further reduced.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one or more embodiments of the present invention, each of the high-permeability portions extends in the direction of the reference axis Ax<b>1</b> over an intermediate point between the adjacent internal conductors in the direction of the reference axis Ax<b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the intermediate point C<b>1</b> between the internal conductor <b>25</b>A and the internal conductor <b>25</b>B. For example, the intermediate point between the internal conductor <b>25</b>A and the internal conductor <b>25</b>B may be the middle point of the line segment extending along the reference axis Ax<b>1</b> one end of which is at the point of intersection between the reference axis Ax<b>1</b> and the outer surface of the internal conductor <b>25</b>A facing toward the internal conductor <b>25</b>B and the other end of which is at the point of intersection between the reference axis Ax<b>1</b> and the outer surface of the internal conductor <b>25</b>B facing toward the internal conductor <b>25</b>A. Since the high-permeability portion <b>10</b>A<b>11</b> extends in the direction of the reference axis Ax<b>1</b> over the intermediate point C<b>1</b>, both the magnetic flux generated by the internal conductor <b>25</b>A and the magnetic flux generated by the internal conductor <b>25</b>B are likely to pass through the high-permeability portion <b>10</b>A<b>11</b>.

In one or more embodiments of the invention, the inductor array <b>1</b> is produced by a sheet lamination method in which magnetic sheets are stacked together. The first step of the sheet lamination method for producing the inductor array <b>1</b> is to prepare the magnetic sheets. The magnetic sheets are, for example, made from a slurry obtained by mixing and kneading a resin and metal magnetic particles of a soft magnetic material. The slurry is molded into the magnetic sheets using a sheet molding machine such as a doctor blade sheet molding machine. The resin mixed and kneaded together with the metal magnetic particles may be, for example, a polyvinyl butyral (PVB) resin, an epoxy resin, or any other resin materials having an excellent insulation property. The materials for preparing the magnetic sheets are selected such that the magnetic sheets will have, after firing, a relative permeability required for the body portion <b>10</b>M of the base body <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The magnetic sheets are cut into a predetermined shape. Next, a conductive paste is applied by a known method such as screen printing to the magnetic sheets cut into the predetermined shape, thereby forming a plurality of unfired conductor patterns that will form the internal conductors <b>25</b>A to <b>25</b>D after firing. The conductive paste is made by mixing and kneading, for example, Ag, Cu, or alloys thereof and a resin. Through-holes having a shape corresponding to the unfired conductor patters are provided in a part of the magnetic sheets, and the through-holes are then filled with a magnetic material different from the magnetic material used for forming the magnetic sheets, thereby embedding filled portions formed of the magnetic material in the part of the magnetic sheets. The magnetic material for the filled portions is selected such that the filled portions will have, after firing, a relative permeability required for the high-permeability portions <b>10</b>A<b>11</b> to <b>10</b>A<b>13</b>. The filled portions will form the high-permeability portions <b>10</b>A<b>11</b> to <b>10</b>A<b>13</b> after firing.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the way described above, the magnetic sheets having the unfired conductor patterns formed thereon, the magnetic sheets having the filled portions embedded therein, and the magnetic sheets having no conductors formed thereon and having no filled portions embedded therein are stacked together to form a mother laminate.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Next, the mother laminate is diced using a cutter such as a dicing machine or a laser processing machine to obtain a chip laminate.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Next, the chip laminate is subjected to heat treatment at a temperature of 600&#xb0; C. to 850&#xb0; C. for a duration of 20 to 120 minutes. This heat treatment degreases the chip laminate, and the magnetic sheets and the conductor paste are fired to form the base body <b>10</b> that contains the internal conductors <b>25</b>A to <b>25</b>D. If the magnetic sheets contain a thermosetting resin, the thermosetting resin may be cured by performing a heat treatment on the chip laminate at a lower temperature. This cured resin serves as the binder that binds together the metal magnetic particles contained in the magnetic sheet. The heat treatment at a lower temperature is performed at a temperature of 100&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C. for a duration of approximately 20 to 120 minutes, for example.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Following the heat treatment, a conductive paste is applied to the surface of the chip laminate (that is, the base body <b>10</b>) to form the external electrodes <b>21</b>A to <b>21</b>D, <b>22</b>A to <b>22</b>D.

The second through-holes and the third through-holes are provided outside the first through-holes. The second through-holes and the third through-holes are filled with a magnetic material different from the magnetic material used for forming the magnetic sheets. Thus, second filled portions are embedded in the second through-holes, and third filled portions are embedded in the third through-holes. The magnetic material for the second filled portions and the third filled portions is selected such that the second filled portions will have, after firing, a relative permeability required for the high-permeability portions <b>10</b>A<b>21</b> to <b>10</b>A<b>23</b>, and the third filled portions will have, after firing, a relative permeability required for the high-permeability portions <b>10</b>A<b>31</b> to <b>10</b>A<b>33</b>.
