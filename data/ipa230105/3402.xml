Accordingly, demands for clean air keep increasing, and particularly, related products for the clean air, such as a deodorization module, are being developed to provide clean indoor air.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The above information disclosed in this Background section is only for understanding of the background of the inventive concepts, and, therefore, it may contain information that does not constitute prior art.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides an air cleaning module having improved deodorizing efficiency.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, an air cleaning module includes a filter, a fan, a light source unit, a housing and a guide structure. The fan is configured to provide a suction direction and a blowing direction of a fluid which are substantially aligned. The light source unit is arranged to be adjacent to the filter to emit a light toward the filter. The light having a property that sterilizes a contaminant source in a fluid. The housing includes a fluid passage space and further includes a bottom, a ceiling facing the bottom, and a sidewall. The guide structure is arranged between the fan and the filter and configured to guide a fluid to move along a fluid passage path set by the guide structure. The guide structure separates a first space from a second space, the first space including the fluid passage path and the second space including no fluid passage path. The light source unit includes a substrate elongated in one direction and at least one light emitting device mounted on a front surface of the substrate to emit the light.

For example, the light source unit <b>200</b> may emit the light in the ultraviolet light wavelength band. In this case, the light source unit <b>200</b> may emit the light in the wavelength band from about 100 nm to about 420 nm, and particularly, may emit the light in the wavelength band from about 240 nm to about 400 nm.

The photocatalyst is activated by the ultraviolet light to cause a chemical reaction and decomposes various contaminants and germs in the air in contact with the photocatalyst through an oxidation-reduction reaction.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The photocatalyst causes the chemical reaction in which electrons and holes are generated when being exposed to a light above a band gap energy. Therefore, compounds in the air, e.g., water or organic material, may be decomposed by a hydroxyl radical and a superoxide ion, which are formed by the photocatalytic reaction. The hydroxyl radical is very strong oxidant and decomposes organic contaminants in the air and organic contaminants adsorbed in the filter, thereby producing a deodorizing effect. In addition, the hydroxyl radical inactivates the contaminants in the air to sterilize a contaminant source such as germs.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">As the photocatalytic material, titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>), zinc oxide (ZnO), and tin dioxide (SnO<sub>2</sub>) may be used. In the exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, since a recombination speed of the electrons and the holes, which are generated on a surface of the photocatalyst, is very fast, the use of the electrons and holes in a photochemical reaction has its limit. Accordingly, a metal material, such as Pt, Ni, Mn, Ag, W, Cr, Mo, and Zn, or an oxidant thereof is added to the photocatalyst to delay the recombination speed of the electrons and holes. When the recombination speed of the electrons and holes is delayed, a contact probability with target substances and the radicals, which are to be oxidized and/or decomposed, increases, and as a result, a photocatalytic reactivity may increase. In addition, the band gap of the photocatalyst may be controlled with the addition of the oxidant to improve performance of the photocatalyst With the above-described photocatalytic reaction, the air may be sterilized, purified, and deodorized. In the case of sterilization, enzymesin germ cells and enzymes that act on a respiratory system are destroyed to obtain sterilization or antimicrobial effect, and thus reproduction of germs or mold may be prevented and toxins released from the germs or mold may be also be degraded.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Particularly, in the exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, the titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) may be used as the photocatalyst. The titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) irradiated with the ultraviolet light equal to or smaller than about 400 nm produces a superoxide radical, and the generated superoxide radical decomposes the organic material into harmless water and carbon dioxide. The titanium oxide may be nano-particled to produce a large amount of superoxide radical even though the light emitting device <b>210</b> that emits a relatively weak ultraviolet wavelength is used. Accordingly, the photocatalyst has superior organic decomposition capacity, continuous durability and stability regardless of environmental changes, and semi-permanent effect. In addition, the superoxide radical generated in large quantities may remove not only the organic material, but also various substances, such as odor and germs.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In the exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, since the photocatalyst serves as only a catalyst and is not changed by itself, the photocatalyst may be semi-permanently used, and the effect caused by the photocatalyst may last semi-permanently as long as the corresponding light is provided to the photocatalyst.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In the exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, in the case where the HEPA filter is used as the filter <b>300</b>, the light emitted from the light source unit <b>200</b> may correspond to the sterilization wavelength band in which the HEPA filter is sterilized.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In the exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, the HEPA filter may filter out more than 99.7% of organic and inorganic particles equal to or smaller than ab out 0.3 micrometers.
