From the perspective of User Equipment (UE), the PCI effectively identifies a cell. However, PCI values are not necessarily unique across a network, and may be duplicated across networks and even within a single network. Allocation of PCIs is dictated by collision- and confusion-avoidance rules. Furthermore, PCI values may also be non-static and may be allocated automatically by self-configuring functions of Self Organizing Networks (SON).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, telecommunications signal beams of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites over the Earth's surface constantly change and the satellite that serves a given area also periodically changes. If such satellites maintain a constant PCI as they orbit, UEs on Earth will need to perform full signalling handover each time another satellite becomes a UE's best server, which is inefficient (with regards, at least, to energy, signalling and computational processing resources). Furthermore, even if satellites along the same trajectory were set to have the same PCI, a given trajectory will likely cross different regions (e.g. countries) and different terrestrial telecommunications network operators in these regions may have different rules for PCI planning.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is desirable to at least alleviate some of the aforementioned problems.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a method of operating a wireless telecommunications network, the method comprising: identifying a signal coverage area of a moving base station to which to allocate a first physical network identifier, the moving base station forming part of a first telecommunications network; determining a second physical network identifier for enabling access, by user equipment, to an access point that serves the identified signal coverage area, wherein the access point is stationary relative to the moving base station and forms part of a second wireless telecommunications network; associating the first physical network identifier with the determined second physical network identifier; and allocating the first physical network identifier to the moving base station when the moving base station is providing a telecommunications signal in the identified signal coverage area, in order to allow access, by user equipment within the signal coverage area, to the moving base station via the first physical network identifier.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In embodiments, the first and/or the second physical network identifier(s) can exclude(s) a: gNodeB identifier; a cell identifier; and/or a Type Allocation Code.

That is, at <b>240</b>, satellite physical network identifiers are allocated to satellites on the basis of the mappings between satellite and terrestrial identifiers generated at <b>230</b> and the pairings determined at <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0056">For example, and with reference to Table 1 above, the first satellite <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> is allocated the satellite physical network identifier &#x201c;S1&#x201d; since this satellite physical network identifier is associated with the radio access point with which the first satellite <b>130</b>-<b>1</b> is paired.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057">By allocating satellite physical network identifiers that are known to the terrestrial telecommunications network, an improved unified telecommunications network is provided that is capable of processing UE handovers to and/or from the satellite telecommunications network in a manner that is invisible to the UE since the mapping of satellite and terrestrial physical network identifiers is retrievable by the SNC <b>140</b> (and/or TNC <b>110</b>), bypassing the need for the UE to do so. Accordingly, from the perspective of a UE, by way of process <b>200</b>, access to a satellite is performed as the UE would access a radio access point <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058">At a later point in time, the first satellite <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> will eventually move, relative to Earth <b>100</b> and therefore to a given radio access point <b>120</b> also, such that the first satellite <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> serves a new signal coverage area <b>160</b>, such as, for example, the second signal coverage area <b>160</b>-<b>2</b>. Accordingly, after <b>240</b>, process <b>200</b> is available to reset to <b>210</b> (or optionally to <b>220</b> if the information that is communicated in <b>210</b> is static). In this way, the first satellite <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> now serves the second signal coverage area <b>160</b>-<b>2</b>, which coincides with the cell area of the second radio access point <b>120</b>-<b>2</b>. The first satellite <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> is therefore allocated the satellite physical network identifier that is associated with the second radio access point <b>120</b>-<b>2</b> (&#x201c;T2&#x201d;, in the example of Table 1), or &#x201c;S2&#x201d; according to the example shown in Table 1 above.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0059">As a result, process <b>200</b> in effect provides satellite physical network identifiers that are spatially static. That is, a given satellite physical network identifier is made to correspond to a specific cell area, and satellites are allocated the satellite physical network identifier of the cell area that they serve at a given instant. As a result, from the perspective of a UE, the satellite physical network identifier for a satellite-radio access point pair does not constantly change as the satellites orbit. Accordingly, the satellite physical network identifiers remain constant in a given signal coverage area despite the satellite that serves a given signal coverage area changing.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0060">This enables more effective mobility management within the network, and avoids the need for UEs to seek updates to the satellite physical network identifiers (e.g. by means of measurement reports as part of an Automatic Neighbor Relations (ANR) process), and this benefit may be realized regardless of whether a UE is currently attached to the SNC <b>140</b> or the TNC <b>110</b>. Furthermore, a UE that is in idle mode may avoid cell reselections, and UEs that are currently disconnected may more quickly attach to the satellite or terrestrial telecommunications network.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0061">Process <b>200</b> is available to be initiated or re-initiated (as appropriate) when: the TNC <b>110</b> reallocates the terrestrial physical network identifiers; the SNC <b>140</b> reallocates the satellite physical network identifiers; and/or after a predetermined period since a previous iteration of process <b>200</b>, for example after a period by which point a satellite is expected to serve a new signal coverage area.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0062">The satellite and radio access point of a satellite-radio access point pair broadcast at the same frequency, and distinct satellite and terrestrial physical network identifiers helps avoid collisions.
