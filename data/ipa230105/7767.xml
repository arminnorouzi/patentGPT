The optical waveguide <b>5</b> includes a core part <b>51</b> that transmits light and a clad part <b>52</b> that is provided around the core part <b>51</b>. The clad part <b>52</b> sandwiches the core part <b>51</b> in any direction orthogonal to an extension direction of the core part <b>51</b>, that is, a propagation direction of light, and surrounds the core part <b>51</b> in a plane orthogonal to the propagation direction.

Each of the conductor posts (<b>61</b>, <b>62</b>) is a conductor having a columnar, frustum-like, or inverted frustum-like shape extending from the conductor layer <b>11</b> in the opposite direction with respect to the insulating layer <b>21</b>. Each of the conductor posts (<b>61</b>, <b>62</b>) may have any shape in a cross section and a surface orthogonal to the thickness direction of wiring substrate <b>100</b>. An external component (E<b>1</b>) is connected to the conductor posts <b>61</b>, and an external component (E<b>2</b>) is connected to the conductor posts <b>62</b>. That is, the component (E<b>1</b>) and the component (E<b>2</b>) are connected to the wiring substrate <b>100</b> when the wiring substrate <b>100</b> is used. Therefore, the wiring substrate <b>100</b> includes a component region (A<b>1</b>) (first component region), which is a region to be covered by the component (E<b>1</b>) when the wiring substrate <b>100</b> is used, and a component region (A<b>2</b>) (second component region), which is a region to be covered by the component (E<b>2</b>) when the wiring substrate <b>100</b> is used. The component (E<b>1</b>) connected to the conductor posts <b>61</b> is positioned in the component region (A<b>1</b>), and the component (E<b>2</b>) connected to the conductor posts <b>62</b> is positioned in the component region (A<b>2</b>).

Further, although not illustrated, Each of the insulating layers may contain a core material (reinforcing material) formed of a glass fiber, an aramid fiber, or the like, and may contain an inorganic filler formed of fine particles of silica (SiO2), alumina, mullite, or the like.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The covering layer <b>41</b> is formed of any insulating material. For example, the covering layer <b>41</b> may be formed of the same epoxy resin or polyimide resin as the solder resist <b>42</b> and may function as a solder resist preventing a short circuit between the conductor posts. Or, the covering layer <b>41</b> may be formed of an epoxy resin, a BT resin, or a phenol resin used for interlayer insulating layers such as the insulating layer <b>21</b> and the insulating layer <b>22</b>. That is, the material of the covering layer <b>41</b> is not limited to a specific material as long as the covering layer <b>41</b> is insulating and covers predetermined regions of the conductor layer <b>11</b> and the insulating layer <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The core part <b>51</b> and the clad part <b>52</b> of the optical waveguide <b>5</b> may be formed of an organic material, an inorganic material, or a mixed material such as an inorganic polymer containing an organic component and an inorganic component, the material having an appropriate refractive index. Examples of inorganic materials include quartz glass, silicon, and the like, and examples of organic materials include acrylic resins such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), polyimide resins, polyamide resins, polyether resins, epoxy resins, and the like. Further, inorganic polymers such as polysilane may be used.

Since total reflection of light incident on an interface between the core part <b>51</b> and the clad part <b>52</b> at an incident angle equal to or larger than a critical angle is possible, light incident on the core part <b>51</b> can efficiently propagate in the core part <b>51</b>.
