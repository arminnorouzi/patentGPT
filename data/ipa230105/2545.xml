ROMP is initiated by transition metal complexes such as Ru, Mo, and W alkylidine complexes. Metal-free ROMP (MF-ROMP) is an alternative technique that addresses the problem of expensive metal initiators and metal-contamination of the resulting polymers. For example, photoredox mediated MF-ROMP uses organic redox mediators and enol ether initiators in the polymerization process.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Provided are stabilizers and stabilizing reactants for use in MF-ROMP. The polymerization mechanism of MF-ROMP involves the generation of radical cationic active chain ends, which are susceptible to deactivation. For example, photoredox mediated MF-ROMP can be achieved via single electron oxidation of an enol ether initiator with a pyrylium photoredox mediator to ultimately generate radical cationic active chain ends. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that such radical cationic active chain ends may exist as part of a radical-ion pair with the counteranion of the pyrylium salt and the pyranyl radical. The present disclosure is related to the discovery of certain stabilizers that greatly enhance monomer conversion via MF-ROMP. It is believed that these stabilizers facilitate separation of this radical-ion pair to suppress back electron transfer and deactivation in favor of chain propagation. In the present disclosure, stabilization of the MF-ROMP technique is achieved by including these stabilizers as additional components in MF-ROMP reactant compositions or by including stabilizing moieties on reactants (thereby providing stabilizing reactants) in reactant compositions such as monomers and/or chain transfer agents.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In embodiments, a reactant composition for forming a polymer via metal-free ring-opening metathesis polymerization comprises a stabilizer, a stabilizing reactant comprising a stabilizing moiety covalently bound to a reactant moiety, or both; wherein the stabilizer is a halogenated alcohol and the stabilizing moiety is derived from a halogenated alcohol.

Each of these are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.) Briefly, formation of a polymer via MF-ROMP involves exposing reactants such as a strained cyclic unsaturated monomer, an initiator, and a mediator to conditions sufficient to induce ring-opening of the strained cyclic unsaturated monomer and chain propagation to form a polymer therefrom. In conventional MF-ROMP, a solvent such as dichloromethane is necessary since otherwise, polymerization rates are negligible. Other reactants may be included such as co-monomers, crosslinkers, and chain transfer agents. The conditions to induce polymerization include application of some form of energy, e.g., irradiation with light.

The stabilizing reactants may be included in the reactant composition in addition to, or in place of, other reactants in the reactant composition such as the strained cyclic unsaturated monomer and/or the chain transfer agent. A stabilizing reactant comprises a stabilizing moiety covalently bound to a reactant moiety, e.g., a monomeric moiety or a chain transfer moiety. A solvent may be included in any of the reactant compositions. However, in embodiments, no solvent is included. That is, use of the present stabilizers and/or stabilizing reactants enables solvent-free MF-ROMP, i.e., true bulk polymerization.

They are also generally highly polar. These properties are believed to facilitate separation of the radical-ion pairs formed between radical cationic active chain ends and counteranions from the mediator as described above. In embodiments, the stabilizer is a halogenated alcohol, which refers to an alcohol wherein one or more carbon-hydrogen bonds are replaced by carbon-halogen bonds. The halogenated alcohol may be a primary, secondary, or tertiary halogenated alcohol. The halogenated alcohol may have various numbers of carbon atoms, e.g., from 2 to 20 carbon atoms. This includes, e.g., from 2 to 18, from 2 to 16, from 2 to 14, from 2 to 12, from 2 to 10, from 2 to 8, and from 2 to 6. The halogenated alcohol may have a single hydroxyl group (monohydric) or more than one hydroxyl group (polyhydric), e.g., 2 (diol), 3 (triol), etc. The halogenated alcohol may have various degrees of halogenation, which refers to the number of carbon-hydrogen bonds replaced by carbon-halogen bonds. Generally, the degree of halogenation is quite high. Any halogen may be used, including combinations of different halogens.
