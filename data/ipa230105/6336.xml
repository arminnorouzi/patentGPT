Those of ordinary skill in the art will realize that the following description is illustrative only and is not intended to be in any way limiting. For example, the features described with respect to wearable medical devices are applicable to any other electronic device that is held in close contact with a person's skin (e.g., watches, mobile phones such as smartphones, personal electronic devices, headphones, brain-computer interfaces, etc.). Reference will now be made in detail to implementations of examples as illustrated in the accompanying drawings. The same reference indicators will be used throughout the drawings and the following description to refer to the same or like items.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the interest of clarity, not all of the routine features of the examples described herein are shown and described. It will, of course, be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made in order to achieve the developer's specific goals, such as compliance with application- and business-related constraints, and that these specific goals will vary from one implementation to another and from one developer to another.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Because human tissue absorbs electromagnetic fields and because communications antennas in wearable devices are small, conventionally, designers of wearable electronic devices have placed the communications antennas as far away from the skin surface as possible. For example, a communications antenna of a wearable electronic device may be placed on an exterior surface of a housing of the electronic device. This may reduce the impact of the tissue absorbing the electromagnetic field produced by the communications antennas. In this arrangement, a connector is required to connect the communications antenna to a printed circuit board, which is typically included nearer the skin surface. This approach, however, may result in increased manufacturing costs and complexity due to the inclusion of the connector and potential for encapsulation of the antenna outside the device housing. Moreover, for some compact wearable devices, because the distance between the skin and the antenna is so small, this conventional approach may still result in an unsuitable amount of tissue absorption.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an illustrative example, a wearable electronic device includes a housing formed from a bottom and a lid. The bottom has a smooth exterior surface for mounting against a person's skin. The interior of the bottom includes a printed circuit board to which is electrically and physically connected a current-carrying antenna (e.g., an on-PCB loop antenna). The lid is configured to couple with the bottom and includes a scatterer antenna (e.g., a compact half-wave length dipole scatterer) physically connected to an interior surface of the lid but physically separated from the current-carrying antenna by an air gap. The scatterer antenna is shaped such that a first part of the scatterer antenna sits above the current-carrying antenna and a second part of the scatterer antenna sits above a battery of the device. In operation, current from the current-carrying antenna is radiated through the scatterer antenna via the air gap. This arrangement of using the scatterer antenna in connection with the current-carrying antenna increases the overall separation between the primary radiating element (i.e., the scatterer antenna) and the person's skin, and does so without using a connector, which reduces cost and manufacturing complexity. Additionally, because the scatterer antenna is supported by the lid instead of being mounted to the printed circuit board in the bottom, space on the printed circuit board and within the device housing is conserved.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">This illustrative example is given to introduce the reader to the general subject matter discussed herein and the disclosure is not limited to this example. The following sections describe various additional non-limiting examples of wearable electronic devices.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to the figures, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an exploded perspective view of a wearable electronic device <b>100</b>, according to at least one example. The wearable electronic device <b>100</b> may be a wearable monitoring device that is mounted to a body at an exterior surface (e.g., against a person's skin), held against the body at the exterior surface, or mounted in any other suitable manner. As an example, the wearable electronic device <b>100</b> may be configured to monitor glucose levels of the person and communicate with a separate electronic device about the glucose levels.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The wearable electronic device <b>100</b> includes a first housing portion <b>102</b>A (e.g., a lower housing portion), a second housing portion <b>102</b>B (e.g., an upper housing portion), and a biosensor <b>104</b>. The first housing portion <b>102</b>A and the second housing portion <b>102</b>B are configured to couple together to define a housing of the wearable electronic device. The second housing portion <b>102</b>B includes a smooth exterior surface that faces outward from the person's skin. A smooth surface, free from sharp edges, may be desirable to decrease the potential for knocking the wearable electronic device <b>100</b> from the person's skin once mounted. For example, the wearable electronic device <b>100</b> may be worn under clothing (e.g., on the person's arm), and the smooth surface decreases the potential of the person's clothing snagging on the wearable electronic device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The housing may be compact in size for placing on a person's skin. The housing may be made of any suitable material for housing the biosensor <b>104</b>. Non-limiting examples of materials that may be suitable for the housing include silicone, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride (&#x201c;PVC&#x201d;), polypropylene, nylon, polyurethane, polycarbonate, steel, aluminum, and other plastics and metals.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The first housing portion <b>102</b>A may include a substantially planar surface to allow the wearable electronic device <b>100</b> to be placed against the person's skin. The wearable electronic device <b>100</b> may be secured to the skin using an adhesive, band, strap, or other securing means. In some examples, the wearable electronic device <b>100</b> may be worn for extended period of time (e.g., days, weeks, months, etc.). When assembled, a moisture barrier <b>128</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) that extends between the housing portions <b>102</b> may create a seal that keeps moisture from infiltrating the biosensor <b>104</b>. The seal may consist of an adhesive, elastomeric gasket, or other. When assembled, the second housing portion <b>102</b>B encloses the biosensor <b>104</b> and mates with the first housing portion <b>102</b>A (e.g., by way of a snap-fit, seal welded joint, or other). The second housing portion <b>102</b>B may also be glued or otherwise bonded to the first housing portion <b>102</b>A. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the wearable electronic device <b>100</b> after the first housing portion <b>102</b>A and the second housing portion <b>102</b>B have been mated together.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The biosensor <b>104</b>, e.g., an analyte sensor, glucose sensor, or other electromechanical sensor for use in sensing biological information of a person, includes a printed circuit board (&#x201c;PCB&#x201d;) <b>108</b> to which is physically and electrically connected a sensor carrier <b>110</b>, a current-carrying antenna <b>112</b>, sensing circuitry <b>115</b>, a power source <b>116</b> such as a battery, and a near-field communication (&#x201c;NFC&#x201d;) antenna <b>117</b>. The biosensor <b>104</b> also includes a scatterer antenna <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The PCB <b>108</b> may be a rigid printed circuit board, a flexible printed circuit board (&#x201c;FPCB&#x201d;), or any other suitable substrate for electrically and physically connecting the components described herein.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The sensor carrier <b>110</b> is configured to support a sensor wire <b>118</b>. The sensor wire <b>118</b> includes a proximal end portion <b>118</b>A and a distal end portion <b>118</b>B. The proximal end portion <b>118</b>A is supported by the sensor carrier <b>110</b>. For example, the proximal end portion <b>118</b>A may be disposed within a groove or channel of the sensor carrier <b>110</b>. The proximal end portion <b>118</b>A is electrically connected to the PCB <b>108</b> via the sensor carrier <b>110</b>. The sensor carrier <b>110</b> retains the proximal end portion <b>118</b>A and a wire alignment structure <b>120</b> directs the distal end portion <b>118</b>B via a first housing opening <b>122</b> in the first housing portion <b>102</b>A. The wire alignment structure <b>120</b> may include a pair of tabs, a groove, or other structure capable of aligning the sensor wire <b>118</b> through the first housing opening <b>122</b>. The wire alignment structure <b>120</b> can be a component that is attached to the PCB <b>108</b> or may be integrated into the construction of the first housing portion <b>102</b>A (e.g., formed at the same time and using the same approach as was used to form the first housing portion <b>102</b>A).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">When in use, the distal end portion <b>118</b>B, which includes one or more electrodes, is inserted into a person's skin to measure biological parameters (e.g., glucose levels) in the interstitial fluid of subcutaneous tissue beneath the skin. As illustrated, the wire alignment structure <b>120</b> is included on the PCB <b>108</b> at a position adjacent to the first housing opening <b>122</b>. The second housing portion <b>102</b>B includes a second housing opening <b>124</b> that is disposed above the first housing opening <b>122</b>. Through the second housing opening <b>124</b> may be inserted an insertion needle to inject the distal end portion <b>118</b>B of the sensor wire <b>118</b> underneath the person's skin. In some examples, the second housing opening <b>124</b> is formed from a deformable material that can reseal after the insertion needle has been inserted there through. In this manner, the sensor wire <b>118</b> can be injected without interrupting a moisture seal of the enclosure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The current-carrying antenna <b>112</b> is a loop antenna that has been formed in the PCB <b>108</b>. The current-carrying antenna <b>112</b> in combination with the scatterer antenna <b>114</b> may enable transmission of information from the wearable electronic device <b>100</b> (e.g., to one or more electronic devices). For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the wearable electronic device <b>100</b> may communicate over the air with a separate electronic device <b>130</b>. To enable such communication, a transceiver, included in the sensing circuitry <b>115</b> or otherwise, may use the current-carrying antenna <b>112</b> to transmit real-time glucose readings monitored by the biosensor <b>104</b>. The transceiver may also use the current-carrying antenna <b>112</b> to receive information from one or more other electronic devices (e.g., instructions to adjust settings of the biosensor <b>104</b>, updates to software or firmware of the biosensor <b>104</b>, etc.). In some examples, the antenna system including the current-carrying antenna <b>112</b> and the scatterer antenna <b>114</b> is configured to receive and send signals at 2.4 GHz, which may also correspond to the Bluetooth&#xae; standard for communication.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The scatterer antenna <b>114</b>, which is connected to the second housing portion <b>102</b>B, is any suitable communications antenna including a conductive trace antenna that is capable of scattering or otherwise amplifying electromagnetic waves from the current-carrying antenna <b>112</b>. The scatterer antenna <b>114</b> is a half wavelength dipole antenna. Although, as described herein, the scatterer antenna <b>114</b> may also be a full dipole antenna and/or have other lengths ranging less than a half wavelength to greater than a full wavelength. Due to the compact size of the scatterer antenna <b>114</b> and its mounting location in the second housing portion <b>102</b>B, a suitable separation distance between the primary radiating element of the antenna system (e.g., the scatterer antenna <b>114</b>) and the human tissue is achieved. Additionally, because of these same reasons, the design of the wearable electronic device <b>100</b> is less restricted by the available space on the PCB <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The scatterer antenna <b>114</b> is connected to the second housing portion <b>102</b>B and, at least a portion of which, is aligned with the current-carrying antenna <b>112</b>. For example, when the wearable electronic device <b>100</b> is assembled, a portion of the scatterer antenna <b>114</b> overlaps (e.g., sits above) a portion of the current-carrying antenna <b>112</b> to define an overlap region. In some examples, an air gap may be present between the scatterer antenna <b>114</b> and the current-carrying antenna <b>112</b> in this overlap region. In this overlap region, the current-carrying antenna <b>112</b> magnetically couples with the scatterer antenna <b>114</b> to induce the current to create radiating electromagnetic fields from the scatterer antenna <b>114</b>. In some examples, a spacing between the scatterer antenna <b>114</b> and the current-carrying antenna <b>112</b> in the overlap region may be about 1.9 mm. In some examples, the spacing is less than 1.9 mm or more than 1.9 mm (e.g., in range of about 0.5 mm to about 2.5 mm). The current-carrying antenna <b>112</b> may be oriented in a first plane and the scatterer antenna <b>114</b> may be oriented in a second plane that is substantially parallel to the first plane. In some examples, a substantial portion of the current-carrying antenna <b>112</b> may be oriented in the first plane and a substantial portion of the scatterer antenna <b>114</b> may be oriented in the second plane.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The scatterer antenna <b>114</b> may be formed from any suitable conductive material in any suitable manner. For example, the scatterer antenna <b>114</b> may include a metallic trace formed in a dielectric substrate such as a glass-reinforced epoxy laminate or a flexible printed circuit board. In some examples, the scatterer antenna <b>114</b> may include a high conductive copper trace having a thickness of 25-50 micrometers formed in the dielectric substrate. In this example, the scatterer antenna <b>114</b> may be physically connected to the second housing portion <b>102</b>B using an adhesive <b>126</b>. The adhesive <b>126</b> may be a pressure-sensitive adhesive (&#x201c;PSA&#x201d;) applied before or after the scatterer antenna <b>114</b> has been brought into physical contact with the second housing portion <b>102</b>B.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some examples, the scatterer antenna <b>114</b> may be formed from a conductive ink deposited directly to the second housing portion <b>102</b>B. For example, a silver ink trace having a thickness of 3-10 micrometers may be directly deposited on an interior surface of the second housing portion <b>102</b>B.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The sensing circuitry <b>115</b> includes one or more electronic components configured for signal processing. For example, the sensing circuitry <b>115</b> may include a system on chip (&#x201c;SOC&#x201d;) or system in package (&#x201c;SIP&#x201d;) that includes any suitable combination components for digital signal processing, analog signal processing, mixed-signal processing, and/or the like that may be present on the surface of a PCB assembly or embedded. Such components may include, for example, a microcontroller, a memory, a timing source, one or more digital interfaces, one or more analog interfaces, clocks, voltage regulators, and/or any other suitable component. The sensing circuitry <b>115</b> may be configured to receive electrical signals from the sensor wire <b>118</b> (e.g., via the PCB <b>108</b> and the sensor carrier <b>110</b>) and process the electrical signals to determine glucose levels of the person.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples, the sensing circuitry <b>115</b> includes a processing device and a computer-readable medium, such as a random access memory (&#x201c;RAM&#x201d;) coupled to the processing device. The processing device may execute computer-executable program instructions stored in memory, such as executing one or more computer programs. Such processing devices may comprise a microprocessor, a digital signal processor (&#x201c;DSP&#x201d;), an application-specific integrated circuit (&#x201c;ASIC&#x201d;), field programmable gate arrays (&#x201c;FPGAs&#x201d;), state machines, or other processing means for processing electrical signals received from electrodes the sensor wire <b>118</b>.

Examples of computer-readable media may include, but are not limited to a memory chip, ROM, RAM, ASIC, or any other storage means from which a processing device can read or write information.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The near-field communication (&#x201c;NFC&#x201d;) antenna <b>117</b> is any suitable antenna configured to enable near-filed communication between the wearable electronic device <b>100</b> and one or more other electronic devices, such as the electronic device <b>130</b> or other electronic devices. In some examples, the circuitry of the wearable electronic device <b>100</b> may be configured to use the NFC antenna <b>117</b> is initiate an NFC communication. In some examples, the NFC antenna <b>117</b> is the target of an NFC communication. In this manner, the NFC antenna <b>117</b> may enable passive and/or active communication between the wearable electronic device <b>100</b> and other electronic devices.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The power source <b>116</b> is a battery. The height of the power source <b>116</b> and/or power source hold down <b>119</b> represents a top-most elevation of the PCB <b>108</b>. As separation between the current-carrying antenna <b>112</b> and the scatterer antenna <b>114</b> are restricted by this elevation, the length and width of the scatterer antenna <b>114</b> may be adjusted to improve the radio communication. For example, the length of the scatterer antenna <b>114</b> may be around 42 mm. In some examples, the length of the scatterer antenna <b>42</b> may be more than 42 mm or less than 42 mm (e.g., within a range of 30 mm to 80 mm).

Because of this, the current may also be induced in the power source <b>116</b>. In other words, not only does the current-carrying antenna <b>112</b> induce current in the scatterer antenna <b>114</b>, in some examples, the current-carrying antenna <b>112</b> also induces current in the power source <b>116</b> via the scatterer antenna <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a top view of the wearable electronic device <b>100</b> with a device housing in an open state, according to at least one example.
