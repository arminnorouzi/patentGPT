For example, several MSOs use splicing or tuned transitions to jump from network content to advertisement content and vice-versa. Multiple advertisements are used for a particular advertisement time slot, which are intended or targeted for different customer set top boxes based on the customers' profiles. The multiple advertisements may be in the same channel transport streams and/or may be in different channels. Advertisement client software applications (or TAD applications) generally tune to an advertisement-based user profile or MSO set preference when the time slot or TAD window for the advertisement arrives. If the customer attempts to tune to a different channel during the TAD window, the TAD application may force the customer to stay on the TAD channel and may tune to the customer's request channel only when the TAD window has passed or has ended.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the customer or user is not always interested in the TAD content pre-selected for a particular TAD window, such as based on the customer's profile. What is desired, therefore, are systems and/or methods of providing alternative advertising content, such as targeted advertising, that may be provided when requested by the customer.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For a better understanding of the invention, and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a high-level block diagram of an example of a network for providing alternative advertising content;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an example of a process of providing alternative advertising content;</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating another example of a process of providing alternative advertising content;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example of a main advertisement and staggered alternative advertisement for an advertising window; and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example of a hardware configuration operable to manage advertising content.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an example network environment <b>100</b> for providing content from a content network <b>102</b> to a home or user network <b>104</b> via a provider, access, or subscriber network <b>106</b>, and for managing advertising content viewed by customers in the home or user network.

At <b>202</b>, first TAD content is outputted during a TAD window of multimedia content, such as via set top box <b>120</b> or IP set top box <b>124</b>. Prior to <b>202</b>, the customer may be tuned to the content channel and multimedia content from that channel may be outputted. During the TAD window of the multimedia content, the first TAD content may be outputted instead of the multimedia content from the content channel. The first TAD content may include one or more advertisements targeted for the customer based, for example, on the customer's profile. The advertisements and the first TAD content may have a total duration that is the same as the duration of the TAD window.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">At <b>204</b>, at least one user input is received during the TAD window from the customer requesting different TAD content, such as via the graphical user interface of set top box <b>120</b> or set top box <b>124</b>, and/or a remote control for the set top box or IP set top box. For example, the graphical user interface of set top box <b>120</b> or set top box <b>124</b> may include a &#x201c;swap&#x201d; or &#x201c;switch&#x201d; button to request different or alternative TAD content. In some embodiments, the user can click or select the button multiple times during the TAD window to view one or more alternative TAD content. Alternatively, a menu item in the graphical user interface may be selected or highlighted to request alternative TAD content.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">At <b>206</b>, different TAD content instead of the first TAD content is outputted during the TAD window in response to the user input(s). In some embodiments, the different TAD content may be outputted only after one or more predetermined amounts of time from the start or beginning of the TAD window. For example, the different TAD content may include a second TAD content and a third TAD content. The second TAD content may be outputted only, for example, after a first predetermined amount of time after the start of the TAD window and the third content may be outputted only, for example, after a second predetermined amount of time after the start of the TAD window. The second predetermined amount of time may be twice than the first predetermined amount of time, or may be more or less than twice the first predetermined amount of time. Although the different TAD content is described above to include second and third TAD content, other embodiments of method <b>200</b> may include different TAD content that includes only second TAD content (and not third TAD content), or includes fourth, fifth, sixth, or more TAD content which may be outputted after third, fourth, or fifth predetermined amounts of time.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, one or more of the different TAD content may be outputted based on when during the TAD window that the user input at step <b>204</b> is received. For example, when user input is received before the first predetermined amount of time after the start of the TAD window, the second TAD content may be outputted at <b>206</b>. Additionally, or alternatively, when user input is received after the first predetermined amount of time after the start of the TAD window but before the second predetermined amount of time after the start of the TAD window, the third TAD content may be outputted at <b>206</b>. The previously outputted TAD content may be described as only being partially outputted because the entire duration of that previous TAD content was not outputted. In some embodiments, outputting may skip one or more of the different TAD content, such as when user input is received after one or more predetermined amount of times. For example, when user input is received only after the first predetermined amount of time after the start of the TAD window but before the second predetermined amount of time after the start of the TAD window, method <b>200</b> may skip over the second TAD content and output the third TAD content instead of the first TAD content without at least partially outputting the second TAD content.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Method <b>200</b> may, in some embodiments, include at <b>208</b>, outputting the first TAD content instead of the different TAD content during the TAD window in response to receiving user input requesting different TAD content but the user input is received after the predetermined amount of time associated with all of the different TAD content elapses. The first TAD content may be outputted at a predetermined amount of time after the start of the TAD window or may be outputted immediately after the user input is received. The first TAD content is outputted or re-outputted at a point of the first TAD content that chronologically corresponds to the TAD window. In other words, outputting or re-outputting the first TAD content at step <b>208</b> such that the first TAD content ends as planned during the TAD window. In the example above with the second and third TAD content, if user input is received after the second predetermined amount of time (regardless of whether user input(s) where received before the second predetermined amount of time), then the first TAD content is outputted. If the above user input is the only user input received during the TAD window, then the first TAD content remains outputted. When the TAD window has ended, multimedia content from the content channel is outputted. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows particular steps for a process of providing alternative advertising content, other examples of the process may add, omit, replace, repeat, and/or modify one or more steps.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a flowchart is shown of another example method or process <b>250</b> of providing alternative advertising content, which may be performed, for example, by MSO system <b>112</b> and/or one or more their components, such as advertising splice points component <b>113</b>. At <b>252</b>, one or more splice points are inserted in a main TAD for one or more alternative TADs. For example, a first splice point and a second splice point made be inserted in the main TAD for a first alternative TAD and a second alternative TAD. The first alternative TAD may have a duration that is the same as the duration of the main TAD from the first splice point to the end of the main TAD, while the second alternative TAD may have a duration that is the same as the duration of the main TAD from the second splice point to the end of the main TAD. In some embodiments, a third splice point may be inserted in the first alternative TAD for the second alternative TAD, and/or a fourth splice point may be inserted in the second alternative TAD for the remaining portion of the main TAD. Additional splice points may be inserted in the main TAD and the alternative TADs as desired. At <b>254</b>, the main TAD and the alternative TAD(s) may be combined in one or more transport streams. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows particular steps for a process of providing alternative advertising content, other examples of the process may add, omit, replace, repeat, and/or modify one or more steps.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a block diagram <b>300</b> that further illustrates methods <b>200</b> and <b>300</b> is shown. A TAD window <b>302</b> includes a start <b>304</b> of the TAD window and an end <b>306</b> of the TAD window. A main TAD <b>308</b> is outputted during TAD window <b>302</b> and has a duration that is the same duration as the TAD window. In other words, main TAD <b>308</b> has a duration that spans from the start and the end of the TAD window. However, other embodiments may include two or more main TADs that have a collective or total duration that is the same duration as the TAD window. If a user input is received during a first predetermined amount of time <b>310</b> from start <b>304</b> of TAD window <b>302</b> (or before the first predetermined amount of time elapses), then first alternative TAD <b>312</b> is outputted at a first moment or point <b>314</b> of the TAD window, which is the moment or point when the first predetermined amount of time elapses and there is a first splice point in the main TAD to introduce the first alternative TAD.
