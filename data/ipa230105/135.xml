The liquid solution, sometimes called e-liquids or solvent, typically includes nicotine, flavourings and a humectant, such as propylene glycol, to retain moisture and create an aerosol when heated.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many of the flavourings and humectants used in e-liquids have been approved by regulators for oral consumption, however there is lack of research regarding the effects of these compounds when inhaled as an aerosol in the long term. For this reason, the composition of liquid solution for e-cigarettes remain largely unchanged. Thus, there is a need to find alternative composition or alternative formula of the liquid solutions.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The inventors of the present invention have found solutions to the above-discussed problems through currently proposed solvents, liquids and aerosol-generating articles as defined in the claims.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A first aspect of the invention is accordingly to provide a solvent for aerosol-generating material, wherein the solvent comprises of 1, 3-Propanediol and glycerol (i.e. propane-1, 2, 3-triol), wherein the 1, 3-Propanediol is less than 50% by weight based on the total weight of the solvent.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A second aspect of the invention is accordingly to provide a liquid composition comprising a solvent of the present invention and any of nicotine and/or flavourant and/or water.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A third aspect of the invention is accordingly an aerosol-generating article comprises the liquid composition of the present invention, wherein the composition is provided in form of a gel, a foam or a semi-solid matrix.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A fourth aspect of the invention relates to the use of the solvent or the liquid composition or the aerosol-generating article of the present invention for smoking.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The inventors of the present invention found out that instead of a commonly used e-liquid composition of glycerol and 1, 2-Propanediol, a solvent comprises 1, 3-Propanediol and glycerol, wherein the 1, 3-Propanediol is less than 50% by weight based on the total weight of the solvent. In other words, a combination of predominantly (i.e. over 50% of the total weight of the solvent) of glycerol and 1, 3-Propanediol (PDO), preferably over 90% by total weight of the solvent, is found to be an effective alternative formula for the e-liquid composition. Available experimental data demonstrated (e.g. highest concentration tested, 1800 mg/m<sup>3</sup>) that 1, 3-Pronanediol does not appear to pose a significant hazard via inhalation of either the vapour, aerosol or a vapour/aerosol mixture. Moreover, it is unexpectedly found out that the solvent according to the invention also significantly improves for example thermal stability as well as decrease inhaled flavours concentrations.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, similar results have also been observed when at least 90%, at least 95% or at least 98% by weight of the solvent comprises a combination of the 1, 3-Propanediol and the glycerol.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The inventors unexpectedly found out that the present invention confers several advantages not observed in PG (cf. experimental data below) in which certain attributes are obtained in tobacco flavour (e.g. overall flavour, caramel, overall flavour aftertaste, overall liking, tobacco, dryness), menthol flavour (e.g. menthol, overall flavour, vapour volume, roasted) or in fruit flavour (e.g. sweet, sweet aftertaste, bitter, coating). In other words, the formula of the solvent and/or liquid composition can therefore be custom-made based on individual needs. In general, the attributes observed in the 30/70 of PDO/VG (and few instances 50/50 of PDO/VG) are mostly sought after and therefore more desirable to be selected for the formulation in the solvent or liquid composition.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further aspect, when the inventors of the present invention explore the effects of the 1, 3-Propanediol and propylene glycol in glycerol in different ratios, it is furthermore found out that when the solvent comprises predominantly of 1, 3-Propanediol and glycerol (e.g. over 50%, over 90%, over 95% or over 98% of the total weight of the solvent) and that when the ratio of 1, 3-Propanediol to glycerol is exactly 3:7, a number of advantages of the e-cigarette attributes of the aerosol-generating solvent in respect of flavours were observed such as a higher overall flavour, overall liking, tobacco, caramel, cooling sensation, vapour volume and sweet/strawberry. These advantages obtained in the solvent comprising the ratio of 3:7 of PDO and glycerol (glycerine) will be explained in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to some preferred embodiments, when the ratio of 1, 3-Propanediol to glycerol (PDO:VG) is in the range of between 3:7 and 1:1, a number of attributes which generally are preferred by most consumers are obtained, more so when the ratio of PDO:VG is 3:7 and to some extent also to the ratio of 1:1.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the ratio of 1, 3-Propanediol to glycerol is in the range of between 3:7 and 4.5:5.5. The inventors found out that apart similar results can be obtained as in the ratio 3:7, nicotine delivery is found to be increased when the solvent comprises 1, 3-Propanediol and glycerol in such ratio.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to some embodiments, the solvent forms between 52.24 and 99.25% by weight of the composition, or preferably up to 70%, 75%, 80%, 85% or 90% by weight of the composition. The rest may be made up of elements such as tobacco, water, flavourant, gum, binder and etc.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to some embodiments, the nicotine forms at most 10% by weight based on the total weight of the composition, preferably at most 5% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to some embodiments, the flavourant forms between 0.7% and 20% by weight based on the total weight of the composition, preferably between 15 and 20% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to some embodiments, the water forms at most 10% by weight based on the total weight of the composition, preferably at most 2.5% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to some embodiments, the composition further comprises between 0.04% and 7.76% by weight of one or a mixture of carboxylic acids on the total weight of the composition.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to some embodiments, the carboxylic acid is at least one acid selected from the list consisting of Benzoic acid, Levulinic acid, D/L-Tartaric acid, Capric acid, Pyruvic acid, Citric acid, Fumaric acid, D/L-Lactic acid, D/L-Malic acid, Sorbic acid, Adipic acid, L-Aspartic acid, L-Glutamic acid, Succinic acid, Gluconic acid, Linoleic acid, Saccharic acid, 3,7 dimethyl-6-octenoic acid, 2-methyl pentanoic acid, trans-2-Hexenoic acid, Caprylic acid, Lauric acid, Stearic acid, Butyric acid, Linolenic acid, Malonic acid, Myristic acid, Oleic acid, Palmitic acid, Phenylacetic acid, Propionic acid, Valeric acid, Decanoic acid, Hexanoic acid, Octanoic acid.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to some embodiments, the liquid composition has a pH value in the range from 5 to 9, preferably 5.1 to 8.8, more preferably 8.8 to 9.8 when the composition contains no acid, or more preferably pH of 6.3 to 6.5 when the composition contains acid.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to some embodiments, the article is any of an electronic cigarette, an electronic cigarette cartridge, an e-cigarette liquid.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to some embodiments, the article is a heat-not-burn consumable product.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another preferred embodiment, the solvent further comprises one or more of the following components: vapour former, nicotine-containing substrate, water, 1, 2-Propanediol (propylene glycol), flavourings and the combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a further embodiment, the solvent comprises between 0.1% and 2.5% by weight of water based on the total weight of the solvent.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In yet a further embodiment, the solvent comprises between 0.05% and 10% by weight of nicotine-containing substrate based on the total weight of the solvent.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to one preferred embodiment, the solvent comprises approximately between 0.1% and 11%, preferably at most 10%, more preferably at most 5% by weight of nicotine-containing substrate based on the total of the solvent.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to another embodiment, the solvent is provided in form of gel-like, foam-like or a semi-solid matrix.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to one further embodiment, the solvent has a melting point of less than 50&#xb0; C., preferably less than 35&#xb0; C., more preferably less than 25&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In another embodiment, a minute amount (i.e. less than 2% by weight based on the total solvent weight) of ethanol can further be added in the solvent.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">By &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; in relation to a given numerical value, it is meant to include numerical values within 10% of the specified value.

These advantages are for instance less stimulating effect on eyes and skin.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Glycols have been used widely in cosmetics and personal care products to impart beneficial properties such as humectancy, solvency, moisturization and emulsification. Propylene glycol (PG) and 1, 3-Propanediol (PDO) are two examples of glycol. PG, or also known as 1, 2-Propanediol, is chemically different to PDO although they have similar structures and physicochemical properties.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Due to its lower boiling point and viscosity, and different solvent properties, propylene glycol (PG) is often mixed with glycerine in liquid blends intended for inhalation. However, in relation to glycerine, the safety profile of propylene glycol is less well established in particular at high concentrations.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Another compound, 1, 3-Propanediol (PDO), which can be manufactured either by a chemical process using petroleum feedstock or by a fermentation (bio-based) process using corn sugar, has been found to be particularly suitable for use in electronic cigarette liquid solutions.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this connection, the inventors of the present invention found out that PDO is a good alternative for PG in the solvent for use in e-liquid when less than half of the total weight of the solvent comprises the PDO.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Moreover, when the solvent comprises over 90%, over 95% or over 98% by weight of 1, 3-Propanediol and glycerol, it is discovered that in terms of fresh-keeping ability, the required concentration of 1, 3-Propanediol is much lower than that of 1,2-propanediol.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">To this end, it is furthermore disclosed herein that apart from the surprising technical effects of the new formulation of solvent for e-cigarettes disclosed herein, the inventors of the present invention further found out that when the solvent comprises predominantly of PDO and glycerol (e.g. over 50%, over 90%, over 95% or over 98% by weight based on total weight), thermal stability of the solvent is improved significantly, with or without nicotine contained therein.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For instance, thermal stability of formulations of nicotine in PG-VG (1, 2-Propanediol and glycerol) and in PDO-VG (1, 3-Propanediol and glycerol) were compared by differential thermal analysis. It was observed that a significant exothermic peak at around 250&#xb0; C. corresponding to a vaporisation residue of 3 wt. % is characteristic of PG-VG and corresponds to an energy release of 37-38 J/g indicating chemical interactions between PG and VG at high temperature. To the contrary, the PDO-VG formulation has no exothermic peak. This observation leads to indicate the absence of any chemical interaction between PDO and VG.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Moreover, the inventors of the invention further discovers that the thermal behaviour of nicotine-PDO formulation unexpectedly demonstrating a co-vaporization process of nicotine and PDO, confirming the absence of chemical interaction between nicotine and PDO. This result suggests that PDO is particularly adapted to ensure a constant delivery of nicotine during vaping process.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">More surprisingly, when the ratio between the PDO and glycerol is provided to be exactly at 3:7, as demonstrated by the experimental data, a number of positive e-cigarette attributes have been observed (i.e. higher mean scores for positive attributes and lower mean scores for negative attributes) compared to the samples where PG and glycerol were provided at the same ratio. These positive results were not observed in other ratios, such as 7:3 and 1:1 of PDO and glycerol.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The most common attributes of e-cigarettes used included those that are flavoured, contain nicotine, and are of tank style. It has been proposed that attributes that warrant further research include characterizing flavours and product features that allow user customization (i.e. mixing different e-liquids and adjusting voltage or temperature settings).</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">For this reason, the inventors of the present invention have looked into one perspective of the e-cigarette attributes, namely the &#x201c;flavour&#x201d; and the results are disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Several solvents according to the present invention having different percentage of combination of the composition have been prepared and tested. The samples were prepared for example as shown in Table 1 below.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="280pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Solvents prepared according to several combinations.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Combined</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>PDO and</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>glycerol</entry></row><row><entry>Examples</entry><entry>(3:7)</entry><entry>Nicotine</entry><entry>Acid</entry><entry>Water</entry><entry>Flavour</entry><entry>Total</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="8"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="right"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1</entry><entry>79.95 wt. %</entry><entry>0.05</entry><entry>wt. %</entry><entry>0.00 wt. %</entry><entry>0.00 wt. %</entry><entry>20.0 wt. %</entry><entry>100 wt. %</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>70.00 wt. %</entry><entry>10.0</entry><entry>wt. %</entry><entry>0.00 wt. %</entry><entry>0.00 wt. %</entry><entry>20.0 wt. %</entry><entry>100 wt. %</entry></row><row><entry>3</entry><entry>79.91 wt. %</entry><entry>0.05</entry><entry>wt. %</entry><entry>0.04 wt. %</entry><entry>0.00 wt. %</entry><entry>20.0 wt. %</entry><entry>100 wt. %</entry></row><row><entry>4</entry><entry>62.24 wt. %</entry><entry>10.0</entry><entry>wt. %</entry><entry>7.76 wt. %</entry><entry>0.00 wt. %</entry><entry>20.0 wt. %</entry><entry>100 wt. %</entry></row><row><entry>5</entry><entry>77.45 wt. %</entry><entry>0.05</entry><entry>wt. %</entry><entry>0.00 wt. %</entry><entry>2.50 wt. %</entry><entry>20.0 wt. %</entry><entry>100 wt. %</entry></row><row><entry>6</entry><entry>67.50 wt. %</entry><entry>10.0</entry><entry>wt. %</entry><entry>0.00 wt. %</entry><entry>2.50 wt. %</entry><entry>20.0 wt. %</entry><entry>100 wt. %</entry></row><row><entry>7</entry><entry>77.41 wt. %</entry><entry>0.05</entry><entry>wt. %</entry><entry>0.04 wt. %</entry><entry>2.50 wt. %</entry><entry>20.0 wt. %</entry><entry>100 wt. %</entry></row><row><entry>8</entry><entry>59.74 wt. %</entry><entry>10.00</entry><entry>wt. %</entry><entry>7.76 wt. %</entry><entry>2.50 wt. %</entry><entry>20.0 wt. %</entry><entry>100 wt. %</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Examples</heading><p id="p-0067" num="0065">The experimental results which will be discussed below is based on the solvent provided according to the Example 5 (for experimental data shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>6</b></figref>), or according to the Example 7 (for experimental data shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>13</b></figref>), as shown in the Table 1 above.

This attribute (perception to dryness and vapour volume) was particularly investigated as it is often sought after by users for the fact that this attribute relates to refreshing sensation.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0087">In more detail, as can be seen in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, when the ratio of PDO and glycerol is provided at 3:7 (30% are PDO and 70% are glycerol), the &#x201c;cooling sensation&#x201d; decreased slightly compared to the other two ratios (i.e. 7:3 and 1:1). However, a significant dropped of the &#x201c;cooling sensation&#x201d; was observed in the sample of PG and glycerol having the ratio of 3:7. On another hand, when the attribute of &#x201c;dryness vs vapour volume&#x201d; was investigated, as demonstrated in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, samples containing PDO produced constantly higher mean scores across different ratios in comparison to the PG. This result proposed that glycerol-based solvent (i.e. over 50% by weight are glycerol) comprising a ratio of 3:7 of PDO and glycerol are particularly suitable for e-liquid providing cooling sensation and reduced dryness.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows that PDO decreases the known negative attributes (e.g. smoky, coating and bitterness) for fruit flavour category, when the ratio of PDO and glycerol was provided at 3:7. This result clearly shows that solvent comprising lower percentage of PDO (3:7 for PDO: glycerol) is a more favourable candidate compared to other ratios.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0089">When the ratio of PDO and glycerol was provided at 3:7, the mean score for &#x201c;sweet/strawberry&#x201d; increased significantly, as can be seen in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> whereas the mean score of PG and glycerol, when the ratio was set at 3:7, decreased significantly. This shows that the solvent comprising PDO and glycerol is a better candidate in comparison of PG and glycerol when the solvent is provided at this ratio of 3:7.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0090">Noteworthy, the inventors of the present invention also found out that the solvent comprising PDO as claimed presently is not only stable upon heating (e.g. less than 250&#xb0; C.) and have better thermal behaviour showing less thermal decomposition by-products compared to PG, PDO also seems to give nicotine a more basic environment ensuring a complete free base nicotine form.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0091">Furthermore, when the ratio of PDO to glycerol is 3:7, the solvent gives surprisingly better flavouring properties than PG and glycerol. This special effect has not been observed in another ratio, for instance 2:3, 3:2, or 1:4.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0092">The 1, 3-Propanediol (PDO) used in the present invention is commercially available provided from companies such as Laboratoires Xeres and Naturacig under the product name of &#x201c;vegetol&#x201d;. It is therefore foreseen that the PDOs provided by other companies can also be treated as equivalent.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0093">The liquid composition as used herein contains solvent as described herein, wherein the solvent is glycerol-based (i.e. over 50% by weight). The liquid composition may further include elements such as nicotine, water, flavour, additives, acid and etc. For instance, the weight distribution of these elements can be for instance 0.05-10 wt. % of nicotine, 0-7.76% of acid, 0-10 wt. % of water, 0.7-20 wt. % of flavour, 50-90 wt. % of glycerol.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0094">As an example, the combined amount of PDO and glycerol according to the present invention may be provided up to 79.95 wt. % based on the total weight of the solvent, the rest being made up of for instance 0.05 wt. % of nicotine and 20 wt. % of flavourant.
