The only circulating forms of folates in the blood are monoglutamates and folate monoglutamates are the only form of folate that is transported across the cell membrane&#x2014;likewise, the monoglutamate form of polyglutamatable antifolates are transported across the cell membrane. Once taken up into cells, intracellular folate is converted to polyglutamates by the enzyme folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase (FPGS).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Antifolate is transported into cells by the reduced folate carrier (RFC) system and folate receptors (FRs) &#x3b1; and &#x3b2; and by Proton Coupled Folate Transporter (PCFT) that is generally most active in a lower pH environment. RFC is the main transporter of antifolates at physiologic pH and is ubiquitously expressed in both normal and diseased cells. Consequently, Antifolate treatment often suffers from the dose-limiting toxicity that is a major obstacle in cancer chemotherapy. Once inside the cell, antifolates are polyglutamated by FPGS, which may add up to 6 glutamyl groups in an L-gamma carboxyl group linkage to the antifolate. The L-gamma polyglutamation of antifolates by FPGS serves at least two main therapeutic purposes: (1) it greatly enhances Antifolate affinity and inhibitory activity for DHFR; and (2) it facilitates the accumulation of polyglutamated antifolate, which unlike antifolate (monoglutamate), is not easily transported out of cells by cell efflux pumps.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While targeting folate metabolism and nucleotide biosynthesis is a well-established therapeutic strategy for cancer, for antifolates, clinical efficacy is limited by a lack of tumor selectivity and the presence of de novo and acquired drug resistance. Antifolates often act during DNA and RNA synthesis, and consequently have a greater toxic effect on rapidly dividing cells such as malignant and myeloid cells. Myelosuppression is typically the dose-limiting toxicity of antifolate therapy and has limited the clinical applications of antifolates.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Resistance to antifolate therapy is typically associated with one or more of, (a) increased cell efflux pump activity, (b) decreased transport of antifolates into cells (c) increased DHFR activity, (d) decreased folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity, and (e) increased gamma-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) activity, which cleaves gamma polyglutamate chains attached to folates and antifolates.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The challenge to the longstanding (&#x3e;30 years) observation that higher-level polyglutamates of various antifolates have much greater potency compared to lower-level glutamates, has been that the scientific community has relied on the intracellular FPGS mediated mechanisms to convert the lower-level glutamates to their higher-level forms. The present disclosure provides the chemical synthesis, larger scale process and the means to deliver higher-level polyglutamate forms of antifolates directly into the cell, without having to rely on the cells machinery to achieve this goal.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In various embodiments, the present disclosure is based in part on the advantageous synthetic methods described herein, which allow large-scale synthesis of polyglutamated compounds, in particular, polyglutamated Antifolates such as gamma-polyglutammated Antifolates, and/or alpha-polyglutammated Antifolates, e.g., in a substantially pure form.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the present disclosure also provides pharmaceutical compositions such as liposomal compositions comprising the polyglutamated Antifolates such as the substantially pure polyglutamated Antifolates and methods of using the compositions.

In some embodiments, the provided methods deliver to cancer cells a gamma or alpha polyglutamated form of the antifolate while (1) minimizing/reducing exposure to normal tissue cells, (2) optimizing/improving the cytotoxic effect of antifolate-based agents on cancer cells and (3) minimizing/reducing the impact of the efflux pumps, and other resistance mechanisms that limit the therapeutic efficacy of antifolates.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to a method of preparing a polyglutamated drug, in particular, a polyglutamated antifolate, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

Reference to the number of glutamyl groups in a &#x3b3;PANTIFOL (ANTIFOL-PG) herein takes into account the glutamyl group in the Antifolate. For example, a ANTIFOL-PG composition containing 5 glutamyl residues in addition to the glutamyl group of ANTIFOL is referred to herein as hexaglutamated Antifolate or Antifolate hexaglutamate. Polyglutamate chains comprise an N-terminal glutamyl group and one or more C-terminal glutamyl groups. The N-terminal glutamyl group of a polyglutamate chain is not linked to another glutamyl group via its amine group, but is linked to one or more glutamyl group via its carboxylic acid group. In some embodiments, the N-terminal glutamyl group of a polyglutamated-Antifolate is the glutamyl group of Antifolate.

In some embodiments, the gamma linkage is an amide bond between the gamma carboxyl group of one glutamyl group and a second glutamyl group. The gamma linkage can be between a glutamyl group and the glutamyl group in the Antifolate, or between the glutamyl group and a second glutamyl group that is not present in Antifolate, such as a glutamyl group within a polyglutamate chain attached to Antifolate. In some embodiments, the gamma linkage refers to the amide bond of the glutamyl group of the Antifolate.

The targeting moiety can comprise a wide variety of entities. Targeting moieties can include naturally occurring molecules, or recombinant or synthetic molecules. In some embodiments, the targeting moiety is an antibody, antigen-binding antibody fragment, bispecific antibody or other antibody-based molecule or compound. In some embodiments, the targeting moiety is an aptamer, avimer, a receptor-binding ligand, a nucleic acid, a biotin-avidin binding pair, a peptide, protein, carbohydrate, lipid, vitamin, toxin, a component of a microorganism, a hormone, a receptor ligand or any derivative thereof.

Because of the sequence identity between homologous proteins in different species, specific affinity can, in several embodiments, include a binding agent that recognizes a protein or target in more than one species. Likewise, because of homology within certain regions of polypeptide sequences of different proteins, the term &#x201c;specific affinity&#x201d; or &#x201c;specifically binds&#x201d; can include a binding agent that recognizes more than one protein or target. It is understood that, in certain embodiments, a targeting moiety that specifically binds a first target may or may not specifically bind a second target. As such, &#x201c;specific affinity&#x201d; does not necessarily require (although it can include) exclusive binding, e.g., binding to a single target. Thus, a targeting moiety may, in certain embodiments, specifically bind more than one target. In certain embodiments, multiple targets may be bound by the same targeting moiety.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0070">The term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; refers to that portion of an antigen capable of being recognized and specifically bound by a targeting moiety (i.e., binding moiety) such as an antibody. When the antigen is a polypeptide, epitopes can be formed both from contiguous amino acids and noncontiguous amino acids juxtaposed by tertiary folding of a protein. Epitopes formed from contiguous amino acids are typically retained upon protein denaturing, whereas epitopes formed by tertiary folding are typically lost upon protein denaturing. An epitope typically includes at least 3, and more usually, at least 5 or 8-10 amino acids in a unique spatial conformation.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0071">Expressions like &#x201c;binding affinity for a target&#x201d;, &#x201c;binding to a target&#x201d; and analogous expressions known in the art refer to a property of a targeting moiety which may be directly measured through the determination of the affinity constants, e.g., the amount of targeting moiety that associates and dissociates at a given antigen concentration. Different methods can be used to characterize the molecular interaction, such as, but not limited to, competition analysis, equilibrium analysis and microcalorimetric analysis, and real-time interaction analysis based on surface plasmon resonance interaction (for example using a BIACORE&#xae; instrument). These methods are well-known to the skilled person and are described, for example, in Neri et al., Tibtech 14:465-470 (1996), and Jansson et al., J. Biol.

An &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; can be determined empirically and in a routine manner, in relation to the stated purpose. In the case of cancer, the effective amount of an agent may reduce the number of cancer cells; reduce the tumor size; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; inhibit (i.e., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; inhibit, to some extent, tumor growth; and/or relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the disorder. To the extent the drug may prevent growth and/or kill existing cancer cells, it may be cytostatic and/or cytotoxic.

Cyclodextrins (CDs) are groups of cyclic oligosaccharides which have been shown to improve physicochemical properties of many drugs through formation of complexes. CDs are cyclic oligosaccharides composed of several D-glucose units linked by &#x3b1;-(1,4) bonds. This cyclic configuration provides a hydrophobic internal cavity and gives the CDs a truncated cone shape. Many hydroxyl groups are situated on the edges of the ring which make the CDs both lipophilic and soluble in water. As a result, CDs are able to form complexes with a wide variety of hydrophobic agents, and thus change the physical-chemical properties of these complexed agents.

The terms &#x201c;parent&#x201d;, &#x201c;underivatized&#x201d;, or &#x201c;inert&#x201d;, cyclodextrin refer to a cyclodextrin containing D-glucopyranoside units having the basic formula C6H12O6 and a glucose structure without any additional chemical substitutions (e.g., &#x3b1;-cyclodextrin consisting of 6 D-glucopyranoside units, a &#x3b2;-cyclodextrin consisting of 7 D-glucopyranoside units, and a &#x3b3;-cyclodextrin cyclodextrin consisting of 8 D-glucopyranoside units). The physical and chemical properties of a parent cyclodextrin can be modified by derivatizing the hydroxyl groups with other functional groups.

The term &#x201c;charged cyclodextrin&#x201d; refers to a cyclodextrin having one or more of its hydroxyl groups substituted with a charged moiety. Such a moiety can itself be a charged group or it can comprise an organic moiety (e.g., a C1-C6 alkyl or C1-C6 alkyl ether moiety) substituted with one or more charged moieties.</p><p id="p-0428" num="0299">In some embodiments, the &#x201c;ionizable&#x201d; or &#x201c;charged&#x201d; moieties of a CD derivative are weakly ionizable.

Since each cyclodextrin hydroxyl group differs in chemical reactivity, reaction with a modifying moiety can produce an amorphous mixture of positional and optical isomers. Alternatively, certain chemistry can allow for pre-modified &#x3b1;-D-glucopyranoside units to be reacted to form uniform products.</p><p id="p-0433" num="0304">The aggregate substitution that occurs for cyclodextrin derivatives in a mixture is described by a term referred to as the degree of substitution. For example, a 6-ethylenediamino-&#x3b2;-cyclodextrin with a degree of substitution of seven would be composed of a distribution of isomers of 6-ethylenediamino-&#x3b2;-cyclodextrin in which the average number of ethylenediamino groups per 6-ethylenediamino-&#x3b2;-cyclodextrin molecule is seven. The degree of substitution for a cyclodextrin derivative mixture can routinely be determined using mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.</p><p id="p-0434" num="0305">In one embodiment, at least one hydroxyl moieties facing away from the cyclodextrin interior is substituted with an ionizable chemical group. For example, the C2, C3, C6, C2 and C3, C2 and C6, C3 and C6, and all three of C2-C3-C6 hydroxyls of at least one &#x3b1;-D-glucopyranoside unit are substituted with an ionizable chemical group.

A wide variety of lipids have been used to make liposomes. These include cationic, anionic and neutral lipids. In some embodiments, the liposomes comprising the polyglutamated Antifolate are anionic or neutral. In other embodiments, the provided liposomes are cationic. The determination of the charge (e.g., anionic, neutral or cationic) can routinely be determined by measuring the zeta potential of the liposome. The zeta potential of the liposome can be positive, zero or negative. In some embodiments, the zeta potential of the liposome is less than or equal to zero. In some embodiments, the zeta potential of the liposome is in a range of 0 to &#x2212;150 mV. In another embodiment, the zeta potential of the liposome is in the range of &#x2212;30 to &#x2212;50 mV.</p><p id="p-0478" num="0343">In some embodiments, cationic lipids are used to make cationic liposomes which are commonly used as gene transfection agents. The positive charge on cationic liposomes enables interaction with the negative charge on cell surfaces. Following binding of the cationic liposomes to the cell, the liposome is transported inside the cell through endocytosis.</p><p id="p-0479" num="0344">In some preferred embodiments, a neutral to anionic liposome is used. In a preferred embodiment, an anionic liposome is used. Using a mixture of, for example, neutral lipids such as HSPC and anionic lipids such as PEG-DSPE results in the formation of anionic liposomes which are less likely to non-specifically bind to normal cells. Specific binding to tumor cells can be achieved by using a tumor targeting antibody such as, for example, a folate receptor antibody, including, for example, folate receptor alpha antibody, folate receptor beta antibody and/or folate receptor delta antibody.</p><p id="p-0480" num="0345">As an example, at least one (or some) of the lipids is/are amphipathic lipids, defined as having a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic portion (typically a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail). The hydrophobic portion typically orients into a hydrophobic phase (e.g., within the bilayer), while the hydrophilic portion typically orients toward the aqueous phase (e.g., outside the bilayer). The hydrophilic portion can comprise polar or charged groups such as carbohydrates, phosphate, carboxylic, sulfato, amino, sulfhydryl, nitro, hydroxy and other like groups. The hydrophobic portion can comprise apolar groups that include without limitation long chain saturated and unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups and groups substituted by one or more aromatic, cyclo-aliphatic or heterocyclic group(s). Examples of amphipathic compounds include, but are not limited to, phospholipids, aminolipids and sphingolipids.</p><p id="p-0481" num="0346">Typically, for example, the lipids are phospholipids. Phospholipids include without limitation phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and the like. It is to be understood that other lipid membrane components, such as cholesterol, sphingomyelin, and cardiolipin, can be used.</p><p id="p-0482" num="0347">The lipids comprising the liposomes provided herein can be anionic and neutral (including zwitterionic and polar) lipids including anionic and neutral phospholipids. Neutral lipids exist in an uncharged or neutral zwitterionic form at a selected pH. At physiological pH, such lipids include, for example, dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG), diacylphosphatidylcholine, diacylphosphatidylethanolamine, ceramide, sphingomyelin, cephalin, cholesterol, cerebrosides and diacylglycerols. Examples of zwitterionic lipids include without limitation dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), dimyristoylphos-phatidylcholine (DMPC), and dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS). Anionic lipids are negatively charged at physiological pH. These lipids include without limitation phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin, diacylphosphatidylserine, diacylphosphatidic acid, N-dode-canoyl phosphatidylethanolamines, N-succinyl phosphatidylethanolamines, N-glutarylphosphatidylethanolamines, lysylphosphatidylglycerols, palmitoyloleyolphos-phatidylglycerol (POPG), and other anionic modifying groups joined to neutral lipids.</p><p id="p-0483" num="0348">Collectively, anionic and neutral lipids are referred to herein as non-cationic lipids. Such lipids may contain phosphorus but they are not so limited. Examples of non-cationic lipids include lecithin, lysolecithin, phosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylethan-olamine, dioleoylphosphati-dylethanolamine (DOPE), dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl ethanol-amine (DPPE), dimyristoylphosphoethanolamine (DMPE), distearoyl-phosphatidy 1-ethan-olamine (DSPE), palmitoyloleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) palmitoyl-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC), distearoylphosphat-idylcholine (DSPC), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), dipalmitoylphospha-tidylcholine (DPPC), dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG), dipalmitoylphospha-tidylglycerol (DPPG), palmitoyloleyolphosphatidylglycerol (POPG), 16-0-monomethyl PE, 16-0-dimethyl PE, 18-1-trans PE, palmitoyloleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), 1-stearoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidyethanolamine (SOPE), phosphatidylserine, phosphatidyl-inositol, sphingomyelin, cephalin, cardiolipin, phosphatidic acid, cerebrosides, dicetyl-phosphate, and cholesterol.</p><p id="p-0484" num="0349">The liposomes may be assembled using any liposomal assembly method using liposomal components (also referred to as liposome components) known in the art.

Typically, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins in which residues from the complementary determining region (CDR) are replaced by residues from the CDR of a non-human species (e.g., mouse, rat, rabbit, and hamster) that have the desired specificity, affinity, and capability (Jones et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-327 (1988); Verhoeyen et al., Science 239:1534-1536 (1988)). In some instances, the Fv framework region (FR) residues of a human immunoglobulin are replaced with the corresponding residues in an antibody from a non-human species that has the desired specificity, affinity, and capability. The humanized antibody can be further modified by the substitution of additional residues either in the Fv framework region and/or within the replaced non-human residues to refine and optimize antibody specificity, affinity, and/or capability. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two or three, variable domains containing all or substantially all of the CDR regions that correspond to the non-human immunoglobulin whereas all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin consensus sequence. The humanized antibody can also comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region or domain (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin.

In other embodiments, the target cell is an immune cell.</p><p id="p-0564" num="0423">In some embodiments, the targeting moiety has specific affinity for an epitope expressed on a tumor cell surface antigen. The term &#x201c;tumor cell surface antigen&#x201d; refers to an antigen that is common to a specific hyperproliferative disorder such as cancer. In some embodiments, the targeting moiety has specific affinity for an epitope of a tumor cell surface antigen that is a tumor associated antigen (TAA). A TAA is an antigen that is found on both tumor and some normal cells. A TAA may be expressed on normal cells during fetal development when the immune system is immature and unable to respond or may be normally present at extremely low levels on normal cells but which are expressed at much higher levels on tumor cells. Because of the dynamic nature of tumors, in some instances, tumor cells may express unique antigens at certain stages, and at others also express antigens that are also expressed on non-tumor cells.

Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable carriers contained in the provided pharmaceutical compositions include normal saline, isotonic dextrose, isotonic sucrose, Ringer's solution, and Hanks' solution. In some embodiments, a buffer substance is added to maintain an optimal pH for storage stability of the pharmaceutical composition. In some embodiments, the pH of the pharmaceutical composition is between 6.0 and 7.5. In some embodiments, the pH is between 6.3 and 7.0. In further embodiments, the pH is 6.5. Ideally the pH of the pharmaceutical composition allows for both stability of liposome membrane lipids and retention of the entrapped entities. Histidine, hydroxyethylpiperazine-ethylsulfonate (HEPES), morpholipoethylsulfonate (MES), succinate, tartrate, and citrate, typically at 2-20 mM concentration, are exemplary buffer substances. Other suitable carriers include, e.g., water, buffered aqueous solution, 0.4% NaCl, and 0.3% glycine. Protein, carbohydrate, or polymeric stabilizers and tonicity adjusters can be added, e.g., gelatin, albumin, dextran, or polyvinylpyrrolidone. The tonicity of the composition can be adjusted to the physiological level of 0.25-0.35 mol/kg with glucose or a more inert compound such as lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or dextrin. These compositions can routinely be sterilized using conventional, sterilization techniques known in the art (e.g., by filtration). The resulting aqueous solutions can be packaged for use or filtered under aseptic conditions and lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous medium prior to administration.</p><p id="p-0603" num="0462">The provided pharmaceutical liposome compositions can also contain other pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, and tonicity adjusting agents, for example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and calcium chloride. Additionally, the liposome suspension may include lipid-protective agents which protect lipids against free-radical and lipid-peroxidative damages on storage. Lipophilic free-radical quenchers, such as gamma-tocopherol and water-soluble iron-specific chelators, such as ferrioxamine, are suitable.</p><p id="p-0604" num="0463">The liposome concentration in the provided fluid pharmaceutical formulations can vary widely depending upon need, e.g., from less than about 0.05% usually or at least about 2-10% to as much as 30-50% by weight and will be selected primarily by fluid volumes, and viscosities, in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected. For example, the concentration may be increased to lower the fluid load associated with treatment. This may be particularly desirable in patients having atherosclerosis-associated congestive heart failure or severe hypertension. Alternatively, liposome pharmaceutical compositions composed of irritating lipids may be diluted to low concentrations to lessen inflammation at the site of administration.</p><p id="p-0605" num="0464">Some embodiments, relate to a method of delivering a targeted pegylated liposomal formulation of polyglutamated Antifolate, to a tumor expressing folate receptor on its surface. An exemplary method comprises the step of administering a liposome pharmaceutical composition provided herein in an amount to deliver a therapeutically effective dose of the targeted pegylated liposomal polyglutamated Antifolate to the tumor.</p><p id="p-0606" num="0465">The amount of liposome pharmaceutical composition administered will depend upon the particular polyglutamated Antifolate entrapped inside the liposomes, the disease state being treated, the type of liposomes being used, and the judgment of the clinician. Generally, the amount of liposome pharmaceutical composition administered will be sufficient to deliver a therapeutically effective dose of the particular therapeutic entity.</p><p id="p-0607" num="0466">The quantity of liposome pharmaceutical composition necessary to deliver a therapeutically effective dose can be determined by routine in vitro and in vivo methods, common in the art of drug testing. See, for example, D. B. Budman, A. H. Calvert, E. K. Rowinsky (editors). Handbook of Anticancer Drug Development, LWW, 2003. Therapeutically effective dosages for various therapeutic compositions are known to those skilled in the art. In some embodiments, a therapeutic entity delivered via the pharmaceutical liposome composition and provides at least the same or higher activity than the activity obtained by administering the same amount of the therapeutic entity in its routine non-liposome formulation. Typically, the dosages for the liposome pharmaceutical composition is in a range for example, between about 0.005 and about 5000 mg of the therapeutic entity per square meter of body surface area most often, between about 0.1 and about 1000 mg therapeutic entity per square meter of body surface area.</p><p id="p-0608" num="0467">For example, if the subject has a tumor, an effective amount may be that amount of the agent (e.g., gamma polyglutamated Antifolate composition or alpha polyglutamated Antifolate composition) that reduces the tumor volume or load (as for example determined by imaging the tumor). Effective amounts can also routinely be assessed by the presence and/or frequency of cancer cells in the blood or other body fluid or tissue (e.g., a biopsy). If the tumor is impacting the normal functioning of a tissue or organ, then the effective amount can routinely be assessed by measuring the normal functioning of the tissue or organ. In some instances, the effective amount is the amount required to lessen or eliminate one or more, and preferably all, symptoms.</p><p id="p-0609" num="0468">Pharmaceutical compositions comprising the polyglutamated Antifolate compositions (e.g., liposomes containing a pentaglutamated or hexaglutamated Antifolate) are also provided. Pharmaceutical compositions are sterile compositions that comprise a sample liposome and preferably polyglutamated Antifolate, preferably in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p><p id="p-0610" num="0469">Unless otherwise stated herein, a variety of administration routes are available. The particular mode selected will depend, upon the particular active agent selected, the particular condition being treated, and the dosage required for therapeutic efficacy. The provided methods can be practiced using any known mode of administration that is medically acceptable and in accordance with good medical practice. In some embodiments, the administration route is an injection. In further embodiments, the injection is by a parenteral route elected from an intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intraarticular, intraepidural, intrathecal, intravenous, intramuscular, or intra sternal injection. In some embodiments, the administration route is an infusion. In additional embodiments, the administration route is oral, nasal, mucosal, sublingual, intratracheal, ophthalmic, rectal, vaginal, ocular, topical, transdermal, pulmonary, or inhalation.</p><p id="p-0611" num="0470">Therapeutic compositions containing PANTIFOL compositions such as the liposomal PANTIFOL compositions described herein can be conventionally administered intravenously, as by injection of a unit dose, for example. The term &#x201c;unit dose&#x201d; when used in reference to a therapeutic composition provided herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosage for the subject, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required diluent; e.g., carrier, or vehicle. In a specific embodiment, therapeutic compositions containing an Adapter are administered subcutaneously.</p><p id="p-0612" num="0471">In some embodiments, the PANTIFOL composition is administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation, and in a therapeutically effective amount. The quantity to be administered depends on the subject to be treated, capacity of the subject's system to utilize the active ingredient, and degree of therapeutic effect desired. Precise amounts of active ingredient required to be administered depend on the judgment of the practitioner and are peculiar to each individual. However, suitable dosage ranges for systemic application are disclosed herein and depend on the route of administration. Suitable regimes for administration are also variable but are typified by an initial administration followed by repeated doses at one or more hour intervals by a subsequent injection or other administration. Alternatively, continuous intravenous infusion sufficient to maintain concentrations in the blood in the ranges specified for in vivo therapies are contemplated.</p><p id="p-0613" num="0472">The PANTIFOL composition are formulated, dosed, and administered in a fashion consistent with good medical practice. Factors for consideration in this context include the particular disorder being treated, the particular patient being treated, the clinical condition of the individual patient, the cause of the disorder, the site of delivery of the agent, the method of administration, the scheduling of administration, and other factors known to medical practitioners. The dosage ranges for the administration of PANTIFOL composition are those large enough to produce the desired effect in which the disease symptoms mediated by the target molecule are ameliorated. The dosage should not be so large as to cause adverse side effects, such as, hyperviscosity syndromes, pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, and other adverse side effects known in the art. Generally, the dosage will vary with the age, weight, height, body surface area, state of health (e.g., renal and liver function), condition, sex and extent of the disease in the patient and can routinely be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any complication.</p><p id="p-0614" num="0473">The dosage schedule and amounts effective for therapeutic and prophylactic uses, i.e., the &#x201c;dosing regimen,&#x201d; will depend upon a variety of factors, including the cause, stage and severity of the disease or disorder, the health, physical status, age of the subject being treated, and the site and mode of the delivery of the PANTIFOL composition. Therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of the PANTIFOL composition can be determined by standard pharmaceutical, pharmacological, and toxicological procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals. Data obtained from these procedures can likewise be used in formulating a range of dosages for human use. Moreover, therapeutic index (i.e., the dose therapeutically effective in 50 percent of the population divided by the dose lethal to 50 percent of the population (ED50/LD50)) can readily be determined using known procedures. The dosage is preferably within a range of concentrations that includes the ED50 with little or no toxicity, and may vary within this range depending on the dosage form employed, sensitivity of the patient, and the route of administration.</p><p id="p-0615" num="0474">The dosage regimen also takes into consideration pharmacokinetics parameters known in the art, such as, drug absorption rate, bioavailability, metabolism and clearance (see, e.g., Hidalgo-Aragones, J.

It is well within the state of the art for the clinician to determine the dosage regimen for each subject being treated. Moreover, single or multiple administrations of the PANTIFOL composition can be administered depending on the dosage and frequency as required and tolerated by the subject. The duration of prophylactic and therapeutic treatment will vary depending on the particular disease or condition being treated. Some diseases are amenable to acute treatment whereas others require long-term, chronic therapy. The PANTIFOL composition can be administered serially, or simultaneously with the additional therapeutic agent.</p><p id="p-0616" num="0475">In some embodiments, the PANTIFOL composition is administered in a liposomal composition at a dose of between 0.005 and 5000 mg of PANTIFOL per square meter of body surface area, or any range therein between.

Fmoc was removed with 20% piperidine in DMF for 3 minutes and a second time for 15 minutes. The washing steps are performed with NMP. The peptides were cleaved from the solid support using TFA (140 mL/mmol resin, containing 5% (v) milliQ-H<sub>2</sub>O for 2.5 hours. The peptide containing TFA solution was collected and the resin was washed with TFA. The TFA solution was concentrated under reduced pressure and precipitated using 40 mL ice cold dietheyl ether/n-pentane (1:1, v/v) per 7 mL TFA mixture. After centrifugation the peptide is washed on additional time with ice cold dietheyl ether/n-pentane (1:1, v/v) and centrifuged. Afterwards, the crude peptide was dissolved in 5 mL ACN/water 1:1 and lyophilized. This step was repeated three times to give the desired product. Peptides were analyzed by UPLC/ESI-MS (gradient: 5-55% B in 2 min, flow: 1 mL/min, eluent A: 100% H<sub>2</sub>O+0.05% TFA; eluent B: 100% ACN+0.05% TFA) and positive ion current for MS analysis. Then the peptide was coupled to the PEM-Acid in a standard amide coupling. The compounds were purified by Reverse-Phase preparative HPLC.</p><p id="p-0748" num="0602">Or more generally, an initial glutamyl residue can be bonded to a Wang resin (or other suitable resins or solid supports) and additional glutamyl residues are added serially via solid phase peptide synthesis using F-moc chemistry. After the final glutamyl residue is added the Antifolate precursor (e.g., pemetrexed precursor) is coupled to the peptide and the molecule is cleaved from the resin. Or more generally, the synthesis of pemetrexed polyglutamates can be conducted as following: Synthesis of the polyglutamate peptides was performed using standard solid phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc/tBu-based chemistry on a 2-chlorotrityl resin. Linkage of the PEM moiety (Z) was performed on the solid support by coupling the unprotected des-glutamyl pemetrexed building block via its benzoic acid to the free N-terminus of the peptide using a suitable coupling reagent to form the amide bond. Cleavage of the PEM peptide from the resin and concomitant removal of the various sidechain protecting groups was performed using a cocktail of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) with several scavengers. Subsequent workup involved precipitation from the cleavage cocktail followed by chromatographic purification using an appropriate buffer system tailored to the individual construct, yielding the PEM peptides with the requested purity and quantity. Lyophilization of the purified fractions provided the desired Pemetrexed polyglutamate peptides.</p><p id="p-0749" num="0603">Two pemetrexed gamma polyglutamate (in L form or D form) were synthesized on solid phase resin and compounds were fully characterized by LC-MS, NMR with a HPLC purity of 96% and 98%, exact mass: 1072.3621; Calculated (M+H): 1073.3699, Found (M+H): 1073.3687.</p><p id="p-0750" num="0604">Optical rotation in water at pH 10.8 for compound 100 [a]<sub>D </sub>10.5; Optical rotation in water at pH 10.8 for compound 110 [a]<sub>D</sub>&#x2212;9.2</p><p id="p-0751" num="0605">Similarly, compounds 200 and 210 can also be prepared by solid phase synthesis using a Symphony synthesizer as compounds 100 and compound 110.</p><p id="p-0752" num="0606">Two pemetrexed alpha polyglutamate (in L form or D form) were synthesized on solid phase resin and compounds were fully characterized by LC-MS, NMR with a HPLC purity of 96% to 98%, exact mass: 1072.3621; Calculated (M+H): 1073.3699, Found (M+H): 1073.3691.</p><p id="p-0753" num="0607">Optical rotation in water for compound 200 [a]<sub>D</sub>&#x2212;33.9; Optical rotation in water at for compound 210 [a]<sub>D</sub>+36.3.</p><heading id="h-0052" level="1">Example 7.
