For example, electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) include a class of vaporizer devices that are battery powered and that can be used to simulate the experience of smoking, but without burning of tobacco or other substances. Vaporizer devices are gaining increasing popularity both for prescriptive medical use, in delivering medicaments, and for consumption of tobacco, nicotine, and other plant-based materials. Vaporizer devices can be portable, self-contained, and/or convenient for use.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In use of a vaporizer device, the user inhales an aerosol, colloquially referred to as &#x201c;vapor,&#x201d; which can be generated by a heating element that vaporizes (e.g., causes a liquid or solid to at least partially transition to the gas phase) a vaporizable material, which can be liquid, a solution, a solid, a paste, a wax, and/or any other form compatible for use with a specific vaporizer device. The vaporizable material used with a vaporizer device can be provided within a cartridge for example, a separable part of the vaporizer device that contains vaporizable material) that includes an outlet (for example, a mouthpiece) for inhalation of the aerosol by a user.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To receive the inhalable aerosol generated by a vaporizer device, a user may, in certain examples, activate the vaporizer device by taking a puff, by pressing a button, and/or by some other approach. A puff as used herein can refer to inhalation by the user in a manner that causes a volume of air to be drawn into the vaporizer device such that the inhalable aerosol is generated by a combination of the vaporized vaporizable material with the volume of air.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An approach by which a vaporizer device generates an inhalable aerosol from a vaporizable material involves heating the vaporizable material in a vaporization chamber (e.g., a heater chamber) to cause the vaporizable material to be converted to the gas (or vapor) phase. A vaporization chamber can refer to an area or volume in the vaporizer device within which a heat source (for example, a conductive, convective, and/or radiative heat source) causes heating of a vaporizable material to produce a mixture of air and vaporized material to form a vapor for inhalation of the vaporizable material by a user of the vaporizer device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Vaporizer devices can be controlled by one or more controllers, electronic circuits (for example, sensors, heating elements), and/or the like on the vaporizer device. Vaporizer devices can also wirelessly communicate with an external controller for example, a computing device such as a smartphone).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some implementations, the vaporizable material can be drawn out of a reservoir and into the vaporization chamber via a wicking element (e.g., a wick). Drawing of the vaporizable material into the vaporization chamber can be at least partially due to capillary action provided by the wicking element as the wicking element pulls the vaporizable material along the wicking element in the direction of the vaporization chamber. However, as vaporizable material is drawn out of the reservoir, the pressure inside the reservoir is reduced, thereby creating a vacuum and acting against the capillary action. This can reduce the effectiveness of the wicking element to draw the vaporizable material into the vaporization chamber, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the vaporizer device to vaporize a desired amount of vaporizable material, such as when a user takes a puff on the vaporizer device. Furthermore, the vacuum created in the reservoir can ultimately result in the inability to draw all of the vaporizable material into the vaporization chamber, thereby wasting vaporizable material. As such, improved vaporizer devices and/or vaporization cartridges that improve upon or overcome these issues are desired.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Aspects of the current subject matter relate to vaporizer devices and to cartridges for use in a vaporizer device.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some variations, one or more of the following features may optionally be included in any feasible combination.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one exemplary embodiment, a cartridge is provided and includes a first storage chamber and a second storage chamber, a vaporization chamber that includes an elongate member that is in fluid communication with the first storage chamber and the second storage chamber, a magnetic element, and a conductive element in selective communication with the magnetic element.

Example implementations include vaporizer devices and systems including vaporizer devices. The term &#x201c;vaporizer device&#x201d; as used in the following description and claims refers to any of a self-contained apparatus, an apparatus that includes two or more separable parts (for example, a vaporizer body that includes a battery and other hardware, and a cartridge that includes a vaporizable material), and/or the like. A &#x201c;vaporizer system,&#x201d; as used herein, can include one or more components, such as a vaporizer device. Examples of vaporizer devices consistent with implementations of the current subject matter include electronic vaporizers, electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), and/or the like. In general, such vaporizer devices are hand-held devices that heat (such as by convection, conduction, radiation, and/or some combination thereof) a vaporizable material to provide an inhalable dose of the material.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The vaporizable material used with a vaporizer device can be provided within a cartridge (for example, a part of the vaporizer device that contains the vaporizable material in a reservoir or other container) which can be refillable when empty, or disposable such that a new cartridge containing additional vaporizable material of a same or different type can be used). A vaporizer device can be a cartridge-using vaporizer device, a cartridge-less vaporizer device, or a multi-use vaporizer device capable of use with or without a cartridge. For example, a vaporizer device can include a heating chamber (for example, an oven or other region in which material is heated by a heating element) configured to receive a vaporizable material directly into the heating chamber, and/or a reservoir or the like for containing the vaporizable material.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some implementations, a vaporizer device can be configured for use with a liquid vaporizable material (for example, a carrier solution in which an active and/or inactive ingredient(s) are suspended or held in solution, or a liquid form of the vaporizable material itself). The liquid vaporizable material can be capable of being completely vaporized. Alternatively, at least a portion of the liquid vaporizable material can remain after all of the material suitable for inhalation has been vaporized.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to the block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a vaporizer device <b>100</b> can include a power source <b>112</b> (for example, a battery, which can be a rechargeable battery), and a controller <b>104</b> (for example, a processor, circuitry, etc. capable of executing logic) for controlling delivery of heat to an atomizer <b>141</b> to cause a vaporizable material <b>102</b> to be converted from a condensed form (such as a liquid, a solution, a suspension, a part of an at least partially unprocessed plant material, etc.) to the gas phase. The controller <b>104</b> can be part of one or more printed circuit boards (PCBs) consistent with certain implementations of the current subject matter.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">After conversion of the vaporizable material <b>102</b> to the gas phase, at least some of the vaporizable material <b>102</b> in the gas phase can condense to form particulate matter in at least a partial local equilibrium with the gas phase as part of an aerosol, which can form some or all of an inhalable dose provided by the vaporizer device <b>100</b> during a user's puff or draw on the vaporizer device <b>100</b>. It should be appreciated that the interplay between gas and condensed phases in an aerosol generated by a vaporizer device <b>100</b> can be complex and dynamic, due to factors such as ambient temperature, relative humidity, chemistry, flow conditions in airflow paths (both inside the vaporizer device and in the airways of a human or other animal), and/or mixing of the vaporizable material <b>102</b> in the gas phase or in the aerosol phase with other air streams, which can affect one or more physical parameters of an aerosol. In some vaporizer devices, and particularly for vaporizer devices configured for delivery of volatile vaporizable materials, the inhalable dose can exist predominantly in the gas phase (for example, formation of condensed phase particles can be very limited).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The atomizer <b>141</b> in the vaporizer device <b>100</b> can be configured to vaporize a vaporizable material <b>102</b>. The vaporizable material <b>102</b> can be a liquid. Examples of the vaporizable material <b>102</b> include neat liquids, suspensions, solutions, mixtures, and/or the like. The atomizer <b>141</b> can include a wicking element (i.e., a wick) configured to convey an amount of the vaporizable material <b>102</b> to a part of the atomizer <b>141</b> that includes a heating element (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, the wicking element can be configured to draw the vaporizable material <b>102</b> from a reservoir <b>140</b> configured to contain the vaporizable material <b>102</b>, such that the vaporizable material <b>102</b> can be vaporized by heat delivered from a heating element. The wicking element can also optionally allow air to enter the reservoir <b>140</b> and replace the volume of vaporizable material <b>102</b> removed. In some implementations of the current subject matter, capillary action can pull vaporizable material <b>102</b> into the wick for vaporization by the heating element, and air can return to the reservoir <b>140</b> through the wick to at least partially equalize pressure in the reservoir <b>140</b>. Other methods of allowing air back into the reservoir <b>140</b> to equalize pressure are also within the scope of the current subject matter.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;wick&#x201d; or &#x201c;wicking element&#x201d; include any material capable of causing fluid motion via capillary pressure.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The heating element can include one or more of a conductive heater, a radiative heater, and/or a convective heater. One type of heating element is a resistive heating element, which can include a material (such as a metal or alloy, for example a nickel-chromium alloy, or a non-metallic resistor) configured to dissipate electrical power in the form of heat when electrical current is passed through one or more resistive segments of the heating element. In some implementations of the current subject matter, the atomizer <b>141</b> can include a heating element which includes a resistive coil or other heating element wrapped around, positioned within, integrated into a bulk shape of, pressed into thermal contact with, or otherwise arranged to deliver heat to a wicking element, to cause the vaporizable material <b>102</b> drawn from the reservoir <b>140</b> by the wicking element to be vaporized for subsequent inhalation by a user in a gas and/or a condensed (for example, aerosol particles or droplets) phase. Other wicking elements, heating elements, and/or atomizer assembly configurations are also possible.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The heating element can be activated in association with a user puffing (i.e., drawing, inhaling, etc.) on a mouthpiece <b>130</b> of the vaporizer device <b>100</b> to cause air to flow from an air inlet, along an airflow path that passes the atomizer <b>141</b> (i.e., wicking element and heating element). Optionally, air can flow from an air inlet through one or more condensation areas or chambers, to an air outlet in the mouthpiece <b>130</b>. Incoming air moving along the airflow path moves over or through the atomizer <b>141</b>, where vaporizable material <b>102</b> in the gas phase is entrained into the air. The heating element can be activated via the controller <b>104</b>, which can optionally be a part of a vaporizer body <b>110</b> as discussed herein, causing current to pass from the power source <b>112</b> through a circuit including the resistive heating element, which is optionally part of a vaporizer cartridge <b>120</b> as discussed herein. As noted herein, the entrained vaporizable material <b>102</b> in the gas phase can condense as it passes through the remainder of the airflow path such that an inhalable dose of the vaporizable material <b>102</b> in an aerosol form can be delivered from the air outlet (for example, the mouthpiece <b>130</b>) for inhalation by a user.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Activation of the heating element can be caused by automatic detection of a puff based on one or more signals generated by one or more of a sensor <b>113</b>. The sensor <b>113</b> and the signals generated by the sensor <b>113</b> can include one or more of: a pressure sensor or sensors disposed to detect pressure along the airflow path relative to ambient pressure (or optionally to measure changes in absolute pressure), a motion sensor or sensors (for example, an accelerometer) of the vaporizer device <b>100</b>, a flow sensor or sensors of the vaporizer device <b>100</b>, a capacitive lip sensor of the vaporizer device <b>100</b>, detection of interaction of a user with the vaporizer device <b>100</b> via one or more input devices <b>116</b> (for example, buttons or other tactile control devices of the vaporizer device <b>100</b>), receipt of signals from a computing device in communication with the vaporizer device <b>100</b>, and/or via other approaches for determining that a puff is occurring or imminent.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As discussed herein, the vaporizer device <b>100</b> consistent with implementations of the current subject matter can be configured to connect (such as, for example, wirelessly or via a wired connection) to a computing device (or optionally two or more devices) in communication with the vaporizer device <b>100</b>. To this end, the controller <b>104</b> can include communication hardware <b>105</b>. The controller <b>104</b> can also include a memory <b>108</b>. The communication hardware <b>105</b> can include firmware and/or can be controlled by software for executing one or more cryptographic protocols for the communication.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A computing device can be a component of a vaporizer system that also includes the vaporizer device <b>100</b>, and can include its own hardware for communication, which can establish a wireless communication channel with the communication hardware <b>105</b> of the vaporizer device <b>100</b>. For example, a computing device used as part of a vaporizer system can include a general-purpose computing device (such as a smartphone, a tablet, a personal computer, some other portable device such as a smartwatch, or the like) that executes software to produce a user interface for enabling a user to interact with the vaporizer device <b>100</b>. In other implementations of the current subject matter, such a device used as part of a vaporizer system can be a dedicated piece of hardware such as a remote control or other wireless or wired device having one or more physical or soft (i.e., configurable on a screen or other display device and selectable via user interaction with a touch-sensitive screen or some other input device like a mouse, pointer, trackball, cursor buttons, or the like) interface controls. The vaporizer device <b>100</b> can also include one or more outputs <b>117</b> or devices for providing information to the user. For example, the outputs <b>117</b> can include one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs) configured to provide feedback to a user based on a status and/or mode of operation of the vaporizer device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the example in which a computing device provides signals related to activation of the resistive heating element, or in other examples of coupling of a computing device with the vaporizer device <b>100</b> for implementation of various control or other functions, the computing device executes one or more computer instruction sets to provide a user interface and underlying data handling. In one example, detection by the computing device of user interaction with one or more user interface elements can cause the computing device to signal the vaporizer device <b>100</b> to activate the heating element to reach an operating temperature for creation of an inhalable dose of vapor/aerosol. Other functions of the vaporizer device <b>100</b> can be controlled by interaction of a user with a user interface on a computing device in communication with the vaporizer device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The temperature of a resistive heating element of the vaporizer device <b>100</b> can depend on a number of factors, including an amount of electrical power delivered to the resistive heating element and/or a duty cycle at which the electrical power is delivered, conductive heat transfer to other parts of the electronic vaporizer device <b>100</b> and/or to the environment, latent heat losses due to vaporization of the vaporizable material <b>102</b> from the wicking element and/or the atomizer <b>141</b> as a whole, and convective heat losses due to airflow (i.e., air moving across the heating element or the atomizer <b>141</b> as a whole when a user inhales on the vaporizer device <b>100</b>). As noted herein, to reliably activate the heating element or heat the heating element to a desired temperature, the vaporizer device <b>100</b> may, in some implementations of the current subject matter, make use of signals from the sensor <b>113</b> (for example, a pressure sensor) to determine when a user is inhaling. The sensor <b>113</b> can be positioned in the airflow path and/or can be connected (for example, by a passageway or other path) to an airflow path containing an inlet for air to enter the vaporizer device <b>100</b> and an outlet via which the user inhales the resulting vapor and/or aerosol such that the sensor <b>113</b> experiences changes (for example, pressure changes) concurrently with air passing through the vaporizer device <b>100</b> from the air inlet to the air outlet. In some implementations of the current subject matter, the heating element can be activated in association with a user's puff, for example by automatic detection of the puff, or by the sensor <b>113</b> detecting a change (such as a pressure change) in the airflow path.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The sensor <b>113</b> can be positioned on or coupled to (i.e., electrically or electronically connected, either physically or via a wireless connection) the controller <b>104</b> (for example, a printed circuit board assembly or other type of circuit board). To take measurements accurately and maintain durability of the vaporizer device <b>100</b>, it can be beneficial to provide a seal <b>127</b> resilient enough to separate an airflow path from other parts of the vaporizer device <b>100</b>. The seal <b>127</b>, which can be a gasket, can be configured to at least partially surround the sensor <b>113</b> such that connections of the sensor <b>113</b> to the internal circuitry of the vaporizer device <b>100</b> are separated from a part of the sensor <b>113</b> exposed to the airflow path. In an example of a cartridge-based vaporizer device, the seal <b>127</b> can also separate parts of one or more electrical connections between the vaporizer body <b>110</b> and the vaporizer cartridge <b>120</b>. Such arrangements of the seal <b>127</b> in the vaporizer device <b>100</b> can be helpful in mitigating against potentially disruptive impacts on vaporizer components resulting from interactions with environmental factors such as water in the vapor or liquid phases, other fluids such as the vaporizable material <b>102</b>, etc., and/or to reduce the escape of air from the designated airflow path in the vaporizer device <b>100</b>. Unwanted air, liquid or other fluid passing and/or contacting circuitry of the vaporizer device <b>100</b> can cause various unwanted effects, such as altered pressure readings, and/or can result in the buildup of unwanted material, such as moisture, excess vaporizable material <b>102</b>, etc., in parts of the vaporizer device <b>100</b> where they can result in poor pressure signal, degradation of the sensor <b>113</b> or other components, and/or a shorter life of the vaporizer device <b>100</b>. Leaks in the seal <b>127</b> can also result in a user inhaling air that has passed over parts of the vaporizer device <b>100</b> containing, or constructed of, materials that may not be desirable to be inhaled.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some implementations, the vaporizer body <b>110</b> includes the controller <b>104</b>, the power source <b>112</b> (for example, a battery), one more of the sensor <b>113</b>, charging contacts (such as those for charging the power source <b>112</b>), the seal <b>127</b>, and a cartridge receptacle <b>118</b> configured to receive the vaporizer cartridge <b>120</b> for coupling with the vaporizer body <b>110</b> through one or more of a variety of attachment structures. In some examples, the vaporizer cartridge <b>120</b> includes the reservoir <b>140</b> for containing the vaporizable material <b>102</b>, and the mouthpiece <b>130</b> has an aerosol outlet for delivering an inhalable dose to a user.

This withdrawing of the vaporizable material from the reservoir housing can be due, at least in part, to capillary action provided by the wick, which pulls the vaporizable material along the wick in the direction towards a vaporization chamber. As a result, the vaporizable material is fed into the wicking element by capillary action. However, the magnitude of capillary action can be at least partially contingent upon the wicking material itself (e.g., the type of wicking material, the dimensions of the wicking material (e.g., length), the absorption rate of the wicking material) and on the amount of vaporizable material contained within reservoir housing to replenish the wicking element.

As discussed in more detail below, the vaporizable material that flows into the elongate member <b>212</b> is vaporized to form a vaporized material (e.g., an aerosol) by the heat produced by the conductive element <b>228</b> in response to either the first electric current and the second electric current.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Each end of the elongate member <b>212</b> includes an inlet that is configured to allow the vaporizable material <b>206</b> to flow into the channel <b>214</b>, and thus, the elongate member <b>212</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, the first end <b>212</b><i>a </i>includes a first inlet <b>216</b> and the second end <b>212</b><i>b </i>includes a second inlet <b>218</b> that allow the vaporizable material to flow into the channel <b>214</b> and, thus, into the elongate member <b>212</b> from the first storage chamber <b>202</b> and the second storage chamber <b>204</b>, respectively, for vaporization into a vaporized material.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The first and second inlets <b>216</b>, <b>218</b> can have a variety of shapes and/or sizes. For purposes of simplicity, only the first inlet <b>216</b> will be discussed herein with respect to size. However, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that the following discussion is equally applicable to the second inlet <b>218</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, the first inlet <b>216</b> can have a diameter that is sized to substantially prevent the passage of the first fraction of the vaporizable material <b>206</b> therethrough, when an internal pressure of the first storage chamber <b>202</b> is substantially equal to ambient pressure outside of the first storage chamber <b>202</b>. That is, the first inlet <b>216</b> can include a diameter that is sized such that a surface tension of the first fraction of the vaporizable material <b>206</b> is created to thereby substantially prevent such vaporizable material from passing through, and thus, out of the first storage chamber <b>202</b>, when the pressure is equalized across the first inlet <b>216</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Further, in some embodiments, one or more inlet valves can be positioned at the first end <b>212</b><i>a </i>and/or the second end <b>212</b><i>b </i>of the elongate member <b>212</b>. The one or more inlet valves can be configured to substantially prevent the vaporizable material within the channel <b>214</b> of the elongate member <b>212</b> from flowing back into one of the storage chambers through one of the inlets of the elongate member <b>212</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, a first inlet valve <b>220</b> is positioned at the first end <b>212</b><i>a </i>of the elongate member <b>212</b> to substantially prevent a portion of the first fraction of the vaporizable material <b>206</b> in the elongate member <b>212</b> from flowing back into the first storage chamber <b>202</b>. As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, a second inlet valve <b>222</b> is positioned at the second end <b>212</b><i>b </i>of the elongate member <b>212</b> to substantially prevent a portion of the second fraction of the vaporizable material <b>208</b> in the elongate member <b>212</b> from flowing back into the second storage chamber <b>204</b>. As such, the first inlet valve <b>220</b> and the second inlet valve <b>222</b> can each substantially function as a one-way valve that are configured to substantially allow an influx of vaporizable material into the elongate member <b>212</b> while also being configured to substantially inhibit backflow of the vaporizable material out of the elongate member <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">As discussed above, a magnetic element <b>224</b> is disposed within the channel <b>214</b> of the elongate member <b>212</b>. The magnetic element <b>224</b> is configured to selectively oscillate between a first position (e.g., as shown in <b>2</b>A), and a second position (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). This oscillation between the first position and the second position can cause the vaporizable material <b>206</b> to flow alternately from the first storage chamber <b>202</b> and from the second storage chamber <b>204</b>. For example, when in the first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), the magnetic element <b>224</b> is configured to substantially prevent the first fraction of the vaporizable material <b>206</b> from flowing into the elongate member <b>212</b>, and when in the second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), the magnetic element <b>224</b> is configured to substantially prevent the second fraction of the vaporizable material <b>208</b> from flowing into the elongate member <b>212</b>. As such, the oscillation of the magnetic element <b>224</b> substantially controls the delivery of the vaporizable material into the elongate member <b>212</b>. Further, the magnetic element <b>224</b> in combination with the size of the inlets of the elongate member <b>212</b> can also control the flow rate of the vaporizable material into the elongate member <b>212</b>. As a result, a consistent delivery rate of the vaporizable material can be delivered to the vaporization chamber <b>210</b> for vaporization.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The magnetic element <b>224</b> can have a variety of configurations and sizes. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, the magnetic element <b>224</b> is substantially rectangular. Further, the magnetic element <b>224</b> can be formed of any suitable material that can be magnetized, e.g., iron, nickel, cobalt, and the like. In one embodiment, the magnetic element <b>224</b> is a permanent magnet.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">As discussed above, in use, the magnetic element <b>224</b> moves from the first position to the second position in response to the first motive force and from the second position back to the first position in response to the second motive force. The first motive force and the second motive force are generated by the conductive element <b>228</b> in response to the conductive element <b>228</b> receiving a first electric current and a second electric current, respectively.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The conductive element <b>228</b> can have a variety of configurations that substantially allow the conductive element <b>228</b> to be in selective communication with the magnetic element <b>224</b> so as to effect oscillation of the magnetic element <b>224</b> in response to the first and second motive forces. For example, the conductive element <b>228</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, is a conductive coil that is substantially wound about the elongate member <b>212</b>. The conductive element <b>228</b> can be formed from any suitable electrically and thermally conductive material, such as iron, carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, copper, brass, bronze, electrically conductive ceramic and polymer composites, or other materials capable of being inductively heated.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The conductive element <b>228</b> is connected to a power source, such as the power source <b>112</b> within vaporizer body <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref>. The power source, when prompted (e.g., when a user puffs on a mouthpiece, such as mouthpiece <b>232</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>), supplies alternating currents (e.g., the first electric current and the second electric current having a reverse or opposite polarity of the first electric current) to the conductive element <b>228</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the vaporizer cartridge <b>200</b> includes two or more cartridge contacts such as, for example, a first cartridge contact <b>234</b><i>a </i>and a second cartridge contact <b>234</b><i>b</i>. The two or more cartridge contacts can be configured to couple, for example, with the receptacle contacts <b>125</b><i>a </i>and <b>125</b><i>b </i>in order to form one or more electrical connections with the power source <b>112</b>. The circuit completed by these electrical connections can allow delivery of electrical currents to the conductive element <b>228</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In response to the application of alternating currents, the conductive element <b>228</b> produces alternating magnetic fields. As such, these alternating magnetic fields act on the magnetic element <b>224</b> causing the magnetic element <b>224</b> to oscillate from the first position to the second position or vice versa in response to the applied current. That is, in use, when the conductive element <b>228</b> receives the first current, which has a first polarity, the conductive element <b>228</b> generates a first magnetic field that provides the first motive force to drive the magnetic element <b>224</b> from the first position to the second position, and when the conductive element <b>228</b> receives the second current, which has a second polarity that is opposite the first polarity, the conductive element <b>228</b> generates a second magnetic field that provides the second motive force to drive the magnetic element <b>224</b> from the second position to the first position Thus, the alternating currents applied to the conductive element <b>228</b> allow the conductive element <b>228</b> to produce alternating magnetic fields that drive the magnetic element <b>224</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Further, the alternating magnetic fields generated by the conductive element <b>228</b> pass through the elongate member <b>212</b> causing eddy currents. These eddy currents heat the elongate member <b>212</b> to a temperature that is at least substantially equal to the vaporization temperature of the vaporizable material. As a result, the portion of the vaporizable material (e.g., a portion of the first fraction of the vaporizable material <b>206</b> or of the second fraction of the vaporizable material <b>208</b>) that flows into the elongate member <b>212</b> is then vaporized to form a vaporized material (e.g., aerosol). This vaporized material can then combine with, and be carried out of the vaporization chamber <b>210</b>, by the air <b>230</b> passing through an airflow passageway, such as the airflow passageway <b>229</b>, of the vaporization chamber <b>210</b>. As such, the conductive element <b>228</b> can be configured to substantially produce the motive forces to drive the magnetic element <b>224</b> to allow flow of the vaporizable material into the elongate member <b>212</b> and to substantially vaporize the vaporizable material within the elongate member <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The first and/or second electric current applied to, and received by, the conductive material <b>228</b> can be adjusted, for example, by the provision of an adjustment mechanism, such as a pulse width modulator, a variable resistor, or the like in an electrical circuit connecting the power source and the conductive element <b>228</b>. Alternatively, or additionally, the adjustment mechanism includes a simple on/off switch in the circuit.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Further, the speed at which the magnetic element <b>224</b> oscillates can be adjusted by adjusting the frequency of the alternating currents. In some embodiments, a direct current can be applied to the conductive element <b>228</b> to offset the alternating currents so as to disassociate the heating of the elongate member <b>212</b>, and thus, the vaporization of the vaporizable material therein, from the oscillation of the magnetic element <b>224</b>. That is, the application of direct current could stop the oscillation of the magnetic element <b>224</b> while heating the elongate member <b>212</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">While the vaporization chamber <b>210</b> can have a variety of configurations, the vaporization chamber <b>210</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, is defined by two opposing sidewalls <b>210</b><i>a</i>, <b>210</b><i>b </i>and a bottom wall <b>210</b><i>c </i>extending therebetween. The first sidewall <b>210</b><i>a </i>of the vaporization chamber <b>210</b> is also one of the sidewalls <b>202</b><i>c </i>of the first storage chamber <b>202</b>, and the second sidewall <b>210</b><i>b </i>of the vaporization chamber <b>210</b> is also one of the sidewalls <b>202</b><i>c </i>of the second storage chamber <b>204</b>. As such, in this illustrated embodiment, the vaporization chamber <b>210</b> is at least partially bounded by the first and second storage chambers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>. As shown, the vaporization chamber <b>210</b> defines an airflow passageway <b>229</b> that extends therethrough.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The airflow passageway <b>220</b> is configured to direct air, illustrated as dash-lined arrow <b>230</b>, through the vaporization chamber <b>210</b> so that the air <b>230</b> will mix with the vaporized material to form an aerosol, illustrated as dash-lined arrow <b>231</b>. The airflow passageway <b>229</b> further directs the aerosol <b>231</b> through an outlet <b>211</b> of the vaporization chamber <b>210</b>, and thus a mouthpiece <b>232</b> coupled to the vaporizer cartridge <b>200</b>, for inhalation by a user. While a mouthpiece <b>232</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, a person skilled in the art will appreciate that in other embodiments, the mouthpiece <b>232</b> can be omitted and the user can directly puff on the cartridge <b>200</b> at an outlet (such as outlet <b>211</b> of vaporization chamber <b>210</b>).</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, at least one wall of the vaporization chamber <b>210</b>, such as sidewall <b>210</b><i>a </i>and/or sidewall <b>210</b><i>b</i>, can be formed of, or coated with, a hydrophobic material so as to prevent any condensation from accumulating within the vaporization chamber <b>210</b>. As such, any water that may be present in the aerosol <b>231</b> and in the air <b>230</b> can be carried through and out of the vaporization chamber <b>210</b> as the user puffs on the mouthpiece <b>232</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The air <b>230</b> enters the vaporization chamber <b>210</b> through the bottom wall <b>210</b><i>c </i>as a user puffs the mouthpiece <b>232</b>. As such, the bottom wall <b>210</b><i>c </i>is configured to allow air <b>230</b> to readily pass therethrough and into the vaporization chamber <b>210</b>. While the bottom wall <b>210</b><i>c </i>can have a variety of configurations, the bottom wall <b>210</b><i>c </i>is perforated, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>. The perforations can be of any suitable size that allows air to pass through the bottom wall <b>210</b><i>c</i>. In certain embodiments, the size of the perforations can substantially prevent any vaporizable material dispensed from the first or second storage chambers <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> or aerosol <b>231</b> to pass through the bottom wall <b>210</b><i>c</i>, and therefore inhibit undesirable leakage into other portions of a vaporizer body, such as vaporizer body <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref>, coupled to the vaporizer cartridge <b>200</b>. The bottom wall <b>210</b><i>c </i>can include any suitable number of perforations, and therefore the number of perforations is not limited by what is illustrated in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>. Alternatively or in addition, the bottom wall <b>210</b><i>c </i>can be formed of an air permeable material. Thus, the bottom wall <b>210</b><i>c </i>functions as an air inlet for the vaporization chamber <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The bottom wall <b>210</b><i>c </i>can also be configured to prevent air <b>230</b> and/or aerosol <b>231</b> within the vaporization chamber <b>210</b> from passing therethrough. That is, the bottom wall <b>210</b><i>c </i>can be configured as a one-way valve, and therefore only allow air <b>230</b> to pass through and into the vaporization chamber <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, any of the remaining walls of the vaporization chamber <b>210</b> can be perforated and/or formed of an air permeable material to allow air to pass into (or out of) the vaporization chamber <b>210</b> as desired.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Terminology</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0086">For purposes of describing and defining the present teachings, it is noted that unless indicated otherwise, the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; is utilized herein to represent the inherent degree of uncertainty that may be attributed to any quantitative comparison, value, measurement, or other representation.
