particularly to a power supply apparatus with operations of a grid connection mode, a standalone mode, and a black start mode without using a battery energy storage device in a system.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The statements in this section merely provide background information related to the present disclosure and do not necessarily constitute prior art.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the development of the economy, users' requirements for uninterrupted power supply and power supply quality are also increasing. Traditional centralized power supply is not easy to build large-scale power plants and power transmission and distribution systems, which makes be difficult to implement plans to enhance the reliability of the power system. In addition, earthquakes, typhoons, and other natural disasters caused continuous power outages.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, due to the development of new power generation technologies and the changes in the competition mechanism of the electricity industry, power generation equipment has developed diversified and is no longer limited to the development of large-scale centralized power generation. Therefore, decentralized power generation systems have begun to receive great attention.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are many types of power sources in distributed power generation systems. Besides solar, wind and other renewable energy power generation, diesel engine generators, micro-turbine generators, etc. can be applied to this system. In particular, the micro-turbine generator is a technology suitable for decentralized power generation systems and micro-grids due to its small size, low pollution, easy installation, operation and maintenance, and development potential.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">When using a micro-turbine generator in a distributed power generation system, there are two operation modes: a grid connection mode and a standalone mode, depending on whether it is connected with the power system. In addition, in consideration of the operation of the system, the start (activation) function of each operation mode is also required.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, which shows a block diagram of a related-art turbine generator system. The turbine generator system includes a micro turbine <b>101</b>, a generator <b>102</b>, a DC-AC converter <b>103</b> of driving the generator, AC-DC converters <b>1051</b>,<b>1052</b> of active front-end conversion, a DC-DC converter <b>111</b> of battery conversion, a battery set (pack) <b>112</b>, and a system controller <b>110</b>. The system can achieve the grid connection mode (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and the standalone mode (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) through the connection/disconnection of contact switches <b>1061</b>,<b>1062</b>,<b>1063</b> on the output circuit. In addition, when the system occurs failure under the grid connection mode, the system controller <b>110</b> will first stop the micro-turbine generator in operation, switch the contact switches of the output circuit, and then restart the micro-turbine generator to make it operate in the standalone mode.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, when the micro-turbine generator system operates in the grid connection mode, all the contact switches <b>1061</b>,<b>1062</b>,<b>1063</b> are in the turned-on state. In this condition, the micro-turbine generator system refers to the voltage and frequency of a mains <b>107</b>, and its operation is similar to a current source, and the power electricity generated from the micro-turbine generator set is fed to the mains to supply power to a general load <b>108</b> and a critical load <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, when the micro-turbine generator system operates in the standalone mode, since it does not need to be connected with the mains <b>107</b>, the contact switch <b>1061</b> at the mains side is in the turned-off state, as shown by dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In this condition, the micro-turbine generator system forms an independent operation system controlled by a voltage source, and supplies the generated power electricity to the general load <b>108</b> and the critical load <b>109</b>. However, when the standalone mode is activated (started), since there are no mains as an external power source for starting the generator set, the battery pack <b>112</b> and the DC-DC converter <b>111</b> (also referred to as a battery converter) are installed on the DC bus <b>104</b> as a backup power source for activating (starting) the standalone mode. The additional battery pack <b>112</b> and the battery converter <b>111</b> can also provide electrical energy buffering when the energy supply and demand between the electrical load and the turbine generator is unbalanced. For example, when the electrical load sharply rises, the electrical load is first supplied by the battery pack <b>112</b> through the battery converter <b>111</b>, and then the power generation of the turbine generator is increased to balance the electrical load demand and replenish energy to the battery pack <b>112</b>. Therefore, it can avoid the risk of generator system failure due to excessive power extraction from the turbine generator in a short period of time, resulting in excessive reduction of the generator speed.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In summary, in the micro-turbine generator system described above, the use of battery energy storage device composed of the battery pack <b>112</b> and the battery converter <b>111</b> will result in a substantial increase in the cost of system construction, and the maintenance cost of battery energy storage device is relatively expensive. On the contrary, if the battery energy storage device is not used, there will be no backup power supply in the micro-turbine generator system for use when starting in standalone mode.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, under the absence of the battery energy storage device, when the system faces sudden changes in the electrical load, since there is no battery pack to provide an electrical energy buffer for unbalance energy supply and demand between electrical load and micro-turbine generator, the micro-turbine generator will face the risk that the instantaneous speed change is too large and the turbo generator system will fail.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a power supply apparatus to solve the problems of existing technology.

It will be understood that the drawing figures and exemplified embodiments of present disclosure are not limited to the details thereof.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In response to the above technical problems, the present disclosure provides a micro-turbine generator system without using a battery energy storage device built (connected) on a DC bus in the system. The turbine generator system includes a micro turbine, a generator, a DC-AC converter of driving the generator, an AC-DC converter of active front-end conversion, an uninterruptible power system (UPS), an AC-side output configuration circuit, a capacitor bank, and a system controller. In order to ensure that the micro-turbine generator system has the starting function of the standalone mode, the present disclosure uses an uninterrupted power system, combined with the switching of the contact switches of the AC-side output circuit so as to complete the black start operation of the standalone mode.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition, when the system of the present disclosure faces sudden changes in the electrical load, the electrical energy buffer function of the unbalanced energy supply and demand between the electrical load and the micro-turbine generator will be provided by the capacitor bank so that it is possible to avoid the generator system failure due to excessive changes in the rotation speed of the turbine generator.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Due to the absence of the battery energy storage device, the uninterruptible power system and capacitor bank with mature technology, low cost and easy maintenance are used instead as the backup power supply when the system is started in the standalone mode and the electrical energy buffer device when the electrical load changes. Therefore, the micro-turbine generator system of the present disclosure has the characteristics of low cost and easy maintenance, and ensures that it has functions such as a grid connection mode, a standalone mode, and a black start mode.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, which shows a block diagram of a power supply apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present disclosure. The power supply apparatus is coupled to an AC power source V<sub>AC</sub>, a critical load L<sub>1</sub>, and a general load L<sub>2</sub>. The AC power source V<sub>AC </sub>may be a single-phase or three-phase AC power source. In particular, the critical load L<sub>1 </sub>is usually an important load for system priority, emergency, or uninterrupted power supply. Compared with the critical load L<sub>1</sub>, the general load L<sub>2 </sub>is a less important load.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The power supply apparatus includes an uninterruptible power system (UPS) <b>10</b>, a generator system <b>20</b>, a power conversion system <b>30</b>, and a controller <b>50</b>. The uninterruptible power system <b>10</b> is a device used to continuously provide backup AC power to the load when the AC power source V<sub>AC </sub>is abnormal (such as power failure, under voltage, over voltage, etc.) so as to maintain the normal operation of the load. The uninterruptible power system <b>10</b> includes an input side S<sub>I </sub>and an output side S<sub>O</sub>. The input side S<sub>I </sub>is connected to the AC power source V<sub>AC </sub>and the general load L<sub>2</sub>, and the output side S<sub>O </sub>is connected to the critical load L<sub>1</sub>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The generator system <b>20</b> includes a DC bus B<sub>DC</sub>. The power conversion system <b>20</b> includes a first power conversion path <b>31</b> and a second power conversion path <b>32</b>.

A first end <b>321</b> of the second power conversion path <b>32</b> is connected to the general load L<sub>2 </sub>and the input side S<sub>I</sub>, and a second end <b>312</b> of the first power conversion path <b>31</b> and a second end <b>322</b> of the second power conversion path <b>32</b> are jointly connected to the DC bus B<sub>DC</sub>.

Therefore, the uninterruptible power system <b>10</b> builds an ignition voltage on the DC bus B<sub>DC </sub>through the first power conversion path <b>31</b> to activate the generator system <b>20</b>. Moreover, when the controller <b>50</b> determines that the AC power source V<sub>AC </sub>is abnormal and before the first power conversion path <b>31</b> is enabled, the controller <b>50</b> controls to stop the operation of the generator system <b>20</b> so as to prevent the built ignition voltage from causing damage to the generator system <b>20</b> in operation.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">After the generator system <b>20</b> is activated by the ignition voltage, the controller <b>50</b> disables the first power conversion path <b>31</b>, and the generator system <b>20</b> builds a working voltage on the DC bus B<sub>DC</sub>.

In this condition, since it is no longer necessary to activate the generator system <b>20</b> by the uninterruptible power system <b>10</b> through the first power conversion path <b>31</b>, the first power conversion path <b>31</b> may be disabled and the working voltage can be built on the DC bus B<sub>DC </sub>after the generator system <b>20</b> operates.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">After the working voltage is built on the DC bus B<sub>DC</sub>, the controller <b>50</b> enables the second power conversion path <b>32</b>.

That is, since the generator system <b>20</b> is sufficient for power generation (is capable of generating power electricity), the generator system <b>20</b> supplies power to the general load L<sub>2 </sub>through the second power conversion path <b>32</b>, and supplies power to the critical load L<sub>1 </sub>through the second power conversion path <b>32</b> and the uninterruptible power system <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the power conversion system <b>20</b> supplies power to the critical load L<sub>1 </sub>through the second power conversion path <b>32</b> and the uninterruptible power system <b>10</b>, the controller <b>50</b> controls the uninterruptible power system <b>10</b> operating in a standby mode, and the generator system <b>10</b> charges at least one battery of the uninterruptible power system <b>10</b>. That is, when the generator system <b>20</b> is sufficient to supply power to the critical load L<sub>1</sub>, the critical load L<sub>1 </sub>may not need to be powered by the uninterrupted power system <b>10</b>. In this condition, therefore, the uninterrupted power system <b>10</b> may enter the standby mode (operate in the standby mode), and at least one of the uninterrupted power system <b>10</b> is charged so that the uninterrupted power system <b>10</b> can uninterruptedly and normally provide power electricity when needed.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">When the controller <b>50</b> determines that the AC power source V<sub>AC </sub>is restored, the controller <b>50</b> suspends the operation of the power supply apparatus.

After the operation of the grid connection mode, the controller <b>50</b> restores the operation of the power supply apparatus so that the AC power source V<sub>AC </sub>and the generator system <b>200</b> supply power to the critical load L<sub>1 </sub>and the general load L<sub>2 </sub>since the uninterrupted power system <b>10</b> still operates in the standby mode (since the AC power source V<sub>AC </sub>has restored to normal). In other words, either the AC power source V<sub>AC </sub>or the generator system <b>20</b> can supply power to the critical load L<sub>1 </sub>and the general load L<sub>2</sub>.

In this condition, the micro-turbine generator system refers to the voltage and frequency of a mains <b>107</b>, and its operation is similar to a current source, and the power electricity generated from the micro-turbine generator set is fed to the mains to supply power to a general load <b>108</b> and a critical load <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, when the micro-turbine generator system operates in a standalone mode, since it does not need to be connected with the mains <b>107</b> (without grid connection), the contact switch <b>4021</b> is turned off (shown by dotted lines), the contact switch <b>4022</b> is turned off (shown by dotted lines), and the contact switch <b>4023</b> is turned on.

In this circuit configuration, since the input-side power of the uninterruptible power system <b>401</b> is lost, the uninterrupted power system <b>401</b> will automatically operate in an emergency power backup mode to supply power to the critical load <b>109</b>. In this condition, the AC-DC converter <b>404</b> of active front-end conversion starts operating, and a voltage (referred to as a DC bus voltage or an ignition voltage) on a DC bus <b>104</b> is built by the power electricity generated from the uninterrupted power system <b>401</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Step 2.

The turbine generator system includes a micro turbine <b>101</b>, a generator <b>102</b>, a DC-AC converter <b>103</b> of driving the generator, an AC-DC converter <b>904</b> of active front-end conversion, an uninterruptible power system (UPS) <b>401</b>, an AC-side output configuration circuit <b>1302</b>, a capacitor bank <b>403</b>, and a system controller <b>110</b>. The system can achieve the grid connection mode (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>) and the standalone mode (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>) through the connection/disconnection of the contact switches <b>4021</b>,<b>4024</b> of the AC-side output configuration circuit <b>1302</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, when the micro-turbine generator system operates in a grid connection mode, the contact switch <b>4021</b> is turned on, and the contact switch <b>4024</b> is connected to a contact of an input side of the uninterruptible power system <b>401</b>. In this condition, the micro-turbine generator system refers to the voltage and frequency of a mains <b>107</b>, and its operation is similar to a current source, and the power electricity generated from the micro-turbine generator set is fed to the mains to supply power to a general load <b>108</b> and a critical load <b>109</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, when the micro-turbine generator system operates in a standalone mode, since it does not need to be connected with the mains <b>107</b> (without grid connection), the contact switch <b>4021</b> is turned off (shown by dotted lines) and the contact switch <b>4024</b> is connected to a contact of an input side of the uninterruptible power system <b>401</b>. In this condition, the micro-turbine generator system refers to the voltage and frequency of a mains <b>107</b>, and its operation is similar to a current source, and the power electricity generated from the micro-turbine generator set is fed to the mains to supply power to a general load <b>108</b> and a critical load <b>109</b>. However, when the standalone mode is activated (started), since there are no mains as an external power source for starting the generator set, the uninterruptible power system <b>401</b> is used as a backup power source for activating (starting) the standalone mode.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Specifically, in the turbine generator system of the second embodiment of the power supply apparatus according to the present disclosure, the activation (startup) procedure of the standalone mode is divided into the following five steps.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Step 1. Before the startup procedure, the controller <b>110</b> turns off the contact switch <b>4021</b>, turns off the contact switch <b>4021</b> and connects the contact switch <b>4024</b> to a contact of an output side of the uninterruptible power system <b>401</b> (in order to activate the generator through the uninterruptible power system <b>401</b>). In this circuit configuration, since the input-side power of the uninterruptible power system <b>401</b> is lost, the uninterrupted power system <b>401</b> will automatically operate in an emergency power backup mode to supply power to the critical load <b>109</b>. In this condition, the AC-DC converter <b>904</b> of active front-end conversion starts operating, and a voltage (referred to as a DC bus voltage or an ignition voltage) on a DC bus <b>104</b> is built by the power electricity generated from the uninterrupted power system <b>401</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Step 2. After the voltage on the DC bus <b>104</b> is built, the built voltage is used to drive the DC-AC converter <b>103</b> operating in a speed control mode to increase the rotation speed of the generator <b>102</b>. When the rotation speed of the generator <b>102</b> reaches to the normal operation speed of the micro turbine <b>101</b>, the micro turbine <b>101</b> is ignited and started to complete the operation of the generator <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Step 3. The controller <b>110</b> provides a command to connect the contact switch <b>4024</b> to a contact of an open-circuited configuration (the generator <b>102</b> has been started and enters the power generation standby condition), and stops the operation of the AC-DC converter <b>904</b>, and therefore the adjustment and control (regulation) of the voltage on the DC bus <b>104</b> will lose by the AC-DC converter <b>904</b>. In this condition, the DC-AC converter <b>103</b> will automatically change its operation mode and take over the regulation of the voltage of the DC bus <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Step 4. The controller <b>110</b> provides a command to start operating the AC-DC converter <b>904</b> in the standalone mode so as to build a voltage on the AC output side of the system.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Step 5. The controller <b>110</b> provides a command to turn on the contact switch <b>4024</b> to start supplying the power electricity generated from the turbine generator to the general load <b>108</b> to complete starting the standalone mode. Since the input side of the uninterrupted power system <b>401</b> restores to the normal operation voltage condition, the uninterrupted power system <b>401</b> will automatically switch from the emergency power backup mode to the normal standby mode.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the various embodiments of the present disclosure, the DC-AC converter <b>103</b> and the AC-DC converters <b>404</b>,<b>405</b>,<b>904</b> are all bidirectional converters, and the conduction direction of the aforementioned converters may be changed by adjusting different modes by the system controller <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Although the present disclosure has been described with reference to the preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood that the present disclosure is not limited to the details thereof.
