First, for the TW M595102 patent, the portable cup holder disclosed in the patent is only a board structure without a bottom support structure, that is to say, the portable cup holder positions beverage cups on the board. However, this type of portable cup holder would limit the size of the beverage cup placed on it. If the diameter of the beverage cup is too small for the mounting hole to limit the position of the beverage cup, the beverage cup will automatically fall off from the mounting hole. In addition, for the TW M577004 patent, the portable cup holder disclosed in this patent solves the aforementioned problem that the portable cup holder may not be able to hold beverage cups. However, this type of portable cup holder is directly formed, which causes this type of portable cup holder cannot be stacked tightly during transportation or storage, which would make the transporter or the beverage industry need to get a certain space for storing the portable cup holders. It is impossible to avoid the waste of space, which make transporter or the beverage industry reduce the number of portable cup holders in transportation or storage.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, the existing paper cup holders have poor load capacity, and there is a high risk of bottom breakage or damage when placing large-volume beverages.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A main object of the invention is to solve the problem of poor load capacity of the conventional paper cup holder.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to achieve the above object, the invention provides a paper cup holder with carrying handles comprising a first base board, a first wall board connected to one side of the first base board, a surface board connected to one side of the first wall board, a second wall board connected to one side of the surface board, and a second base board connected to one side of the second wall board.

The invention provides a paper cup holder <b>10</b> with carrying handles. The entire paper cup holder <b>10</b> is made of paper except an adhesive part. The paper cup holder <b>10</b> is stacked and stored in a flat form when not in use. The paper cup holder <b>10</b> comprises a first base board <b>11</b>, a first wall board <b>12</b> connected to one side of the first base board <b>11</b>, a surface board <b>13</b> connected to one side of the first wall board <b>12</b>, a second wall board <b>14</b> connected to one side of the surface board <b>13</b>, and a second base board <b>15</b> connected to one side of the second wall board <b>14</b>. When the paper cup holder <b>10</b> is unfolded, the first base board <b>11</b>, the first wall board <b>12</b>, the surface board <b>13</b>, the second wall board <b>14</b> and the second base board <b>15</b> are located on an extension line <b>30</b> and connected in sequence. The first base board <b>11</b>, the first wall board <b>12</b>, the surface board <b>13</b>, the second wall board <b>14</b> and the second base board <b>15</b> are bent in sequence to form a tubular structure <b>16</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The surface board <b>13</b> serves as the top surface of the tubular structure <b>16</b>, and the bottom surface of the tubular structure <b>16</b> is formed by the first base board <b>11</b> and the second base board <b>15</b> that are overlapped with each other. Further, the first base board <b>11</b> is divided by a bending line <b>111</b> into a bottom surface forming part <b>112</b> and a supporting part <b>113</b> connected to the bottom surface forming part <b>112</b>. When the tubular structure <b>16</b> is formed, the bottom surface forming part <b>112</b> is not only serving as a part of the bottom surface of the tubular structure <b>16</b>, but also partially overlapping with the second base board <b>15</b>, and the adhesive is applied to the overlapped part. The supporting part <b>113</b> is bent relative to the bottom surface forming part <b>112</b> based on the bending line <b>111</b> to connect with the surface board <b>13</b>. The supporting part <b>113</b> is connected to the surface board <b>13</b> by bonding with the adhesive. Observing from one of two tubular openings <b>161</b> of the tubular structure <b>16</b>, it can be directly found that the supporting part <b>113</b> is erected therein, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. When the paper cup holder <b>10</b> of the invention is implemented, the main object of the supporting part <b>113</b> is not to support the forming of the tubular structure <b>16</b>, but to strengthen the load capacity of the bottom of the tubular structure <b>16</b> through connection with the surface board <b>13</b> to prevent the bottom of the paper cup holder <b>10</b> from breaking when being provided for placing large-volume beverages.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The surface board <b>13</b> is formed with two carrying handle forming line sets <b>131</b> which are symmetrically disposed and at least two cup inlet forming lines <b>132</b>. Each of the two carrying handle forming line sets <b>131</b> includes an outer secant line <b>133</b>, and an inner secant line <b>134</b> facing the other of the two carrying handle forming line sets <b>131</b>. A starting point and an end point of each of the cup inlet forming lines <b>132</b> are located on the inner secant line <b>134</b>. In one embodiment, each of the at least two cup inlet forming lines <b>132</b> is a secant line. In one embodiment, each of the cup inlet forming lines <b>132</b> is configured as an arc. In addition, in order to maintain the balance of the paper cup holder <b>10</b>, in one embodiment, the quantity of the cup inlet forming lines <b>132</b> facing each of the two inner secant lines <b>134</b> are equal. Two carrying handles <b>17</b> based on the two carrying handle forming line sets <b>131</b> and two hollow areas are simultaneously formed on the surface board <b>13</b>. Each of the two hollow areas forms a cup inlet <b>18</b> with at least one of the cup inlet forming lines <b>132</b> jointly. Furthermore, in one embodiment, the outer secant line <b>133</b> of each of the two carrying handle forming line sets <b>131</b> comprises two straight line segments <b>135</b> disposed at interval and a continuous curve segment <b>136</b> connecting with the two straight line segments <b>135</b> at two ends respectively, and the continuous curve segment <b>136</b> is designed to correspond to a gesture of a user holding the two carrying handles <b>17</b>, so that it is convenient for the user to carry the paper cup holder <b>10</b> of the invention by hand. The surface board <b>13</b> of the invention does not need to form the two carrying handles <b>17</b> and a plurality of cup inlets <b>18</b> separately, so that the plurality of cup inlets <b>18</b> can utilize the surface board <b>13</b> to a greatest extent.
