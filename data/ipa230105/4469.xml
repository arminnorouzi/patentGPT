In these environments, unplanned asset shutdown and/or failure can incur severe consequences, ranging from expenses due to loss of production and/or expenses, to potential injury to workers, amongst others. Given these risks, it can be common to monitor selected parameters of various assets during operation. Measurements of the operating parameters can provide an indication of the condition of a respective asset components, as well as the asset as a whole. As a result, deviations in asset operation from normal operation can be identified and addressed to avoid asset shutdown and/or failure. Thus, asset condition monitoring can provide a variety of long term benefits, such as lower production costs, reduced equipment down time, improved reliability, and enhanced safety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Condition monitoring systems can be configured to report a variety of events characterizing deviation in asset performance from pre-determined normal operation conditions. As an example, set points can be used to define a normal operation range and measurement of operating parameters outside of this range can be flagged as an event. However, it can be appreciated that, under circumstances where measured operating parameters fluctuate about a set point, event logs can become filled with more events than are necessary for an operator to efficiently analyze the cause triggering the event. Furthermore, existing condition monitoring systems often present events as a list. Thus, when repeated events are logged, it can be difficult to find the unique events responsible for triggering the event.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, many condition monitoring platforms do not combine events with supporting data, and can require an operator to navigate between different applications and/or computing devices to compare event details, to supporting data. This scenario increases the time necessary for an operator to gather the information needed to diagnose event triggers, which can be undesirable under time-sensitive circumstances.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, as discussed in detail below, systems and methods for improved visualization of events logged by a condition monitoring system provided herein.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an embodiment, an asset management system is provided and can include a historian and an event analyzer.

The drawings are intended to depict only typical aspects of the subject matter disclosed herein, and therefore should not be considered as limiting the scope of the disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Assets (e.g., machines, machine components, etc.) can be monitored by one or more sensors to ensure they are operating properly. Condition monitoring systems can be used to review sensor measurements, detect when an asset is operating abnormally, and determine whether or not to log an event (e.g., an alarm). Logged events can be reviewed by operating engineers to determine whether action should be taken regarding an event (e.g., shutdown, scheduling maintenance, etc.) Existing condition monitoring systems can present events as a list. However, under some circumstances (e.g., when an asset shifts repeatedly between operating normally and abnormally), similar events can be logged repeatedly. As a result, event logs can become filled with more events than are necessary for an operator to efficiently analyze the cause triggering the event. Furthermore, it can be difficult to find unique events responsible for triggering the event.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Accordingly, improved systems and methods for visualizing events are provided. In one aspect, event data from multiple condition monitoring systems can be displayed. This is an improvement over existing condition monitoring systems that are designed to only visualize event data acquired at their local site. In another aspect, events can be reviewed and classified as either being unique or repeated. When displaying events for viewing by an operator, repeated events can be aggregated into a single item. The ability to aggregate repeated events can improve the efficiency of operators employing the event visualization system, as repeated events can be reviewed together without the need for additional searching. In a further aspect, a displayed event can be selected to view further details regarding the event, facilitating ease of review. In contrast, existing condition monitoring systems can lack the ability to obtain and display such detailed event data, or at the very least, can require an operator to switch between multiple applications on the user computing device.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Embodiments of systems and corresponding methods for visualization of events for condition monitoring are discussed herein. However, embodiments of the disclosure can be employed to for visualization of other data without limit.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating one exemplary embodiment of an operating environment <b>100</b> including one or more condition monitoring systems <b>102</b> in communication with an event visualization system <b>104</b>. As shown, a plurality condition monitoring systems <b>102</b> are provided, each present at a respective site (e.g., Site 1, Site 2, . . . Site N) including one or more assets <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Embodiments of the assets <b>106</b> can include any machine or machine component for which monitoring is desired. In certain embodiments, the assets <b>106</b> can be machines including rotating components, reciprocating components, and/or fixed asset components. Such components can include, but are not limited to, gears, bearings, and shafts, amongst others. Examples of machines containing such components can include, but are not limited to, turbomachines, turbines (e.g., hydro, wind), generators, and reciprocating compressors, amongst others.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As discussed in greater detail below, the assets <b>106</b> can be arranged in an asset hierarchy including a plurality of levels. The lowest level of the asset hierarchy can be the asset components. The next level up from asset components can be the asset level, which encompasses all of the components of a respective asset. As an example, for a recycle compressor asset, asset components can include a motor, a gearbox, and a compressor. The next level up from assets <b>106</b> can be the asset group level. Assets <b>106</b> can be grouped according to any predetermined criteria, such as functionality or process. In one example, a hydrocracker asset group can include respective assets <b>106</b> such as a recycle compressor, a make-up compressor, and a charge pump. The next level up from asset groups can be the site level, which can include all assets associated with a site. As an example, a refinery site can include asset groups such as alkylation, atmospheric distillation, coker, fluidic catalytic cracking, hydrocracker, reformer, and vacuum distillation. The final level up from sites can be the fleet level, which includes all assets <b>106</b> at all sites. It can be appreciated that the examples above are provided for illustration and that the asset hierarchy can include any number of levels, as necessary.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each of the condition monitoring systems <b>102</b> can be in communication with respective sensors <b>110</b> that are configured to sense one or more operating parameters of a target one of the assets <b>106</b>. The sensors <b>110</b> can be further configured to generate at least one sensor signal <b>110</b><i>s </i>representing the measured operating parameter, and to transmit sensor signals <b>110</b><i>s </i>to a respective condition monitoring system <b>102</b> (e.g., via field wiring). As an example, the sensors <b>110</b> can include a probe, a transducer, and a signal conditioning circuit (not shown). The probe can interact with the asset <b>106</b> for measurement of the operating parameter. The transducer can convert measurements of the operating parameter into an electrical signal (e.g., a voltage), and the signal conditioning circuit can condition and/or amplify the electrical signal to generate the sensor signals <b>110</b><i>s </i>(e.g., a voltage ranging between a minimum and maximum). Thus, in one aspect, the sensor signals <b>110</b><i>s </i>can contain the direct or raw measurement made by the sensor transducer. The sensor signals <b>110</b><i>s </i>can be an analog signal or a digital signal.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another aspect, the sensor signals <b>110</b><i>s </i>can include information in addition to the direct measurements of an operating parameter. As an example, the sensor signals <b>110</b><i>s </i>can include metadata regarding one or more components of the corresponding sensors <b>110</b>, such as the transducer. Examples of metadata can include, but is not limited to, one or more of a serial number, revision number, operating temperature, and state of health.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The number and type of sensors <b>110</b> can be dictated by the operating parameter(s) that are intended to be measured. In one aspect, the sensors <b>110</b> can take the form of one or more proximity probes for measurement of vibration, position, speed, direction of motion, and eccentricity. In another aspect, the sensors <b>110</b> can take the form of one or more accelerometers for measurement of seismic vibration and acceleration. In a further aspect, the sensors <b>110</b> can take the form of one or more temperature probes or pressure probes for measurement of temperature and pressure, respectively. It can be understood that the types of sensors <b>110</b> and corresponding measured operating parameters discussed above are not exhaustive and embodiments of the sensors <b>110</b> can include any sensor or combination of sensors suitable for measurement of operating parameters of interest.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In use, the condition monitoring system <b>102</b> can be configured to analyze the received sensor signals <b>110</b><i>s </i>and identify events regarding the corresponding monitored assets <b>106</b>. As an example, the condition monitoring system <b>102</b> can be configured to determine a value characterizing an operating parameter measurement. The condition monitoring system <b>102</b> can also be configured to compare determined values to one or more corresponding predetermined set points or other conditions (e.g., alarm conditions) to determine an alarm status (e.g., OK, Not OK, over, under, etc.) As an example, OK/Not OK can represent a pass/fail condition, while over/under can represent measurement of one or more operating parameters over a set point or under a set point respectively.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">For instance, when the asset <b>106</b> is a rotating shaft and the measured operating parameter is radial vibration of the shaft, the sensor signal <b>110</b><i>s </i>can include measurements of displacement of the shaft as a function of time. From the sensor signals <b>110</b><i>s</i>, the condition monitoring system <b>102</b> can determine the value of vibration amplitude from the peak-to-peak displacement. Under circumstances where the alarm status indicates operation of the asset <b>106</b> outside of a normal operating range, the condition monitoring system <b>102</b> can log the alarm as an event.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In further embodiments, the condition monitoring system <b>102</b> can be configured to analyze operational parameters received from multiple sensors <b>110</b> using defined logic and/or models to extract advanced insights of asset fault conditions. These operational parameters can be measured from a single component/asset or multiple components/assets.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The condition monitoring system <b>102</b> can be further configured to perform monitoring of in a similar fashion upon itself. The additional monitoring can be grouped into a variety of categories and can include, but is not limited to, system health, instrument health, and analytical health.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">System health can include the health of any aspect of the hardware and/or software supporting the functionality of the condition monitoring system <b>102</b>. The condition monitoring system <b>102</b> can receive data from its software/hardware and employ this data in conjunction with set points or other programmed logic to determine whether a system health event has occurred and should be logged. Examples of system health can include, but are not limited to, configuration settings, loss of communication, drivers, firmware/hardware updates, data wrapping/loss, etc.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Instrument health can include any aspect of the operation of the sensors <b>110</b> to collect sensor data. The condition monitoring system <b>102</b> can receive metadata from the sensors <b>110</b> regarding their operation and employ this data in conjunction with set points or other programmed logic to determine whether an instrument health event has occurred and should be logged. Examples of instrument health can include, but are not limited to, instrument faults, instrument OK status, and instrument communication status.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Analytical health can include the logic employed for identifying events (e.g., alarms and additional monitoring). As an example, rules/criteria defining when the condition monitoring system <b>102</b> logs an event (e.g., an event source) can be prepared by one or more authorized parties, such as a manufacturer, owner, operator of the condition monitoring system. The condition monitoring system <b>102</b> can receive metadata regarding logic employed for event identification and employ this data in conjunction with predetermined set points or other criteria defining normal and abnormal operation of event identification logic determine whether an event has occurred and should be logged. Examples of analytical health can include, but are not limited to presence/absence of event identification logic.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In general, regardless of the event type, when an event is logged, selected event data regarding that event can be recorded. Examples of event data can include, but are not limited to, a location of the affected asset within the asset hierarchy of the fleet, and at least one event parameter corresponding to the event (e.g., an operating parameter measurement in the case of an alarm event). The event parameters can optionally include one or more of the following:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0051">Event name: A name of the identified event.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0052">Asset state: An operating state of the asset to which the event pertains. Examples can include, but are not limited to, startup, running (normal operation), shutdown, etc.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0053">Measurement type and measurement point: The measurement type is the category of measurement used to identify the event (e.g., vibration, temperature, pressure, etc.) The measurement point is a channel used to acquire the values for the measurement type (e.g., the sensor(s) <b>110</b>).</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0054">Event Trigger: One or more set points used to identify the event.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0055">Event type: A classification of the event (e.g., NOT OK, over, under, etc.),</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0056">Event source: One or more logic packages employed to identify an event.

When the event is transitory, the operating parameter measurement(s) can be a single operational parameter measurement(s) Alternatively, when the event persists, the operating parameter measurement(s) can be a plurality of operating parameter measurements acquired during at least a portion of the event (e.g., operational parameter measurements acquired between the event entered time and the event exited time)</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0052" num="0060">Each condition monitoring system <b>102</b> can be configured to output the event data logged for assets <b>106</b> of its respective site. In certain embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the event visualization system <b>104</b> can be in communication with the plurality of condition monitoring systems <b>102</b> and the event data can be received therefrom (e.g., site 1 event data <b>112</b>A, site N event data <b>112</b>N, collectively event data <b>112</b>). In alternative embodiments, not shown, the condition monitoring system can output the event data to another computing device. Subsequently, the condition monitoring system can retrieve the event data.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0061">As shown, the event visualization system <b>104</b> includes an event analyzer <b>116</b> in communication with a historian <b>120</b>, and a user computing device <b>122</b>. The historian <b>120</b> can be configured to store event data <b>112</b> received from the plurality of condition monitoring systems <b>102</b>. The event analyzer <b>116</b> can be configured to submit queries <b>114</b> to the historian <b>120</b> for event data <b>112</b>. Subsequently, the event analyzer <b>116</b> can generate graphical user interfaces (GUIs) <b>126</b> based upon the received event data <b>112</b> and transmit the GUIs <b>126</b> to the user computing device <b>122</b> for display. The user computing device <b>122</b> can be configured to display GUIs <b>126</b> generated by the event analyzer <b>116</b>, as well as receive user selections within the GUI <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0062">A hierarchical list of the assets within the fleet, arranged in levels as discussed above, can be displayed within the GUI <b>126</b>. In response to receipt of a user selection of a hierarchical level within this list, the event analyzer <b>116</b> can be configured to identify a plurality of events associated with the selected hierarchical level. The event analyzer <b>116</b> can further update the GUI <b>126</b> to include a second list of the identified events, where unique and repeated events are each displayed in a single respective entry.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0063">The event visualization system <b>104</b> can provide a variety of benefits over existing techniques for event visualization. In one aspect, events from a plurality of condition monitoring systems <b>102</b> can be included in the event data <b>112</b> and visualized. In contrast, existing condition monitoring systems can be configured to only visualize event data acquired at their local site and cannot visualize events experienced by assets of other sites.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0064">In another aspect, the event analyzer <b>116</b> can be further configured to update the GUI <b>126</b> to display a list of events corresponding to assets <b>106</b> within the selected hierarchical level. This list can include unique events and repeated events. In contrast with existing condition monitoring systems, however, repeated events can be identified and aggregated into a single list entry. The ability to aggregate repeated events can improve the efficiency of operators employing the event visualization system <b>104</b>, as repeated events can be reviewed together without the need for additional searching.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0065">In a further aspect, the GUI <b>126</b> can be updated to display detailed data regarding an event of the event list in response to an operator selection. In contrast, existing condition monitoring systems can lack the ability to obtain and display such detailed event data, or at the very least, can require an operator to switch between multiple applications. The ability to view detailed event data without cumbersome application switching can further improve the efficiency of operators employing the event visualization system <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0066">In certain embodiments, events can pertain to alarms (e.g., an operating parameter that is outside of a normal operating range). Under some circumstances, an alarm can be indicative of a problem with the monitored asset, and it can be desirable to address such alarms in order to avoid asset shutdown and/or damage. Accordingly, the GUI <b>126</b> can be further updated to display one or more recommended actions in combination with an alarm event. Beneficially, by displaying recommendations in combination with alarm events, the event visualization system <b>104</b> can assist operators in determining courses of action to address an alarm events and allow faster resolution of such alarm events.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0067">The discussion below provides exemplary embodiments of the GUI <b>126</b> generated by the event analyzer <b>116</b> with regards to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>A, and <b>3</b>B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating one exemplary embodiment of the GUI <b>126</b>. As discussed in detail below, the GUI <b>126</b> can be configured to display one or more of a first window <b>200</b>, a second window <b>202</b>, a third window <b>204</b>, and a fourth window <b>206</b> in any combination.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0068">The GUI <b>126</b> can be configured to display a hierarchical list of assets <b>210</b> within the first window <b>200</b>. As shown, the hierarchical list of assets <b>210</b> includes a plurality of levels, such as a fleet level, a site level, an asset group level, an asset level, and a component level.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0069">The GUI <b>126</b> can be configured to receive a user selection (e.g., user selection <b>124</b>) of a level of the hierarchical list of assets <b>210</b>. In response to receipt of this selection, the event analyzer <b>116</b> can determine the assets <b>106</b> and corresponding events associated with the selected hierarchical level.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0070">As discussed above, the highest level is the fleet level. Thus, selection of the fleet level includes all assets <b>106</b> of the fleet (e.g., all assets within each site) and all events of the fleet.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0071">The second highest level is the site level and it can include one or more sites (e.g., site 1, site 2, . . . site N). Thus, selection of a site of the site level can include the assets <b>106</b> associated with the selected site and all events corresponding to the assets of the selected site.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0072">The third highest level is the asset group level (e.g., asset group 1, asset group 2, . . . asset group N). Thus, selection of an asset group of the asset group level can include the assets <b>106</b> associated with the selected asset group and all events corresponding to the assets <b>106</b> of the selected asset group.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0073">The fourth highest level is the asset level (e.g., asset <b>1</b>, asset <b>2</b>, asset N). Thus, selection of an asset <b>106</b> of the asset level includes the selected asset <b>106</b> and all events corresponding to the selected asset <b>106</b>. Optionally, when asset components are monitored, selection of an asset <b>106</b> of the asset level can further include the components associated with the selected asset <b>106</b> and events corresponding to the selected asset <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0074">The fifth highest level is the asset component level (e.g., component <b>1</b>, component <b>2</b>, component N). Thus, selection of a component of the component level includes the selected component and all events corresponding to the selected component.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0075">The event analyzer <b>116</b> can be further configured to update the GUI <b>126</b> to display a second list of events associated with the selected hierarchical level of the hierarchical list of assets <b>210</b>. This second list can include a single entry for unique events and a single entry for respective repeat events. As discussed above, examples of events can include, but are not limited to, alarms, system health of the condition monitoring system, instrument health of instruments (e.g., sensors <b>110</b>) acquiring operating parameter measurements of respective monitored assets <b>106</b>, and analytical health of logic used to identify the events.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0076">As discussed above, the event data corresponding to each event can include at least one event parameter. In certain embodiments, an event can be classified as a repeat event when the at least one event parameter corresponding to the event matches all of the at least one event parameter of another event of the plurality of events. In general, such matching is designed to ensure that events classified as repeat events are evaluated on the same basis and occur under nominally identical conditions of the asset and, therefore, can be attributed to the same underlying cause. Furthermore, such events can exhibit little substantive variation with respect to one another. Therefore, grouping these repeat events in a single entry within the second list provides a significant efficient improvement without a substantive loss of event information.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0077">In certain embodiments, the at least one event parameter can include measurement type and measurement point, asset state, event level, event source, and event type. Thus, under these circumstances, an event is classified as a unique event when the at least one of the above-listed event parameters of the event does not match another event. In contrast, under these circumstances, an event is classified as a repeat event when the least one event parameter corresponding to the event matches all of the above-listed event parameters of another event.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0078">It can be appreciated that these event parameters are discussed for the purpose of example only and the at least one event parameter can be different and, optionally, can include greater or fewer event parameters.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0079">In further embodiments, the second window <b>202</b> can further display selected event information corresponding to each of the listed events.

Examples of the event data can include, but are not limited to, an event summary <b>212</b>, a recommended action <b>214</b>, an event occurrence list <b>216</b>, and an operating parameter plot <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0081">A representative example is further illustrated <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref>.

Non-limiting examples of summarized event data can include, but is not limited to, an event occurrence count, the asset state (startup, running (normal operation), shutdown, etc.), the event trigger value (alone or in combination with a measured operating parameter value causing the event to be triggered), the event type (e.g., alarm, system health, instrument health, or analytical health), and the event source. In the case of a uniquely selected event, the most recent occurrence will be the only occurrence within the event data corresponding to the selected event. Thus, under these circumstances, the count adopts a value of 1.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0083">In certain embodiments, recommended actions are shown in a second sub-window of the third window <b>204</b>. The recommended actions corresponding to respective events can be determined by the condition monitoring system <b>102</b> and included with the event data <b>112</b>. In certain embodiments, the recommendations can be determined by the condition monitoring systems <b>102</b> and provided with the event data <b>112</b>. In other embodiments, an operator can employ the event visualization system <b>104</b> to associate recommendations with specific events. In one example, a recommendation can suggest that specific maintenance be performed on an asset <b>106</b>. In another example, a recommendation can suggest operation of an asset <b>106</b> within specified operating parameters.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0084">An exemplary list of event occurrences <b>216</b> is shown in a third sub-window of the third window <b>204</b>. In the case of a uniquely selected event, the most recent occurrence will be the only occurrence within the event data corresponding to the selected event. Thus, under these circumstances, only a single occurrence will be displayed. In contrast, the case of a repeat selected event, all of the occurrences within the event data corresponding to the selected repeat event can be displayed.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0085">For each occurrence, selected event data can be displayed.

Optionally, one or more set points can be overlaid on the plot. It can be appreciated that the plot can display other data in any format as necessary.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0087">The event analyzer <b>116</b> can be further configured to update the GUI <b>126</b> to display a fourth window <b>206</b> in response to receipt of the first user selection of a level of the hierarchical list of assets <b>210</b>. As an example, the fourth window <b>206</b> can include a performance summary at the selected hierarchy level based upon the portion of the event data <b>112</b> corresponding to the first plurality of events.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0088">A representative example of the fourth window is further illustrated <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref>.

Examples can include, but are not limited to, alarm acknowledgement, alarm suppression, resetting a latched alarm, etc. In a further embodiment, quick actions can pertain to case management, such as case creation or case assignment. As an example, under circumstances where an operator has a case where they are managing the status/maintenance of a specific asset <b>106</b> and a new event is identified that is related to the case, the operator can use the quick actions to assign that event to the case to gather all supporting data. In another example, a new case could be created after a new event is identified. In a further embodiment, quick actions can pertain to navigation within the GUI <b>126</b>.

The measured operating data can be before, during, and/or after the selected event.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0106">Exemplary technical effects of the methods, systems, and devices described herein include, by way of non-limiting example improved visualization of events for condition monitoring. In one aspect, unique and non-unique (e.g., recurring) events can be identified and recurring events can be aggregated together and displayed in a graphical user interface. Therefore, unnecessary display of redundant events can be avoided, facilitating ease of review of listed events. In another aspect, the display of events in this manner is not limited to events from a single site but multiple sites, up to an entire fleet. This manner of data visualization can be particularly advantageous when listing events across an entire fleet, as the number of listed events increases significantly as compared to display of events from one or a small number of sites. In a further aspect, the graphical user interface can be further configured to display supporting information in the form of summary views and various detailed views (e.g., all recurring events, data plots illustrating measured operating parameters within a time range including respective events, etc.) This enables operators to quickly review events and supporting data without the need to sort through a large list of nuisance events.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0107">Certain exemplary embodiments have been described to provide an overall understanding of the principles of the structure, function, manufacture, and use of the systems, devices, and methods disclosed herein.
