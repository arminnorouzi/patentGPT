Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0011" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A nucleic acid sequence measuring apparatus, a nucleic acid sequence measuring method, and a non-transitory recording medium according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail below with reference to the drawings. The outline of the embodiment of the present invention will be described first, and then the details of the embodiment of the present invention will be described below.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Outline</heading><p id="p-0049" num="0048">An embodiment of the present invention is intended to improve the measurement accuracy of a target having a specific nucleic acid sequence included in a sample compared with in the related art. For example, an embodiment of the present invention enables a target to be measured even if a size of the target included in a sample is very small. To be specific, the embodiment of the present invention is realizing a high measurement accuracy by eliminating an influence of weak fluorescence (offset light) emitted from the nucleic acid sequence measuring device, uneven fluorescence (variation in amount of light), or the like as far as possible when a sample is not added.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The nucleic acid sequence measuring device disclosed in Patent Literature 1 described above is a nucleic acid sequence measuring device which includes a fluorescent probe having a fluorescent molecule added thereto and a quenching probe having a quenching molecule added thereto and in which the fluorescent probe and the quenching probe are joined so that the fluorescence of the fluorescent molecule is quenched through the quenching molecule. In this nucleic acid sequence measuring device, if a target to be measured is added, hybridization breaks the joining between the fluorescent probe and the quenching probe so that fluorescence is emitted.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For this reason, if a target is not added to the nucleic acid sequence measuring device, the fluorescence of the fluorescent molecule added to the fluorescent probe is quenched through the quenching molecule added to the quenching probe. Thus, fluorescence need not be emitted from the nucleic acid sequence measuring device. However, when the quenching of fluorescence through the quenching molecule is incomplete, offset light is emitted from the nucleic acid sequence measuring device. Such offset light becomes noise and deteriorates the measurement accuracy. For example, when the amount of targets is small, the fluorescence emitted from the nucleic acid sequence measuring device is also weak. For this reason, if this weak fluorescence is hidden in the offset light, the target cannot be measured.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Also, when a target is measured using the nucleic acid sequence measuring device, before and after hybridization, a process of comparing amounts of fluorescent light emitted from the nucleic acid sequence measuring device is performed. That is to say, a process of comparing an amount of offset light emitted from the nucleic acid sequence measuring device before hybridization with an amount of fluorescent light emitted from the nucleic acid sequence measuring device after hybridization is performed.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the related art, the above process is performed using a nucleic acid sequence measuring device in which a block (second block) to which a sample which does not include a target is added is prepared in addition to a block (first block) to which a sample which includes a target is added. That is to say, the amount of fluorescent light (offset light) emitted from the second block is compared with the amount of fluorescent light emitted from the first block (fluorescence emitted after hybridization).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Alternatively, the above process is performed using a nucleic acid sequence measuring device to which a sample which includes a target is added and a nucleic acid sequence measuring device to which a sample which does not include a target is added. That is to say, an amount of fluorescent light (offset light) emitted from the nucleic acid sequence measuring device to which a sample which does not include a target is added is compared with an amount of fluorescent light emitted from the nucleic acid sequence measuring device to which a sample which includes a target is added (fluorescence emitted after hybridization).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">However, the amount of offset light varies between blocks and between nucleic acid sequence measuring devices due to manufacturing variations or the like of the nucleic acid sequence measuring device. For this reason, if the amount of offset light is relatively small, it is possible to measure a target, but if the amount of offset light is relatively large, it may not be possible to measure a target. As described above, the measurement accuracy deteriorates in accordance with a magnitude of a variation in amount of offset light between blocks and between nucleic acid sequence measuring devices.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Also, in the nucleic acid sequence measuring device disclosed in Patent Literature 1 described above, there is also a variation in the amount of fluorescent light emitted from a spot (region in which the fluorescent probe and the quenching probe in the joining state described above are fixed on a substrate). This is due to a fixed amount of the probe in the spot, an uneven reaction, and the like. Variations in amount of light in such spots also cause deterioration in measurement accuracy.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the embodiment of the present invention, first, a difference between a first time point indicating an amount of fluorescent light emitted from a predefined measurement region of the nucleic acid sequence measuring device at a first time point before or immediately after the addition of a sample to the nucleic acid sequence measuring device and a second amount of light indicating an amount of fluorescent light emitted from a measurement region at a second time point after a predefined time has elapsed from the addition of a sample to the nucleic acid sequence measuring device is acquired. Furthermore, a target is measured based on the difference between the first amount of light and the second amount of light.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As described above, in the embodiment of the present invention, the difference between the first amount of fluorescent light emitted from a certain measurement region at the first time point and the second amount of fluorescent light emitted from the same measurement region as described above at the second time point is acquired. Furthermore, a target is measured based on the difference between the first amount of light and the second amount of light. For this reason, it is possible to improve the measurement accuracy of the target having a specific nucleic acid sequence included in a sample compared with in the related art.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0059" num="0058">First, a nucleic acid sequence measuring device used for measuring a nucleic acid sequence will be described below.
