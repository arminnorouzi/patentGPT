Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention generally relates to construction materials and techniques, and more specifically relates to a building block wall system, methods of manufacturing blocks, and method that may be used to construct a wall.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Background Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Building blocks have been used for centuries to construct homes, office buildings, churches, and many other structures. Early building blocks were hewn from stone into appropriate shapes that were assembled together, typically using mortar, to form a wall. In modern times, various types of concrete blocks have been developed, which are typically formed by pouring a cement-based concrete mixture into a form and allowing the concrete to cure. This type of concrete block is strong and makes for a sturdy wall, but installing a traditional concrete block requires a skilled mason that must manually lift each block, and set each block using mortar to secure the blocks in place. This process is very labor-intensive.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One application for concrete blocks is the construction of retaining walls. Retaining walls are required when there is a body of earth that needs to be held in place. While several different block designs have been used in the art, most of these are relatively small blocks that a construction worker must manually lift and put in place. Most require mortar and a considerable amount of labor to install. U.S. Pat. No. 6,796,098, which issued on Sep. 28, 2004, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,073,304, which issued on Jul. 11, 2006, disclose building blocks and a building block system that greatly simplifies construction of a wall using the blocks. These two patents were assigned to Stone Strong LLC of Lincoln, Nebraska, and are incorporated herein by reference. The blocks have a relatively large, finished surface. The blocks include one or more lift and alignment devices in the block that allow the block to be lifted using a suitable lifting apparatus, such as a crane, forklift, backhoe, etc. The blocks include one or more recessed portions in the bottom surface of the block positioned to receive the protruding lift and alignment device of a previously-laid block underneath, thereby helping to align the block with the previously-laid block. Some embodiments of the blocks include one or more voids that extend from the top surface to the bottom surface of the block, and that align with each other when the blocks are stacked into a wall, thereby allowing fill material to be placed in the voids to strengthen the wall.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to the preferred embodiments, a system of blocks has a finished surface that provides an attractive appearance. The blocks are relatively large in size, allowing the quick construction of a wall, such as a retaining wall, using the blocks. The blocks may include one or more lift and alignment rings in the block that allow the block to be lifted using a suitable lifting apparatus, such as a crane, forklift, backhoe, etc. The blocks include one or more recessed portions in the bottom surface of the block positioned to receive the protruding lift and alignment device of a previously-laid block underneath, thereby helping to align the block with the previously-laid block.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The building blocks, system and methods disclosed herein provide improvements to the building blocks, system and methods disclosed in the two patents referenced in the Background Art second above. The front of the building block includes a finished front face that provides a decorative look, and the building block includes a tongue and a groove. In a first embodiment, one row of the blocks is placed adjacent to each other with the tongues and grooves facing up to form a first row with a finished front face that provides a decorative look. A second row of blocks identical to the first block can be placed inverted and opposite the first row of blocks so the tongues and grooves on the second row of blocks interlock with the tongues and grooves on the first row of blocks. The result is a wall that has two opposing finished faces with the blocks interlocked back-to-back. In a second embodiment, two types of blocks are provided, the first type having a finished front face and a second type having a thicker and heavier unfinished front face. In the second embodiment, one row of the blocks with the finished front face is placed adjacent to each other to form a first row with a finished front face. A second row of blocks with the unfinished front face are then positioned facing away from the first row of blocks so the tongues and grooves on each of each of the second blocks interlock with the grooves and tongues, respectively, on each of the first blocks. The result is a wall that has one finished face and an opposing unfinished face with the blocks interlocked back-to-back. The blocks can be made so a recess on the bottom of each block is offset from the lift and alignment rings on the top of the block so the blocks can be used to build a setback or battered wall, where each block is set back from the previous block. In the alternative, the blocks can be made so the recess on the bottom of each block aligns with the lift and alignment rings on the top of the block so the blocks can be used to build a vertical wall, where the face of each block aligns with the face of the previous block.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Building blocks include a tongue and groove on each block that allow the blocks to be placed in a way that interlocks the tongue and groove of one block with the corresponding groove and tongue, respectively, of another block facing the opposite direction, thereby interlocking the blocks back-to-back. In a first embodiment, the same building block that has a finished front face that provides a decorative look is used for both sides of the wall, resulting in a wall with opposed finished surfaces. In a second embodiment, a first plurality of blocks that have a finished front face that provide a decorative look are used for one side of the wall, while a second plurality of blocks that have a thicker and unfinished, non-decorative face are used for the other side of the wall, with the first and second plurality of blocks interlocking back-to-back via their respective tongues and grooves. Both types of blocks can be made using the same concrete form.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The foregoing and other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following more particular description of preferred embodiments of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, a first embodiment of a building block <b>100</b> includes a front <b>110</b>, a right side <b>120</b>, a left side <b>130</b>, and a back <b>140</b>. The front <b>110</b> preferably includes a finished, decorative front surface that resembles stone or provides other desired appearance, one example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Each side <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> preferably includes a corresponding lift and alignment ring <b>150</b> and <b>160</b>, respectively. The lift and alignment rings <b>150</b> and <b>160</b> serve two functions, first to allow lifting and placing the block <b>100</b>, and second to align a block being placed with a previously-placed block. The side <b>120</b> includes a groove <b>170</b>, and, in similar configuration, side <b>130</b> includes a groove <b>180</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a horizontal dotted line is shown at a distance <b>220</b> from the top of the side <b>120</b> that represents approximately half of the total height <b>210</b> of the side <b>120</b>. As shown more particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, groove <b>170</b> preferably has a depth <b>230</b> that extends downwardly from the top of side <b>120</b> to a point <b>240</b> greater than half the distance <b>220</b> between the top and the bottom of side <b>120</b>. The back <b>140</b> of the block includes a tongue <b>190</b>, shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, that extends upwardly from the bottom of the side <b>120</b> to a height greater than half the distance <b>220</b> between the bottom and the top. Side <b>130</b> includes a similar groove <b>180</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The tongue and groove configuration allows blocks to be placed with the tongue of a first block engaging the groove of a second block, and the tongue of the second block engaging the groove of the first block, thereby interlocking the two blocks back-to-back.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the preferred embodiments, an angled surface <b>250</b> connects the groove <b>170</b> to the tongue <b>190</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The angled surface <b>250</b> helps to slide a second block in place atop the first block so the tongues and grooves of two opposing blocks interlock with each other.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The bottom of each side preferably includes a recess <b>260</b> that is used to align the block <b>100</b> with a previously-placed block. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the recess <b>260</b> is offset from the position of the lift and alignment ring <b>150</b>. This allows the block <b>100</b> to be used to build a setback or battered wall, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Building block <b>100</b> preferably includes one or more voids that extend from the top surface to the bottom surface of the block. Examples of suitable voids are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> to include a fully enclosed void <b>192</b> and two partially enclosed voids <b>194</b> and <b>196</b>. When blocks <b>100</b> are laid next to each other, partially enclosed voids <b>194</b> and <b>196</b> of adjacent blocks combine to form a void somewhat similar in size to void <b>192</b>. These voids are designed to align with voids of other blocks when the blocks are stacked to form a wall. The voids may be filled with an appropriate filler material, such as recycled concrete, gravel, concrete, etc. Filling the voids with an appropriate filler material increases the shear strength of a wall built using the block <b>100</b>. The preferred embodiments also extend to a block <b>100</b> that is solid, and thus has no voids.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The interlocking of two substantially identical blocks back-to-back is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. A first block <b>100</b>A represents one of the blocks <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>. A second block <b>100</b>B represents another one of the blocks <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, but inverted so the two blocks interlock as shown. Note the tongue (<b>190</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of block <b>100</b>A engages the groove (<b>170</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of block <b>100</b>B, while the tongue (<b>190</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of block <b>100</b>B engages the groove (<b>170</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of block <b>100</b>A.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">With the block configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, a setback or battered wall can be built. A first row of blocks <b>100</b>A is placed on a suitable foundation <b>610</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Examples of a suitable foundation <b>610</b> include concrete and/or rock. Next, a row of blocks <b>100</b>B is placed inverted with the tongues and grooves engaging the grooves and tongues, respectively, of the blocks <b>100</b>A. Note the lift and alignment ring <b>510</b> of the inverted block <b>100</b>B as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> can be removed with a cutter or grinder, or a space could be made in the foundation <b>610</b> so removing the lift and alignment ring <b>510</b> is not necessary. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the lift and alignment ring <b>510</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> has been removed. Once the row of blocks <b>100</b>A and the row of blocks <b>100</b>B have been placed, the result is a partial wall with two opposing finished faces, where the two rows of block are interlocked back-to-back. The next row of blocks <b>100</b>C is then placed, with the recesses <b>260</b> aligning with the lift and alignment ring so the front face of blocks <b>100</b>C is setback from the front face of blocks <b>100</b>A, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The next row of blocks <b>100</b>D is then placed inverted with the tongues and grooves engaging the grooves and tongues, respectively, of the blocks <b>100</b>C. This process repeats for the row of blocks <b>100</b>E, the row of blocks <b>100</b>F, the row of blocks <b>100</b>G, and the row of blocks <b>100</b>H. The result is a wall <b>600</b> that has opposing finished surfaces that has been built from a single type of block, with one side right side up and the other side inverted, with the blocks on the two sides interlocking back-to-back as shown.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an alternative embodiment, the recess <b>260</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> could be positioned directly over the lift and alignment ring <b>150</b>. Two such blocks <b>700</b>A and <b>700</b>B can be interlocked, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Blocks that have the recesses aligned with the lift and alignment rings can be used to build a vertical wall that has the faces of each row in the same plane as the faces on other rows on the same side of the wall, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. A first row of blocks <b>700</b>A is placed on the foundation <b>810</b>. A second row of blocks <b>700</b>B is placed inverted so the tongues and grooves interlock with the first blocks <b>700</b>A as shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the lift and alignment ring <b>710</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> has been removed. The next row of blocks <b>700</b>C is placed. Because the bottom recess aligns with the lift and alignment ring, the front faces of blocks <b>700</b>C will be in substantially the same plane as the front faces of blocks <b>700</b>A. Once the row of blocks <b>700</b>C has been placed, the row of blocks <b>700</b>D is placed, followed by the row of blocks <b>700</b>E, the row of blocks <b>700</b>F, the row of blocks <b>700</b>G, and the row of blocks <b>700</b>H. The result is a wall <b>800</b> that has two finished surfaces opposite to and substantially parallel with each other, with each block interlocking with one or more other blocks back-to-back as shown.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">While the blocks shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>8</b></figref> are shown in cross-section for the purpose of illustration, one skilled in the art will appreciate the blocks of one row are preferably staggered with respect to a row of previously-placed blocks to provide a stronger wall. This applies not only to a row above but to the row behind as well. Thus, a first row of blocks <b>100</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> could be placed, and the second row of blocks <b>100</b>B is placed staggered with respect to the first row of blocks <b>100</b>A, and such that a tongue on a second block <b>100</b>B engages a groove on two of the blocks <b>100</b>A, and a tongue on the first block <b>100</b>A engages a groove on two of the blocks <b>100</b>B. This can be done, for example, by cutting one of the blocks <b>100</b>B in half and starting at the end with a half block, which will cause blocks <b>100</b>B to be staggered with respect to the edges of blocks <b>100</b>A.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a second embodiment, two different types of blocks can be interlocked. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> show a second type of block <b>900</b> that does not have or need a decorative front face because one side of the wall will have dirt or other suitable fill material backfilled against it. In the most preferred implementation, the block <b>900</b> has a very similar configuration as the block <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, with the primary difference being the front <b>910</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is thicker and heavier than the front <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>. The block <b>900</b> is shown in an orientation that is inverted compared to block <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Block <b>900</b> includes sides <b>120</b> and <b>130</b> with their corresponding respective grooves <b>170</b> and <b>180</b>. Side <b>130</b> includes a groove <b>180</b> and corresponding tongue <b>190</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. Recess <b>960</b> is similar to recess <b>160</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, with a corresponding recess <b>970</b> in side <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The second type of block <b>900</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> can be made using the same form used to make block <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>. The primary difference is the liner that provides the decorative surface of the front <b>110</b> is removed from the form, making the front <b>910</b> of block <b>900</b> an unfinished, non-decorative surface. Unfinished, non-decorative means the front <b>910</b> does not necessarily have any features that could be considered design features. Front <b>910</b> could thus be a plain concrete front. Design features are not needed because the front <b>910</b> will have dirt or other suitable material backfilled against it. The removal of the form liner that provides the decorative front face shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> from the form causes the front <b>910</b> to be thicker and heavier than the front <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>. The additional mass provided by a thicker front provides an advantage by providing a stronger block that allows building walls that are self-supported or that have a higher height than would be possible using the block <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows a first type of block <b>100</b>A, which is one of the blocks <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, interlocked back-to-back with the second type of block <b>900</b>A, which is one of the blocks <b>900</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>. With the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, a battered or setback wall can be built as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. A first row of blocks <b>100</b>A is placed on a suitable foundation <b>1210</b>. A row of blocks <b>900</b>A is then placed, interlocking back-to-back with the first row of blocks <b>100</b>A as shown.

The row of blocks <b>100</b>D is then placed, followed by the row of blocks <b>900</b>D. The result is a wall <b>1200</b> that has one finished surface <b>1220</b> with a decorative look opposite to an unfinished surface <b>1230</b> against which dirt or other suitable material can be backfilled, with each block interlocking back-to-back with one or more other blocks as shown.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">By positioning the lower recess of the blocks <b>100</b>A to directly underlie the lift and alignment ring, as shown in block <b>1300</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, a vertical wall can be built, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. A first row of blocks <b>1300</b>A is placed on a suitable foundation <b>1410</b>. A row of blocks <b>900</b>A is then placed so they interlock back-to-back with the row of blocks <b>1300</b>A as shown.

Position a decorative liner in the form for the front face (step <b>1510</b>). Position one or more inserts in the form for the bottom, side and middle recesses and voids (step <b>1520</b>). Position one or more inserts in the form for the tongue and groove (step <b>1530</b>). Note the positioning of the decorative liner in step <b>1510</b> and inserts in steps <b>1520</b> and <b>1530</b> need not necessarily be done for each block. For example, when pouring two identical blocks back-to-back, the decorative liner and previously-placed inserts can be used. The positioning of the liner in step <b>1510</b> and inserts in steps <b>1520</b> and <b>1530</b> can thus mean actually inserting the liner and inserts into the form, or merely verifying the liner and inserts are already in a correct position. Position reinforcement in the form, if needed (step <b>1540</b>). Suitable reinforcement positioned in the form can include, for example, steel rebar and welded wire mesh. The lift and alignment rings are then positioned (step <b>1550</b>) so the lift and alignment rings extend above the top of the block as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>. In one suitable implementation, the lift and alignment rings are placed through slots in the form and held in place with magnetic holders. Suitable additives can then be added to the concrete mix (step <b>1560</b>). Suitable additives to the concrete mix can include, for example, steel fibers, fiberglass fibers, curing accelerators, plasticizers, chemicals, admixtures, etc. Pour the concrete mix into the form (step <b>1570</b>). In the most preferred implementation, the concrete mix is poured to the top of the form in step <b>1570</b>. Allow the concrete to cure (step <b>1580</b>). In the most preferred embodiment, the concrete is allowed to cure to a minimum of 1,900 pounds per square inch (psi) (13 megapascal (MPa)). For a block of the dimensions in paragraph 0049, this minimum amount of cure can be achieved by leaving the block in the form for 3-4 hours when concrete curing accelerators are added to the concrete mix, thus allowing two pours per business day. This minimum amount of cure can also be achieved without adding concrete accelerators to the concrete mix by leaving the block in the form for 8-10 hours. Once sufficient time has passed to assure the concrete has cured to a minimum of 1,900 psi (13 MPa), the block is removed from the form (step <b>1590</b>).
