Here, the portable electronic device <b>2</b>A includes a touch panel in which a touch sensor is superimposed on a display as an operation unit. The portable electronic device <b>2</b>A has a built-in battery and operates with energy (electric power, electric charge) stored in the battery. Various charging devices are used as a charging mechanism for charging the battery. In this embodiment, a charging mechanism for regular charging and a charging mechanism for fast charging are exemplified.

In this embodiment, the charging characteristics of the battery are prescribed, for example, for each model of the portable electronic device <b>2</b>A. The computer <b>10</b> stores the charging characteristics of the battery for each model of the portable electronic device <b>2</b>A in the database. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates charging characteristics of the battery with a model SMART PHONE TYPE <b>1</b>. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, regular charging and fast charging are exemplified as the charging methods. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, charging rates are prescribed in a constant-current area and a constant-voltage area for each of regular charging and fast charging. The computer <b>10</b> calculates the charging times to the target charging capacity for each model with reference to the database in which the charging characteristics illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> are stored.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">For example, in the regular charging, a state of charge (SOC) range of 0% to 70% is a constant-current area. In the constant-current area, charging is performed with a constant current, and the charging rate is, for example, 60%/hour. Accordingly, the battery can be charged from an SOC of 0% to an SOC of 60% through one hour of charging. In the regular charging, an SOC range of 70% to 100% is a constant-voltage area. In the constant-voltage area, charging is performed with a constant voltage. In the constant-voltage area, the charging rate decreases gradually and thus is represented as an approximate value. The charging rate of an approximate value is, for example, about 50%/hour.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the fast charging, an SOC range of 0% to 60% is a constant-current area. In the constant-current area for fast charging, the charging rate is, for example, 180%/hour.

In this routine, the computer <b>10</b> receives a request for information on a charging spot from the portable electronic device <b>2</b>A (S<b>1</b>). The computer <b>10</b> acquires a current state of charge (SOC) of the battery along with the request for information. The current SOC of the battery is also referred to as a residual capacity or a charging capacity of the battery. At this time, the computer <b>10</b> may acquire a necessary charging capacity. The necessary charging capacity is an amount of electric power necessary for operating of the portable electronic device <b>2</b>A until the next charging opportunity. The necessary charging capacity may be designated as, for example, an SOC of the battery after it has been charged. The necessary charging capacity may also be referred to as a target charging capacity. When the portable electronic device <b>2</b>A transmits the request for information on the charging spot to the computer <b>10</b> in the process of Step S<b>1</b>, it is assumed that the user has a charging opportunity to charge the battery of the portable electronic device <b>2</b>A.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Then, the computer <b>10</b> determines whether the request from the portable electronic device <b>2</b>A includes designation of a necessary charging capacity (S<b>2</b>).

The computer <b>10</b> may determine that charging is not possible during a business trip or movement for the business trip in the schedule management information for the user. On the other hand, the computer <b>10</b> may determine that charging is possible to a time period in which a location of the user is the seat or the home in the schedule management information for the user. The computer <b>10</b> may determine that charging is possible in a rest time or a free time in the schedule management information for the user.
