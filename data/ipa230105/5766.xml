having an antenna and an IC chip electrically connected to the antenna is increasing. Manufacturing of an inlay involves a process of placing a supplied IC chip on an antenna that is formed on a base material. The IC chip is placed at a predetermined reference position on an antenna, which is a reference for mounting the IC chip. In order to place the IC chip accurately at the reference position on an antenna in the process, it is known to correct a position of the IC chip (for example, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-123406).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-123406 discloses a mounting apparatus comprised of a stage in which a synchronization roller, which sucks and holds an IC chip, is moved from front to back and from side to side, with respect to a film base plate.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the mounting apparatus disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2008-123406 merely moves the synchronization roller from front to back and from side to side (namely, X-axis and Y-axis), and thus the mounting apparatus has a limitation to place an IC chip on the antenna even more accurately.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of this, an object of one aspect of the present invention is to improve accuracy in a position on which an IC chip is mounted, when an IC chip is mounted in an inlay manufacturing process.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An embodiment of the present invention is an IC chip mounting apparatus for mounting an IC chip at a reference position of an inlay antenna while conveying the antenna, the IC chip mounting apparatus including: a nozzle configured to suck an IC chip when located at a first position and to place the IC chip at the reference position of the antenna when located at a second position; a nozzle attachment to which the nozzle is attached; a first rotating unit configured to rotate the nozzle around an axis; a second rotating unit configured to rotate the nozzle attachment so that the nozzle moves from the first position to the second position; a moving machine configured to move the nozzle; an image acquisition unit configured to acquire an image of the IC chip sucked by the nozzle, when the nozzle is located at a position between the first position and the second position; and a correction amount determination unit configured to determine correction amounts for the IC chip sucked by the nozzle, based on the image acquired by the image acquisition unit. The correction amounts includes: a first correction amount for correcting an angle of the nozzle around the axis, a second correction amount for correcting a position of the antenna in a conveying direction of the antenna, and a third correction amount for correcting the position of the antenna in a width direction. The first rotating unit is configured to rotate the nozzle around the axis based on the first correction amount.
