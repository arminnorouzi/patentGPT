num="0001">Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 119 (a), this application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0087939, filed on Jul. 5, 2021, the contents of which are all hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to footwear, and more particularly to footwear capable of reducing strain on joints of feet during walking.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, footwear refers to things that people wear on their feet when standing or walking on the ground. The footwear includes a cushion for foot health. The footwear with the cushion is also beneficial to a wearer's knee and back.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The conventional technology of the footwear has already been disclosed in Korean Patent Publication No. 2013-0071160. This invention is to keep a foot healthy by providing a multilayered cushion in a lower portion of a shoe.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the shoe with the cushion cannot avoid thickening of a sole. Further, the cushion lacks elasticity in a horizontal direction for the sake of elasticity in a vertical direction, and thus causes a problem that the sole is not bent well. When a wearer walks, a metatarsophalangeal joint area gets bent a lot. In particular, when a wearer does a vigorous exercise such as running, the metatarsophalangeal joint area gets bent more.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> illustrates walking with the shoe and barefoot walking. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the walking with the shoe is different from the barefoot walking if the sole of the shoe is not bent.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In particular, if the sole of the shoe is thick and is less elastic in the horizontal direction, more power is needed and joints are strained to fold the metatarsophalangeal joint area. To solve this, there has been released a product which is hollow or has a corrugated sole so that the shoe can be readily bent. However, the released products still have problems that power is needed to bend the metatarsophalangeal joint area and inconvenience is caused by tripping over a step, etc. or catching foreign materials therein even though the shoe is relatively easily bent.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An aspect of the disclosure is to provide footwear, in which a cushion layer is effectively bent even though an outsole of footwear has a thick cushion layer to distribute weight, thereby putting no stain on movement during walking.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an embodiment of the disclosure, there is provided footwear including: uppers provided to surround at least a certain region of a wearer's foot; a supporter disposed below the uppers and supporting the foot; and a walking assister provided in the supporter, adjacent to a metatarsophalangeal joint area of the foot, and generating elasticity in a walking direction of the wearer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The walking assister may be compressed in mid-stance motion of the wearer, and restored in toe-off motion of the wearer.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The walking assister may include a plurality of walking assisters provided below the metatarsophalangeal joint, and the metatarsophalangeal joint may be positioned between the plurality of walking assisters.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The walking assister may be formed as a single body below the metatarsophalangeal joint.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The supporter may include a mounting groove formed to cross the supporter in a widthwise direction of the supporter, and the walking assister may be mounted to the mounting groove.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The walking assister may be provided to cross the supporter in the widthwise direction of the supporter, and formed to have a trapezoidal cross-section in the lengthwise direction of the supporter.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The walking assister may include a material of which elasticity is high in the walking direction of the wearer.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The walking assister may be shaped like a torsion spring.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The mounting groove may be shaped to taper upward in its cross-section in the lengthwise direction of the supporter.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The walking the supporter may include: a first frame area disposed to be adjacent to a front region of the mounting groove; a second frame area disposed to be adjacent to a back region of the mounting groove; and an elastic area connecting the first and second frame areas and generating elasticity between the first and second frame areas.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The walking assister may assist the supporter in ordinarily bending a front region upward an angle of 10&#x2dc;40&#xb0; with respect to the metatarsophalangeal joint, and generate elasticity when the supporter is compressed by external force while touching the ground and then taken off the ground.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The supporter may include an outsole disposed below the uppers; and a midsole disposed between the uppers and the outsole, and the walking assister may be provided in the outsole or both the outsole and the midsole.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The walking assister may include a first assister disposed frontward with reference to the metatarsophalangeal joint; and a second assister disposed backward with reference to the metatarsophalangeal joint, wherein the first assister and the second assister are different in angle at which the supporter is bent during the walking of the wearer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The first assister may allow the front region of the supporter to be bent at an angle of 15&#x2dc;25&#xb0;, and the second assister may allow the back region of the supporter to be bent at an angle of 45&#x2dc;65&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The first and second assisters may be formed with a bottom side longer than a top side.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The bottom side of the first assister may be lengthened in a frontward direction, and the bottom side of the second assister may be lengthened in a backward direction.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The foregoing technical effects of the disclosure are not limited to the effects mentioned above, and other unmentioned technical effects will become apparent to those skilled in the art by the following descriptions</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The above and/or other aspects will become apparent and more readily appreciated from the following description of embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a lateral view of footwear according to a first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a bottom view of the footwear according to the first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a structure of a general foot;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> to <b>6</b></figref> illustrate possible diseases in a metatarsophalangeal joint;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates motion of a foot in general walking motion;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates joints of foot in a normal condition;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates mid stance motion of the footwear according to the first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates toe-off motion of the footwear according to the first embodiment;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a lateral view of footwear according to the second embodiment;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates a walking assister in the footwear according to the second embodiment;</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> illustrates mid stance motion of the footwear according to the second embodiment;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates toe-off motion of the footwear according to the second embodiment;

However, embodiments are not limited to the following embodiments set forth herein, but may be implemented in various forms. The following embodiments are provided in order to fully describe the disclosure and enable those skilled in the art to understand the scope of the disclosure. In the drawings, the shapes, etc. of the elements may be exaggerated for clearer description, and like numerals refer to like elements.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a lateral view of footwear according to a first embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a bottom view of the footwear according to the first embodiment. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a structure of a general foot.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, footwear <b>1000</b> according to the first embodiment includes an elastic walking assister <b>100</b> in supporters <b>1200</b> and <b>1300</b> forming a lower region. Thus, the footwear <b>1000</b> puts no strain on a wearer's movement during walking.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In general, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> to <b>6</b></figref>, a metatarsophalangeal joint in a body structure serves to connect a metatarsal bone and a phalange. In other words, the metatarsophalangeal joint is a part on which a lot of weight is put and which is bent and stressed the most in the foot during walking. Therefore, the metatarsophalangeal joint and its surrounding regions are vulnerable to arthritis, metatarsalgia, interdigital neuralgia, Morton's neuroma, hallux valgus, and the like diseases.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Thus, the supporters <b>1200</b> and <b>1300</b> of the footwear <b>1000</b> are required to have a thick cushion layer for weight distribution and be effectively bent in a region adjacent to the metatarsophalangeal joint.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, during walking, motion of the foot is divided into phases of heel strike&#x2014;mid stance&#x2014;toe-off. Referring to the motion of the foot during the walking, it is seen that the most bending part in the motion of the foot during the walking is a metatarsophalangeal joint area in the toe-off phase. The metatarsophalangeal joint is an area that consumes the highest energy in the toe-off phase of lifting a heel and moving forward by giving strength to toes.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, to solve the foregoing problems, the footwear <b>1000</b> according to the first embodiment may include uppers <b>1100</b>, a midsole <b>1200</b>, an outsole <b>1300</b>, and the walking assister <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The uppers <b>1100</b> may have various shapes according to the kinds of footwear <b>1000</b>. For example, the uppers <b>1100</b> form an overall upper region of the footwear <b>1000</b> and serve to protect a wearer's foot. Further, the midsole <b>1200</b> is interposed between the uppers <b>1100</b> and the outsole <b>1300</b> and provides cushioning. Further, the outsole <b>1300</b> is placed beneath the midsole <b>1200</b>, and strikes the ground. Here, the midsole <b>1200</b> and the outsole <b>1300</b> are provided to form the supporters <b>1200</b> and <b>1300</b> of the footwear <b>1000</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Meanwhile, the walking assister <b>100</b> is provided as an elastic body.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, the walking assister <b>100</b> may be made of a material of which elasticity is high in a horizontal direction, i.e., in a lengthwise direction of the footwear <b>1000</b>. The walking assister <b>100</b> may be provided in the outsole <b>1300</b> or in both the outsole <b>1300</b> and the midsole <b>1200</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">For example, the walking assisters <b>100</b> are placed to be adjacent to the metatarsophalangeal joint, and form a pair below the metatarsophalangeal joint so that the metatarsophalangeal joint can be positioned between the pair of walking assisters <b>100</b>. Further, the walking assisters <b>100</b> may be provided as a single body and placed below the metatarsophalangeal joint. However, this is merely to describe this embodiment, and at least one walking assister <b>100</b> or two or more multiple walking assisters <b>100</b> may be provided.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further, the walking assisters <b>100</b> may be mounted to cross the outsole <b>1300</b> or to cross the outsole <b>1300</b> and the midsole <b>1200</b> in a widthwise direction of the footwear <b>1000</b>. However, this is merely to describe this embodiment, and at least an area of the walking assister <b>100</b> may be surrounded by the midsole <b>1200</b> or the outsole <b>1300</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, the walking assister <b>100</b> may be formed with a bottom side longer than a top side. For example, the walking assister <b>100</b> may be formed to have a trapezoidal cross-section in the lengthwise direction of the footwear <b>1000</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Thus, a front region of the footwear <b>1000</b> is provided to face upward at an angle of 10&#x2dc;40&#xb0; by the walking assister <b>100</b>. In other words, the walking assister <b>100</b> having the trapezoidal cross-section in the lengthwise direction may bend a toe-side region of the footwear <b>1000</b> upward as compared with that of the conventional footwear. Therefore, toes of a wearer who wears the footwear <b>1000</b> are oriented upward.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Meanwhile, the walking assister <b>100</b> may include a first assister <b>110</b> disposed forward in with respect to the metatarsophalangeal joint, and a second assister <b>120</b> disposed backward with respect to the metatarsophalangeal joint.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In this case, the first assister <b>110</b> and the second assister <b>120</b> may be different in angle at which the outsole is bent. For example, a degree of bending the outsole <b>1300</b> may be varied depending on the use of the footwear <b>1000</b>. When the outsole <b>1300</b> is bent at an angle of 60&#x2dc;90&#xb0;, the first assister <b>110</b> allows the front region of the outsole to be bent at an angle of 15&#x2dc;25&#xb0; and the second assister <b>120</b> allows the back region of the outsole to be bent at an angle of 45&#x2dc;65&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Further, the first assister <b>110</b> and the second assister <b>120</b> may have the bottom sides longer than the top sides so as to smoothly assist walking when the outsole <b>1300</b> is bent. In this case, the bottom side of the first assister <b>110</b> may be lengthened in the frontward direction, and the bottom side of the second assister <b>120</b> may be lengthened in the backward direction. Therefore, the first assister <b>110</b> assists the front region of the outsole <b>1300</b> in being more easily stretched and bent, and the second assister <b>120</b> assists the back region of the outsole <b>1300</b> in being more easily stretched and bent.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, toes of a human basically face upward as the metatarsophalangeal joint is bent. Thus, a wearer's toes face upward while wearing the footwear, thereby maintaining the foot comfortable.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Further, even when a wearer is in a driving or sitting position, dorsal flexion where the wearer's toes are bent toward the dorsum of the foot is maintained. Thus, a wearer's toes are oriented upward when wearing the footwear <b>1000</b>, thereby maintaining the foot comfortable even in a driving or sitting position.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In this way, the walking assister <b>100</b> assists a part of the foot, which is bent the most, i.e., a metatarsophalangeal joint area, i.e., in being easily bent. Further, the walking assister <b>100</b> uses elasticity to assist motion of lifting the heel of the foot in the toe-off phase where the highest energy is consumed.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In other words, conventional footwear requires power for bending a lower region of the footwear when the metatarsophalangeal joint area is bent in the toe-off phase.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">On the other hand, the footwear <b>1000</b> according to the first embodiment includes the walking assister <b>100</b> so that the supporters <b>1200</b> and <b>1300</b> of the footwear <b>1000</b> can be easily bent, thereby reducing energy consumed during the walking. Accordingly, the footwear <b>1000</b> needs less force for the joints and their surroundings and the foot is not strained, thereby having effects on preventing various possible diseases in the foot.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Below, motion of a foot wearing the footwear during walking will be described. However, repetitive descriptions will be avoided, and like numerals refer to like elements throughout.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates mid stance motion of the footwear according to the first embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates toe-off motion of the footwear according to the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, a toe portion of the footwear <b>1000</b> according to the first embodiment is bent upward. Further, toes and a foot arch are kept parallel to the ground by the wearer's weight in mid-stance motion of putting a foot on the ground. In this case, the supporters <b>1200</b> and <b>1300</b> of the footwear <b>1000</b> are also kept parallel to the ground, and therefore the supporters <b>1200</b> and <b>1300</b> of the walking assister <b>100</b> are contracted. Thus, the walking assister <b>100</b> are urged to return to its original shape by elasticity in the horizontal direction.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Then, a gait is switched over from the mid stance phase to the toe-off phase. Thus, when a wearer first lifts the heel, the walking assister <b>100</b> assists the wearer's metatarsophalangeal joint in being easily bent as the contracted lower region returns to its original shape. In addition, the walking assister <b>100</b> assists the heel in being lifted. Because the metatarsophalangeal joint is easily bent, the stress on the metatarsophalangeal joint is relieved to thereby prevent metatarsophalangeal arthralgia, interdigital neuralgia, etc. Further, there is an advantage of reducing overall energy consumption during walking.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Below, footwear according to a second embodiment will be described in detail.
