The difficulty of a DRAM process is related to a size. The smaller the size, the greater the difficulty. In the future, a DRAM process technology may be around 10 nm to 15 nm, which is very strict on the electrical performance of products. A buried gate is used in an active region of the DRAM. The buried gate is generally small in size. The smaller the size is, the easier a short-channel effect may appear.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When a length of a conductive channel of a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor is reduced to a dozen of nanometers or even several nanometers, a threshold voltage of a transistor may decrease.
