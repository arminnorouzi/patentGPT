Alternatively, the predetermined time may be set on the basis of a history information, wherein a time from the start of the running until the abnormality begins to appear in the physical condition of the occupant is stored as the history information.

Alternatively, a driving route suitable to take the measure may be displayed in conjunction with a navigation apparatus. Specifically, a choice of whether or not to the occupant needs a motion sickness pill may be displayed and the occupant's reply may be accepted (an inquiry may be made by audio and the occupant's reply may be accepted by voice recognition), and when the occupant replies that he or she needs it, a driving route to a nearby pharmacy may be displayed.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">One of the causes of the motion sickness is that the occupant other than the driver cannot predict the behavior of the vehicle <b>10</b>. As a measure for such a cause, when there is an occupant who has a motion sickness, a display or a voice guidance related to the behavior of the vehicle <b>10</b> may be provided. For example, on the basis of information about a driving road, in which direction and in how many seconds the vehicle <b>10</b> turns may be voice-guided. Alternatively, in which direction the vehicle <b>10</b> turns or in how many seconds the vehicle <b>10</b> moves may be displayed on the display unit <b>301</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the icon of the occupant displayed in the occupant information display area varies depending on the degree of the motion sickness. For example, in Example 1, an expression of the icon varies depending on the degree of the motion sickness. In Example 2, brightness and color of the icon varies depending on the degree of the motion sickness. When changing the color of the icon, it is preferable to adopt a color from which emergency can be intuitively grasped. Specifically, it may be changed to &#x201c;green&#x201d; when the degree of the motion sickness is slight, to &#x201c;yellow&#x201d; when the degree of the motion sickness is moderate, and to &#x201c;red&#x201d; when the degree is severe. Although an example of changing the icon in three stages is illustrated here, the number of types of the icon may be increased or reduced in accordance with the degree, such as, for example, in five stages.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the cause/measure information display area may be icon-displayed.
