More particularly, but not exclusively, the present disclosure is directed to stabilization system, an implant, and methods for preventing relative motion between a first bone and a second bone, for example, an ilium and a sacrum defining a sacroiliac (SI) joint during minimally invasive surgery.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A number of different medical procedures involve securing sections of tissue. For example, for an individual to receive relief from pain in the pelvic region or lower back, a recognized treatment is to perform SI joint fusion in which the sacrum is fixed to the ilium. Another situation when it is indicated to secure two sections of tissue is fixation of a fractured bone. Still further, spinal fusion including fixation of adjacent vertebrae is also a procedure of particular interest.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Securing adjacent sections of bone (or two adjacent bones) may include drilling a bore that at least partially extends through each of the adjacent sections of the bone. An elongated implant is seated and secured within the bore. A portion of the implant is positioned in one of the sections of the bone (e.g., a first bone), and another portion of the implant is positioned within another section of the bone (e.g., a second bone). The implant, and sometimes plural implants, prevents movement of the sections of the bone. The adjacent surfaces of the sections of the bone may fuse together to form a single bone. The fusion increases the strength of the bond between the two sections of bone.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Known systems and methods of securing sections of tissue are associated with several disadvantages. For example, eliminating relative movement between the sections of the bone often requires the implant to be relatively large in size to ensure adequate contact area between the implant and the sections of the bone. It readily follows that a relatively larger implant requires a commensurately larger incision. The invasiveness of the larger incision may lead to increased healing time and risk of infection.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there is a need in the art for a stabilization system and an implant for the stabilization system designed to overcome one or more of the aforementioned disadvantages</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">One aspect of the present disclosure is directed toward an implant for a minimally invasive bone stabilization system for preventing relative motion between an ilium and a sacrum. The implant comprises an elongate trunk defined between a proximal end configured to be positioned within the ilium, a distal end configured to be positioned within the sacrum. The elongate trunk extends between the ilium and the sacrum. A bore extends through the elongate trunk. A longitudinal axis may be defined between the proximal and distal ends, and a periphery may be defined by an outer surface of the elongate trunk. The implant further comprises a proximal anchor comprising at least one deformable feature. The deformable feature is adapted to move between an initial configuration in which the deformable feature is within the periphery of the elongate trunk, and a deployed configuration in which at least a portion of the deformable feature extends outwardly beyond the periphery of the elongate trunk relative to the longitudinal axis to engage the ilium. Additionally, the implant comprises a distal anchor coupled to the elongate trunk. The distal anchor comprising an expandable member defining an interior in fluid communication with the bore of the elongate trunk. The expandable member is adapted to receive curable material to move between a collapsed state in which the expandable member is within the periphery of the elongate trunk, and an expanded state in which at least a portion of the expandable member extends outwardly beyond the periphery of the elongate trunk relative to the longitudinal axis to engage the sacrum.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to certain aspects of the present disclosure, the implant comprises a stem extending proximally from the proximal end of the elongate trunk. The stem comprises driven features configured to engage complimentary drive features of an insertion tool. The proximal anchor comprises engagement features coupled to the elongate trunk and configured to engage complimentary engagement features of the insertion tool. The deformable features may be circumferentially arranged about the outer surface of the elongate trunk. The deformable features are adapted to buckle in response to compressive loads applied to the proximal anchor such that at least a portion of the deformable features extend beyond the periphery of the elongate trunk relative to the longitudinal axis to engage the ilium.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to certain aspects of the present disclosure, the minimally invasive bone stabilization system includes the insertion tool comprising a driver configured to receive a rotational input, a first shaft comprising a distal end and engagement features at the distal end, a second shaft coaxially arranged within the first shaft. The second shaft includes a proximal end coupled to the driver, a distal end opposite the proximal end, drive features near the distal end, and a lumen extending through the second shaft.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A method for preventing relative motion between the ilium and the sacrum with the implant is also disclosed. The method comprises the steps of creating a minimally invasive incision within skin. An access cannula is positioned through the minimally invasive incision. A borehole is resected through the ilium and into the sacrum through the access cannula. The implant is positioned within the borehole such that the proximal anchor is disposed in the ilium and the distal anchor is disposed in the sacrum. The insertion tool removably coupled to the implant is operated to apply a compressive force to the proximal anchor along the longitudinal axis. The proximal anchor moves from the initial configuration in which the proximal anchor is within the periphery of the elongate trunk, to the deployed configuration in which at least a portion of the deformable feature of the proximal anchor extends outwardly beyond the periphery of the elongate trunk relative to the longitudinal axis to engage the ilium. Curable material is injected through the bore and into the expandable member to move the expandable member between the collapsed state in which the expandable member is within the periphery of the elongate trunk, and the expanded state in which at least a portion of the expandable member extends outwardly beyond the periphery of the elongate trunk relative to the longitudinal axis to engage the sacrum</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The disclosure is pointed out with particularity in the claims.

The trunk <b>90</b> is defined between a proximal end <b>302</b> configured to be positioned within the first tissue section <b>122</b> and a distal end <b>304</b> configured to be positioned within the second tissue section <b>124</b>. The trunk <b>90</b> extends between the first tissue section <b>122</b> and the second tissue section <b>124</b>. A proximal anchor <b>86</b> is located proximally from the proximal end <b>302</b> of trunk <b>90</b>, and a distal anchor <b>106</b> is located distally to the distal end <b>304</b> of the trunk <b>90</b>. (&#x201c;Proximal&#x201d; is understood to mean towards the practitioner, away from the site in which the implant <b>76</b> is to be seated; and &#x201c;distal&#x201d; is understood to mean away from the practitioner holding the tool <b>30</b>, towards the site in which the implant <b>76</b> is to be seated.) In a manner to be described, the tool <b>30</b> is used to deploy the proximal anchor <b>86</b>, and in certain embodiments the distal anchor <b>106</b>. Once the proximal and distal anchors <b>86</b>, <b>106</b> are deployed, the implant <b>76</b> secures the first and second tissue sections <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The implant <b>76</b> is shaped so that trunk <b>90</b> is elongate in shape. The trunk <b>90</b> includes a periphery <b>306</b> defined by an outer surface <b>308</b> of the trunk <b>90</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the trunk <b>90</b> is cylindrical and has a length defined between the proximal and distal ends <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> and a diameter defined by the periphery <b>306</b>. In other words, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows the outer surface <b>308</b> extending circumferentially to define the periphery <b>306</b>. The proximal anchor <b>86</b> may be a tubular shaped structure that extends proximally from the proximal end <b>302</b> of trunk <b>90</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, at least a portion of the proximal anchor <b>86</b> is formed integrally with the trunk <b>90</b>. The proximal anchor <b>86</b> comprises at least one deformable feature <b>310</b> that is, at least initially, within the periphery <b>306</b> of the trunk <b>90</b>. In certain embodiments, the implant <b>76</b> is shaped so that the outer diameter of proximal anchor <b>86</b> and the periphery <b>306</b> of the trunk <b>90</b> are initially equal. The deformable feature <b>310</b> of the proximal anchor <b>86</b> is adapted to move between an initial configuration (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>) in which the deformable feature <b>310</b> is within the periphery <b>306</b> of the trunk <b>90</b>, and a deployed configuration (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>) in which at least a portion of the deformable feature <b>310</b> extends outwardly beyond the periphery <b>306</b> relative to the longitudinal axis <b>300</b> to engage the first tissue section <b>122</b>, e.g., the ilium. The distal anchor <b>106</b> is coupled to the trunk <b>90</b> and comprises an expandable member <b>312</b>. The expandable member <b>312</b> is adapted to receive injectable material to move between a collapsed state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>) in which the expandable member <b>312</b> is within the periphery <b>306</b> of the trunk <b>90</b>, and an expanded state (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>) in which at least a portion of the expandable member <b>312</b> extends outwardly beyond the periphery <b>306</b> of the trunk <b>90</b> relative to the longitudinal axis <b>300</b> to engage the second tissue section <b>124</b>; e.g., the sacrum. Thus, prior to positioning the implant <b>76</b> within the patient, the proximal and distal anchors <b>86</b>, <b>106</b> are within the periphery <b>306</b> to minimize the axial profile of the implant <b>76</b> and facilitate surgery that is less or minimally invasive. Relative to known system with diameters of 10, 12 or greater millimeters (mm) (and/or requiring the use of a tissue dilator), the implant <b>76</b> of the present disclosure advantageously has smaller diameters that provides for percutaneous placement through a minimally invasive incision. Exemplary diameters of the implant <b>76</b> include less than 10 mm, and more particularly less than 7 mm, and even more particularly less than 4 mm. Further, the component of tool <b>30</b> used to position the implant <b>76</b> need not require a diameter larger than that of the implant <b>76</b> itself. Consequently, the relatively smaller incision and borehole exposes the patient to less trauma.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As used herein, injectable material may include any material suitable for injection into the patient for use with the stabilization system and/or as part of the methods disclosed herein. The injectable material may include a curable material, for example, a biocompatible curable material (bone cement). Exemplary curable materials include non-resorbable curable materials such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) or glass ionomer cements, or resorbable material such as calcium phosphate. The injectable material may include a bone growth material (e.g., autograft bone, allograph bone, and/or synthetic material that fosters bone growth). The injectable material may include therapeutic agents, for example, a pharmacologic that reduces infection or tissue inflammation). Other injectable materials suitable with the present system and methods are contemplated, and it is also understood that combinations of the aforementioned injectable materials may be utilized (e.g., calcium phosphate with demineralized bone matrix and bioglass). In alternative embodiments, the material received within the interior <b>314</b> of the expandable member <b>312</b> is not injected, but rather packed with a tamp or otherwise provided in a suitable manner.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, the proximal anchor <b>86</b> includes a plurality of apertures <b>104</b>.

In other words, the outer surfaces <b>308</b>, <b>309</b> may be a singular, continuous structure, as shown, but are separately identified to delineate the portion of the outer surface defining the proximal anchor <b>86</b>. The apertures <b>104</b> define a deformable feature <b>310</b> interposed between each adjacent pair of apertures <b>104</b>. Each of the apertures <b>104</b> may be oval in shape and comprise a major axis <b>316</b> and a minor axis <b>318</b>.

In a manner to be described, the apertures <b>104</b> are configured to localize stresses to the deformable feature <b>310</b> from compressive loads applied to the proximal anchor <b>86</b> to induce deformation of the deformable feature <b>310</b> and move the deformable feature <b>310</b> from the initial configuration to the deployed configuration. Each of the deformable features define a width, where the width is smallest at a position between the minor axes <b>318</b> of adjacent pairs of apertures <b>104</b> such that the localized stresses induce buckling to the deformable features <b>310</b> at the widths. In another exemplary embodiment, a plurality of slots (not shown) may be circumferentially arranged and spaced apart from each other on the outer surface <b>309</b> of the proximal anchor <b>86</b>. The slots define the deformable feature <b>310</b> interposed between each adjacent pair of the slots with the deformable feature <b>310</b> being strut-like in shape. The localized stresses induce bowing of the struts with each of the bowed struts including an apex in the deployed configuration with the apex extending beyond the periphery <b>306</b> of the trunk <b>90</b> relative to the longitudinal axis <b>300</b>. In still another exemplary embodiment, the proximal anchor <b>86</b> may take the appearance of an annular cage in at least some respects similar to a cardiovascular stent. The annular cage include a grid-like pattern of structural members (i.e., the deformable features <b>310</b>) with interstitial spaces (i.e., the apertures <b>104</b>). The cage is configured to deform, deflect, buckle, bow, and/or otherwise deform in response to the compressive loads applied to the proximal anchor <b>86</b> such that at least a portion of the cage extends beyond the periphery <b>306</b> of the trunk <b>90</b> relative to the longitudinal axis <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">For still another example, the proximal anchor <b>86</b> may include opposing wings configured to deflect outwardly in response to the screw-like member being axially advanced on contact with the opposing wings. It is to be understood that deformation may include deflection of at least a portion of the proximal anchor <b>86</b>. For still yet another example, the proximal anchor <b>86</b> may include a scissor-like jack having two opposing surfaces configured to move in opposite directions in response to the screw-like member being axially advanced.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The proximal end of proximal anchor <b>86</b> may be castellated.

The knob <b>54</b> is rotated to cause the like rotation of drive shaft <b>60</b>. The rotation of the drive shaft <b>60</b> causes the threading <b>64</b> to engage the threading <b>89</b> coupled to the stem <b>88</b>. The implant <b>76</b> is threaded onto drive shaft <b>60</b> until the teeth <b>81</b> of the cap <b>78</b> engage the complementary teeth <b>47</b> integral with tool <b>30</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>.

The delivery cannula <b>68</b> is optionally preloaded loaded with the injectable material. The cannula <b>68</b> is fitted in the lumen <b>62</b> so the distal end of the cannula <b>68</b> seats in counterbore <b>98</b> internal to the implant <b>76</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The tool <b>30</b> is used to position the implant <b>76</b> within the borehole <b>126</b>. In certain embodiments, the tool <b>30</b> directs the implant <b>76</b> through the access cannula <b>354</b> and into the borehole <b>126</b>. The implant <b>76</b> may be positioned such that the proximal anchor <b>86</b> is located inward of the boundary <b>123</b> between the cortical and cancellous layers of the first tissue section <b>122</b>, and distal anchor <b>106</b> is located in the second tissue section <b>124</b>, for example, within the cavity <b>128</b>. In embodiments utilizing the guidewire (with the access cannula <b>354</b> removed), the tool <b>30</b> and the implant <b>76</b> are cannulated so as to slidably receive the guidewire. The tool <b>30</b> and the implant <b>76</b> are directed through the incision <b>350</b> and the overlying tissue while constrained by the guidewire.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The proximal anchor <b>86</b> is deployed by actuating the driver <b>52</b>. The driver <b>52</b> is actuated by rotating knob <b>54</b>, and the rotation of knob <b>54</b> results in a like rotation of drive shaft <b>60</b>. It is understood that, at this time, implant <b>76</b> is blocked from rotation relative to tool <b>30</b>, and the stem <b>88</b> is threadably engaging the drive shaft <b>60</b>. Accordingly, the rotation of drive shaft <b>60</b> draws the stem <b>88</b> proximally and, by extension, an entirety of the implant <b>76</b> moves proximally relative to the tool <b>30</b>. With movement of the cap <b>78</b> blocked by the abutment of the cap <b>78</b> against the distal end of shaft <b>46</b>, the proximal anchor <b>86</b> is compressed between cap <b>78</b> and trunk <b>90</b> of the implant <b>76</b>. Owing to the presence of apertures <b>104</b> localizing compressive stresses, the deformable features <b>310</b> of the proximal anchor <b>86</b> is relatively mechanically weak. In other words, in response to longitudinally compressive forces, the deformable features <b>310</b> of the proximal anchor <b>86</b>, in comparison to other sections of the implant <b>76</b>, are less able to resist buckling. Accordingly, in response to the longitudinally compressive force placed on anchor <b>86</b>, the deformable features <b>310</b> buckle outwardly. The deformable features <b>310</b> are adapted to buckle into two buckled sections separated by an elbow that projects radially outwardly beyond the periphery <b>306</b> of trunk <b>90</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>. As a result of this buckling, the buckled sections and the elbow of the anchor <b>86</b> penetrate into the first tissue section <b>122</b> surrounding borehole <b>126</b>. The penetration of the deployed anchor <b>86</b> into the surrounding tissue prevents movement of the implant <b>76</b> relative to the first tissue section <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The distal anchor <b>106</b> is deployed. It is understood the deploying of the distal anchor <b>106</b> may occur before or after deploying of the proximal anchor <b>86</b>. The deploying of the distal anchor <b>106</b> may include expanding the expandable member <b>312</b> with the injectable material. In one example, a stylet (not shown) is inserted into the lumen <b>62</b> to urge the injectable material preloaded into the delivery cannula <b>68</b> to flow through bore <b>102</b> internal to the implant <b>76</b> and into the expandable member <b>312</b>. The injectable material is discharged from the open end of bore <b>102</b> in into the interior <b>314</b> of the expandable member <b>312</b>. The injectable material expands the expandable member <b>312</b> from the collapsed state from which the expandable member <b>312</b> is within the periphery <b>306</b> of the trunk <b>90</b>, the expanded state in which at least a portion of the expandable member <b>312</b> extend outwardly beyond the periphery <b>306</b> of the trunk <b>90</b> relative to the longitudinal axis <b>300</b>. The expandable member <b>312</b> contacts and engages the second tissue section <b>124</b>. The expandable member <b>312</b> may compress the surrounding tissue against which the expandable member <b>312</b>. In embodiments utilizing the guidewire (with the access cannula <b>354</b> removed), the distal anchor <b>106</b> cannulated so as to slidably receive the guidewire. For example, the expandable member <b>312</b> of the distal anchor <b>106</b> may be, for example, a torus or toroid defining an inner passageway through the expandable member <b>312</b>. A suitable structure may be coupled to the implant <b>76</b> to axially support the toroidal expandable member at its distal end. For example, the neck <b>92</b> (or an additional neck) may extend through substantially an entirely of a length of the toroidal expandable member. In such an example, the inner passageway is sized to slidably receive the guidewire such that, as the tool <b>30</b> and the implant <b>76</b> are directed through the incision <b>350</b>, the guidewire is disposed within the inner passageway of the expandable member <b>312</b> prior to injecting the injectable material into the interior <b>314</b> of the expandable member <b>312</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In embodiments where the injectable material is curable material, the curable material may be permitted to cure or harden, resulting in a mass <b>130</b> of cured material, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, extending outwardly from and around the head <b>94</b> of the implant <b>76</b>. Further, the curable material hardens around the ribs <b>96</b> integral with head <b>94</b> and neck <b>92</b>. The hardening of the curable material around the ribs <b>96</b> reduces the likelihood that, should the implant <b>76</b> and tissue section <b>124</b> be subjected to axial loads, the implant <b>76</b> will work free from the hardened mass <b>130</b> (e.g., &#x201c;pull out&#x201d;). The mass <b>130</b> and the expandable member <b>312</b> prevent movement of the implant <b>76</b> relative to the second tissue section <b>124</b>. When the proximal and distal anchors <b>86</b> and <b>106</b> engaging the first and second tissue sections <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, respectively, relative movement between the tissue sections <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> is prevented.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Once the implant <b>76</b> is deployed, driver <b>52</b> is actuated to disconnect the tool <b>30</b> from the implant <b>76</b>. The knob <b>54</b> is rotated in the direction opposite the direction in which the knob <b>54</b> is rotated to deploy the proximal anchor <b>86</b>. At this time, the proximal and distal anchors <b>86</b>, <b>106</b> constrain the implant <b>76</b> from movement relative to the tissue sections <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>. Accordingly, as a result of the rotation of drive shaft <b>60</b>, the drive shaft <b>60</b> rotates proximally away from the stem <b>88</b>. Since the drive shaft <b>60</b> does not move longitudinally relative to the rest of the tool <b>30</b>, the proximal movement of the tool <b>30</b> separates the tool from the implant <b>76</b>.

In embodiments where the injectable material is curable material, the curable material is permitted to cure within the interior <b>314</b> of the expandable member <b>312</b> with the expandable member <b>312</b> engaging the sacrum <b>124</b>. Additionally, the curable material injected into the interior <b>314</b> of the expandable member <b>312</b> surrounds the neck <b>92</b> and is in contact with the rib <b>96</b>. The curable material is permitted to cure in contact with the rib <b>96</b> to facilitate axial retention of the implant <b>76</b> within the cured curable material.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments of the method, the expandable member <b>312</b> comprises fenestrations <b>178</b>. In this embodiment the method further comprises a step of injecting additional curable material into the interior <b>314</b> of the expandable member <b>312</b> such that a portion of the curable material is urged through the fenestrations <b>178</b> and into contact with the sacrum <b>124</b>. In another embodiment of the method, the expandable member <b>312</b> is formed from a permeable material. In this embodiment the method further comprises a step of injecting additional curable material into the interior <b>314</b> of the expandable member <b>312</b> such that a portion of the curable material is urged through the permeable material and into contact with the sacrum <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments of the method, multiple implants <b>76</b> may be implanted into a patient. As mentioned above, each implant <b>76</b> may have as dedicated tool <b>30</b>, or a single tool <b>30</b> may be used to insert multiple implants <b>76</b>. The method further comprises the step of decoupling the tool <b>30</b> from a first implant, and removably coupling the tool <b>30</b> to a second implant. With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the second implant is then inserted through a second minimally invasive incision and within a second borehole with a proximal anchor of the second implant engaging the ilium <b>122</b> and a distal anchor of the second implant disposed in the sacrum <b>124</b>. The proximal anchor of the second implant is then deployed in a manner substantially the same as the first implant. Prior to both the first implant and second implant receiving the injectable material, the second implant is decoupled from the distal end of the shaft <b>46</b> of the installation tool <b>30</b> with a second delivery cannula remaining coupled to the second implant positioned within the second borehole. The delivery cannulas coupled to the first and second implants extend through the first and second minimally invasive incisions, respectively. The injectable material is then injected into each delivery cannula to expand the expandable member of the first implant and the second implant.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">After expanding the expandable member <b>312</b> of the one or more implants <b>76</b> outwardly to engage the sacrum <b>124</b>, the delivery cannula <b>68</b> and the access cannula <b>354</b> are each removed through the minimally invasive incision <b>350</b>. Finally, the minimally invasive incision <b>350</b> is closed with the expandable member <b>312</b> and cured curable material remaining within the patient.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The foregoing is directed to specific versions of the disclosure. Other features of the stabilization system and/or the implant are contemplated. For example, the shapes of the components of the implant <b>76</b> may vary from what has been described. In alternative versions of the disclosure the trunk <b>90</b> may be non-circular in cross section. In some of these versions of the disclosure the trunk <b>90</b> may be formed so as to have straight edges that meet at corners. A benefit of providing the trunk <b>90</b> with non-circular cross-sectional shapes is that it can serve to limit the rotation of the implant <b>76</b> in the tissue in which the implant <b>76</b> is seated. In certain embodiments, certain structures of the implant <b>76</b> may be formed of unitary construction (e.g., the trunk <b>90</b> and the cap <b>78</b>). Likewise, for ease of manufacture, it may be desirable to form the trunk <b>90</b> out of coaxial inner and outer tubes. Further, in certain embodiments, the trunk <b>90</b> may be curved or angled along a curved longitudinal axis <b>300</b>. This feature may be useful to facilitate placement of the implant <b>76</b> or the mechanical properties of the implant <b>76</b>. In certain embodiments, one or both of the proximal and distal anchors <b>86</b>, <b>106</b>, may be configured to deploy asymmetrically. This would be particularly suitable for applications where space considerations are present in the intended area of the implant. Additionally or alternatively, the implant <b>76</b> may be configured to withstand asymmetric mechanical loading. In certain embodiments, the proximal and distal anchors <b>86</b>, <b>106</b> of the implant <b>76</b> of may be configured to be deployed either simultaneously or sequentially.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In certain embodiments, the proximal anchor <b>86</b> may not extend beyond the periphery <b>306</b> in the deployed configuration, and/or the distal anchor <b>106</b> may not extend beyond the periphery <b>306</b> in the expanded state. The deployed configuration and the expanded state may be alternatively defined as the proximal anchor <b>86</b> and the distal anchor <b>106</b>, respectively, simply moving radially outwardly from the longitudinal axis <b>300</b> of the trunk <b>90</b> (even if not beyond the periphery <b>306</b>).</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The proximal anchor <b>86</b> may be of any suitable construction. For example, a screw-like member may be provided with a threaded shaft having a pointed tip. The screw-type member is deployed by rotating the anchor so the shaft threads into the bone. The shaft threading engages the bone to secure the anchor and, by extension, the implant to the bone. For another example, one or more rigid pins may be provided to deploy by being forced outwardly from the trunk. Another alternative includes a spring that is under tension with the anchor deployed by releasing a member restraining the spring.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Likewise, the distal anchor <b>106</b> may be of any suitable construction. In certain embodiments, the expandable member <b>312</b> is formed from a non-compliant material that inflates to a defined shape. An example of a non-compliant material is a synthetic textile such as woven polyester fabric. An outer surface of the expandable member <b>312</b> may be impregnated with materials. One such material may be a material to encourage bone growth, and another material may include the therapeutic agent (e.g., a material that reduces the likelihood of infection). It should be understood that that the distal anchor may take the form of an outwardly buckling assembly and the proximal anchor take the form of an inflatable expandable member.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The tool <b>30</b> may include the additional and/or alternative components for deploying the implant <b>76</b>. These components may include solid shafts that are moved longitudinally relative to the tool handle <b>32</b>. Each shaft is advanced or retracted to deploy the anchor that the shaft engages. Likewise, other means than threading may be used to releasably hold the implant <b>76</b> to the tool <b>30</b>. For example, for some versions of the disclosure, the tool <b>30</b> may be formed with fingers that retract or contract. The implant <b>76</b> is formed with complementary openings for receiving the distally located tips of these fingers. Once the implant <b>76</b> is set the fingers are retracted or contracted away from the openings in which they are seated so as to disconnect the tool <b>30</b> from the implant <b>76</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The cannula (e.g., the delivery cannula <b>86</b> or the cannula <b>190</b>) itself may be comprised of a flexible material to allow the cannula to exit the opening and deliver injectable material distally of the implant <b>76</b> through that opening. For example, cannula may be comprised of a superelastic metallic material, such as nitinol, that possesses a preset curved shape that allows it to exit the opening in the implant <b>76</b> and deliver injectable material to a tissue location a certain distance away from the implant <b>76</b>. It is further contemplated that another instrument may be deployed through the bore <b>102</b>, for example, a curette that is used to form a cavity around the implant <b>76</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Variations in the above described exemplary methods are also contemplated. The borehole <b>126</b> in which the implant is fitted may have a diameter equal to or less than the diameter of the trunk <b>90</b> of the implant <b>76</b>. For example, the diameter of the borehole <b>126</b> is less than the diameter of the trunk <b>90</b>, by 1 mm or less. In such an example, there is a compression or interference fit between the trunk <b>90</b> and the tissue surrounding the trunk <b>90</b>. In certain methods, the tool <b>30</b> are arranged to hold the trunk <b>90</b> of the implant <b>76</b> static while the tool <b>30</b> is advanced distally (as opposed to retracted proximally) to provide the compressive force to induce buckling of the proximal anchor <b>86</b>. Further, it is also contemplated that the adjacent sections of soft tissue may be secured together. For example, the implant <b>76</b> may include one or more barbs.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The foregoing is directed to specific versions of the disclosure. Other versions of the disclosure may have different features. It should likewise be understood that not all versions of the disclosure may have each of the above described features. Likewise, the features of the different versions of the disclosure may be combined.
