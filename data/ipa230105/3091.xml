Such downhole tools include, for example, torches, perforators, setting tools, fracturing equipment, and the like (collectively referred to herein as downhole tools).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A need exists, in the oil and gas industry, for the ability to anchor, clock in direction, and eventually release a transient tool or the tool string that will allow for precise and effective tool system performance. Enabling the precise location of: a force, an application of torque, a sensor, a perforation or cut, and a drilling exit or other downhole operation, at an optimal position, further reduces the requirement to reposition multiple-run, single location tools and tool processes, while reducing the chances of misguided or off-position deployments of the tools.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some existing tool systems, deployed within a wellbore, are constructed with control lines surrounding the periphery of a pipe or tubular string. Removal of the pipe requires cutting both the pipe at the target location, and the control line or lines. Without cutting both, operators cannot complete the required finishing operations. Cutting operations that are powerful enough to cut through all the elements, however, are restricted in their use due to the danger of causing harm to the backside infrastructure. Thus, having the ability to make multiple, precise cuts at a single target plane can enable all elements to be cut. A need exists for placing tools that enable precise energy delivery for cut effectiveness.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To precisely position a tool, it is useful to place an anchor or anchoring system in a single position, such that multiple tools may lock into that anchor or anchoring system for an exact placement and positioning of each tool. With the anchor placed downhole, the tool does not have to rely on measurement or clocking from the surface. Alternatively, anchoring systems are needed to enable the positioning and repositioning of the same or multiple downhole tools, and to enable the orienting or clocking of the tool while downhole. The clocking of the downhole tool enables future operations to be performed by the downhole tool at the same downhole location or at an offset. The offset can include an angular offset (e.g., azimuthal, radial, polar, etc.) of the tool or a positional offset of the location of the downhole tool (e.g., a lower or higher depth within the wellbore, from the previous location within the wellbore at which the prior operations were conducted).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">When screwed together and properly torqued, joints between pipes within a tubular string become relatively seamless, and the lack of distinguishable features makes the joints difficult to locate using conventional well logging devices. While casing collar locators and similar devices can assist in positioning a tool within a tubular string, existing devices are limited in their accuracy, which may generally be, at best, in the range of a few feet. A joint target within a tubular string may be just inches in length, requiring far more precise placement of a tool than current collar locators and similar devices can provide.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Completion processes taking place within a wellbore often require placing sensors, perforating a wall for communication, and perforating a casing such that contact with a geological feature is made. Operations such as gauge integration, cement squeezing, fracturing and jet drilling become subsequent processes.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other positioning systems can include providing physical features within the interior of a tubular string that interact with corresponding physical features of a locating tool; however, these positioning systems require numerous, precisely crafted features to ensure proper function and interaction, including various moving parts to cause selective engagement between corresponding features.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A need exists for removable positioning apparatus and methods for positioning a tool with complementary mating integration capacity within a tubular string, for enabling precise positioning of anchorable tools at a preselected location, including joints, within the tubular string to facilitate the effectiveness of the tools. Having the flexibility of a selectively placed locking feature within a tubular member greatly enhances the tool's ability to positively fixate a tool, using pre-positioned anchoring profile mechanisms within a wellbore system.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A further need exists for positioning apparatus and methods usable for positioning a tool within a tubular string that are simple in construction and function, able to incorporate reusable, machinable, and re-machinable parts that are able to accommodate a variety of latching and/or engaging orientations.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A need also exists for positioning apparatus and methods usable for positioning a tool within a tubular string that are conveyable and deployable utilizing readily available setting tools.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present embodiments meet these needs.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of the present invention include apparatus, systems and methods usable to accurately locate, position, and actuate packers, cutters, torches, perforators, setting tools, and/or other types of tools used downhole.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The disclosed embodiments include a system for providing a self-centering reusable anchor location within a wellbore. The system includes an extreme range anchor having a first extending assembly configured to engage the wellbore. The first extending assembly can comprise a first set of arms that can connect to a first brace, a second set of arms that can connect to a second brace, and a set of footplates. Each footplate in the set of footplates can be connected at a first side to the first set of arms and can be connected at a second side to the second set of arms. Each footplate can comprise a fixator that can be coupled to a radially external face and configured to securely engage the wellbore. The extreme range anchor can include a pull rod that can be rigidly coupled to the first brace and slidably connected to the second brace. Forcing the pull rod in an axial direction can shorten the distance between the first brace and the second brace and can force the set of footplates to move in a radial direction toward the wellbore.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In certain embodiments, the system may include a second extending assembly configured to engage the wellbore. The second extending assembly may include a third set of arms connected to the second brace, a fourth set of arms connected to a third brace, and a second set of footplates. Each footplate in the second set of footplates can be connected at a first side of the third set of arms and connected at a second side to the fourth set of arms.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In certain embodiments, the system may include a body and an engagement key. The engagement key may be configured to engage with the body to maintain an axial position of the pull rod relative to the body when the pull rod is forced in the axial direction. In certain embodiments, the engagement key may be configured to disengage from within the body in response to the body being forced in the axial direction at a disengage threshold of force.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In certain embodiments, the set of footplates are configured to move a distance up to fifteen (15) centimeters in the radial direction to engage with the wellbore. In certain embodiments, the fixators may include cone-shaped fixators, half cone-shaped fixators, serrated fixators, or other fixators to securely engage the wellbore. In certain embodiments, the first extending assembly may include a pull rod spring, securing pins, securing bands, or other securing implements to prevent radial movement of the set of footplates, prior to the forcing of the pull rod.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In certain embodiments, the system may include fixator covers configured to cover the fixators. The fixator covers may prevent engagement between the fixators and the wellbore while the extreme range anchor is being deployed to a depth within the wellbore. In certain embodiments, the extreme range anchor may include a setting rod configured to connect to the pull rod with a tab at a first end, and to a setting tool at a second end. The setting tool may pull the setting rod to force the pull rod in the axial direction. In certain embodiments, the tab may be configured to shear the setting rod from the pull rod when pulled at a set force.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The disclosed embodiments can include a method of performing a downhole operation within a wellbore. The method can include lowering an extreme range anchor into the wellbore, wherein the extreme range anchor may include a tool connecting head. The method can include the step of actuating a setting tool to force a pull rod in an axial direction to extend a set of footplates in a radial direction. The footplates may be configured to securely engage the wellbore with fixatorm coupled to a radially external face of the footplates. The method can further include the steps of lowering a first tool onto the tool connecting head, completing a first operation with the first tool, retrieving the first tool to a surface of the wellbore, lowering a second tool onto the tool connecting head, completing a second operation with the second tool at a second location, and retrieving the second tool to the surface of the wellbore.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The method of the disclosed embodiments may also include pulling on the tool connecting head in the axial direction to disengage the set of footplates from the wellbore. The step of completing the first operation, the second operation, or combinations thereof, may include actuating an axial torch cutter, a radial torch cutter, a wellbore perforator, a production tubing cutter, or combinations thereof. Also, actuating the setting tool may include shearing a setting rod from the pull rod. The shearing may be configured to occur when the set of footplates are engaged with the wellbore. In certain embodiments of the methods disclosed, the first operation may be completed at a target location and the second operation may be completed within three (3) centimeters (1.18 inches), or less than three 3 centimeters of the target location. Also, the footplates may be configured to extend in the radial direction up to fifteen (15) centimeters.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In certain disclosed embodiments of a system for securely engaging a wellbore, the system can include a first arm rotatably connected to a first brace at a first end of the first arm, a second arm rotatably connected to a second brace at a first end of the second arm, and a pull rod rigidly connected to the first brace and slidably connected to the second brace and configured to translate in a longitudinal direction. When the pull rod translates the longitudinal direction, the first arm and the second arm may be configured to rotate so that a second end of the first arm and a second end of the second arm protrude in an axial direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In certain embodiments, the system can include a footplate rotatably connected to the second end of the first arm and the second end of the second arm. The system can further include a protrusion attached at the second end of the second arm. The protrusion can be configured to protrude into the wellbore after the pull rod translates in the longitudinal direction. The first arm may include a recess configured to house the protrusion during transport of the system into the wellbore, and the first arm, the second arm or combinations thereof can comprise flex features, as described below.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the detailed description of various embodiments usable within the scope of the present disclosure, presented below, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a perspective view of an embodiment of an extreme range anchor usable within the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a cross-sectional view of the embodiment of the extreme range anchor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts a cross-sectional view of the embodiment of the extreme range anchor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts a perspective view of an embodiment of a footplate that may be used as part of the extreme range anchor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts a perspective view of an embodiment of a footplate that may be used as part of the extreme range anchor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts a cross-sectional view of the embodiment of the extreme range anchor of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts a cross-sectional side view of an additional or alternative lower extending assembly <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts a perspective view of an embodiment of an extreme range anchor that uses an electromechanical anchor in the upper section of the extreme range anchor.

The anchor <b>10</b>, as depicted, can include a lower section <b>12</b>, which includes securing features as explained below, and an upper section <b>14</b>, which may include the electronic, mechanical, or chemical deploying features as explained below.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an alignment member <b>16</b>, to which downhole tools may connect, can be attached to the upper section <b>14</b>. For example, the alignment member <b>16</b> may include a fishneck, as illustrated, to connect to the downhole tool. With such an alignment member <b>16</b>, a downhole tool <b>17</b> can be lowered onto the fishneck (surrounding the alignment member <b>16</b>). The alignment member <b>16</b> may include a nub <b>18</b> that can provide the downhole tool <b>17</b> with an azimuthal direction into which the downhole tool <b>17</b> can clock. With the nub <b>18</b> providing the azimuthal direction, a precise directional operation may be conducted multiple times with one or more tools. That is, the anchor <b>10</b> stays within the wellbore and additional downhole tools <b>17</b> may be lowered onto the alignment member <b>16</b>, oriented on a nub <b>18</b>, triggered, and retrieved. The downhole tool <b>17</b> may be locked into place on the fishneck, on the alignment member <b>16</b>, or locked onto the nub <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">To lock the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> into place, the lower section <b>12</b> can include a number of extending assemblies that can be retracted while the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> is lowered into the wellbore.

The lower assembly <b>20</b> includes a set of lower arms <b>24</b><i>a</i>, a set of footplates <b>26</b><i>a</i>, and a set of upper arms <b>24</b><i>b</i>. Likewise, the upper assembly <b>22</b> includes a set of lower arms <b>24</b><i>c</i>, a set of footplates <b>26</b><i>b</i>, and a set of upper arms <b>24</b><i>d</i>. Each set of arms <b>24</b> or footplates <b>26</b> may contain as few as two members or many more members.

Although the embodiment of the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes two assemblies <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, each assembly comprising sets of arms <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>and sets of footplates <b>26</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> can include any number of assemblies <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> to ensure a secure connection within the wellbore.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the arms <b>24</b> can connect the footplate <b>26</b> to braces that can tie the assemblies <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> together. For example, as further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the lower arm <b>24</b><i>a </i>(for simplicity, each of the sets of arms <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>may be discussed below as individual arms; it should be understood that &#x201c;the lower arms <b>24</b><i>a</i>&#x201d; should mean the lower arm in each set of the lower arms <b>24</b><i>a</i>) in the lower assembly <b>20</b> can connect a first end of the first footplate <b>26</b><i>a </i>to a lower brace <b>28</b>, and the upper arm <b>24</b><i>b </i>in the lower assembly <b>20</b> can connect a second end of the first footplate <b>26</b><i>a </i>to a middle brace <b>29</b>. With regard to the upper assembly <b>22</b>, the lower arm <b>24</b><i>c </i>in the upper assembly <b>22</b> can connect the second footplate <b>26</b><i>b </i>to the middle brace <b>29</b>, and the upper arm <b>24</b><i>d </i>of the upper assembly <b>22</b> can connect the second footplate <b>26</b><i>b </i>to an upper brace <b>30</b>. The connections between the arms <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>and the braces <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>30</b> can be rotatably hinged so that the arms <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are free to change the angle at which they connect to each of the braces <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The assemblies <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> can extend radially outward in response to a pull rod <b>32</b>, which pulls on a bottom end <b>34</b> of the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> to shorten the distance between the braces <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>. That is, a setting tool, an electromechanical anchor, or other tool for pulling, urges the pull rod <b>32</b> (perhaps through intermediary components, as explained below) in an upper direction <b>36</b>; and in response, the footplates <b>26</b> in the lower assembly <b>20</b> and the upper assembly <b>22</b> simultaneously extend in a radially outward direction <b>44</b>. The simultaneous movement of all sets of arms <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>and footplates <b>26</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>self-centers the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> within the wellbore, tubing, etc. A pull rod spring <b>40</b> can be used to exert a force in a downward direction <b>42</b> during the time that the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> travels down the wellbore to keep the assemblies <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> radially inward <b>38</b> and to prevent vibration or accidental movement of the assemblies <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> due to loose movement of the arms <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>and/or the footplates <b>26</b><i>a</i>-<i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the lower assembly <b>20</b> in a traveling or un-extended position with the pull rod <b>32</b> fully in the downward radial direction <b>42</b>, To further ensure stable travel conditions, the footplate <b>26</b><i>a </i>may be secured into position with pins <b>46</b> that may be attached to the pull rod spring <b>40</b> or other area of the extreme range anchor <b>10</b>. The pins <b>46</b> can grip the footplate <b>26</b> at a gripping surface <b>48</b> that stably affixes until the pull rod <b>32</b> is deployed in the upward radial direction <b>36</b>. In other words, the lower assembly <b>20</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, will maintain a traveling angle <b>50</b> for the arms <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>relative to the braces <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> throughout the descent into the wellbore. The traveling angle <b>50</b> may typically be near 90 degrees, meaning that the arms <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are usually traveling parallel to the wellbore during descent. In some embodiments, however, the traveling angle <b>50</b> may be greater than or less than 90 degrees, to accommodate more rapid deployment or other requirements for deployment of the extreme range anchor <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">To deploy the extreme range anchor <b>10</b>, the pull rod <b>32</b> is pulled in the upward radial direction <b>36</b>, as mentioned above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows that the pull rod <b>32</b> is rigidly attached to the bottom end <b>34</b>, so that when the pull rod <b>32</b> is pulled, the bottom end <b>34</b>, the bottom brace <b>28</b>, and the attached arm <b>24</b><i>a </i>are all pulled in the upward radial direction <b>36</b>. The middle brace <b>29</b>, in contrast, can travel along the outer diameter of the pull rod <b>32</b> such that the pull rod <b>32</b> is free to slide through the middle brace <b>29</b>. Force from the upper assembly <b>22</b> urges the middle brace <b>29</b> downward (i.e., in the downward radial direction <b>42</b>) relative to the bottom end <b>34</b> and the arms <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and the footplate <b>26</b><i>a </i>are thus forced radially outward <b>44</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A deployed embodiment of the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the bottom brace <b>28</b> (with the bottom end <b>34</b>) has been pulled closer to the middle brace <b>29</b>, and the arms <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and the footplate <b>26</b><i>a </i>have moved radially outward <b>44</b>. The arms <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>now make a deployed angle <b>52</b> relative to the braces <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>, while the footplate <b>26</b><i>a </i>remains parallel to the pull rod <b>32</b> and, importantly, to a tubing wall <b>62</b>. The deployed angle <b>52</b> is generally less than the traveling angle <b>50</b> so that the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> travels down the wellbore with a smaller profile than when the anchor <b>10</b> is deployed. The footplate <b>26</b><i>a </i>travels a distance <b>56</b> from the traveling position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) to the deployed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The distance <b>56</b> may, in certain embodiments, be any length up to 30 centimeters. For example, the range may be between 1 centimeter and 15 centimeters, between 1 centimeter and 20 centimeters, between 1 centimeter and 25 centimeters, between 5 centimeters and 15 centimeters, etc. Once the pull rod <b>32</b> is pulled and the anchor is deployed, a face <b>60</b> of the footplate <b>26</b><i>a </i>can abut the tubing wall <b>62</b> and fixators <b>64</b> can bite into the tubing wall <b>62</b> to ensure a secure fit. Since the arms <b>24</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>and footplate <b>26</b><i>a </i>can deploy or extend simultaneously, the footplate <b>26</b><i>a </i>and/or the fixators <b>64</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>), in each set or assembly <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, can bite into the tubing wall <b>62</b> with the same force and timing. That is, while one footplate <b>26</b><i>a </i>may contact the tubing wall <b>62</b> before the other footplates <b>26</b><i>a</i>, the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> will center itself before any of the footplates <b>26</b><i>a </i>apply any pressure that will actually set the fixators <b>64</b> into the tubing wall <b>62</b>. The fixators <b>64</b> decrease the likelihood of slipping or shifting after deployment, and the fixators <b>64</b> can include any combination of shapes and sizes to securely bite into the tubing wall <b>62</b>. The illustrated embodiments include a flat cone fixator <b>70</b>, a pointed cone fixator <b>72</b>, and a multipoint fixator <b>74</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an embodiment of the footplate <b>26</b> that may be used in the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>. As shown, the footplate <b>26</b> employs fixators <b>64</b> of a uniform size and shape. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a two-by-three pattern of pointed cone fixators <b>72</b>. The size, shape, and/or pattern of the fixators <b>64</b> may depend on the type of tubing wall <b>62</b> into which the fixators <b>64</b> will bite. For example, a tubing wall <b>62</b> that is highly corroded and/or rusted, with loose or softened material on an inner surface <b>80</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), may employ a fixator <b>64</b> that penetrates deeper into the inner surface <b>80</b>, On the other hand, if the tubing wall <b>62</b> is made of a hard and/or polished surface, the fixators <b>64</b> may employ smaller, sharper, and/or more plentiful points on the face <b>60</b> of the footplate <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As an additional but not limiting example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an embodiment of a footplate <b>26</b> having five fixators <b>64</b> arranged on the face <b>60</b> of the footplate <b>26</b>. Included on the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a larger multipoint fixator <b>74</b> positioned in the center of the footplate <b>26</b> with several smaller flat cone fixators <b>70</b> positioned toward the corners of the footplate <b>26</b>. Additionally, the footplate <b>26</b> in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> includes chemical fixators <b>82</b> that may employ glue, epoxy, adhesive, or other chemicals to attach the footplate <b>26</b> to the tubing wall <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">To protect the fixators <b>64</b> during travel down the wellbore, the footplate <b>26</b> may include a fixator cover <b>84</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The fixator cover <b>84</b> can be attached to the face <b>60</b> during travel and, in certain embodiments, is made out of material that has a low coefficient of friction. For example, the fixator cover <b>84</b> may include a polymer, a ceramic, a plastic, a silicone, a rubber, or other protective material. The cover enables the footplate <b>26</b> and the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> to traverse passed features within the wellbore that may otherwise contact the fixators <b>64</b> and impede travel. Additionally, the fixator cover <b>84</b> protects the fixators <b>64</b> so that any sharp points of the fixators <b>64</b> maintain their sharpness until deployment. After deployment of the extreme range anchor <b>10</b>, the fixator cover <b>84</b> can deform, compress, or fracture so that the fixators <b>64</b> are able to meet the inner surface <b>80</b> of the tubing wall <b>62</b>. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the fixator cover <b>84</b> has fractured and will dissolve or fall down the wellbore.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an embodiment of the upper section <b>14</b> of the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As shown, the upper section <b>14</b> of the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> can be used to house a body <b>98</b> that assists in keeping the extending assemblies <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> in the deployed position after deployment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the upper section <b>14</b> before the pull rod <b>32</b> has been pulled. As depicted, a collar <b>100</b> of the pull rod <b>32</b> sits at the bottom of a cavity <b>102</b> against a shoulder <b>120</b> which rests in contact with the body seat <b>104</b>. As explained above, the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> can travel down the wellbore in this position. To deploy the extreme range anchor <b>10</b>, the pull rod <b>32</b> can be connected to a first end of a setting rod <b>106</b> with a shear stud <b>108</b>. The setting rod <b>106</b> can be connected at the other end to a setting tool, an electromechanical anchor, or other downhole pulling device that pulls on the setting rod <b>106</b>. The setting rod <b>106</b>, shear stud <b>108</b>, and pull rod <b>32</b> can move upward <b>36</b> in relation to the body <b>98</b>. Similar to the middle brace <b>29</b> explained above, the upper brace <b>30</b> can be slidably coupled to the pull rod <b>32</b>, which enables the pull rod <b>32</b> to move axially upwards <b>36</b> and, thus, forces the arms <b>24</b> radially outward <b>44</b>. To prevent deformation of the tubing wall <b>62</b>, the shear stud <b>108</b> can be calibrated to shear at a given deployment force. In certain embodiments, an electromechanical anchor may be calibrated or programmed to cut off power once a deployment force (e.g., smaller than the force that would deform the tubing wall <b>62</b>) has been detected. In such embodiments, the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> possibly may not have a shear stud <b>108</b>. The deployment force is large enough to set the fixators <b>64</b> into the inner surface <b>80</b> of the tubing wall <b>62</b>, but small enough so that the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> and the tubing wall <b>62</b> do not deform or otherwise suffer damage. After deployment of the extreme range anchor <b>10</b>, the setting tool (if used), the setting rod <b>106</b>, and any part of the shear stud <b>108</b> attached to the setting rod <b>106</b> can be retrieved back to the surface of the wellbore. In certain embodiments, the electromechanical anchor used to set the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> may remain downhole until the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> is ready to be retrieved.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The pull rod <b>32</b> can be kept in place by a variety of securing devices. For example, the upper section <b>14</b> may include an engagement key <b>110</b>, retention shear pin <b>122</b>, and ridges <b>112</b> inside the cavity <b>102</b> of the body <b>98</b>. The ridges <b>112</b> in the illustrated embodiment are shaped to enable the engagement key <b>110</b> to slide axially upward <b>36</b>, but prevent the engagement key <b>110</b> from sliding downward <b>42</b>. A lower edge <b>114</b> of each ridge <b>112</b> can be angled slightly to reduce the friction between a top edge <b>116</b> of the engagement key <b>110</b>. An upper edge <b>118</b> of the ridges <b>112</b>, however, is angled to increase the retaining ability of a bottom edge <b>120</b> of the engagement key <b>110</b>. The engagement key <b>110</b> may also include an engagement spring <b>124</b> that increases the radially outward <b>44</b> force of the engagement key <b>110</b> against the ridges <b>112</b>. The engagement key <b>110</b> may include embodiments where the engagement spring <b>124</b> is a coil spring, or as illustrated, may include a resilient material, or an arc spring that forces the engagement key <b>110</b> toward the ridges <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">After deployment, the anchor <b>10</b> may stay in the deployed location for a number of operations. One or more tools can be lowered downhole and onto the alignment member <b>16</b> for operation. After all desired tool operations are completed, an operator may retrieve the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> by returning the extending assemblies <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> to the traveling position. For example, the electromechanical may use a motor to move the pull rod <b>32</b> back down <b>42</b> relative to the upper section <b>14</b> and the upper brace <b>30</b>. The pull rod <b>32</b> may also be released by fracturing or shearing the retention shear pin <b>122</b>. The retention shear pin <b>122</b> may be calibrated to fracture at a disengaged threshold of force on the extreme range anchor <b>10</b>. Alternatively, a retrieving tool may be lowered and secured onto the alignment member <b>16</b> and pulled axially upward <b>36</b>. At the disengage threshold, the retention shear pin <b>122</b> shears, allowing the pull rod <b>32</b> to be disconnected from the engagement key <b>110</b>. The downhole end of the collar <b>100</b> will make contact with the uphole end of the shoulder <b>120</b> upon retrieval. The pull rod spring <b>40</b> forces the pull rod <b>32</b> to stay in the extended position, which keeps the extending assemblies <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> radially inward <b>38</b> so the anchor <b>10</b> can be fully retrieved. The retrieval operation may be completed by the last tool to be oriented on the anchor <b>10</b>. The last tool in that instance would be positioned to apply sufficient overpull to the anchor <b>10</b> so that the retention shear pin <b>122</b> breaks or shears.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional side view of an additional or alternative lower extending assembly <b>130</b>. The lower extending assembly <b>130</b> includes a lower arm <b>132</b><i>a </i>that may attach to the lower brace <b>28</b> in a similar manner to the other lower arm <b>24</b><i>a</i>. Likewise, an upper arm <b>132</b><i>b </i>may attach to the middle brace <b>29</b> in a similar way as described above. As illustrated, however, the lower extending assembly <b>130</b> may include embodiments that secure the anchor <b>10</b> to the wellbore without the footplate <b>26</b> described above. Instead, the lower extending assembly <b>130</b> may employ a securing protrusion <b>134</b> that protrudes from the end of the upper arm <b>132</b><i>b</i>. The protrusion <b>134</b> includes ridges <b>136</b> that bite into the wellbore. The biting of the ridges <b>136</b> secures the positioning of the anchor <b>10</b> during orientation of the subsequently anchored tools. The ridges <b>136</b> may have additional or alternative size, shape, and/or pattern to the ones shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, depending on the material into which the ridges <b>136</b> will be biting. As with the fixators <b>64</b> (explained above), the size, shape, and/or pattern of the ridges <b>136</b> may penetrate deeper into the inner surface if the tubing wall <b>62</b> is highly corroded, rusted, or has loose or softened material on an inner surface <b>80</b> thereof. On the other hand, if the tubing wall <b>62</b> is made of a hard and/or polished surface, the ridges <b>136</b> may employ smaller, sharper, and/or more plentiful points.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">During transport of the anchor <b>10</b> down the wellbore, the lower arm <b>132</b><i>a </i>and the upper arm <b>132</b><i>b </i>are substantially parallel to the pull rod <b>32</b>, slimming the profile of the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> in a similar manner to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> described above. The protrusion <b>134</b> is in line with the arms <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b</i>. The lower arm <b>132</b><i>a </i>includes a recess <b>138</b> cut out of the lower arm <b>132</b><i>a</i>, and during transport, the protrusion <b>134</b> is located within the recess <b>138</b> to protect the ridges <b>136</b> and ensure a smooth descent of the anchor <b>10</b>. The lower arm <b>132</b><i>a </i>may attach to a left side <b>137</b> and a right side <b>140</b> of the upper arm <b>132</b><i>b</i>, which ensures an even and secure deployment of the protrusion <b>134</b> against the wellbore. In certain embodiments, the lower arm <b>132</b><i>a </i>may include the protrusion <b>134</b> having the ridges <b>136</b> on an upper end <b>142</b> to further secure the anchor <b>10</b> into the wellbore. In an additional or alternative embodiment, the upper arm <b>132</b><i>b </i>and lower arm <b>132</b><i>a </i>may switch roles. That is, the lower arm may include the protrusion <b>134</b> while the upper arm <b>132</b><i>b </i>includes the recess <b>138</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The upper arm <b>132</b><i>b </i>(or the lower arm <b>132</b><i>a</i>, in certain embodiments) may also include flex features <b>144</b>, or other cushioning features, that enable the upper arm <b>132</b><i>b </i>to cushion or flex during deployment. Flex and cushion may be useful to set and maintain connection between the protrusion <b>134</b> and the wellbore. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, as the engagement key <b>110</b> slides upward <b>36</b> along the ridges <b>112</b>, each ridge <b>112</b> individually slides past the engagement key <b>110</b>. When the shear stud <b>108</b> shears, the engagement key <b>110</b> may experience a slide back. This small slide may occur especially if the engagement key <b>110</b> is only partially pulled from one ridge <b>112</b> to the next ridge <b>112</b>, This may be a very small amount (e.g., 0.006 inches or 0.152 mm) due to the small length of the ridges <b>112</b>, but can still cause the protrusion <b>134</b> to lose some traction with the wellbore.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">To prevent this traction loss, the flex features <b>144</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) provide some spring potential energy to build up before the shear stud <b>108</b> shears. That is, the pull rod <b>32</b> pulls the braces <b>28</b>, <b>29</b> to move the arms <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b </i>outward <b>44</b> until the protrusion <b>134</b> contacts the wellbore. Then, the upper arm <b>132</b><i>b </i>can flex to produce the spring potential between the wellbore and the pull rod <b>32</b>. Following the flexing of the upper arm <b>132</b><i>b</i>, the shear stud <b>108</b> shears and the spring potential from the flexing absorbs any loss in traction caused by the shift of the engagement key <b>110</b> between ridges <b>112</b>. The spring potential energy pushes the protrusion <b>134</b> against the wellbore with additional force, which increases the frictional force and thus the overall ability of the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> to remain in a fixed location.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The flex features <b>144</b> may include slots, striations, grooves, or other physical changes to the arm (e.g., upper arm <b>132</b><i>b</i>) that enable an otherwise rigid arm to flex or arch without deforming or permanently bending. The flex features <b>144</b> may also include material differences to the arms. For example, the arms <b>132</b> may be constructed from a flexible metal, polymer, rubber, or other material that does not deform under a load. Furthermore, the flex features <b>144</b> may include combinations of these or other features that enable the arms <b>132</b> to provide an increased force normal to the interior surface of the wellbore.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In certain embodiments, the anchor <b>10</b> may be purposefully offset from a center of the wellbore. For example, the lower arms <b>132</b><i>a </i>and upper arms <b>132</b><i>b </i>may vary in length from one set of the extending assembly <b>130</b> to another set. That is, the upper arm <b>132</b><i>b </i>of one set may be longer than the upper arms <b>132</b><i>b </i>of the other sets of the particular extending assembly <b>130</b>. This may result in the shorter upper arm <b>132</b><i>b </i>being attached to the middle brace <b>29</b> while the longer upper arm <b>132</b><i>b </i>is attached to a different middle brace. When the extending assembly <b>130</b> is deployed, the longer arms of one set will force the anchor <b>10</b> away from the center of the wellbore before the shorter arms of another set engage the wall of the wellbore. Alternatively or additionally, to offset the anchor <b>10</b> from the center of the wellbore, a connection point <b>146</b> between the lower arm <b>132</b><i>a </i>and the upper arm <b>132</b><i>b </i>may be adjusted. In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, both lower arms <b>132</b><i>a </i>and both upper arms <b>132</b><i>b </i>are of substantially equal length, and the connection point <b>146</b> is near the ends of these arms <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b </i>as shown. However, in certain embodiments, the lower arm <b>132</b><i>a </i>may be longer, with the recess <b>138</b> enveloping a greater proportion of the upper arm <b>132</b><i>b</i>. That is, the lower arm <b>132</b><i>a </i>can extend on either side of the upper arm <b>132</b><i>b </i>to any point of connection, for example see connection <b>148</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In embodiments with longer recesses <b>138</b>, the connection <b>148</b> may be located closer to the middle brace <b>29</b> by an extended length <b>150</b>, thus relocating the connection point <b>146</b> to the connection <b>148</b>. The lengths of the upper arms <b>132</b><i>b </i>may remain the same, however, the connection point <b>146</b> can be changed to any connection <b>148</b> along the upper arm <b>132</b><i>b</i>. When the connection point <b>146</b> is located at the connection <b>148</b>, and is closer to the middle brace <b>29</b>, the deployment of the extending assembly <b>130</b> can cause the protrusion <b>134</b> to extend further from the lower extending assembly <b>130</b>. This would allow the upper arm <b>132</b><i>b</i>, with the protrusion <b>134</b>, to extend further away from the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> for a given translation distance by the pull rod <b>32</b>. Thus, if the connection point <b>146</b> were located at different a different connection <b>148</b> for each set of arms <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b</i>, the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> would be positioned at a non-central position within the wellbore.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of the extreme range anchor <b>10</b> that uses an electromechanical anchor in the upper section <b>14</b>. The electromechanical section will be located uphole <b>36</b> from the upper brace <b>30</b>. The electromechanical section may include the engagement key <b>110</b>, the shear pin <b>122</b>, a rotation device (e.g., actuator, motor, extender, etc.) and a communication device (e.g., electronic circuit board). A signal can be sent to the communication device to initiate a setting procedure, or the retrieval procedure. The signal may be communicated from the surface by sending a pressure wave that is detected by the communication device, or by direct electronic communication through a wireline connection. Additionally, the communication device may begin the deployment procedure when a set of conditions is detected within the wellbore. The set of conditions may include pressure, temperature, chemicals, orientation (e.g., only deploys in a horizontal wellbore shaft), acceleration (e.g., does not deploy while moving), and time (e.g., will not deploy until a certain length of time has elapsed since being dropped into the wellbore). The communication device will send a signal to the rotation device to initiate the setting sequence. Initiation of the rotation device will result in the uphole <b>36</b> movement of the pull rod <b>32</b> and the function of the system will react as outlined above. Additionally, the retrieval process may include a second signal or group of detected signals to reverse the motion of the rotation device. The retrieval process may also include a strong upward <b>36</b> force applied to the system in order to shear the pin joining the engagement key <b>110</b> and the pull rod <b>32</b>. Shearing of the pin will result in disengagement of the profiles from the casing and anchor arms will collapse to the travel angle <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">While various embodiments usable within the scope of the present disclosure have been described with emphasis, it should be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the present invention can be practiced other than as specifically described herein.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
