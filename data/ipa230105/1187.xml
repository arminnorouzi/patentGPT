This is true for a large variety of benefit agents including pharmaceutical, nutraceutical agents, agricultural nutrients and related substances, cosmetic agents, fragrances, air care agents, and many other benefit agents in a variety of fields. Transdermal delivery of pharmaceutical agents has proven effective for drugs that are able to move across the skin barrier. For example, small amounts of nicotine can be delivered over extended periods with transdermal patches that suspend the nicotine in an ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer (see, e.g., Nicoderm-CQ&#xae; by GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK). Other examples include extended release of fragrances and malodor removing agents for improving the air quality in living spaces and automobiles, fertilizers in the soil for more efficient food production, and biocides on surfaces for mitigating microorganism growth. Controlled and extended release delivery systems may involve the delivery of various benefit agents in different forms, such as solid, liquid and gas, to different locations, and under different conditions.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A variety of delivery systems has been developed during the last decades that provide on demand delivery of benefit agents. For instance, Chrono Therapeutics (Hayward, Calif.) has tested a micro pump-enabled smart transdermal patch for delivering nicotine. Nonetheless, the corresponding device is large and visible through clothing as a sizable bump. Thus, there remains a need for small, simple, inexpensive, versatile and safe delivery systems for delivering benefit agents on demand.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention addresses this need by providing a low power delivery system whereby a benefit agent or a mixture of benefit agents can be released on demand. Additionally, as described below, the invention provides a system for delivering varying amounts of benefit agents from the same delivery system at different times, and for delivering multiple benefit agents at the same or different times from the same benefit agent delivery system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, the invention is a benefit agent delivery system comprising a first electrode layer, a microcell layer comprising a plurality of microcells, and a porous second electrode layer. Each microcell has a first opening. The porous second electrode layer spans the first openings of each microcell of the plurality of microcells. The first electrode layer, the microcell layer, and the porous second electrode layer are vertically stacked upon each other. Each microcell contains a liquid mixture comprising reverse micelles in a hydrophobic liquid that are formed from a polar liquid, a surfactant and a benefit agent. The surfactant is an anionic surfactant or a cationic surfactant. The reverse micelles in the hydrophobic liquid may have an average diameter of from 10 nm to 10 &#x3bc;m. Application of a first voltage on a microcell via the first electrode layer and the porous second electrode layer having polarity, which causes the migration of the reverse micelles in the microcell towards the porous second electrode, increases the rate of release of the benefit agent through the porous second electrode layer compared to the rate of release of the benefit agent through the porous second electrode layer when no voltage is applied. Application of a second voltage across a microcell via the first electrode layer and the porous second electrode layer, the second voltage having polarity opposite to the polarity of the first voltage, causes the migration of the reverse micelles in the microcell away from the porous second electrode layer and reduces the rate of release of the benefit agent through the porous second electrode layer compared to the rate of release of the benefit agent through the porous second electrode layer when no voltage is applied. The benefit agent delivery system may further comprise a sealing layer disposed between the microcell layer and the porous second electrode layer. The benefit agent delivery system may comprise a voltage source that is coupled to the first electrode layer and the porous second electrode layer. The reverse micelles of the liquid mixture may further comprise stabilizing particles, in addition to the anionic or cationic surfactant.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In yet another aspect, the invention is a method for operating a benefit agent delivery system. The method for operating the benefit agent delivery system comprises the steps of: (i) providing a benefit agent delivery system comprising (a) a first electrode layer, (b) a microcell layer comprising a plurality of microcells, wherein each microcell includes an opening, and wherein each microcell contains a liquid mixture, wherein the liquid mixture comprises reverse micelles in a hydrophobic liquid that are formed from a polar liquid, an anionic or cationic surfactant, and a benefit agent, (d) a porous second electrode layer spanning the opening of each microcell, and (e) a voltage source that is coupled to the first electrode layer and the porous second electrode layer; wherein the first electrode layer, the microcell layer, and the porous second electrode layer are vertically stacked upon each other; (ii) applying a first voltage on a microcell via the voltage source that causes the migration of the reverse micelles of the microcell towards the porous second electrode, increasing the rate of release of the benefit agent through the porous second electrode layer compared to the rate of release of the benefit agent through the porous second electrode layer when no voltage is applied, and (f) applying a second voltage on a microcell via the voltage source, the second voltage having polarity opposite to the polarity of the first voltage, causes the migration of the reverse micelles of the microcell away from the porous second electrode, reducing the rate of release of the benefit agent through the porous second electrode layer compared to the rate of release of the benefit agent through the porous second electrode layer when no voltage is applied.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates an example of a benefit agent delivery system comprising a first electrode layer, a plurality of microcells, each microcell containing reverse micelles in a hydrophobic liquid, and a porous second electrode layer that spans the first opening of each microcell.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates an example of a benefit agent delivery system comprising a first electrode layer, a plurality of microcells, each microcell containing reverse micelles in a hydrophobic liquid, a sealing layer, and a porous second electrode layer;

A variety of different benefit agents can be delivered from the same system. Different concentrations of benefit agents can also be delivered from the same system. The invention can be used to deliver a pharmaceutical agent, a vaccine, an antibody, a hormone, a protein, a nucleic acid, a nutrient, a nutraceutical agent, a cosmetic agent, a fragrance, a malodor removing agent, an air care agent, an agricultural agent, an air care agent, an anti-microbial agent, a preservative, and other benefit agents. Pharmaceutical agents and cosmetic agents may be delivered to patients transdermally. However, the invention may be used to deliver benefit agents to animals, generally. For example, the invention can deliver tranquilizing agents to a horse during transport. In addition, the invention may be used to deliver benefit agents to other surfaces or spaces.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">&#x201c;Electrocoalescence&#x201d; is the phenomenon of the increase of the average diameter of an internal phase droplets of an emulsion upon application of an electric field on the emulsion. The emulsion may comprise reverse micelles in a hydrophobic liquid. The term electrocoalescence includes the complete collapse of the reverse micelles into two different layers of liquid phases, a hydrophobic continuous phase layer and a polar liquid phase layer, upon application of an electric field on the reverse micelles in the hydrophobic liquid.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, the term &#x201c;two liquid layers&#x201d; of the liquid mixture means that the liquid mixture comprises two liquid phases (hydrophobic liquid and polar liquid), which form two separate liquid layers. The liquid layers are arranged so that one liquid layer is above the other liquid layer. The liquid layer having higher specific gravity is located at the bottom of the liquid layer having lower specific gravity. Typically, aqueous layers have higher specific gravity and are located below the hydrophobic liquid layer.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">&#x201c;Porous electrode layer&#x201d; is an electrode layer of the benefit agent delivery system that has average pore size larger than 100 nm. The porous electrode layer also serves as electrode for applying an electric field on the microcell layer. The electric field is applied on the microcell layer via two electrode layers (first electrode layer and porous second electrode layer) that sandwich the microcell layer. The second electrode layer is porous. The first electrode layer or the porous second electrode layer may comprise a plurality of electrodes, which can be independently addressed.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">&#x201c;Porous diffusion layer&#x201d; is a layer of the benefit agent delivery system that has average pore size that is larger than 0.2 nm. &#x201c;Rate control layer&#x201d; is a layer of the benefit agent delivery system that has average pore size that is 0.2 nm or smaller.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">&#x201c;Emulsion&#x201d; is a material that comprises droplets of liquid A dispersed in liquid B. Liquid A is immiscible to liquid B. Liquid A is part of the internal phase (which can be also called discontinuous phase) of the emulsion. Liquid B is called continuous phase (or external phase) of the emulsion. Typically, the emulsion is stabilized by surfactants or by stabilizing particles. Examples of emulsions include oil-in-water emulsions, where the internal phase is hydrophobic and the continuous phase is aqueous, and water-in-oil emulsions, where the internal phase is aqueous and the continuous phase is hydrophobic. Emulsions stabilized by stabilizing particles are also called &#x201c;Pickering emulsions&#x201d;. In the case of Pickering emulsions, the stabilizing particles are present in the interface of the internal phase and the continuous phase of the emulsion droplets.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">&#x201c;Reverse micelles&#x201d; or &#x201c;reverse micelles in the hydrophobic liquid&#x201d; are structures that comprise the internal phase of an emulsion, wherein the emulsion comprises droplets of a polar liquid in a hydrophobic liquid. Typically, reverse micelles are stabilized by surfactants or stabilizing particles. The polar liquid may comprise water, a combination of water and a polar organic liquid. The polar liquid may also be anhydrous, comprising a polar organic liquid. In the case of the polar liquid comprising water, the term &#x201c;reverse micelle&#x201d; may be also called &#x201c;water-in-oil emulsion&#x201d;.

This increases the concentration of reverse micelles adjacent to the sealing layer at microcell <b>130</b>A, which increases the diffusion of reverse micelles <b>265</b> through the sealing layer and porous second electrode layer and increases the rate of release of the benefit agent <b>290</b> through the porous second electrode layer compared to the rate of release of the benefit agent through the porous second electrode layer when no voltage is applied. The rate of release of the benefit agent through the porous second electrode layer may be more than 10%, or more than 25%, or more than 50%, or more than 75% or more than 90% compared to the rate of release of the benefit agent through the porous second electrode layer before the application of the electric field.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows the benefit agent delivery system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> after application of electric field across microcell <b>130</b>A via voltage source <b>280</b>. In this example, though, a second voltage is applied across microcell <b>130</b>A. The applied second voltage results in the porous second electrode at microcell <b>130</b>A being negative and the first electrode <b>120</b> being positive. The fact that reverse micelles <b>265</b> are negatively charged and the first electrode <b>120</b> is positive causes reverse micelles of microcell <b>130</b>A to migrate towards the first electrode and away from the porous second electrode layer.

Non-limiting examples of stabilizing particles include silica, iron oxide, alumina, other metal oxides, clay, natural or synthetic phyllosilicate, carbon black, carbon nanotubes, polymeric particles, chitosan, cyclodextrin, starch, natural proteins, and other particles. Stabilizing particles, which comprise inorganic materials, may have a surface that is hydrophobically modified. Stabilizing reverse emulsions by such particles offer the advantage of higher biocompatibility of particles in comparison to surfactant molecules.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The stabilizing particles may have various shapes including spheres, plates, cylinders, ellipsoid, and other shapes. The stabilizing particles may have a variety of sizes. For example, the stabilizing particles may have average size of from 10 nm to 2 &#x3bc;m, or from 10 nm to 800 nm, or from 100 nm to 300 nm. In this case, the average size refers to the largest dimension of the particle.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The weight percent of the stabilizing particles in the liquid mixture, which is included in the plurality of microcells of the benefit agent delivery system, may be more than 1 weight percent, or more than 0.1 weight percent, or more than 0.2 weight percent, or more than 0.3 weight percent, or more than 0.4 weight percent of surfactant by weight of the liquid mixture. The liquid mixture may comprise from 0.1 weight percent to 20 weight percent, or from 0.2 weight percent to 10 weight percent, or from 0.3 weight percent to 5 weight percent, or form 0.4 weight percent to 3 weight percent, or from 0.5 weight percent to 1 weight percent of the stabilizing particles by weight of the liquid mixture.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Another example of a benefit agent delivery system of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The benefit agent delivery system may comprise a backing layer <b>110</b>, a first electrode layer <b>120</b>, a microcell layer comprising a plurality of microcells (<b>330</b>A, <b>330</b>B, <b>330</b>C), a porous second electrode layer <b>150</b>, and a release sheet <b>160</b>. In this example, each microcell of the plurality of microcells (<b>330</b>A, <b>330</b>B, <b>330</b>C) has two openings, a first opening and a second opening. The first opening and the second opening are at opposite sides of the microcell. The first electrode layer <b>120</b> spans the second opening of each microcell and the porous second electrode layer <b>150</b> spans the first opening of each microcell. Microcell walls <b>335</b> separate the microcells from each other. Each microcell includes a liquid mixture. The liquid mixture comprises reverse micelles <b>145</b> in hydrophobic liquid <b>140</b>. The reverse micelles in the hydrophobic liquid are formed from a polar liquid, an anionic or a cationic surfactant, and a benefit agent. In this example, both the first electrode layer <b>120</b> and the porous second electrode layer <b>150</b> are in contact with the liquid mixture that is included in the plurality of microcells.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The microcell structure of the invention lends itself to making arrays of differing benefit agents, or arrays of different concentrations, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Because the microcells can be individually activated with an active matrix of electrodes, it is possible to provide varying benefit agents on demand and to produce complex dosing profiles. Using injection with inkjet or other fluidic systems, individual microcells can be filled to enable a variety of different benefit agents to be included in a benefit agent delivery system. For example, a system of the invention may include nicotine at four different concentrations, thereby allowing different dosages to be delivered at different times during the day. For example, shortly after waking up the most concentrated dose may be delivered (dark gray), followed by a much lower taper dose during the day (speckled), until the time that a user needs another more concentrated dose. It is possible to include different benefit agents in the same microcell. For example, the system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may also include an analgesic (stripes) to reduce swelling and itching in the area of the skin that is in contact with the delivery system. Of course, a variety of combinations are possible, and varying microcells might include pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, nutrients, adjuvants, vitamins, vaccines, hormones, cosmetic agents, fragrances, preservatives, etc. Furthermore, the arrangement of the microcells may not be distributed. Rather, the microcells may be filled in clusters, which makes filling and activation more straightforward. In other embodiments, smaller microcell arrays may be filled with the same medium, i.e., having the same benefit agent at the same concentration, and then the smaller arrays assembled into a larger array to make a delivery system of the invention.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Techniques for constructing microcells. Microcells may be formed either in a batch process or in a continuous roll-to-roll process as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,933,098. The latter offers a continuous, low cost, high throughput manufacturing technology for production of compartments for use in a variety of applications including benefit agent delivery and electrophoretic displays. Microcell arrays suitable for use with the invention can be created with microembossing, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. A male mold <b>500</b> may be placed either above the web <b>504</b> or below the web <b>504</b> (not shown); however, alternative arrangements are possible. For examples, please see U.S. Pat. No. 7,715,088, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A conductive substrate may be constructed by forming a conductor film <b>501</b> on polymer substrate that becomes the backing layer for a device. A composition comprising a thermoplastic, thermoset, or a precursor thereof <b>502</b> is then coated on the conductor film. The conductor film serves as the first electrode layer of the benefit agent delivery system. The thermoplastic or thermoset precursor layer is embossed at a temperature higher than the glass transition temperature of the thermoplastics or thermoset precursor layer by the male mold in the form of a roller, plate or belt.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The thermoplastic or thermoset precursor for the preparation of the plurality of microcells may be multifunctional acrylate or methacrylate, vinyl ether, epoxide and oligomers or polymers thereof, and the like. A combination of multifunctional epoxide and multifunctional acrylate is also very useful to achieve desirable physico-mechanical properties. A crosslinkable oligomer imparting flexibility, such as urethane acrylate or polyester acrylate, may be added to improve the flexure resistance of the embossed microcells. The composition may contain polymer, oligomer, monomer and additives or only oligomer, monomer and additives. The glass transition temperatures (or T<sub>g</sub>) for this class of materials usually range from about &#x2212;70&#xb0; C. to about 150&#xb0; C., preferably from about &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. to about 50&#xb0; C. The microembossing process is typically carried out at a temperature higher than the T<sub>g</sub>. A heated male mold or a heated housing substrate against which the mold presses may be used to control the microembossing temperature and pressure.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the mold is released during or after the precursor layer is hardened to reveal an array of microcells <b>503</b>. The hardening of the precursor layer may be accomplished by cooling, solvent evaporation, cross-linking by radiation, heat or moisture. If the curing of the thermoset precursor is accomplished by UV radiation, UV may radiate onto the transparent conductor film from the bottom or the top of the web as shown in the two figures. Alternatively, UV lamps may be placed inside the mold. In this case, the mold must be transparent to allow the UV light to radiate through the pre-patterned male mold on to the thermoset precursor layer. A male mold may be prepared by any appropriate method, such as a diamond turn process or a photoresist process followed by either etching or electroplating. A master template for the male mold may be manufactured by any appropriate method, such as electroplating. With electroplating, a glass base is sputtered with a thin layer (typically 3000 &#x212b;) of a seed metal such as chrome inconel. The mold is then coated with a layer of photoresist and exposed to UV. A mask is placed between the UV and the layer of photoresist. The exposed areas of the photoresist become hardened. The unexposed areas are then removed by washing them with an appropriate solvent. The remaining hardened photoresist is dried and sputtered again with a thin layer of seed metal. The master is then ready for electroforming. A typical material used for electroforming is nickel cobalt. Alternatively, the master can be made of nickel by electroforming or electroless nickel deposition. The floor of the mold is typically between about 50 to 400 microns. The master can also be made using other microengineering techniques including e-beam writing, dry etching, chemical etching, laser writing or laser interference as described in &#x201c;Replication techniques for micro-optics&#x201d;, SPIE Proc. Vol. 3099, pp. 76-82 (1997). Alternatively, the mold can be made by photomachining using plastics, ceramics or metals.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Prior to applying a UV curable resin composition, the mold may be treated with a mold release to aid in the demolding process. The UV curable resin may be degassed prior to dispensing and may optionally contain a solvent. The solvent, if present, readily evaporates. The UV curable resin is dispensed by any appropriate means such as, coating, dipping, pouring or the like, over the male mold. The dispenser may be moving or stationary. A conductor film is overlaid the UV curable resin. Pressure may be applied, if necessary, to ensure proper bonding between the resin and the plastic and to control the thickness of the floor of the microcells. The pressure may be applied using a laminating roller, vacuum molding, press device or any other like means. If the male mold is metallic and opaque, the plastic substrate is typically transparent to the actinic radiation used to cure the resin. Conversely, the male mold can be transparent and the plastic substrate can be opaque to the actinic radiation. To obtain good transfer of the molded features onto the transfer sheet, the conductor film needs to have good adhesion to the UV curable resin, which should have a good release property against the mold surface.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Microcell arrays for the invention typically include a pre-formed first electrode layer, such as indium tin oxide (ITO) conductor lines; however, other conductive materials, such as silver or aluminum, may be used. The first electrode layer may be backed by or integrated into substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, polyaramid, polyimide, polycycloolefin, polysulfone, epoxy and their composites. The first electrode layer may be coated with a radiation curable polymer precursor layer. The film and precursor layer are then exposed imagewise to radiation to form the microcell wall structure. Following exposure, the precursor material is removed from the unexposed areas, leaving the cured microcell walls bonded to the conductor film/support web. The imagewise exposure may be accomplished by UV or other forms of radiation through a photomask to produce an image or predetermined pattern of exposure of the radiation curable material coated on the conductor film. Although it is generally not required, the mask may be positioned and aligned with respect to the first electrode layer, i.e., ITO lines, so that the transparent mask portions align with the spaces between ITO lines, and the opaque mask portions align with the ITO material (intended for microcell cell floor areas).</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Photolithography. Microcells can also be produced using photolithography. Photolithographic processes for fabricating a microcell array are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>, the microcell array <b>600</b> may be prepared by exposure of a radiation curable material <b>601</b><i>a </i>coated by known methods onto a conductor electrode film <b>602</b> to UV light (or alternatively other forms of radiation, electron beams and the like) through a mask <b>606</b> to form walls <b>601</b><i>b </i>corresponding to the image projected through the mask <b>606</b>.

The UV radiates through the transparent area <b>605</b> onto the radiation curable material <b>601</b><i>a</i>. The exposure is preferably performed directly onto the radiation curable material <b>601</b><i>a</i>, i.e., the UV does not pass through the substrate <b>603</b> or base conductor <b>602</b> (top exposure). For this reason, neither the substrate <b>603</b>, nor the conductor <b>602</b>, needs to be transparent to the UV or other radiation wavelengths employed.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the exposed areas <b>601</b><i>b </i>become hardened and the unexposed areas (protected by the opaque area <b>604</b> of the mask <b>606</b>) are then removed by an appropriate solvent or developer to form the microcells <b>607</b>. The solvent or developer is selected from those commonly used for dissolving or reducing the viscosity of radiation curable materials such as methylethylketone (MEK), toluene, acetone, isopropanol or the like. The preparation of the microcells may be similarly accomplished by placing a photomask underneath the conductor film/substrate support web and in this case the UV light radiates through the photomask from the bottom and the substrate needs to be transparent to radiation.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The photolithography methodology described in the previous three paragraphs may be utilized to manufacture the benefit agent delivery system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, wherein each of the plurality of microcells has two openings, a first opening and a second opening at opposite sides of the microcell, wherein the first electrode layer spans the second opening and the porous second electrode layer spans the first opening.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Imagewise Exposure. Still another alternative method for the preparation of the microcell array of the invention by imagewise exposure is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>C and <b>6</b>D</figref>. When opaque conductor lines are used, the conductor lines can be used as the photomask for the exposure from the bottom. Durable microcell walls are formed by additional exposure from the top through a second photomask having opaque lines perpendicular to the conductor lines. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> illustrates the use of both the top and bottom exposure principles to produce the microcell array <b>610</b> of the invention. The base conductor film <b>612</b> is opaque and line-patterned. The radiation curable material <b>611</b><i>a</i>, which is coated on the base conductor <b>612</b> and substrate <b>613</b>, is exposed from the bottom through the conductor line pattern <b>612</b>, which serves as the first photomask.

The spaces <b>615</b> between the lines <b>614</b> are substantially transparent to the UV light. In this process, the wall material <b>611</b><i>b </i>is cured from the bottom up in one lateral orientation, and cured from the top down in the perpendicular direction, joining to form an integral microcell <b>617</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>, the unexposed area is then removed by a solvent or developer as described above to reveal the microcells <b>617</b>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The microcells may be constructed from thermoplastic elastomers, which have good compatibility with the microcells and do not interact with the media. Examples of useful thermoplastic elastomers include ABA, and (AB)n type of di-block, tri-block, and multi-block copolymers wherein A is styrene, &#x3b1;-methylstyrene, ethylene, propylene or norbornene; B is butadiene, isoprene, ethylene, propylene, butylene, dimethylsiloxane or propylene sulfide; and A and B cannot be the same in the formula. The number, n, is &#x2265;1, preferably 1-10. Particularly useful are di-block or tri-block copolymers of styrene or ox-methylstyrene such as SB (poly(styrene-b-butadiene)), SBS (poly(styrene-b-butadiene-b-styrene)), SIS (poly(styrene-b-isoprene-b-styrene)), SEBS (poly(styrene-b-ethylene/butylenes-b-styrene)) poly(styrene-b-dimethylsiloxane-b-styrene), poly((&#x3b1;-methylstyrene-b-isoprene), poly(&#x3b1;-methylstyrene-b-isoprene-b-&#x3b1;-methylstyrene), poly(&#x3b1;-methylstyrene-b-propylene sulfide-b-&#x3b1;-methylstyrene), poly(&#x3b1;-methylstyrene-b-dimethylsiloxane-b-&#x3b1;-methylstyrene). Commercially available styrene block copolymers such as Kraton D and G series (from Kraton Polymer, Houston, Tex.) are particularly useful. Crystalline rubbers such as poly(ethylene-co-propylene-co-5-methylene-2-norbomene) or EPDM (ethylene-propylene-diene terpolymer) rubbers such as Vistalon 6505 (from Exxon Mobil, Houston, Tex.) and their grafted copolymers have also been found very useful.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The thermoplastic elastomers may be dissolved in a solvent or solvent mixture, which is immiscible with the carrier in the microcells and exhibits a specific gravity less than that of the carrier. Low surface tension solvents are preferred for the overcoating composition because of their better wetting properties over the microcell walls and the fluid. Solvents or solvent mixtures having a surface tension lower than 35 dyne/cm are preferred. A surface tension of lower than 30 dyne/cm is more preferred. Suitable solvents include alkanes (preferably C<sub>6-12 </sub>alkanes such as heptane, octane or Isopar solvents from Exxon Chemical Company, nonane, decane and their isomers), cycloalkanes (preferably C<sub>6-12 </sub>cycloalkanes such cyclohexane and decalin and the like), alkylbezenes (preferably mono- or di-C<sub>1-6 </sub>alkyl benzenes such as toluene, xylene and the like), alkyl esters (preferably C<sub>2-5 </sub>alkyl esters such as ethyl acetate, isobutyl acetate and the like) and C<sub>3-5 </sub>alkyl alcohols (such as isopropanol and the like and their isomers). Mixtures of alkylbenzene and alkane are particularly useful.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In addition to polymer additives, the polymer mixtures may also include wetting agents (surfactants). Wetting agents (such as the FC surfactants from 3M Company, Zonyl fluorosurfactants from DuPont, fluoroacrylates, fluoromethacrylates, fluoro-substituted long chain alcohols, perfluoro-substituted long chain carboxylic acids and their derivatives, and Silwet silicone surfactants from OSi, Greenwich, Conn.) may also be included in the composition to improve the adhesion of the layer, which spans the microcell opening (porous second electrode layer or sealing layer) to the microcells and provides a more flexible coating process. Other ingredients including crosslinking agents (e.g., bisazides such as 4,4&#x2032;-diazidodiphenylmethane and 2,6-di-(4&#x2032;-azidobenzal)-4-methylcyclohexanone), vulcanizers (e.g., 2-benzothiazolyl disulfide and tetramethylthiuram disulfide), multifunctional monomers or oligomers (e.g., hexanediol, diacrylates, trimethylolpropane, triacrylate, divinylbenzene, diallylphthalene), thermal initiators (e.g., dilauroryl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide) and photoinitiators (e.g., isopropyl thioxanthone (ITX), Irgacure 651 and Irgacure 369 from Ciba-Geigy) are also highly useful to enhance the physico-mechanical properties of the layer, which spans the microcell opening (porous second electrode layer or sealing layer), by crosslinking or polymerization reactions during or after the overcoating process.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">After the microcells are produced, they are filled with appropriate liquid mixture or liquid mixtures. The microcell array <b>700</b> may be prepared by any of the methods described above.

For example, the hydrophobic liquid may comprise a vegetable, fruit, or nut oil.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The microcells may be filled using a variety of techniques. In some embodiments, where a large number of neighboring microcells are to be filled with an identical composition, blade coating may be used to fill the microcells to the depth of the microcell walls <b>735</b>. In other embodiments, where a variety of different composition are to be filled in a variety of nearby microcell, inkjet-type microinjection can be used to fill the microcells. In yet other embodiment, microneedle arrays may be used to fill an array of microcells with the appropriate liquid mixture(s). The filling may be done in a one-step or multistep process.

This may be a porous second electrode layer or a sealing layer. It may comprise a continuous layer or a discontinuous layer (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>). A polymer composition may be used to form layer <b>770</b>. In some embodiments, the microcell covering/sealing process may involve exposure to heat, dry hot air, or UV radiation. In most embodiments, the polymer should be insoluble or have low solubility with the liquid mixture that is included in the microcells. The polymer composition, which is used to form layer <b>770</b>, can also be biocompatible and selected to adhere to the sides or tops of the microcell walls <b>735</b>. An adhesive can also be used to attach the electrode layer onto layer <b>770</b>. The adhesive may also be electrically conductive. A suitable biocompatible adhesive for sealing layer is a phenethylamine mixture, such as described in U.S. patent application Ser.

The process typically includes coating an array of empty microcells with a layer of positively working photoresist, selectively opening a certain number of the microcells by image-wise exposing the positive photoresist, followed by developing the photoresist, filling the opened microcells with the desired liquid mixture, and covering the opening of the filled microcells. These steps may be repeated to create covered microcells filled with other liquid mixtures. This procedure allows for the formation of large sheets of microcells having the desired ratio of liquid mixtures or concentrations.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In embodiments that the benefit agent delivery system comprises a sealing layer, after the microcells <b>700</b> are filled and sealed, the sealed microcell array may be laminated with the porous second electrode layer comprising a plurality of electrodes <b>795</b>.

The laminate adhesive may be post-cured by radiation such as UV through the first electrode layer if the latter is transparent to the radiation. In other embodiments, the porous second electrode layer comprising the plurality of electrodes <b>795</b> may be bonded directly to the sealed array of the microcell. In some embodiments, a biocompatible adhesive is then laminated to the assembly. The biocompatible adhesive will allow benefit agents to pass through while keeping the device mobile on a user. Suitable biocompatible adhesives are available from 3M (Minneapolis, Minn.).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Once the delivery system has been constructed, it may be covered with a release sheet to provide protection. The release sheet may also include adhesives. The benefit agent delivery system may be flexible. This means that it can be folded to a certain extend without breaking, a property similar to a thin rubber sheet. The benefit agent delivery system can be an autonomous system, which that can be easily transported in a small space, such as a handbag, and only needs electric power, which can be a small battery to operate.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some embodiments, it will not be necessary to provide a benefit agent delivery system comprising two electrode layers on the opposite sides of the system. For instance, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the benefit agent delivery system <b>800</b> may include a voltage source <b>875</b> that is grounded into the surface to which the delivery system is attached <b>892</b>.

Application of an electric field to at least one of the electrodes <b>895</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, may activate the corresponding microcell and trigger the release of the active agent through the porous electrode (or increase the rate of release through the porous electrode). It is appreciated that the porous electrode layer comprises a plurality of electrodes whereby each of the plurality of electrodes can be addressed individually, e.g., with row-column drivers as in an electro-optic display.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Advanced embodiments of a benefit agent delivery system will include circuitry to allow the benefit agent delivery system to be activated wirelessly with a secondary device <b>992</b>, such as a smart phone or smart watch.

In another embodiment, i.e., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the benefit agent delivery system includes a controller <b>1004</b> that independently controls the plurality of electrodes of the electrode layer. Controller <b>104</b> may also be able to receive wireless signals from a secondary device <b>1012</b>. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> will allow a user to control, for example, the type of benefit agent that is delivered and the amount at the desired time. Using an application on the secondary device <b>1012</b> it may be possible to program the benefit agent delivery system to modify the amount of benefit agent based upon the time of day. In other embodiments, the application may be operatively connected to biometric sensors, e.g., a fitness tracker, whereby the application causes the dosage to be turned off if, e.g., the pulse rate of the user exceeds a preset threshold.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">When driving the benefit agent delivery systems of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, NFC, Bluetooth, WIFI, or other wireless communication function is turned on, allowing a user to manipulate the applied voltage across the microcells in order to activate the desired microcells. The activation can be initiated before or after the benefit agent delivery system is applied on the desired surface or location. In addition, benefit agent release adjustment can be achieved at any time when necessary. Because the microcell activation is controlled by smart watch or smart phone, the percentage and area for all of the microcells at different activation status is known, which means all of the usage data will be available to a user or a provider, including the time of the system activation and the amount of the benefit agent(s) administered. Thus, the system may provide a precise control to the user or another person (i.e. a doctor or health provider) to adjust the benefit agent delivery. Because every microcell can be activated independently, the system is programmable. That is, the overall benefit agent delivery can be programmed by activating each of the plurality of microcells when desired. For a benefit agent delivery system, which is designed to deliver benefit agents transdermally, the skin irritation can be mitigated, because the benefit agent can be released over a period of time. Additionally, in drug delivery applications, patient compliance can be done effectively, because the smart device, which is used to activate the system, can remotely communicate with the physician for data sharing.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">It is to be understood that the invention is not limited to combinations of benefit agents in the microcell, as different benefit agents can be delivered by adding those benefit agents to additional layers of the benefit agent delivery system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> exemplifies a benefit agent delivery system that comprises in order, a backing layer <b>1110</b>, a first electrode layer <b>1120</b>, a microcell layer <b>1135</b>, a sealing layer <b>1160</b>, an adhesive layer <b>1180</b>, a porous second electrode layer <b>1190</b>, and a release sheet <b>1115</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the benefit agents may be present in, for example, the adhesive layer <b>1180</b>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Area A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> exemplified two different benefit agents being loaded into the microcell layer <b>1135</b> and the adhesive layer <b>1180</b>. In some embodiments, the two benefit agents may be delivered at the same time. They may also have different delivery profiles. The system also provides a way to deliver different benefit agents with different physical properties, such as different hydrophobicities. For example, a hydrophilic benefit agent can be loaded into the plurality of microcells at high loading. In this embodiment, the adhesive layer may include a hydrophobic benefit agent. Accordingly, the release profile of the two benefit agents can also be adjusted nearly independently. This system overcomes the problem of stabilizing a benefit agent with unfavorable solubility with, e.g., surfactants, capsules, etc.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Area B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment in which the same benefit agent is loaded in both the microcells and the adhesive layer <b>1180</b>. Depending on the characteristics of the benefit agent, this method can help to load larger quantities of benefit agent into the benefit agent delivery system, which can help to increase the benefit agent release amount and control the release profile.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Area C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment in which a combination of benefit agents is loaded either into the microcell, or into the adhesive layer <b>1180</b>, or into both layers. The benefit agents in the microcell composition and adhesive layer can be the same or different. The number of benefit agents in the microcell formulation and the number of benefit agents in the adhesive layer can also be the same or different.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">A benefit agent-loading layer <b>1285</b> can be also included into the benefit agent delivery system adjacent to the release sheet <b>1215</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. The amount and types of benefit agents in the benefit agent-loading layer <b>1285</b> can be independent of the loading in the microcells and/or in the adhesive layer. The benefit agent can be introduced into only some portions of the adhesive layer, or it can present in both adhesive <b>1280</b> and the benefit agent-loading layer <b>1285</b>. The benefit agent-loading layer <b>1285</b> may be porous. In another example, the benefit-loading layer may be located between the sealing layer <b>1260</b> and the adhesive layer <b>1280</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The benefit agent delivery system may also comprise a porous diffusion layer or a rate control layer that is disposed between the sealing layer and the electrode layer. If there is an adhesive layer adjacent to the sealing layer, the porous diffusion layer or the rate control layer may be disposed between the adhesive layer and the electrode layer. The porous diffusion layer or the rate control layer and the adhesive layer may be integrated into one layer, which may have volume resistivity of less than 10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>Ohm*cm, or less than 10<sup>&#x2212;9 </sup>Ohm*cm. That is, the porous diffusion layer or the rate control layer may also serve as an adhesive layer, establishing an adhesive connection between the sealing layer and the electrode layer. The porous diffusion layer or the rate control layer and the electrode layer may also be integrated into one layer.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The porous diffusion layer may have average pore size larger than 0.2 nm. The rate control layer may have average pore size of 0.2 nm and smaller. The porous diffusion layer and the rate control layer may control the rate of release of the benefit agent by its porosity, pore size, layer thickness, the chemical structure, and the polarity of the material from which it is constructed. Thus, for example, a rate control layer, positioned adjacent to the sealing layer or adjacent to the electrode layer, and made with a nonpolar polymer such as polyethylene having some porosity level may reduce the rate of release of relatively polar benefit agents, such as, for example benefit agents that are soluble or dispersible in water. In addition, a rate control layer having low porosity or higher thickness may slow down the delivery of benefit agents.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">As mentioned above, various layers of the benefit agent delivery system may be combined or integrated in a single layer. For example, an adhesive layer an adjacent porous second electrode layer may also be integrated into one layer. The same may be true for the combination of the porous diffusion layer or the rate control layer and the porous second electrode layer, the combination of the sealing layer and the benefit agent-loading layer, the combination of the benefit agent-loading layer and the rate control layer, etc.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The benefit agent delivery system of the present invention may be operated by a method comprising the steps of:</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">(1) Providing a benefit agent delivery system comprising (a) a first electrode layer, (b) a microcell layer comprising a plurality of microcells, wherein each microcell includes an opening, and wherein each microcell contains a liquid mixture, wherein the liquid mixture comprises reverse micelles in a hydrophobic liquid that are formed from a polar liquid, an anionic or cationic surfactant, and a benefit agent, (d) a porous second electrode layer spanning the opening of each microcell, and (e) a voltage source that is coupled to the first electrode layer and the porous second electrode layer; wherein the first electrode layer, the microcell layer, and the porous second electrode layer are vertically stacked upon each other;</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">(2) Applying a first voltage on a microcell via the voltage source that causes the migration of the reverse micelles of the microcell towards the porous second electrode, increases the rate of release of the benefit agent through the porous second electrode layer compared to the rate of release of the benefit agent through the porous second electrode layer when no voltage is applied;</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">(3) Applying a second voltage on a microcell via the voltage source, the second voltage having polarity opposite to the polarity of the first voltage, that causes the migration of the reverse micelles of the microcell away from the porous second electrode and reduces the rate of release of the benefit agent through the porous second electrode layer compared to the rate of release of the benefit agent through the porous second electrode layer when no voltage is applied.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">The rate of release of the benefit agent of a microcell of the benefit agent delivery system may be increased or decreased depending on the polarity of the electric field applied across the microcell compared to rate of release of the benefit agent from the microcell without application of an electric field. Furthermore, the rate of increase or decrease can be controlled by the amplitude of the voltage and the period of time that the voltage is applied. For example, in the case of reverse micelles stabilized by an anionic surfactant, wherein application of a first voltage makes the porous second electrode layer at a microcell positive, the higher the amplitude of the applied first voltage, the higher is the increase in the rate of release of the benefit agent of the microcell. Analogously, the longer the first voltage is applied across the microcell, the higher is the increase in the rate of release of the benefit agent of the microcell. In the case of reverse micelles stabilized by an anionic surfactant, wherein application of a second voltage makes the porous second electrode layer at a microcell negative, the higher the amplitude of the applied second voltage, the higher is the decrease of the rate of release of the benefit agent of the microcell.

Thus, the system has the flexibility of delivering variable quantities of benefit agents at different times. Additionally, the microcell arrays may be loaded with different benefit agents, thereby providing a mechanism to deliver different or complimentary benefit agents on demand.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">In addition to more conventional applications, such as transdermal delivery of pharmaceutical compounds, the benefit agent delivery system may be the basis for delivering agricultural nutrients. The microcell arrays can be fabricated in large sheets that can be used in conjunction with hydroponic growing systems, or they can be integrated into hydrogel film farming, such as demonstrated by Mebiol, Inc. (Kanagawa, Japan). The benefit agent delivery system can be incorporated into the structural walls of smart packing, as well. The delivery system, for example, makes it possible to have long-term release of antioxidants into a package containing fresh vegetables or other items. Such packaging could dramatically improve the shelf life of certain foods and other items yet will only require the amount of antioxidant necessary to maintain freshness until the package is opened.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The effect of the application of an electrical field on the rate of release of a water soluble benefit agent via a porous substrate may be determined using a Franz cell as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.
