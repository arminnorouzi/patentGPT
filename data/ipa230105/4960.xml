Technical Considerations</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many events, such as auto shows, farmers markets, and the like take place in locations where network connectivity may be limited, unreliable, and/or non-existent. As a result, parties to transactions in these locations may forego the use of electronic payment processing methods and revert to traditional paper-money based transactions. Similarly, local area networks (e.g., via Wi-Fi&#xae; networks and/or the like) that enable communication with a payment processing network (e.g., via the Internet) may suffer from interference as the amount of devices connecting to the local area network increases, resulting in slowed or impeded network connectivity. In this situation, parties may forego the use of electronic payment processing methods. Presently, systems and methods do not exist which are able to efficiently and effectively allow parties to engage in the use of electronic payment processing when network connectivity is impaired.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, and generally, provided are improved systems, methods, and apparatus for exchanging transaction data.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to some non-limiting embodiments or aspects, provided is a computer-implemented method for exchanging transaction data, the computer-implemented method comprising: transmitting, with at least one processor, a first public encryption key via a near field communication (NFC) connection, the first public encryption key of a first computing device;

For example, users (e.g., customers) operating user devices to communicate with merchant devices operated by merchants (e.g., NFC transponder devices (e.g., smartphones, mobile point-of-sale (POS) devices, and/or the like) and/or passive NFC transponder devices (e.g., NFC transponder tags)) may cause a user device to initiate or otherwise engage in electronic transactions to complete a purchase. In some non-limiting embodiments or aspects, user devices and/or merchant devices operated during a transaction may determine that a connection to a transaction service provider system cannot be established (e.g., a connection to a transaction service provider system is unavailable). For example, where a network communication connection cannot be established between devices (e.g., a connection to a communication network is unavailable), and a transaction service provider system to communicate data, the devices may communicate data via a short range wireless communication connection. Once a network communication connection is established between the devices and a transaction service provider system, data (e.g., transaction data associated with a transaction, a message associated with a transaction, and/or the like) may be transmitted to a transaction service provider system. Additionally, or alternatively, in some non-limiting embodiments or aspects, devices transmitting data to a transaction service provider system may encrypt some or all of the data prior to transmission. For example, a user device and/or a merchant device may encrypt some or all of the transaction data associated with a transaction and/or a transaction message associated with the transaction prior to or after transmitting the transaction data with the other of the user device or the merchant device. In some non-limiting embodiments or aspects, a user device and/or a merchant device may store transaction data associated with a transaction in memory (fully, partially, or not encrypted). For example, a user device and/or a merchant device may store transaction data associated with a transaction in secured memory (e.g., a region of memory of the user device and/or the merchant device that is access-controlled) until network communication connectivity with a transaction service provider system is established. In this way, transaction processing is improved in that customers and merchants may engage in secured transactions electronically where a network communication connection to a transaction service provider system cannot be established. Moreover, the security of these transactions may be maintained by encrypting some or all of the transaction data associated with the transaction until a device attempting to communicate with a transaction service provider system is able to upload the transaction data.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, illustrated is a system <b>100</b> for exchanging transaction data when connections to a transaction service provider cannot be established.
