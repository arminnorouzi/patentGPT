Further, standardization of techniques for avoiding increase in a control signaling load due to connections of an enormous number of Machine to Machine (M2M) terminals to an LTE network has been performed (Non-Patent Literature 1). The M2M terminals are, for example, terminals that perform communication without human intervention. The M2M terminals are placed in various types of equipment including machines (e.g., vending machines, gas meters, electric meters, vehicles, railway vehicles, and ships) and sensors (e.g., environmental, agricultural, and traffic sensors). In the LTE, communication performed by the M2M terminals are referred to as Machine Type Communications (MTC) and a terminal performing the MTC is referred to as an MTC terminal (MTC User Equipment (MTC UE)).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">While M2M service providers need to distribute an enormous number of M2M terminals, there is a limit to the cost allowable for each M2M terminal. Therefore, it is required M2M terminals be implemented at a low cost, and M2M terminals be able to perform communication with low power consumption, for example. Further, in one use case, MTC UEs perform communication while they are fixedly or statically installed in buildings. In this case, the radio quality of MTC UEs may be always low and accordingly coverage enhancement technique is especially needed for MTC devices compared to normal UEs having mobility (e.g., mobile telephones, smartphones, tablet computers, and notebook personal computers (notebook PCs)). Further, functional restrictions contributing to reduction of the cost include, for example, a low maximum transmission power, a small number of reception antennas, no support of high-order modulation schemes (e.g., 64 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (64 QAM)), and a narrow operating bandwidth (e.g., 1.25 MHz), which lower the maximum transmission rate of MTC UEs. Therefore, in the LTE, standardization of techniques for enhancing communication characteristics of MTC UEs (i.e., coverage), which are expected to be lower than those of normal UE has been performed (Non-Patent Literature 2). In the following description, some examples of the techniques for enhancing coverage of MTC UEs discussed in the LTE are described. It can be said that the coverage enhancement techniques (coverage enhancement processing) for MTC UEs described below are processing for enhancing or improving communication characteristics or communication quality of MTC UEs. The state of a UE to which these special coverage enhancement techniques has been applied is referred to as a coverage enhancement mode (Enhanced Coverage Mode (ECM)).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The ECM can improve, for example, a reception characteristic of a Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH), a transmission characteristic of a Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) preamble (i.e., detection characteristic in an eNB), a reception characteristic of a Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH), and a transmission characteristic of a Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH). The PBCH is a downlink broadcast channel used by an eNB to transmit broadcast information commonly used within a cell. The PRACH is an uplink physical channel used by a UE for an initial access to a radio base station (eNB). The PDSCH is a downlink physical channel used for data reception by a UE. The PUSCH is an uplink physical channel used for data transmission by a UE.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One processing that is being discussed to improve a reception characteristic of the PBCH is to repeatedly transmit broadcast information on the PBCH a number of extra times as compared to the normal operation by a predetermined number of times (Non-Patent Literature 3). One processing that is being discussed to improve a transmission characteristic of the PRACH is to repeatedly transmit the PRACH (i.e., preamble) a predetermined number of times (Non-Patent Literature 4). Further, one processing that is being discussed to improve a reception characteristic of the PDSCH and a transmission characteristic of the PUSCH is to repeatedly transmit the PDSCH and the PUSCH over multiple subframes (Non-Patent Literature 5). According to the above processing, communication characteristics of MTC UEs that is expected to be lower than that of normal UEs will be improved.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is expected that the coverage enhancement processing in the ECM is performed for MTC UEs that perform a delay tolerant access. The delay tolerant access is defined as being a new EstablishmentCause that is specified in an RRC Connection Request message and is used, for example, to control an overload. The delay tolerant access is mainly intended for MTC UEs that execute a delay-tolerant MTC application. For example, in a metering service (meter reading service), there is no need to send a metering report to a remote system in real time (or in exact communication cycles) and a long delay may be allowed for the transmission of the metering report. When an eNB imposes overload control on the delay tolerant access, the eNB may reject an RRC Connection Request transmitted by a RRC Connection Request message that contains &#x201c;EstablishmentCause&#x201d; indicating the delay tolerant access.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Non Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0008">[Non-Patent Literature 1] 3GPP TR 37.868 V11.0.0 (2011-09), &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network; Study on RAN Improvements for Machine-type Communications; (Release 11)&#x201d;, September, 2011</li>    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0009">[Non-Patent Literature 2] 3GPP TR 36.888 V12.0.0 (2013-06), &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network; Study on provision of low-cost Machine-Type Communications (MTC) User Equipments (UEs) based on LTE (Release 12)&#x201d;, June, 2013</li>    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0010">[Non-Patent Literature 3] 3GPP R1-135943, Vodafone, &#x201c;Way Forward on P-BCH for MTC enhanced coverage&#x201d;, 3GPP TSG RAN WG1 #75, San Francisco, USA, 11-15 Nov. 2013</li>    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0011">[Non-Patent Literature 4] 3GPP R1-135944, Vodafone, &#x201c;Way Forward on PRACH for MTC enhanced coverage&#x201d;, 3GPP TSG RAN WG1 #75, San Francisco, USA, 11-15 Nov. 2013</li>    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0012">[Non-Patent Literature 5] 3GPP R1-136001, Vodafone et al. &#x201c;Way forward on PDCCH, PDSCH, PUCCH and PUSCH for MTC enhanced coverage&#x201d;, 3GPP TSG RAN WG1 #75, San Francisco, USA, 11-15 Nov. 2013</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0013">The present inventor has examined many problems that are caused when the coverage enhancement processing in the ECM is applied to MTC UEs (M2M terminals). For example, while PBCH repetition is commonly applied to MTC UEs in a cell, RACH repetition and PDSCH/PUSCH repetition are separately applied to each MTC UE.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0014">In one example, an eNB may determine whether the ECM, in particular, coverage enhancement processing on a per-MTC-UE basis (e.g., RACH repetition and PDSCH/PUSCH repetition) is required for a specific MTC UE or not. Since PDSCH/PUSCH repetition requires allocation of radio resources by an eNB, it may be reasonable that the necessity of the coverage enhancement processing on a per-MTC-UE basis is determined by the eNB.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">On the other hand, however, that the necessity of the ECM is determined by an eNB may cause problems. For example, If an MTC UE cannot start the ECM until an eNB has determined the necessity of the ECM (in particular, the coverage enhancement processing on a per-MTC-UE basis) for this specific MTC UE, the MTC UE cannot benefit from the improvement of communication characteristics by the ECM until the determination in the eNB has been completed. This may cause increase in delay time until the MTC UE becomes able to benefit from the improvement of communication characteristics by the ECM. Accordingly, in the worst case, the MTC UE may fail the first access to the eNB (e.g., random access on the PRACH, or procedure for establishing a radio connection (Radio Resource Control (RRC) Connection)).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">In view of the above, one exemplary object of embodiments disclosed in the specification is to provide an MTC UE (M2M terminal), a base station, a method, and a program that are improved to allow the MTC UE to determine necessity of special coverage enhancement processing for MTC UEs (e.g., coverage enhancement processing in the ECM).

This radio communication system provides communication services, such as voice communication or packet data communication or both, for example. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the radio communication system includes M2M terminals <b>11</b> (<b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B, <b>11</b>C), a normal radio terminal <b>12</b> which is not an M2M terminal, a base station <b>13</b>, and a core network <b>14</b>. The radio terminal <b>12</b> is, for example, a mobile telephone, a smartphone, a tablet computer, or a notebook PC. The M2M terminals <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B, and <b>11</b>C, and the radio terminal <b>12</b> are located in a cell <b>130</b> of the base station <b>13</b>. In this embodiment, the radio communication system is described as being a 3GPP LTE system. That is, the M2M terminals <b>11</b> correspond to MTC UEs, the radio terminal <b>12</b> corresponds to a normal UE which is not an MTC UE, the base station <b>13</b> corresponds to an eNodeB (eNB), and the core network <b>14</b> corresponds to an Evolved Packet Core (EPC).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the distance between the MTC UE <b>11</b>A and the eNB <b>13</b> is larger than the distance between the MTC UE <b>11</b>B and the eNB <b>13</b>. Accordingly, it is assumed that the MTC UE <b>11</b>A has a large pathloss and its radio quality is degraded. Further, the MTC UE <b>11</b>C is installed in a building and, accordingly, it is thus assumed that its radio quality is more degraded compared to a case in which the MTC UE <b>11</b>C is located outdoors. Furthermore, if the capabilities or functions of the MTC UEs <b>11</b> (<b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B, and <b>11</b>C) are limited compared to those of the normal UE <b>12</b> (e.g., a lower maximum transmission power, a smaller number of reception antennas, no support of high-order modulations), it is expected that degradation in radio quality of the MTC UEs <b>11</b> will become more serious. Therefore, the MTC UEs <b>11</b> according to this embodiment are configured to support the aforementioned Enhanced Coverage Mode (ECM) and to perform coverage enhancement processing in the ECM.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0035">As already stated above, the coverage enhancement processing in the ECM can be said as processing for enhancing or improving communication characteristics (communication quality) of MTC UEs. As already stated above, the coverage enhancement processing in the ECM may include at least one of the following processing (a) to (d) or may include other processing (e.g., (e) and (f)):<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0036">(a) Repeatedly transmitting broadcast information on a PBCH a number of extra times as compared to the normal operation by a predetermined number of times;</li>    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0037">(b) Repeatedly transmitting a PPACH (PRACH preamble) a predetermined number of times;</li>    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0038">(c) Repeatedly transmitting a PDSCH over multiple subframes;</li>    <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0039">(d) Repeatedly transmitting a PUSCH over multiple subframes;</li>    <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0040">(e) Increasing the power spectral density (PSD) of one or both of a PDSCH and a PUSCH (PSD boosting); and</li>    <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0041">(f) Performing frequency hopping during repetitive transmission of one or both of a PDSCH and a PUSCH.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0033" num="0042">The subframe is a unit constituting a LTE radio frame. One radio frame has a length of ten milliseconds and is composed of ten subframes. Therefore, one subframe has a length of one millisecond. One subframe includes 14 symbols in a time domain (single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) symbols in uplink and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols in downlink).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0043">In the following description, communication control for the ECM according to this embodiment is described. The eNB <b>13</b> according to this embodiment transmits, in the cell <b>130</b>, a first notification indicating that specific coverage enhancement processing for MTC UEs (M2M terminals) (i.e., the coverage enhancement processing in the ECM) is supported in the cell <b>130</b> of the eNB <b>13</b>. The first notification may indicate whether the ECM is supported, on a per-base-station basis (i.e., supported in all the cells of the eNB <b>13</b>) or on a per-cell basis. The MTC UE <b>11</b> receives the first notification from the eNB <b>13</b>. The MTC UE <b>11</b> then transmits a second notification to the eNB <b>13</b> after reception of the first notification. The MTC UE <b>11</b> may transmit the second notification in response to receiving the first notification from the eNB <b>13</b>. The MTC UE <b>11</b> transmits the second notification to the eNB <b>13</b> when establishing a radio connection (RRC Connection) with the eNB <b>13</b> or while performing a procedure for establishing a bearer between the MTC UE <b>11</b> and the EPC <b>14</b> (i.e., Evolved Packet System (EPS) bearer). The second notification indicates that the coverage enhancement processing in the ECM is required by the MTC UE <b>11</b> or is being executed by the MTC UE <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0044">According to this embodiment, the following effects can be expected. That is, if the MTC UE <b>11</b> cannot start the ECM until the eNB <b>13</b> has determined the necessity of the ECM for the MTC UE <b>11</b> (in particular, the coverage enhancement processing dedicated for the specific MTC UE <b>11</b>), the MTC UE <b>11</b> cannot benefit from the improvement of communication characteristics by the ECM until the determination in the eNB <b>13</b> has been completed. This may cause increase in delay time until the MTC UE <b>11</b> becomes able to benefit from the enhancement of communication characteristics by the ECM. Accordingly, in the worst case, the MTC UE <b>11</b> fails the first access to the eNB <b>13</b> (e.g., random access on the PRACH, or procedure for establishing a radio connection (RRC Connection)).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0045">In order to deal with these problems, the eNB <b>13</b> according to this embodiment transmits the aforementioned first notification in the cell <b>130</b>. Accordingly, the MTC UE <b>11</b> according to this embodiment can know that the ECM is supported in the cell <b>130</b> of the eNB <b>13</b> and can transmit the second notification, which indicates the coverage enhancement processing in the ECM is required or being executed by the MTC UE <b>11</b>, to the eNB <b>13</b> when establishing a radio connection (RRC Connection) or while performing an EPS bearer establishment procedure. In most cases, UEs including the MTC UEs <b>11</b> measure the radio quality in an idle state before transitioning from an idle state (RRC_IDLE) to a connected state (RRC_CONNECTED) at a periodic or non-periodic communication opportunity. Accordingly, the MTC UE <b>11</b> may receive the first notification from the eNB during the idle state and determine the necessity of the ECM based on the radio quality, which is measured during the idle state, prior to arrival of a communication opportunity. It is therefore possible to contribute to a reduction in delay time (delay time until the ECM is started) due to waiting for determination by the eNB <b>13</b> of necessity of the ECM after arrival of the communication opportunity.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0046">The terms &#x201c;idle state&#x201d; and &#x201c;connected state&#x201d; used in the specification is defined as follows. The &#x201c;idle state&#x201d; is a state in which a radio connection between a UE and an eNB has been released. Accordingly, the eNB has no information (UE context) regarding the UE in the idle state. The location of the UE in the idle state is tracked by a core network at location-registration-area level (e.g., tracking area or routing area). The core network can reach the UE in the idle state by paging. Further, the UE in the idle state cannot perform unicast data transmission to or from the eNB. Accordingly, the UE in the idle state should transition to the connected state in order to perform unicast data transmission. Examples of the idle state include: (1) an RRC idle state in a Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN); (2) an RRC_IDLE state in an Evolved UTRAN (E-UTRAN); and (3) an Idle state in WiMAX (IEEE 802.16-2004), mobile WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e-2005), and WiMAX<b>2</b> (IEEE 802.16m).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0047">On the other hand, the connected state is a state in which the UE is connected to the eNB. Accordingly, the eNB has information (UE context) regarding the UE in the connected state. The location of the UE in the connected state is tracked by the core network at cell level or base-station level. In most cases, the UE in the connected state can perform unicast data transmission to and from the eNB. However, when the UE is in a CELL_PCH state and a URA_PCH state in the UTRAN, the UE context is held by a base station (NodeB), but no dedicated channel is allocated to the UE either in uplink or in downlink. Examples of the connected state include: (1) an RRC connected state in the UTRAN; (2) an RRC_CONNECTED state in the E-UTRAN; and (3) a connected state in the WiMAX, the mobile WiMAX, and the WiMAX<b>2</b>. Note that, the RRC connected state in the UTRAN includes a CELL_DCH state, a CELL_FACH state, a CELL_PCH state, and a URA_PCH state.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0048">Next, specific examples of a method of transmitting the first notification from the eNB <b>13</b> to the MTC UE <b>11</b> and a method of transmitting the second notification to the eNB <b>13</b> from the MTC UE <b>11</b> are described.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0049">It is preferable that the first notification is transmitted on a broadcast channel that can be received by the MTC UEs <b>11</b> having no radio connection (RRC connection) with the eNB <b>13</b>, i.e., the MTC UEs <b>11</b> in the idle state. In other words, preferably, the first notification is broadcast information that can be received by the MTC UEs <b>11</b> in the idle state. Specifically, a Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH), which is one of the logic channels in the LTE, may be used for transmitting the first notification.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0050">More specifically, the first notification is preferably transmitted on a broadcast channel that can be received by each MTC UE <b>11</b> that is in the idle state (RCC_IDLE) and further in a detach state (EMM-DEREGISTERED). The detach state (EMM-DEREGISTERED) is one of EPS Mobility Management (EMM) states in the LTE. That is, the detach state (EMM-DEREGISTERED) is a state in which the UE is not registered in a mobility management element (e.g., Mobility Management Entity (MME)) in the core network (e.g., EPC) and the mobility management of the UE is not performed. The location information of the UE in the detach state is not tracked by the MME, and, accordingly, the UE in the detach state is unreachable from the core network (EPC) by paging. The UE in the detach state needs to perform an initial cell selection (i.e., initial cell research), establish a radio connection with the eNB, and perform location registration in the core network (EPC), prior to performing communication. The BCCH can also be received by each MTC UE <b>11</b> that is in the idle state (RCC_IDLE) and further in the detach state (EMM-DEREGISTERED).</p><p id="p-0042" num="0051">The BCCH is mapped to a transport channel, i.e., a Broadcast Channel (BCH) or a Downlink Shared Channel (DL-SCH). Further, the BCH, which the BCCH has been mapped to, is transmitted by the eNB <b>13</b> using a physical channel, i.e., a Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH). The PBCH is transmitted using a predetermined resource block of the first subframe in each radio frame and is updated at a period of 40 milliseconds (at a period of four radio frames). The broadcast information transmitted on the PBCH is a Master Information Block (MIB). Therefore, the first notification may be contained in the MIB.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0052">On the other hand, the DL-SCH, which the BCCH has been mapped to, is transmitted by the eNB <b>13</b> using a physical channel, i.e., a Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH). Although the PDSCH is mainly used to transmit user data, transmission of the BCCH (i.e., broadcast information) is specified as one of the special uses of the PDSCH. The resource block used for the BCCH (broadcast information) is indicated by a control message in a Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). The broadcast information transmitted on the PDSCH is System Information Blocks (SIBs). Therefore, the first notification may be contained in one of the existing SIBs (e.g., System Information Block Type 1 (SIB1)). Alternatively, the first notification may be contained in an SIB that is newly defined for the M2M, MTC UEs, or ECM.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0053">The first notification may indicate whether the ECM is supported in the cell <b>130</b> of the eNB <b>13</b> either explicitly (e.g., flag bit) or implicitly. The first notification may indicate whether the ECM is supported, on a per-base-station basis (i.e., supported in all the cells of the eNB <b>13</b>) or on a per-cell basis. The implicit first notification may include configuration information for the coverage enhancement processing in the ECM (ECM radio resource configuration or ECM configuration).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0054">The ECM radio resource configuration or ECM configuration may include, for example, at least one of the following information items:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0055">Configuration information regarding reception of broadcast information (PBCH);</li>    <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0056">Configuration information regarding reception of system information (System Information Block (SIB));</li>    <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0057">Configuration information regarding reception of paging (Paging Channel (PCH));</li>    <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0058">Configuration information regarding reception of downlink control information (Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH));</li>    <li id="ul0003-0005" num="0059">Configuration information regarding reception of downlink data (PDSCH);</li>    <li id="ul0003-0006" num="0060">Configuration information regarding transmission of uplink control information (Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH));</li>    <li id="ul0003-0007" num="0061">Configuration information regarding transmission of uplink data (PUSCH); and</li>    <li id="ul0003-0008" num="0062">Configuration information regarding measurement reporting of radio quality (Measurement Report).</li></ul></p><p id="p-0046" num="0063">The configuration information regarding reception of the broadcast information (PBCH) and the configuration information regarding reception of the system information (SIB) may be, for example, information indicating which subframe(s) and/or which OFDM symbol(s) is used to repeatedly transmit the broadcast information and (which kind of) system information. The configuration information regarding reception of paging may be, for example, information indicating which subframe(s) is used to repeatedly transmit paging. The configuration information regarding reception of the downlink control information (PDCCH) and reception of the downlink data (PDSCH) may be, for example, information indicating how many times they are repeatedly transmitted or may be information indicating which subframe(s) is used for repeatedly transmitting them. The configuration information regarding transmission of the uplink control information (PUCCH) and the transmission of the uplink data (PUSCH) may be, for example, information indicating how many times they are repeatedly transmitted or may be information indicating which subframe(s) is used for repeatedly transmitting them. The configuration information regarding measurement reporting of radio quality may be an offset value or a threshold applied to the measurement result of the radio quality while the ECM is being executed or may be an offset value or a threshold applied to determination on the report of the measurement result of the radio quality while the ECM is being executed.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0064">Next, the second notification is described in detail. The second notification may be transmitted using, for example, a message for requesting establishment of a radio connection (RRC connection), i.e., an RRC Connection Request message. Since an RRC Connection Request message is transmitted first in the RRC connection establishment procedure, it can also be said that the second notification is transmitted during a procedure for establishing a radio connection (RRC connection). From another point of view, the RRC Connection Request message is transmitted in a third step of a random access procedure (Random Access Channel (RACH) procedure). Accordingly, if the RRC Connection Request message is used, it can also be said that the second notification is transmitted during a random access procedure (RACH procedure).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0065">In another example, the second notification may be transmitted using a completion message indicating completion of establishment of the radio connection (RRC connection), i.e., an RRC Connection Setup Complete message. Since the RRC Connection Setup Complete message is the final message transmitted during an RRC connection establishment procedure, it can be said that the second notification is transmitted during a procedure for establishing a radio connection (RRC connection). Further, the RRC Connection Setup Complete message contains a NAS message (e.g., NAS: Service Request, NAS: Attach Request). The RRC Connection Setup Complete message containing a NAS message is the first message transmitted during a procedure for establishing an EPS bearer. Therefore, if the RRC Connection Setup Complete message is used, it can be said that the second notification is transmitted during a bearer establishment procedure.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0066">By using the RRC Connection Request message or the RRC Connection Setup Complete message for transmitting the second notification, the MTC UE <b>11</b> can promptly inform the eNB <b>13</b> that the MTC UE <b>11</b> requires the ECM or is executing the ECM, during a procedure for establishing a radio connection. Thus, for example, the eNB <b>13</b> can include the ECM configuration in the configuration of the radio connection to be established for the MTC UE <b>11</b> and can promptly start communication with the MTC UE <b>11</b> using the coverage enhancement processing in the ECM. It is needless to say that, from the viewpoint of establishment of the radio connection (RRC connection), the second notification may be transmitted using an RRC Connection Reestablishment Complete message, which is similar to the RRC Connection Setup Complete message.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0067">In another example, the second notification may be transmitted during a random access procedure (RACH procedure) performed prior to establishment of the radio connection (RRC connection). Specifically, PRACH preamble transmission in the first step of the random access procedure (RACH procedure) may be used for transmitting the second notification. In this case, the second notification may implicitly indicate that the ECM is required or being executed by the MTC UE <b>11</b> by the MTC UE <b>11</b> using a specific radio resource (e.g., time, frequency, code, or preamble sequence) allocated for the ECM among a plurality of radio resources for the PRACH.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0068">Since only a PRACH preamble can be transmitted on the PRACH, it may be difficult to indicate the details of the ECM required or being executed by the MTC UE <b>11</b> (e.g., which one or more of coverage enhancement processes are specifically required). Therefore, the aforementioned RRC Connection Request message or RRC Connection Setup Complete message may be more suitable for transmission of the second notification. However, by using the PRACH preamble for transmitting the second notification, it is possible to notify the eNB <b>13</b> of the information, which indicates whether the ECM is required or being executed by the MTC UE <b>11</b>, much faster compared to using the RRC Connection Request message or RRC Connection Setup Complete message.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0069">In the following description, specific examples of processing for determining whether the ECM is required by the MTC UE <b>11</b> are described. In response to detecting that the ECM is supported in the cell <b>130</b> of the eNB <b>13</b> based on the first notification from the eNB <b>13</b>, the MTC UE <b>11</b> may determine whether the ECM (that is, the coverage enhancement processing in the ECM) is required in the MTC UE <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0070">When the MTC UE <b>11</b> determines that the ECM is required, the MTC UE <b>11</b> may start one or more executable processes selected from a plurality of coverage enhancement processes in the ECM. The MTC UE <b>11</b> may start, for example, reception of a PBCH that is repeatedly transmitted, or repeated transmission of a PRACH preamble in a random access procedure, or both of them. Accordingly, the second notification may indicate that the ECM is being executed by the MTC UE <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0071">On the other hand, for example, PDSCH/PUSCH repetition requires allocation of radio resources by the eNB <b>13</b>. Therefore, the MTC UE <b>11</b> may notify the eNB <b>13</b> of necessity of the coverage enhancement processing that the eNB <b>13</b> is required to deal with (e.g., PDSCH/PUSCH repetition). Further, the MTC UE <b>11</b> may notify the eNB <b>13</b> of necessity of all the coverage enhancement processes in the ECM including processing that can be independently executed in the MTC UE <b>11</b> (e.g., reception of a repeated PBCH, repeated transmission of a PRACH preamble). Accordingly, the second notification may indicate that the ECM is required by the MTC UE <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0072">The MTC UE <b>11</b> may determine necessity of the ECM (the coverage enhancement processing in the ECM) by considering at least one of access cause, terminal capability (UE capability), terminal information (UE information), communication characteristics (communication performance), and radio quality of the MTC UE <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0073">Specific examples of the access cause, terminal capability, terminal information, communication characteristics, and radio quality are described below. However, the contents of the access cause, terminal capability, terminal information, communication characteristics, and radio quality are not limited to them.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0074">The access cause may include at least one of the following two items:<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0075">Purpose of establishing an RRC connection (Establishment cause); and</li>    <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0076">Service type.</li></ul></p><p id="p-0058" num="0077">The purpose of establishing an RRC connection may specify, for example, (a) an emergency call (emergency), (b) a high priority access (highPriorityAccess), (c) an access for mobile terminated communication (mt-Access), mobile originated signaling (mo-Signalling), (d) terminal originated data transmission (mo-Data), (e) a delay tolerant access (delayTolerantAccess), (f) a low priority access (lowPriorityAccess), (g) an access for small data communication (smallDataAccess), (h) an access for small packet communication (smallPacketAccess), (i) a limited access (limitedAccess), (j) an access for a limited service (limitedService), (k) an M2M-type access (m2mAccess), or (l) an access using the ECM (ecmAccess).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0078">The service type may specify, for example, (a) a real-time service, (b) a non real-time service, or (c) M2M-type communication.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0079">The terminal capability may include, for example, at least one of the following three items:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0080">Radio access capability;</li>    <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0081">Device capability; and</li>    <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0082">Terminal category (UE category).</li></ul></p><p id="p-0061" num="0083">The radio access capability may include, for example, (a) information indicating whether the UE is supporting the terminal function defined in the 3GPP LTE (e.g., flag bit) or (b) information indicating whether the UE is supporting the ECM. In order to indicate whether the UE is supporting the ECM, an information element (IE) named &#x201c;EcmSupport&#x201d; may be defined. For example, the true value of &#x201c;EcmSupport&#x201d; indicates that the ECM is supported (Supported) and the false value thereof indicates that the ECM is not supported (NotSupported). Further, an IE named &#x201c;EnhancedCoverageMode&#x201d; may be defined. For example, when EcmSupport is set to a value &#x201c;Supported&#x201d;, it indicates that the UE is supporting the ECM. On the other hand, if the UE does not support the ECM, EcmSupport may be set to a value &#x201c;NotSupported&#x201d;. Alternatively, no sending of this IE may imply that the UE is not supporting the ECM.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0084">The device capability may include, for example, (a) information indicating that the UE is an MTC UE, (b) information indicating that communication capability of the UE is limited (compared to that of a normal UE), or (c) information indicating that the UE performs only a specific communication (e.g., M2M-type communication).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0085">The terminal category may include, for example, (a) information indicating one of terminal categories defined in the 3GPP LTE or (b) information indicating one of access classes defined in the 3GPP LTE.

In Step S<b>410</b>, the MTC UE <b>31</b> performs data communication without using the coverage enhancement processing in the ECM (M2M data without ECM).</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Fourth Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0111" num="0140">A configuration example of a radio communication system according to this embodiment may be to the same as that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> described in the first embodiment. In this embodiment, a modified example of the specific sequences described in the third embodiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) is described.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0141">In this embodiment, similar to the MTC UE <b>31</b> according to the third embodiment, an MTC UE <b>41</b> itself determines necessity of the ECM, starts executing the ECM based on this determination, and informs the eNB <b>43</b> that the MTC UE <b>41</b> requires the ECM (or is executing the ECM) (second notification). After that, the MTC UE <b>41</b> suspends (or stops) execution of the ECM to wait for a determination by the eNB <b>43</b>. With regard to this point, this embodiment is different from the third embodiment. For example, the MTC UE <b>41</b> may starts the coverage enhancement processing in the ECM (e.g., reception of a repeated PBCH, repeated transmission of a PRACH preamble, and repetition of a PDSCH/PUSCH) when accessing to the eNB <b>43</b> and continue the processing until the radio connection (RRC connection) has been established, and then suspend the execution of the ECM. In other words, the MTC UE <b>41</b> may execute the ECM during at least the random access procedure (RACH procedure) and the RRC connection establishment procedure and then suspend execution of the ECM.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0142">Similar to the eNB <b>33</b> according to the third embodiment, the eNB <b>43</b> according to this embodiment determines whether the ECM is necessary for the MTC UE <b>41</b> in response to receiving the second notification from the MTC UE <b>41</b>. Upon determining that the ECM is necessary, the eNB <b>43</b> transmits ECM configuration information to the MTC UE <b>41</b> and upon determining that the ECM is not necessary, transmits an instruction to suspend (or stop) the ECM to the MTC UE <b>41</b>. The MTC UE <b>41</b> re-starts the ECM that has been suspended (stopped) in response to receiving the ECM configuration information from the eNB <b>43</b>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0143">According to the procedure for controlling the ECM as stated above, similar to the third embodiment, the MTC UE <b>41</b> can promptly start the ECM based on the determination by the MTC UE <b>41</b> itself. In particular, by temporarily executing the ECM until at least the radio connection (RRC connection) has been established, it is possible to avoid failure of the first access by the MTC UE <b>41</b> to the eNB <b>43</b> (e.g., random access using a PRACH or RRC Connection establishment). On the other hand, the eNB <b>43</b> can check the validity of the determination by the MTC UE <b>31</b> of necessity of the ECM and selectively start the ECM only when it is appropriate.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a sequence diagram showing one example of operations of the MTC UE <b>41</b> and the eNB <b>43</b> according to this embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows only the messages that are necessary for explanation of this embodiment and some messages included in the procedure specified in the LTE standard are not shown.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0145">The processes in Steps S<b>501</b> to S<b>504</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> are similar to those in Steps S<b>401</b> to S<b>404</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.

The process in Step S<b>507</b> is similar to that in Step S<b>406</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. That is, the eNB <b>43</b> transmits radio resource configuration information (Radio Resource Configuration) to the MTC UE <b>41</b> (RRC Connection Reconfiguration). In Step S<b>508</b>, the MTC UE <b>41</b> starts or re-starts execution of the ECM in response to the instruction from the eNB <b>43</b> (ECM start). Then in Step S<b>509</b>, the MTC UE <b>41</b> performs data communication using the coverage enhancement processing in the ECM in accordance with the radio resource configuration information and the ECM configuration information (M2M data with ECM).</p><p id="p-0119" num="0148">On the other hand, Steps S<b>510</b> and S<b>511</b> show a case the eNB <b>43</b> determines that the ECM is not necessary for the MTC UE <b>41</b> (case <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). In Step S<b>510</b>, the eNB <b>43</b> transmits radio resource configuration information (Radio Resource Configuration) to the MTC UE <b>41</b> (RRC Connection Reconfiguration). The radio resource configuration information in Step S<b>510</b> may explicitly indicate that the ECM is not executed.
