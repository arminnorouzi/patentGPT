Immunotherapies exploit the fact that cancer cells often have molecules on their surface that can be detected by the immune system, known as tumor antigens, which are often proteins or other macromolecules (e.g., carbohydrates). Active immunotherapy directs the immune system to attack tumor cells by targeting tumor antigens. Passive immunotherapies enhance existing anti-tumor responses and include the use of monoclonal antibodies, lymphocytes, and cytokines. Tumor vaccines are typically composed of tumor antigens and immunostimulatory molecules (e.g., adjuvants, cytokines, or Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) ligands) that work together to induce antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) that recognize and lyse tumor cells. Tumor neoantigens, which arise as a result of genetic change (e.g., inversions, translocations, deletions, missense mutations, splice site mutations, etc.) within malignant cells, represent the most tumor-specific class of antigens and can be patient-specific or shared. Tumor neoantigens are unique to the tumor cell as the mutation and its corresponding protein are present only in the tumor. They also avoid central tolerance and are therefore more likely to be immunogenic. Therefore, tumor neoantigens provide an excellent target for immune recognition including by both humoral and cellular immunity.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To elicit a T cell response from vaccination, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) must process epitope-containing peptide and present epitopes on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I or MHC II. One of the critical barriers to developing curative and tumor-specific immunotherapy is insufficient processing and release of minimal epitopes for antigen presentation to generate adequate immune responses. Accordingly, there is a need for developing additional cancer therapeutic vaccines to ensure efficient and sufficient epitope processing and presentation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">All publications, patents, and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent, or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some aspects, provided herein is a polypeptide comprising an epitope presented by a class I MHC or a class II MHC of an antigen presenting cell (APC), the polypeptide having a structure of Formula (I):</p><p id="p-0007" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Y<sub>n</sub>-B<sub>t</sub>-A<sub>r</sub>-X<sub>m</sub>-A<sub>s</sub>-C<sub>u</sub>-Z<sub>p</sub>&#x2003;&#x2003;Formula (I),<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0008" num="0000">or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,</p><p id="p-0009" num="0006">(i) wherein X<sub>m </sub>is the epitope, wherein each X independently represents an amino acid of a contiguous amino acid sequence encoded by a nucleic acid sequence in a genome of a subject,</p><p id="p-0010" num="0007">and wherein, (a) the MHC is a class I MHC and m is an integer from 8 to 12, or<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">(b) the MHC is a class II MHC and m is an integer from 9 to 25;</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0011" num="0009">(ii) wherein each Y is independently an amino acid, analog, or derivative thereof, and wherein:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0010">(A) when variable r of Ar in Formula (I) is 0, Y<sub>n </sub>is not encoded by a nucleic acid sequence immediately upstream of the nucleic acid sequence in the genome of the subject that encodes B<sub>t</sub>-A<sub>r</sub>-X<sub>m</sub>,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0011">(B) when variable r of A<sub>r </sub>in Formula (I) is 1 and variable t of B<sub>t </sub>in Formula (I) is 0, Y<sub>n </sub>is not encoded by a nucleic acid sequence immediately upstream of the nucleic acid sequence in the genome of the subject that encodes X<sub>m</sub>, or</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0012">(C) when variable r of A<sub>r </sub>in Formula (I) is 1 and variable t of B<sub>t </sub>in Formula (I) is 1 or more, Y<sub>n </sub>is not encoded by a nucleic acid sequence immediately upstream of the nucleic acid sequence in the genome of the subject that encodes B<sub>t</sub>;

To facilitate an understanding of the present disclosure, a number of terms and phrases are defined below.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0128">The nomenclature used to describe peptides or proteins follows the conventional practice wherein the amino group is presented to the left (the amino- or N-terminus) and the carboxyl group to the right (the carboxy- or C-terminus) of each amino acid residue. When amino acid residue positions are referred to in a peptide epitope they are numbered in an amino to carboxyl direction with position one being the residue located at the amino terminal end of the epitope, or the peptide or protein of which it can be a part. In the formula representing selected specific embodiments of the present disclosure, the amino- and carboxyl-terminal groups, although not specifically shown, are in the form they would assume at physiologic pH values, unless otherwise specified. In the amino acid structure formula, each residue is generally represented by standard three letter or single letter designations. The L-form of an amino acid residue is represented by a capital single letter or a capital first letter of a three-letter symbol, and the D-form for those amino acid residues having D-forms is represented by a lower case single letter or a lower case three letter symbol. However, when three letter symbols or full names are used without capitals, they can refer to L amino acid residues. Glycine has no asymmetric carbon atom and is simply referred to as &#x201c;Gly&#x201d; or &#x201c;G.&#x201d; The amino acid sequences of peptides set forth herein are generally designated using the standard single letter symbol.

A &#x201c;mature protein&#x201d; is a protein which is full-length and which, optionally, includes glycosylation or other modifications typical for the protein in a given cellular environment. Polypeptides and proteins disclosed herein (including functional portions and functional variants thereof) can comprise synthetic amino acids in place of one or more naturally-occurring amino acids. Such synthetic amino acids are known in the art, and include, for example, aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid, norleucine, &#x3b1;-amino n-decanoic acid, homoserine, S-acetylaminomethyl-cysteine, trans-3- and trans-4-hydroxyproline, 4-aminophenylalanine, 4-nitrophenylalanine, 4-chlorophenylalanine, 4-carboxyphenylalanine, &#x3b2;-phenylserine &#x3b2;-hydroxyphenylalanine, phenylglycine, &#x3b1;-naphthylalanine, cyclohexylalanine, cyclohexylglycine, indoline-2-carboxylic acid, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, aminomalonic acid, aminomalonic acid monoamide, N&#x2032;-benzyl-N&#x2032;-methyl-lysine, N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-dibenzyl-lysine, 6-hydroxylysine, ornithine, &#x3b1;-aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid, &#x3b1;-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid, &#x3b1;-aminocycloheptane carboxylic acid, &#x3b1;-(2-amino-2-norbomane)-carboxylic acid, &#x3b1;,&#x3b3;-diaminobutyric acid, &#x3b1;,&#x3b2;-diaminopropionic acid, homophenylalanine, and &#x3b1;-tert-butylglycine. The present disclosure further contemplates that expression of polypeptides described herein in an engineered cell can be associated with post-translational modifications of one or more amino acids of the polypeptide constructs. Non-limiting examples of post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, acylation including acetylation and formylation, glycosylation (including N-linked and O-linked), amidation, hydroxylation, alkylation including methylation and ethylation, ubiquitination, addition of pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, formation of disulfide bridges, sulfation, myristoylation, palmitoylation, isoprenylation, famesylation, geranylation, glypiation, lipoylation and iodination.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0131">The terms &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; refers to a series of amino acid residues connected one to the other, typically by peptide bonds between the &#x3b1;-amino and carboxyl groups of adjacent amino acid residues.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0132">&#x201c;Synthetic peptide&#x201d; refers to a peptide that is obtained from a non-natural source, e.g., is man-made.

Alternatively, an epitope can be defined as a set of amino acid residues which is involved in recognition by a particular immunoglobulin, or in the context of T cells, those residues necessary for recognition by T cell receptor proteins, chimeric antigen receptors, and/or Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) receptors. A &#x201c;T cell epitope&#x201d; is to be understood as meaning a peptide sequence which can be bound by the MHC molecules of class I or II in the form of a peptide-presenting MHC molecule or MHC complex and then, in this form, be recognized and bound by T cells, such as T-lymphocytes or T-helper cells. Epitopes can be prepared by isolation from a natural source, or they can be synthesized according to standard protocols in the art. Synthetic epitopes can comprise artificial amino acid residues, &#x201c;amino acid mimetics,&#x201d; such as D isomers of naturally-occurring L amino acid residues or non-naturally-occurring amino acid residues such as cyclohexylalanine. Throughout this disclosure, epitopes may be referred to in some cases as peptides or peptide epitopes. It is to be appreciated that proteins or peptides that comprise an epitope or an analog described herein as well as additional amino acid(s) are still within the bounds of the present disclosure. In certain embodiments, the peptide comprises a fragment of an antigen. In certain embodiments, there is a limitation on the length of a peptide of the present disclosure. The embodiment that is length-limited occurs when the protein or peptide comprising an epitope described herein comprises a region (i.e., a contiguous series of amino acid residues) having 100% identity with a native sequence. In order to avoid the definition of epitope from reading, e.g., on whole natural molecules, there is a limitation on the length of any region that has 100% identity with a native peptide sequence. Thus, for a peptide comprising an epitope described herein and a region with 100% identity with a native peptide sequence, the region with 100% identity to a native sequence generally has a length of: less than or equal to 600 amino acid residues, less than or equal to 500 amino acid residues, less than or equal to 400 amino acid residues, less than or equal to 250 amino acid residues, less than or equal to 100 amino acid residues, less than or equal to 85 amino acid residues, less than or equal to 75 amino acid residues, less than or equal to 65 amino acid residues, and less than or equal to 50 amino acid residues. In certain embodiments, an &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; described herein is comprised by a peptide having a region with less than 51 amino acid residues that has 100% identity to a native peptide sequence, in any increment down to 5 amino acid residues; for example 50, 49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37, 36, 35, 34, 33, 32, 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 amino acid residues.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0134">The term &#x201c;derived&#x201d; and its grammatical equivalents when used to discuss an epitope is a synonym for &#x201c;prepared&#x201d; and its grammatical equivalents. A derived epitope can be isolated from a natural source, or it can be synthesized according to standard protocols in the art. Synthetic epitopes can comprise artificial amino acid residues &#x201c;amino acid mimetics,&#x201d; such as D isomers of natural occurring L amino acid residues or non-natural amino acid residues such as cyclohexylalanine. A derived or prepared epitope can be an analog of a native epitope.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0135">An &#x201c;immunogenic&#x201d; peptide or an &#x201c;immunogenic&#x201d; epitope or &#x201c;peptide epitope&#x201d; is a peptide that comprises an allele-specific motif such that the peptide will bind an HLA molecule and induce a cell-mediated or humoral response, for example, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL (e.g., CD8<sup>+</sup>)), helper T lymphocyte (Th (e.g., CD4<sup>+</sup>)) and/or B lymphocyte response. Thus, immunogenic peptides described herein are capable of binding to an appropriate HLA molecule and thereafter inducing a CTL (cytotoxic) response, or a HTL (and humoral) response, to the peptide.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0136">&#x201c;Neoantigen&#x201d; means a class of tumor antigens which arise from tumor-specific changes in proteins. Neoantigens encompass, but are not limited to, tumor antigens which arise from, for example, substitution in the protein sequence, frame shift mutation, fusion polypeptide, in-frame deletion, insertion, expression of endogenous retroviral polypeptides, and tumor-specific overexpression of polypeptides.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0137">The term &#x201c;mutant peptide,&#x201d; &#x201c;tumor-specific peptide,&#x201d; &#x201c;neoantigen peptide,&#x201d; and &#x201c;neoantigenic peptide,&#x201d; used interchangeably with &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; in the present specification, refers to a series of residues, typically L-amino acids, connected one to the other, typically by peptide bonds between the &#x3b1;-amino and carboxyl groups of adjacent amino acids. Similarly, the term &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; is used interchangeably with &#x201c;mutant polypeptide,&#x201d; &#x201c;neoantigen polypeptide,&#x201d; and &#x201c;neoantigenic polypeptide&#x201d; in the present specification to designate a series of residues, e.g., L-amino acids, connected one to the other, typically by peptide bonds between the &#x3b1;-amino and carboxyl groups of adjacent amino acids. The polypeptides or peptides can be a variety of lengths, either in their neutral (uncharged) forms or in forms which are salts, and either free of modifications such as glycosylation, side chain oxidation, or phosphorylation or containing these modifications, subject to the condition that the modification not destroy the biological activity of the polypeptides as herein described. A peptide or polypeptide as used herein comprises at least one flanking sequence. The term &#x201c;flanking sequence&#x201d; as used herein refers to a fragment or region of the neoantigen peptide that is not a part of the neoepitope.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0138">A &#x201c;neoepitope,&#x201d; &#x201c;tumor-specific neoepitope,&#x201d; &#x201c;tumor-specific epitope,&#x201d; or &#x201c;tumor antigen&#x201d; refers to an epitope or antigenic determinant region that is not present in a reference, such as a non-diseased cell, e.g., a non-cancerous cell or a germline cell, but is found in a diseased cell, e.g., a cancer cell. This includes situations where a corresponding epitope is found in a normal non-diseased cell or a germline cell but, due to one or more mutations in a diseased cell, e.g., a cancer cell, the sequence of the epitope is changed so as to result in the neoepitope. The term &#x201c;neoepitope&#x201d; as used herein refers to an antigenic determinant region within the peptide or neoantigenic peptide. A neoepitope may comprise at least one &#x201c;anchor residue&#x201d; and at least one &#x201c;anchor residue flanking region.&#x201d; A neoepitope may further comprise a &#x201c;separation region.&#x201d; The term &#x201c;anchor residue&#x201d; refers to an amino acid residue that binds to specific pockets on HLAs, resulting in specificity of interactions with HLAs. In some cases, an anchor residue may be at a canonical anchor position. In other cases, an anchor residue may be at a non-canonical anchor position. Neoepitopes may bind to HLA molecules through primary and secondary anchor residues protruding into the pockets in the peptide-binding grooves. In the peptide-binding grooves, specific amino acids compose pockets that accommodate the corresponding side chains of the anchor residues of the presented neoepitopes. Peptide-binding preferences exist among different alleles of both of HLA I and HLA II molecules. HLA class I molecules bind short neoepitopes, whose N- and C-terminal ends are anchored into the pockets located at the ends of the neoepitope binding groove. While the majority of the HLA class I binding neoepitopes are of about 9 amino acids, longer neoepitopes can be accommodated by the bulging of their central portion, resulting in binding neoepitopes of about 8 to 12 amino acids. Neoepitopes binding to HLA class II proteins are not constrained in size and can vary from about 16 to 25 amino acids. The neoepitope binding groove in the HLA class II molecules is open at both ends, which enables binding of peptides with relatively longer length. Though the core 9 amino acid residues long segment contributes the most to the recognition of the neoepitope, the anchor residue flanking regions are also important for the specificity of the peptide to the HLA class II allele. In some cases, the anchor residue flanking region is N-terminus residues. In another case, the anchor residue flanking region is C-terminus residues. In yet another case, the anchor residue flanking region is both N-terminus residues and C-terminus residues. In some cases, the anchor residue flanking region is flanked by at least two anchor residues. An anchor residue flanking region flanked by anchor residues is a &#x201c;separation region.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0138" num="0139">&#x201c;Major Histocompatibility Complex&#x201d; or &#x201c;MHC&#x201d; is a cluster of genes that plays a role in control of the cellular interactions responsible for physiologic immune responses. In humans, the MHC complex is also known as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. For a detailed description of the MHC and HLA complexes, see, Paul, Fundamental Immunology, 3<sup>rd </sup>Ed., Raven Press, New York (1993). &#x201c;Proteins or molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)&#x201d;, &#x201c;MHC molecules&#x201d;, &#x201c;MHC proteins&#x201d; or &#x201c;HLA proteins&#x201d; are to be understood as meaning proteins capable of binding peptides resulting from the proteolytic cleavage of protein antigens and representing potential lymphocyte epitopes, (e.g., T cell epitope and B cell epitope) transporting them to the cell surface and presenting them there to specific cells, in particular cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, T-helper cells, or B cells. The major histocompatibility complex in the genome comprises the genetic region whose gene products expressed on the cell surface are important for binding and presenting endogenous and/or foreign antigens and thus for regulating immunological processes. The major histocompatibility complex is classified into two gene groups coding for different proteins, namely molecules of MHC class I and molecules of MHC class II. The cellular biology and the expression patterns of the two MHC classes are adapted to these different roles.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0140">&#x201c;Human Leukocyte Antigen&#x201d; or &#x201c;HLA&#x201d; is a human class I or class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) protein (see, e.g., Stites, et al., Immunology, 8<sup>th </sup>Ed., Lange Publishing, Los Altos, Calif. (1994).</p><p id="p-0140" num="0141">&#x201c;Peptide-MHC (pMHC) stability&#x201d; refers to the length of time it takes for half of the amount of a specific peptide to dissociate from the cognate HLA in a biochemical assay.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0142">&#x201c;Antigen presenting cells&#x201d; (APC) are cells which present peptide fragments of protein antigens in association with MHC molecules on their cell surface. Some APCs may activate antigen specific T cells. Mature professional antigen-presenting cells are very efficient at internalizing antigen, either by phagocytosis or by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and then displaying a fragment of the antigen, bound to a class II MHC molecule, on their membrane. The T cell recognizes and interacts with the antigen-class II MHC molecule complex on the membrane of the antigen presenting cell. An additional co-stimulatory signal is then produced by the antigen presenting cell, leading to activation of the T cell. The expression of co-stimulatory molecules is a defining feature of professional antigen-presenting cells. The main types of professional antigen-presenting cells are dendritic cells, which have the broadest range of antigen presentation, and are probably the most important antigen presenting cells, macrophages, B-cells, and certain activated epithelial cells. &#x201c;Dendritic cells (DCs)&#x201d; are leukocyte populations that present antigens captured in peripheral tissues to T cells via both MHC class II and I antigen presentation pathways. It is well known that dendritic cells are potent inducers of immune responses and the activation of these cells is a critical step for the induction of antitumoral immunity. Dendritic cells are conveniently categorized as &#x201c;immature&#x201d; and &#x201c;mature&#x201d; cells, which can be used as a simple way to discriminate between two well characterized phenotypes. However, this nomenclature should not be construed to exclude all possible intermediate stages of differentiation. Immature dendritic cells are characterized as antigen presenting cells with a high capacity for antigen uptake and processing, which correlates with the high expression of Fc receptor (FcR) and mannose receptor. The mature phenotype is typically characterized by a lower expression of these markers, but a high expression of cell surface molecules responsible for T cell activation such as class I and class II MHC, adhesion molecules (e.g., CD54 and CD11) and costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD40, CD80, CD86 and 4-1 BB).</p><p id="p-0142" num="0143">The terms &#x201c;polynucleotide,&#x201d; &#x201c;nucleotide,&#x201d; &#x201c;nucleic acid,&#x201d; &#x201c;polynucleic acid,&#x201d; or &#x201c;oligonucleotide&#x201d; and their grammatical equivalents are used interchangeably herein and refer to polymers of nucleotides of any length, and include DNA and RNA, for example, mRNA.

Typically the &#x201c;reference&#x201d; may be obtained on the basis of one or more normal specimens, in particular, specimens which are not affected by a cancer disease, either obtained from a patient or one or more different individuals, for example, healthy individuals, in particular, individuals of the same species. A &#x201c;reference&#x201d; can be determined empirically by testing a sufficiently large number of normal specimens.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0145">The term &#x201c;mutation&#x201d; or &#x201c;mutant&#x201d; refers to a change of or difference in the nucleic acid sequence (nucleotide substitution, addition, insertion, or deletion) compared to a reference. A &#x201c;somatic mutation&#x201d; can occur in any of the cells of the body except the germ cells (sperm and egg) and therefore are not passed on to children. These alterations can (but do not always) cause cancer or other diseases. In some embodiments, a mutation is a non-synonymous mutation. The term &#x201c;non-synonymous mutation&#x201d; refers to a mutation, for example, a nucleotide substitution, which does result in an amino acid change such as an amino acid substitution in the translation product. A &#x201c;frameshift&#x201d; occurs when a mutation disrupts the normal phase of a gene's codon periodicity (also known as &#x201c;reading frame&#x201d;), resulting in the translation of a non-native protein sequence. It is possible for different mutations in a gene to achieve the same altered reading frame. A &#x201c;neoORF&#x201d; can be created when an open reading frame (ORF) is altered through various mutational events in the genome, such as missense mutations, fusion transcripts, frameshifts, and/or stop codon losses. A neoORF can encode novel amino acid sequences that are not present in the normal genome.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0146">A &#x201c;conservative amino acid substitution&#x201d; is one in which one amino acid residue is replaced with another amino acid residue having a similar side chain.

K<sub>D </sub>is the dissociation constant and has units of molarity. The affinity constant is the inverse of the dissociation constant. An affinity constant is sometimes used as a generic term to describe this chemical entity. It is a direct measure of the energy of binding. Affinity may be determined experimentally, for example by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using commercially available Biacore SPR units. Affinity may also be expressed as the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC<sub>50</sub>), that concentration at which 50% of the peptide is displaced. Likewise, ln(IC<sub>50</sub>) refers to the natural log of the IC<sub>50</sub>. K<sub>off </sub>refers to the off-rate constant, for example, for dissociation of an HLA binding peptide and a class I or II HLA. Throughout this disclosure, &#x201c;binding data&#x201d; or &#x201c;binding analysis&#x201d; results can be expressed in terms of &#x201c;IC<sub>50</sub>.&#x201d; IC<sub>50 </sub>is the concentration of the tested peptide in a binding assay at which 50% inhibition of binding of a labeled reference peptide is observed. Given the conditions in which the assays are run (i.e., limiting HLA protein and labeled reference peptide concentrations), these values approximate K<sub>D </sub>values. Assays for determining binding are well known in the art and are described in detail, for example, in PCT publications WO 94/20127 and WO 94/03205, and other publications such Sidney et al., Current Protocols in Immunology 18.3.1 (1998); Sidney, et al., J. Immunol. 154:247 (1995); and Sette, et al., Mol. Immunol. 31:813 (1994). Alternatively, binding can be expressed relative to binding by a reference standard peptide. For example, can be based on its IC<sub>50</sub>, relative to the IC<sub>50 </sub>of a reference standard peptide. Binding can also be determined using other assay systems including those using: live cells (e.g., Ceppellini et al., Nature 339:392 (1989); Christnick et al., Nature 352:67 (1991); Busch et al., Int. Immunol. 2:443 (1990); Hill et al., J. Immunol. 147:189 (1991); del Guercio et al., J. Immunol. 154:685 (1995)), cell free systems using detergent lysates (e.g., Cerundolo et al., J.

Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well-known in the art. Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison may be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math., 2:482 (1981); by the alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol., 48:443 (1970); by the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 85:2444 (1988); by computerized implementations of these algorithms (including, but not limited to CLUSTAL in the PC/Gene program by Intelligentics, Mountain View Calif., GAP, BESTFIT, BLAST, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group (GCG), 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis., U.S.A.); the CLUSTAL program is well described by Higgins and Sharp, Gene, 73:237-244 (1988) and Higgins and Sharp, CABIOS, 5:151-153 (1989); Corpet et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 16:10881-10890 (1988); Huang et al., Computer Applications in the Biosciences, 8:155-165 (1992); and Pearson et al., Methods in Molecular Biology, 24:307-331 (1994).

When one molecule is said to have certain percentage of sequence identity with a larger molecule, it means that when the two molecules are optimally aligned, said percentage of residues in the smaller molecule finds a match residue in the larger molecule in accordance with the order by which the two molecules are optimally aligned.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0168">The term &#x201c;substantially identical&#x201d; and its grammatical equivalents as applied to nucleic acid or amino acid sequences mean that a nucleic acid or amino acid sequence comprises a sequence that has at least 90% sequence identity or more, at least 95%, at least 98%, and at least 99%, compared to a reference sequence using the programs described above, e.g., BLAST, using standard parameters. For example, the BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a word length (W) of 11, an expectation (E) of 10, M=5, N=&#x2212;4, and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a word length (W) of 3, an expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix (see Henikoff &#x26; Henikoff, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89:10915 (1992)). Percentage of sequence identity is determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the polynucleotide sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity. In embodiments, the substantial identity exists over a region of the sequences that is at least about 50 residues in length, over a region of at least about 100 residues, and in embodiments, the sequences are substantially identical over at least about 150 residues. In embodiments, the sequences are substantially identical over the entire length of the coding regions.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0169">The term &#x201c;vector&#x201d; as used herein means a construct, which is capable of delivering, and usually expressing, one or more gene(s) or sequence(s) of interest in a host cell.

Thus, isolated peptides described herein do not contain some or all of the materials normally associated with the peptides in their in situ environment. An &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; epitope refers to an epitope that does not include the whole sequence of the antigen from which the epitope was derived. Typically the &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; epitope does not have attached thereto additional amino acid residues that result in a sequence that has 100% identity over the entire length of a native sequence. The native sequence can be a sequence such as a tumor-associated antigen from which the epitope is derived. Thus, the term &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; means that the material is removed from its original environment (e.g., the natural environment if it is naturally occurring). An &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; nucleic acid is a nucleic acid removed from its natural environment. For example, a naturally-occurring polynucleotide or peptide present in a living animal is not isolated, but the same polynucleotide or peptide, separated from some or all of the coexisting materials in the natural system, is isolated. Such a polynucleotide could be part of a vector, and/or such a polynucleotide or peptide could be part of a composition, and still be &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; in that such vector or composition is not part of its natural environment.

Enhanced cleavage and Uses Thereof</p><p id="p-0173" num="0174">One of the critical barriers to developing curative and tumor-specific immunotherapy is insufficient processing and release of minimal epitopes for antigen presentation to generate adequate immune responses. Antigen processing and presentation refer to the processes that occur within a cell that result in fragmentation, or proteolysis, of proteins, association of the protein fragments, or peptides, with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, and the expression of the peptide-MHC (pMHC) molecules on the cell surface for recognition by T cell receptor (TCR) on a T cell. Antigen presentation is mediated by MHC class I molecules and MHC class II molecules found on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and certain other cells. MHC class I and MHC class II molecules deliver short peptides to the cell surface allowing these peptides to be recognized by cytotoxic (CD8+) and helper (CD4+) T cells, respectively. The TCR can recognize antigen only in the form of a peptide bound to an MHC molecule on a cell surface and the antigens recognized by T cells are peptides that arise from the breakdown of macromolecular structures, the unfolding of individual proteins, and their cleavage into short fragments through antigen processing.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0175">Antigen presentation on the cell surface requires correct processing of peptides to release minimal epitopes by the proteasome, cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) aminopeptidases, efficient transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) transport, and sufficient binding to MHC class I molecules. The efficiency of the epitope generation depends not only on the epitope itself but also on its flanking regions or the amino acid sequence flanking the amino acid sequence of the epitope. The efficiency of processing minimal epitope from the peptide comprising the epitope sequence and amino acid sequence flanking the epitope sequence is not completely understood but is known to be affected by multiple factors including the specific amino acid residues on both sides of the cleavage site in the peptide and other competing cleavage sites nearby.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0176">One way to address insufficient processing and release of minimal epitope problem is to study and design the specific amino acid residues or sequences that can be added to N- and/or C-terminus of the epitope sequence to enhance cleavage and processing of peptides and presentation of epitopes. For example, amino acid residues or sequences from other epitopes that are known to be processed efficiently can be added to an epitope sequence. Another example is to use amino acid residues that are known to be commonly observed around epitopes (Abelin, et al., 2017, Immunity 46, 315-326). This approach can confer additional benefits including facilitating the manufacture (e.g., synthesis, purification, and/or formulation) or easier downstream modification (e.g., conjugation to other molecules) of peptides.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0177">Another way to address the current barriers to efficient processing and release of minimal epitopes is to use a protease-cleavable linker to target an epitope-containing peptide for site-specific protease processing for the release of the epitope. For example, specific linkers that can be readily cleaved inside dendritic cells (DCs) to release minimal epitope sequences can used to enhance CD8-dependent immune responses after vaccination. These peptides, additionally, will not have non-selective binding to MHC class I molecules on the surfaces of non-professional APCs, and instead will go through specific (e.g., endocytosis) pathways to be properly processed and presented to T cells. Yet, another example to promote sufficient epitope processing and presentation is to combine the two strategies, i.e., the specific amino acid residues and specific linkers.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0178">Provided herein is a polypeptide comprising an epitope sequence encoded by a genome of a subject, an amino acid or an amino acid sequence that may or may not be encoded by a nucleic acid sequence immediately upstream or downstream of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the epitope sequence in the genome of the subject, an amino acid or an amino acid sequence, and/or a linker.

To generate optimal peptide antigens, two key processing events exist within the antigen processing and presentation pathway. Cytosolic proteins are primarily processed by proteasomes. The short peptides are then transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) for subsequent assembly with MHC class I molecules. Exogenous proteins are primarily presented by MHC class II molecules. Antigens are internalized by several pathways, including phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, and endocytosis, and eventually traffic to a mature or late endosomal compartment where they are processed and loaded on to MHC class II molecules. Cytoplasmic/nuclear antigens can also be trafficked into the endosomal network via autophagy for subsequent processing and presentation with MHC class II molecules.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0211">The initial peptide proteolysis occurs within the cytosol of the cell and degrades larger protein fragments into smaller peptides by the proteasome or immunoproteasome. This processing event is often responsible for generating the final C-terminal residue of peptides that bind to class I MHC. The proteasome is a large proteolytic complex that contains multiple subunits, including two subunits, large multifunctional protease (LMP) 2 and LMP7. Proteins bound for degradation are targeted to the proteasome by covalent linkage with ubiquitin. LMP2 and LMP7 induce the proteolytic complex to generate peptides that bind to class I MHC I. The peptides generated in the cytosol are then transported through TAP into ER. As TAP preferentially transports peptides of 11-14 amino acids, peptides are often too long for stable class I MHC binding and require further processing upon entering the ER. This processing includes trimming of the N-terminal region of the antigenic peptides by endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase (ERAP) 1 and ERAP2. This process creates a pool of peptides that have with high affinity for class I MHC association.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0212">In normal cellular environments, classical class II MHC molecules are only expressed on professional APCs such as dendritic cells (DCs) or macrophages. Exogenous or extracellular antigens that are internalized by phagocytosis, endocytosis, or pinocytosis are primarily presented on class II MHC to CD4+ T cells. A small subset of cytosolic antigens, however, is also expressed on class II MHC as a result of autophagy. In brief, endocytosed antigens are processed in a vesicular pathway consisting of progressively more acidic and proteolytically active compartments classically described as early endosomes (pH 6.0-pH 6.5), late endosomes or endolysosomes (pH 5.0-pH 6.0), and lysosomes (pH 4.5-pH 5.0). Antigens internalized by phagocytosis follow a similar path, terminating in phagolysosomes formed by the fusion of phagosomes and lysosomes. Lysosomes and phagolysosomes (pH 4.0-pH 4.5) contain a number of acid pH-optimum proteases generically called cathepsins. In highly degradative cells such as macrophages, successive cleavages by these enzymes result in very short peptides and free amino acids that are translocated into the cytosol to replenish tRNAs for new protein synthesis. In APCs which are less proteolytically active, larger intermediates form the dominant source of peptides for class II MHC binding and these peptides are usually consisting of 13-18 amino acids.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0213">Both class I and class II MHC can access peptides processed from endogenous and exogenous antigens. For example, class II MHC bind peptides derived from endogenous membrane proteins that are degraded in the lysosome. Likewise, class I MHC can bind peptides derived from exogenous proteins internalized by endocytosis or phagocytosis, a phenomenon called cross-presentation. Specific subsets of DCs are particularly adept at mediating this process, which is critically important for the initiation of a primary response by naive CD8+ T cells.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0214">In one aspect, provided herein is a method of cleaving a polypeptide, comprising contacting the polypeptide described herein to an APC.

Neoantigens and Uses Thereof</p><p id="p-0224" num="0222">One of the critical barriers to developing curative and tumor-specific immunotherapy is the identification and selection of highly specific and restricted tumor antigens to avoid autoimmunity. Tumor neoantigens, which arise as a result of genetic change (e.g., inversions, translocations, deletions, missense mutations, splice site mutations, etc.) within malignant cells, represent the most tumor-specific class of antigens. Neoantigens have rarely been used in cancer vaccine or immunogenic compositions due to technical difficulties in identifying them, selecting optimized antigens, and producing neoantigens for use in a vaccine or immunogenic composition. These problems may be addressed by: identifying mutations in neoplasias/tumors which are present at the DNA level in tumor but not in matched germline samples from a high proportion of subjects having cancer; analyzing the identified mutations with one or more peptide-MHC binding prediction algorithms to generate a plurality of neoantigen T cell epitopes that are expressed within the neoplasia/tumor and that bind to a high proportion of patient HLA alleles; and synthesizing the plurality of neoantigenic peptides selected from the sets of all neoantigen peptides and predicted binding peptides for use in a cancer vaccine or immunogenic composition suitable for treating a high proportion of subjects having cancer.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0223">For example, translating peptide sequencing information into a therapeutic vaccine may include prediction of mutated peptides that can bind to HLA molecules of a high proportion of individuals. Efficiently choosing which particular mutations to utilize as immunogen requires the ability to predict which mutated peptides would efficiently bind to a high proportion of patient's HLA alleles. Recently, neural network based learning approaches with validated binding and non-binding peptides have advanced the accuracy of prediction algorithms for the major HLA-A and -B alleles. However, even using advanced neural network-based algorithms to encode HLA-peptide binding rules, several factors limit the power to predict peptides presented on HLA alleles.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0224">Another example of translating peptide sequencing information into a therapeutic vaccine may include formulating the drug as a multi-epitope vaccine of long peptides. Targeting as many mutated epitopes as practically possible takes advantage of the enormous capacity of the immune system, prevents the opportunity for immunological escape by down-modulation of an immune targeted gene product, and compensates for the known inaccuracy of epitope prediction approaches. Synthetic peptides provide a useful means to prepare multiple immunogens efficiently and to rapidly translate identification of mutant epitopes to an effective vaccine. Peptides can be readily synthesized chemically and easily purified utilizing reagents free of contaminating bacteria or animal substances. The small size allows a clear focus on the mutated region of the protein and also reduces irrelevant antigenic competition from other components (non-mutated protein or viral vector antigens).</p><p id="p-0227" num="0225">Yet another example of translating peptide sequencing information into a therapeutic vaccine may include a combination with a strong vaccine adjuvant. Effective vaccines may require a strong adjuvant to initiate an immune response. For example, poly-ICLC, an agonist of TLR3 and the RNA helicase-domains of MDA5 and RIG3, has shown several desirable properties for a vaccine adjuvant. These properties include the induction of local and systemic activation of immune cells in vivo, production of stimulatory chemokines and cytokines, and stimulation of antigen-presentation by dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, poly-ICLC can induce durable CD4+ and CD8+ responses in humans. Importantly, striking similarities in the upregulation of transcriptional and signal transduction pathways were seen in subjects vaccinated with poly-ICLC and in volunteers who had received the highly effective, replication-competent yellow fever vaccine. Furthermore, &#x3e;90% of ovarian carcinoma patients immunized with poly-ICLC in combination with a NYESO-1 peptide vaccine (in addition to Montanide) showed induction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell, as well as antibody responses to the peptide in a recent phase 1 study. At the same time, poly-ICLC has been extensively tested in more than 25 clinical trials to date and exhibited a relatively benign toxicity profile.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Peptides</heading><p id="p-0228" num="0226">In some aspects, the present disclosure provides isolated peptides that comprise a tumor-specific mutation. These peptides and polypeptides are referred to herein as &#x201c;neoantigenic peptides&#x201d; or &#x201c;neoantigenic polypeptides.&#x201d; The term &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; is used interchangeably with &#x201c;mutant peptide&#x201d;, &#x201c;neoantigen peptide&#x201d; and &#x201c;neoantigenic peptide&#x201d; in the present specification to designate a series of residues, typically L-amino acids, connected one to the other, typically by peptide bonds between the &#x3b1;-amino and carboxyl groups of adjacent amino acids. Similarly, the term &#x201c;polypeptide&#x201d; is used interchangeably with &#x201c;mutant polypeptide,&#x201d; &#x201c;neoantigen polypeptide,&#x201d; and &#x201c;neoantigenic polypeptide&#x201d; in the present specification to designate a series of residues, e.g., L-amino acids, connected one to the other, typically by peptide bonds between the &#x3b1;-amino and carboxyl groups of adjacent amino acids. The polypeptides or peptides can be a variety of lengths, either in their neutral (uncharged) forms or in forms which are salts, and either free of modifications such as glycosylation, side chain oxidation, or phosphorylation or containing these modifications, subject to the condition that the modification not destroy the biological activity of the polypeptides as herein described.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0227">In some embodiments, genomic or exomic sequencing methods are used to identify tumor-specific mutations. Any suitable sequencing method can be used according to the present disclosure, for example, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies. Third Generation Sequencing methods might substitute for the NGS technology in the future to speed up the sequencing step of the method. For clarification purposes: the terms &#x201c;Next Generation Sequencing&#x201d; or &#x201c;NGS&#x201d; in the context of the present disclosure mean all novel high throughput sequencing technologies which, in contrast to the &#x201c;conventional&#x201d; sequencing methodology known as Sanger chemistry, read nucleic acid templates randomly in parallel along the entire genome by breaking the entire genome into small pieces. Such NGS technologies (also known as massively parallel sequencing technologies) are able to deliver nucleic acid sequence information of a whole genome, exome, transcriptome (all transcribed sequences of a genome), or methylome (all methylated sequences of a genome) in very short time periods, e.g. within 1-2 weeks, for example, within 1-7 days or within less than 24 hours and allow, in principle, single cell sequencing approaches. Multiple NGS platforms which are commercially available or which are mentioned in the literature can be used in the context of the present disclosure e.g., those described in detail in WO 2012/159643.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0228">In certain embodiments, the polypeptide described herein can comprise, but is not limited to, about 5, about 6, about 7, about 8, about 9, about 10, about 11, about 12, about 13, about 14, about 15, about 16, about 17, about 18, about 19, about 20, about 21, about 22, about 23, about 24, about 25, about 26, about 27, about 28, about 29, about 30, about 31, about 32, about 33, about 34, about 35, about 36, about 37, about 38, about 39, about 40, about 41, about 42, about 43, about 44, about 45, about 46, about 47, about 48, about 49, about 50, about 60, about 70, about 80, about 90, about 100, about 110, about 120, about 150, about 200, about 300, about 350, about 400, about 450, about 500, about 600, about 700, about 800, about 900, about 1,000, about 1,500, about 2,000, about 2,500, about 3,000, about 4,000, about 5,000, about 7,500, about 10,000 amino acids or greater amino acid residues, and any range derivable therein.

A modification can include a covalent chemical modification that does not alter the primary amino acid sequence of the antigenic peptide itself. Modifications can produce peptides with desired properties, for example, prolonging the in vivo half-life, increasing the stability, reducing the clearance, altering the immunogenicity or allergenicity, enabling the raising of particular antibodies, cellular targeting, antigen uptake, antigen processing, HLA affinity, HLA stability, or antigen presentation. In some embodiments, a peptide may comprise one or more sequences that enhance processing and presentation of epitopes by APCs, for example, for generation of an immune response.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0286">In some embodiments, the polypeptide may be modified to provide desired attributes. For instance, the ability of the peptides to induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity can be enhanced by linkage to a sequence which contains at least one epitope that is capable of inducing a T helper cell response. In some embodiments, immunogenic peptides/T helper conjugates are linked by a spacer molecule. In some embodiments, a spacer comprises relatively small, neutral molecules, such as amino acids or amino acid mimetics, which are substantially uncharged under physiological conditions. Spacers can be selected from, e.g., Ala, Gly, or other neutral spacers of nonpolar amino acids or neutral polar amino acids. It will be understood that the optionally present spacer need not be comprised of the same residues and thus may be a hetero- or homo-oligomer. The neoantigenic peptide may be linked to the T helper peptide either directly or via a spacer either at the amino or carboxy terminus of the peptide. The amino terminus of either the neoantigenic peptide or the T helper peptide may be acylated. Examples of T helper peptides include tetanus toxoid residues 830-843, influenza residues 307-319, and malaria circumsporozoite residues 382-398 and residues 378-389.</p><p id="p-0301" num="0287">The peptide sequences of the present disclosure may optionally be altered through changes at the DNA level, particularly by mutating the DNA encoding the peptide at preselected bases such that codons are generated that will translate into the desired amino acids.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0288">In some embodiments, the peptide described herein can contain substitutions to modify a physical property (e.g., stability or solubility) of the resulting peptide. For example, the peptides can be modified by the substitution of a cysteine (C) with &#x3b1;-amino butyric acid (&#x201c;B&#x201d;). Due to its chemical nature, cysteine has the propensity to form disulfide bridges and sufficiently alter the peptide structurally so as to reduce binding capacity. Substituting &#x3b1;-amino butyric acid for C not only alleviates this problem, but actually improves binding and cross-binding capability in certain instances. Substitution of cysteine with &#x3b1;-amino butyric acid can occur at any residue of a neoantigenic peptide, e.g., at either anchor or non-anchor positions of an epitope or analog within a peptide, or at other positions of a peptide.</p><p id="p-0303" num="0289">The peptide may also be modified by extending or decreasing the compound's amino acid sequence, e.g., by the addition or deletion of amino acids. The peptides or analogs can also be modified by altering the order or composition of certain residues. It will be appreciated by the skilled artisan that certain amino acid residues essential for biological activity, e.g., those at critical contact sites or conserved residues, may generally not be altered without an adverse effect on biological activity. The non-critical amino acids need not be limited to those naturally occurring in proteins, such as L-&#x3b1;-amino acids, or their D-isomers, but may include non-natural amino acids as well, such as &#x3b2;-&#x3b3;-&#x3b4;-amino acids, as well as many derivatives of L-&#x3b1;-amino acids.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0290">In some embodiments, the peptide may be modified using a series of peptides with single amino acid substitutions to determine the effect of electrostatic charge, hydrophobicity, etc. on HLA binding. For instance, a series of positively charged (e.g., Lys or Arg) or negatively charged (e.g., Glu) amino acid substitutions may be made along the length of the peptide revealing different patterns of sensitivity towards various HLA molecules and T cell receptors. In addition, multiple substitutions using small, relatively neutral moieties such as Ala, Gly, Pro, or similar residues may be employed. The substitutions may be homo-oligomers or hetero-oligomers. The number and types of residues which are substituted or added depend on the spacing necessary between essential contact points and certain functional attributes which are sought (e.g., hydrophobicity versus hydrophilicity). Increased binding affinity for an HLA molecule or T cell receptor may also be achieved by such substitutions, compared to the affinity of the parent peptide. In any event, such substitutions should employ amino acid residues or other molecular fragments chosen to avoid, for example, steric and charge interference which might disrupt binding. Amino acid substitutions are typically of single residues. Substitutions, deletions, insertions, or any combination thereof may be combined to arrive at a final peptide.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0291">In some embodiments, the peptide described herein can comprise amino acid mimetics or unnatural amino acid residues, e.g., D- or L-naphylalanine; D- or L-phenylglycine; D- or L-2-thieneylalanine; D- or L-1,-2, 3-, or 4-pyreneylalanine; D- or L-3 thieneylalanine; D- or L-(2-pyridinyl)-alanine; D- or L-(3-pyridinyl)-alanine; D- or L-(2-pyrazinyl)-alanine; D- or L-(4-isopropyl)-phenylglycine; D-(trifluoromethyl)-phenylglycine; D-(trifluoro-methyl)-phenylalanine; D-&#x3c1;-fluorophenylalanine; D- or L-&#x3c1;-biphenyl-phenylalanine; D- or L-&#x3c1;-methoxybiphenylphenylalanine; D- or L-2-indole(allyl)alanines; and, D- or L-alkylalanines, where the alkyl group can be a substituted or unsubstituted methyl, ethyl, propyl, hexyl, butyl, pentyl, isopropyl, iso-butyl, sec-isotyl, iso-pentyl, or a non-acidic amino acid residues. Aromatic rings of a non-natural amino acid include, e.g., thiazolyl, thiophenyl, pyrazolyl, benzimidazolyl, naphthyl, furanyl, pyrrolyl, and pyridyl aromatic rings. Modified peptides that have various amino acid mimetics or unnatural amino acid residues may have increased stability in vivo. Such peptides may also have improved shelf-life or manufacturing properties.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0292">In some embodiments, a peptide described herein can be modified by terminal-NH<sub>2 </sub>acylation, e.g., by alkanoyl (C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>20</sub>) orthioglycolyl acetylation, terminal-carboxyl amidation, e.g., ammonia, methylamine, etc. In some embodiments these modifications can provide sites for linking to a support or other molecule. In some embodiments, the peptide described herein can contain modifications such as but not limited to glycosylation, side chain oxidation, biotinylation, phosphorylation, addition of a surface active material, e.g., a lipid, or can be chemically modified, e.g., acetylation, etc. Moreover, bonds in the peptide can be other than peptide bonds, e.g., covalent bonds, ester or ether bonds, disulfide bonds, hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, etc.</p><p id="p-0307" num="0293">In some embodiments, a peptide described herein can comprise carriers such as those well known in the art, e.g., thyroglobulin, albumins such as human serum albumin, tetanus toxoid, polyamino acid residues such as poly L-lysine and poly L-glutamic acid, influenza virus proteins, hepatitis B virus core protein, and the like.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0294">The peptides can be further modified to contain additional chemical moieties not normally part of a protein. Those derivatized moieties can improve the solubility, the biological half-life, absorption of the protein, or binding affinity. The moieties can also reduce or eliminate any desirable side effects of the peptides and the like. An overview for those moieties can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa. (2000). For example, neoantigenic peptides having the desired activity may be modified as necessary to provide certain desired attributes, e.g., improved pharmacological characteristics, while increasing or at least retaining substantially all of the biological activity of the unmodified peptide to bind the desired HLA molecule and activate the appropriate T cell. For instance, the peptide may be subject to various changes, such as substitutions, either conservative or non-conservative, where such changes might provide for certain advantages in their use, such as improved HLA binding. Such conservative substitutions may encompass replacing an amino acid residue with another amino acid residue that is biologically and/or chemically similar, e.g., one hydrophobic residue for another, or one polar residue for another. The effect of single amino acid substitutions may also be probed using D-amino acids. Such modifications may be made using well known peptide synthesis procedures, as described in e.g., Merrifield, Science 232:341-347 (1986), Barany &#x26; Merrifield, The Peptides, Gross &#x26; Meienhofer, eds. (N.Y., Academic Press), pp. 1-284 (1979); and Stewart &#x26; Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, (Rockford, Ill., Pierce), 2d Ed. (1984).</p><p id="p-0309" num="0295">In some embodiments, the peptide described herein may be conjugated to large, slowly metabolized macromolecules such as proteins; polysaccharides, such as sepharose, agarose, cellulose, cellulose beads; polymeric amino acids such as polyglutamic acid, polylysine; amino acid copolymers; inactivated virus particles; inactivated bacterial toxins such as toxoid from diphtheria, tetanus, cholera, leukotoxin molecules; inactivated bacteria; and dendritic cells.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0296">Changes to the peptide that may include, but are not limited to, conjugation to a carrier protein, conjugation to a ligand, conjugation to an antibody, PEGylation, polysialylation HESylation, recombinant PEG mimetics, Fc fusion, albumin fusion, nanoparticle attachment, nanoparticulate encapsulation, cholesterol fusion, iron fusion, acylation, amidation, glycosylation, side chain oxidation, phosphorylation, biotinylation, the addition of a surface active material, the addition of amino acid mimetics, or the addition of unnatural amino acids.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0297">Glycosylation can affect the physical properties of proteins and can also be important in protein stability, secretion, and subcellular localization. Proper glycosylation can be important for biological activity. In fact, some genes from eukaryotic organisms, when expressed in bacteria (e.g., <i>E. coli</i>) which lack cellular processes for glycosylating proteins, yield proteins that are recovered with little or no activity by virtue of their lack of glycosylation. Addition of glycosylation sites can be accomplished by altering the amino acid sequence. The alteration to the peptide or protein may be made, for example, by the addition of, or substitution by, one or more serine or threonine residues (for O-linked glycosylation sites) or asparagine residues (for N-linked glycosylation sites). The structures of N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides and the sugar residues found in each type may be different. One type of sugar that is commonly found on both is N-acetylneuraminic acid (hereafter referred to as sialic acid). Sialic acid is usually the terminal residue of both N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides and, by virtue of its negative charge, may confer acidic properties to the glycoprotein. Embodiments of the present disclosure comprise the generation and use of N-glycosylation variants. Removal of carbohydrates may be accomplished chemically or enzymatically, or by substitution of codons encoding amino acid residues that are glycosylated. Chemical deglycosylation techniques are known, and enzymatic cleavage of carbohydrate moieties on polypeptides can be achieved by the use of a variety of endo- and exo-glycosidases.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0298">Additional suitable components and molecules for conjugation include, for example, molecules for targeting to the lymphatic system, thyroglobulin; albumins such as human serum albumin (HAS); tetanus toxoid; Diphtheria toxoid; polyamino acids such as poly(D-lysine:D-glutamic acid); VP6 polypeptides of rotaviruses; influenza virus hemagglutinin, influenza virus nucleoprotein; Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH); and hepatitis B virus core protein and surface antigen; or any combination of the foregoing.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0299">Another type of modification is to conjugate (e.g., link) one or more additional components or molecules at the N- and/or C-terminus of a polypeptide sequence, such as another protein (e.g., a protein having an amino acid sequence heterologous to the subject protein), or a carrier molecule. Thus, an exemplary polypeptide sequence can be provided as a conjugate with another component or molecule. In some embodiments, fusion of albumin to the peptide or protein of the present disclosure can, for example, be achieved by genetic manipulation, such that the DNA coding for HSA, or a fragment thereof, is joined to the DNA coding for the one or more polypeptide sequences. Thereafter, a suitable host can be transformed or transfected with the fused nucleotide sequences in the form of, for example, a suitable plasmid, so as to express a fusion polypeptide. The expression may be effected in vitro from, for example, prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells, or in vivo from, for example, a transgenic organism. In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the expression of the fusion protein is performed in mammalian cell lines, for example, CHO cell lines. Furthermore, albumin itself may be modified to extend its circulating half-life. Fusion of the modified albumin to one or more polypeptides can be attained by the genetic manipulation techniques described above or by chemical conjugation; the resulting fusion molecule has a half-life that exceeds that of fusions with non-modified albumin (see, e.g., WO2011/051489). Several albumin-binding strategies have been developed as alternatives for direct fusion, including albumin binding through a conjugated fatty acid chain (acylation). Because serum albumin is a transport protein for fatty acids, these natural ligands with albumin-binding activity have been used for half-life extension of small protein therapeutics.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0300">Additional candidate components and molecules for conjugation include those suitable for isolation or purification. Non-limiting examples include binding molecules, such as biotin (biotin-avidin specific binding pair), an antibody, a receptor, a ligand, a lectin, or molecules that comprise a solid support, including, for example, plastic or polystyrene beads, plates or beads, magnetic beads, test strips, and membranes. Purification methods such as cation exchange chromatography may be used to separate conjugates by charge difference, which effectively separates conjugates into their various molecular weights. The content of the fractions obtained by cation exchange chromatography may be identified by molecular weight using conventional methods, for example, mass spectroscopy, SDS-PAGE, or other known methods for separating molecular entities by molecular weight.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0301">In some embodiments, the amino- or carboxyl-terminus of the peptide or protein sequence of the present disclosure can be fused with an immunoglobulin Fc region (e.g., human Fc) to form a fusion conjugate (or fusion molecule). Fc fusion conjugates have been shown to increase the systemic half-life of biopharmaceuticals, and thus the biopharmaceutical product may require less frequent administration. Fc binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in endothelial cells that line the blood vessels, and, upon binding, the Fc fusion molecule is protected from degradation and re-released into the circulation, keeping the molecule in circulation longer. This Fc binding is believed to be the mechanism by which endogenous IgG retains its long plasma half-life. More recent Fc-fusion technology links a single copy of a biopharmaceutical to the Fc region of an antibody to optimize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties of the biopharmaceutical as compared to traditional Fc-fusion conjugates.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0302">The present disclosure contemplates the use of other modifications, currently known or under development, of the peptides to improve one or more properties. One such method for prolonging the circulation half-life, increasing the stability, reducing the clearance, or altering the immunogenicity or allergenicity of the peptide of the present disclosure involves modification of the peptide sequences by hesylation, which utilizes hydroxyethyl starch derivatives linked to other molecules in order to modify the molecule's characteristics. Various aspects of hesylation are described in, for example, U.S. Patent Appln. Nos. 2007/0134197 and 2006/0258607.</p><p id="p-0317" num="0303">Peptide stability can be assayed in a number of ways. For instance, peptidases and various biological media, such as human plasma and serum, have been used to test stability. See, e.g., Verhoef, et al., Eur. J. Drug Metab. Pharmacokinetics 11:291 (1986). Half-life of the peptides described herein is conveniently determined using a 25% human serum (v/v) assay. The protocol is as follows: pooled human serum (Type AB, non-heat inactivated) is dilapidated by centrifugation before use. The serum is then diluted to 25% with RPMI-1640 or another suitable tissue culture medium. At predetermined time intervals, a small amount of reaction solution is removed and added to either 6% aqueous trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or ethanol. The cloudy reaction sample is cooled (4&#xb0; C.) for 15 minutes and then spun to pellet the precipitated serum proteins. The presence of the peptides is then determined by reversed-phase HPLC using stability-specific chromatography conditions.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0304">Issues associated with short plasma half-life or susceptibility to protease degradation may be overcome by various modifications, including conjugating or linking the peptide or protein sequence to any of a variety of non-proteinaceous polymers, e.g., polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol, or polyoxyalkylenes (see, for example, typically via a linking moiety covalently bound to both the protein and the nonproteinaceous polymer, e.g., a PEG). Such PEG conjugated biomolecules have been shown to possess clinically useful properties, including better physical and thermal stability, protection against susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, increased solubility, longer in vivo circulating half-life and decreased clearance, reduced immunogenicity and antigenicity, and reduced toxicity.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0305">PEGs suitable for conjugation to a polypeptide or protein sequence are generally soluble in water at room temperature, and have the general formula R&#x2014;(O&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>n</sub>&#x2014;O&#x2014;R, where R is hydrogen or a protective group such as an alkyl or an alkanol group, and where n is an integer from 1 to 1000. When R is a protective group, it generally has from 1 to 8 carbons. The PEG conjugated to the polypeptide sequence can be linear or branched. Branched PEG derivatives, &#x201c;star-PEGs&#x201d; and multi-armed PEGs are contemplated by the present disclosure. The present disclosure also contemplates compositions of conjugates wherein the PEGs have different n values and thus the various different PEGs are present in specific ratios. For example, some compositions comprise a mixture of conjugates where n=1, 2, 3, and 4. In some compositions, the percentage of conjugates where n=1 is 18-25%, the percentage of conjugates where n=2 is 50-66%, the percentage of conjugates where n=3 is 12-16%, and the percentage of conjugates where n=4 is up to 5%. Such compositions can be produced by reaction conditions and purification methods known in the art. For example, cation exchange chromatography may be used to separate conjugates, and a fraction is then identified which contains the conjugate having, for example, the desired number of PEGs attached, purified free from unmodified protein sequences and from conjugates having other numbers of PEGs attached.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0306">PEG may be bound to the peptide or protein of the present disclosure via a terminal reactive group (a &#x201c;spacer&#x201d;). The spacer is, for example, a terminal reactive group which mediates a bond between the free amino or carboxyl groups of one or more of the polypeptide sequences and PEG. The PEG having the spacer which may be bound to the free amino group includes N-hydroxysuccinylimide PEG which may be prepared by activating succinic acid ester of PEG with N-hydroxysuccinylimide. Another activated PEG which may be bound to a free amino group is 2,4-bis(O-methoxypolyethyleneglycol)-6-chloro-s-triazine which may be prepared by reacting PEG monomethyl ether with cyanuric chloride. The activated PEG which is bound to the free carboxyl group includes polyoxyethylenediamine.</p><p id="p-0321" num="0307">Conjugation of one or more of the peptide or protein sequences of the present disclosure to PEG having a spacer may be carried out by various conventional methods. For example, the conjugation reaction can be carried out in solution at a pH of from 5 to 10, at temperature from 4&#xb0; C. to room temperature, for 30 minutes to 20 hours, utilizing a molar ratio of reagent to peptide/protein of from 4:1 to 30:1. Reaction conditions may be selected to direct the reaction towards producing predominantly a desired degree of substitution. In general, low temperature, low pH (e.g., pH=5), and short reaction time tend to decrease the number of PEGs attached, whereas high temperature, neutral to high pH (e.g., pH&#x3e;7), and longer reaction time tend to increase the number of PEGs attached. Various means known in the art may be used to terminate the reaction. In some embodiments the reaction is terminated by acidifying the reaction mixture and freezing at, e.g., &#x2212;20&#xb0; C.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Neoepitopes</heading><p id="p-0322" num="0308">A neoepitope comprises a neoantigenic determinant part of a neoantigenic peptide or neoantigenic polypeptide that is recognized by immune system. A neoepitope refers to an epitope that is not present in a reference, such as a non-diseased cell, e.g., a non-cancerous cell or a germline cell, but is found in a diseased cell, e.g., a cancer cell. This includes situations where a corresponding epitope is found in a normal non-diseased cell or a germline cell but, due to one or more mutations in a diseased cell, e.g., a cancer cell, the sequence of the epitope is changed so as to result in the neoepitope. The term &#x201c;neoepitope&#x201d; is used interchangeably with &#x201c;tumor-specific epitope&#x201d; or &#x201c;tumor-specific neoepitope&#x201d; in the present specification to designate a series of residues, typically L-amino acids, connected one to the other, typically by peptide bonds between the &#x3b1;-amino and carboxyl groups of adjacent amino acids. The neoepitope can be a variety of lengths, either in their neutral (uncharged) forms or in forms which are salts, and either free of modifications such as glycosylation, side chain oxidation, or phosphorylation or containing these modifications, subject to the condition that the modification not destroy the biological activity of the polypeptides as herein described.

The term &#x201c;5&#x2032;-cap&#x201d; refers to a cap structure found on the 5&#x2032;-end of an mRNA molecule and generally consists of a guanosine nucleotide connected to the mRNA via an unusual 5&#x2032; to 5&#x2032; triphosphate linkage. In some embodiments, this guanosine is methylated at the 7-position. The term &#x201c;conventional 5&#x2032;-cap&#x201d; refers to a naturally occurring RNA 5&#x2032;-cap, to the 7-methylguanosine cap (m G). In the context of the present disclosure, the term &#x201c;5&#x2032;-cap&#x201d; includes a 5&#x2032;-cap analog that resembles the RNA cap structure and is modified to possess the ability to stabilize RNA and/or enhance translation of RNA if attached thereto, in vivo and/or in a cell.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0343">In certain embodiments, an mRNA encoding a neoantigenic peptide of the present disclosure is administered to a subject in need thereof. In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides RNA, oligoribonucleotide, and polyribonucleotide molecules comprising a modified nucleoside, gene therapy vectors comprising same, gene therapy methods and gene transcription silencing methods comprising same. In some embodiments, the mRNA to be administered comprises at least one modified nucleoside.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0344">The polynucleotides encoding peptides described herein can be synthesized by chemical techniques, for example, the phosphotriester method of Matteucci, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 103:3185 (1981). Polynucleotides encoding peptides comprising or consisting of an analog can be made simply by substituting the appropriate and desired nucleic acid base(s) for those that encode the native epitope.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0345">In some embodiments, the polynucleotides may comprise the coding sequence for the peptide or protein fused in the same reading frame to a polynucleotide which aids, for example, in expression and/or secretion of the peptide or protein from a host cell (e.g., a leader sequence which functions as a secretory sequence for controlling transport of a polypeptide from the cell). The polypeptide having a leader sequence is a pre-protein and can have the leader sequence cleaved by the host cell to form the mature form of the polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0360" num="0346">In some embodiments, the polynucleotides can comprise the coding sequence for the peptide or protein fused in the same reading frame to a marker sequence that allows, for example, for purification of the encoded peptide, which may then be incorporated into a personalized disease vaccine or immunogenic composition. For example, the marker sequence can be a hexa-histidine tag supplied by a pQE-9 vector to provide for purification of the mature polypeptide fused to the marker in the case of a bacterial host, or the marker sequence can be a hemagglutinin (HA) tag derived from the influenza hemagglutinin protein when a mammalian host (e.g., COS-7 cells) is used. Additional tags include, but are not limited to, Calmodulin tags, FLAG tags, Myc tags, S tags, SBP tags, Softag 1, Softag 3, V5 tag, Xpress tag, Isopeptag, SpyTag, Biotin Carboxyl Carrier Protein (BCCP) tags, GST tags, fluorescent protein tags (e.g., green fluorescent protein tags), maltose binding protein tags, Nus tags, Strep-tag, thioredoxin tag, TC tag, Ty tag, and the like.</p><p id="p-0361" num="0347">In some embodiments, the polynucleotides may comprise the coding sequence for one or more of the presently described peptides or proteins fused in the same reading frame to create a single concatamerized neoantigenic peptide construct capable of producing multiple neoantigenic peptides.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0348">In some embodiments, a DNA sequence is constructed using recombinant technology by isolating or synthesizing a DNA sequence encoding a wild-type protein of interest. Optionally, the sequence can be mutagenized by site-specific mutagenesis to provide functional analogs thereof. See, e.g. Zoeller et al., Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 81:5662-5066 (1984) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,588,585. In another embodiment, a DNA sequence encoding the peptide or protein of interest would be constructed by chemical synthesis using an oligonucleotide synthesizer. Such oligonucleotides can be designed based on the amino acid sequence of the desired peptide and selecting those codons that are favored in the host cell in which the recombinant polypeptide of interest is produced. Standard methods can be applied to synthesize an isolated polynucleotide sequence encoding an isolated polypeptide of interest. For example, a complete amino acid sequence can be used to construct a back-translated gene. Further, a DNA oligomer containing a nucleotide sequence coding for the particular isolated polypeptide can be synthesized. For example, several small oligonucleotides coding for portions of the desired polypeptide can be synthesized and then ligated. The individual oligonucleotides typically contain 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; overhangs for complementary assembly.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0349">Once assembled (e.g., by synthesis, site-directed mutagenesis, or another method), the polynucleotide sequences encoding a particular isolated polypeptide of interest is inserted into an expression vector and optionally operatively linked to an expression control sequence appropriate for expression of the protein in a desired host. Proper assembly can be confirmed by nucleotide sequencing, restriction mapping, and expression of a biologically active polypeptide in a suitable host. As well known in the art, in order to obtain high expression levels of a transfected gene in a host, the gene can be operatively linked to transcriptional and translational expression control sequences that are functional in the chosen expression host. Thus, the present disclosure is also directed to vectors, and expression vectors useful for the production and administration of the neoantigenic polypeptides and neoepitopes described herein, and to host cells comprising such vectors.</p><p id="p-0364" num="0350">In some embodiments, an expression vector capable of expressing the peptide or protein as described herein can also be prepared. Expression vectors for different cell types are well known in the art and can be selected without undue experimentation. Generally, the DNA is inserted into an expression vector, such as a plasmid, in proper orientation and correct reading frame for expression. If necessary, the DNA may be linked to the appropriate transcriptional and translational regulatory control nucleotide sequences recognized by the desired host (e.g., bacteria), although such controls are generally available in the expression vector. The vector is then introduced into the host bacteria for cloning using standard techniques (see, e.g., Sambrook et al.

In some embodiments, the vector is Modified Vaccinia Ankara (VA) (e.g. Bavarian Noridic (MVA-BN)).</p><p id="p-0368" num="0354">Various mammalian or insect cell culture systems are also advantageously employed to express recombinant protein. Expression of recombinant proteins in mammalian cells can be performed because such proteins are generally correctly folded, appropriately modified and completely functional. Examples of suitable mammalian host cell lines include the COS-7 lines of monkey kidney cells, described by Gluzman (Cell 23:175, 1981), and other cell lines capable of expressing an appropriate vector including, for example, L cells, C127, 3T3, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), 293, HeLa and BHK cell lines. Mammalian expression vectors can comprise nontranscribed elements such as an origin of replication, a suitable promoter and enhancer linked to the gene to be expressed, and other 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; flanking nontranscribed sequences, and 5&#x2032; or 3&#x2032; nontranslated sequences, such as necessary ribosome binding sites, a polyadenylation site, splice donor and acceptor sites, and transcriptional termination sequences. Baculovirus systems for production of heterologous proteins in insect cells are reviewed by Luckow and Summers, Bio/Technology 6:47 (1988).</p><p id="p-0369" num="0355">Host cells are genetically engineered (transduced or transformed or transfected) with the vectors which can be, for example, a cloning vector or an expression vector. The vector can be, for example, in the form of a plasmid, a viral particle, a phage, etc. The engineered host cells can be cultured in conventional nutrient media modified as appropriate for activating promoters, selecting transformants or amplifying the polynucleotides. The culture conditions, such as temperature, pH and the like, are those previously used with the host cell selected for expression, and will be apparent to the ordinarily skilled artisan.</p><p id="p-0370" num="0356">As representative examples of appropriate hosts, there can be mentioned: bacterial cells, such as <i>E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhimurium </i>and various species within the genera <i>Pseudomonas, Streptomyces</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus</i>; fungal cells, such as yeast; insect cells such as <i>Drosophila </i>and Sf9; animal cells such as COS-7 lines of monkey kidney fibroblasts, described by Gluzman, Cell 23:175 (1981), and other cell lines capable of expressing a compatible vector, for example, the C127, 3T3, CHO, HeLa and BHK cell lines or Bowes melanoma; plant cells, etc. The selection of an appropriate host is deemed to be within the scope of those skilled in the art from the teachings herein.</p><p id="p-0371" num="0357">Polynucleotides described herein can be administered and expressed in human cells (e.g., immune cells, including dendritic cells). A human codon usage table can be used to guide the codon choice for each amino acid. Such polynucleotides comprise spacer amino acid residues between epitopes and/or analogs, such as those described above, or can comprise naturally-occurring flanking sequences adjacent to the epitopes and/or analogs (and/or CTL (e.g., CD8+), Th (e.g., CD4+), and B cell epitopes).</p><p id="p-0372" num="0358">Standard regulatory sequences well known to those of skill in the art can be included in the vector to ensure expression in the human target cells. Several vector elements are desirable: a promoter with a downstream cloning site for polynucleotide, e.g., minigene insertion; a polyadenylation signal for efficient transcription termination; an <i>E. coli </i>origin of replication; and an <i>E. coli </i>selectable marker (e.g. ampicillin or kanamycin resistance). Numerous promoters can be used for this purpose, e.g., the human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) promoter. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,580,859 and 5,589,466 for other suitable promoter sequences. In some embodiments, the promoter is the CMV-IE promoter.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0359">Vectors may be introduced into animal tissues by a number of different methods. The two most popular approaches are injection of DNA in saline, using a standard hypodermic needle, and gene gun delivery. A schematic outline of the construction of a DNA vaccine plasmid and its subsequent delivery by these two methods into a host is illustrated at Scientific American (Weiner et al., (1999) Scientific American 281 (1): 34-41). Injection in saline is normally conducted intramuscularly (IM) in skeletal muscle, or intradermally (ID), with DNA being delivered to the extracellular spaces. This can be assisted by electroporation by temporarily damaging muscle fibers with myotoxins such as bupivacaine; or by using hypertonic solutions of saline or sucrose (Alarcon et al., (1999). Adv. Parasitol. Advances in Parasitology 42: 343-410). Immune responses to this method of delivery can be affected by many factors, including needle type, needle alignment, speed of injection, volume of injection, muscle type, and age, sex and physiological condition of the animal being injected (Alarcon et al., (1999). Adv. Parasitol. Advances in Parasitology 42: 343-410).</p><p id="p-0374" num="0360">Gene gun delivery, the other commonly used method of delivery, ballistically accelerates plasmid DNA (pDNA) that has been adsorbed onto gold or tungsten microparticles into the target cells, using compressed helium as an accelerant (Alarcon et al., (1999). Adv. Parasitol. Advances in Parasitology 42: 343-410; Lewis et al., (1999). Advances in Virus Research (Academic Press) 54: 129-88).</p><p id="p-0375" num="0361">Alternative delivery methods may include aerosol instillation of naked DNA on mucosal surfaces, such as the nasal and lung mucosa, (Lewis et al., (1999). Advances in Virus Research (Academic Press) 54: 129-88) and topical administration of pDNA to the eye and vaginal mucosa (Lewis et al., (1999) Advances in Virus Research (Academic Press) 54: 129-88). Mucosal surface delivery has also been achieved using cationic liposome-DNA preparations, biodegradable microspheres, attenuated <i>Shigella </i>or <i>Listeria </i>vectors for oral administration to the intestinal mucosa, and recombinant adenovirus vectors. DNA or RNA may also be delivered to cells following mild mechanical disruption of the cell membrane, temporarily permeabilizing the cells. Such a mild mechanical disruption of the membrane can be accomplished by gently forcing cells through a small aperture (Sharei et al., Ex Vivo Cytosolic Delivery of Functional Macromolecules to Immune Cells, PLOS ONE (2015)).</p><p id="p-0376" num="0362">Chemical means for introducing a polynucleotide into a host cell include colloidal dispersion systems, such as macromolecule complexes, nanocapsules, microspheres, beads, and lipid-based systems including oil-in-water emulsions, micelles, mixed micelles, and liposomes. An exemplary colloidal system for use as a delivery vehicle in vitro and in vivo is a liposome (e.g., an artificial membrane vesicle). In the case where a non-viral delivery system is utilized, an exemplary delivery vehicle is a liposome. &#x201c;Liposome&#x201d; is a generic term encompassing a variety of single and multilamellar lipid vehicles formed by the generation of enclosed lipid bilayers or aggregates. Liposomes can be characterized as having vesicular structures with a phospholipid bilayer membrane and an inner aqueous medium. Multilamellar liposomes have multiple lipid layers separated by aqueous medium. They form spontaneously when phospholipids are suspended in an excess of aqueous solution. The lipid components undergo self-rearrangement before the formation of closed structures and entrap water and dissolved solutes between the lipid bilayers (Ghosh et al., Glycobiology 5: 505-10 (1991)). However, compositions that have different structures in solution than the normal vesicular structure are also encompassed. For example, the lipids may assume a micellar structure or merely exist as nonuniform aggregates of lipid molecules. Also contemplated are lipofectamine-nucleic acid complexes.</p><p id="p-0377" num="0363">The use of lipid formulations is contemplated for the introduction of the nucleic acids into a host cell (in vitro, ex vivo or in vivo). In another aspect, the nucleic acid may be associated with a lipid. The nucleic acid associated with a lipid may be encapsulated in the aqueous interior of a liposome, interspersed within the lipid bilayer of a liposome, attached to a liposome via a linking molecule that is associated with both the liposome and the oligonucleotide, entrapped in a liposome, complexed with a liposome, dispersed in a solution containing a lipid, mixed with a lipid, combined with a lipid, contained as a suspension in a lipid, contained or complexed with a micelle, or otherwise associated with a lipid. Lipid, lipid/DNA or lipid/expression vector associated compositions are not limited to any particular structure in solution. For example, they may be present in a bilayer structure, as micelles, or with a &#x201c;collapsed&#x201d; structure. They may also simply be interspersed in a solution, possibly forming aggregates that are not uniform in size or shape. Lipids are fatty substances which may be naturally occurring or synthetic lipids. For example, lipids include the fatty droplets that naturally occur in the cytoplasm as well as the class of compounds which contain long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives, such as fatty acids, alcohols, amines, amino alcohols, and aldehydes. Lipids suitable for use can be obtained from commercial sources. Stock solutions of lipids in chloroform or chloroform/methanol can be stored at about &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. Chloroform is used as the only solvent since it is more readily evaporated than methanol.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">4. Antigen Presenting Cells (APCs)</heading><p id="p-0378" num="0364">Antigen presenting cells (APC) present peptide fragments of protein antigens in association with MHC molecules on their cell surface. A presented peptide is associated with a MHC molecule as a peptide-MHC complex (pMHC) on the cell surface of the APC. Processing and presentation of peptide-MHC complexes can involve a series of sequential stages comprising: protease-mediated digestion of proteins; peptide transport into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) mediated by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP); formation of peptide-MHC I molecules using newly synthesized MHC molecules; and transport of peptide-MHC molecules to the cell surface.</p><p id="p-0379" num="0365">Some APCs may activate antigen specific T cells. For example, a T cell comprising a T cell receptor (TCR) that interacts with a pMHC may be activated, stimulated, induced, or expanded upon formation of a TCR-pMHC. In some embodiments, an MHC (e.g., a class I MHC or a class II MHC) of an APC can be loaded with a peptide and presented by an APC by introducing into the APC a nucleic acid (e.g., an RNA) encoding an antigen peptide or polypeptide comprising the peptide sequence to be presented.</p><p id="p-0380" num="0366">From a biological perspective, in order for a somatic mutation to generate an immune response several criteria need to be satisfied: the allele containing the mutation should be expressed by the cell, the mutation should be in a protein coding region and nonsynonymous, the translated protein should be cleaved by the proteasome or other cellular protein degradation pathway and an epitope containing the mutation should be presented by the MHC complex, the presented epitope should be recognized by a TCR and, finally, the TCR-pMHC complex should launch a signaling cascade that activates the T cell.</p><p id="p-0381" num="0367">Monocytes can circulate in the bloodstream and then move into tissues where they can differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells. Classical monocytes are typically characterized by high levels of expression of the CD14 cell surface receptor. Monocytes and B cells can be competent APCs, although their antigen presenting capacities appear to be limited to the re-activation of previously sensitized T cells. These cell types may not be capable of directly activating functionally na&#xef;ve or unprimed T cell populations. Professional antigen-presenting cells are very efficient at internalizing antigen, either by phagocytosis or by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and then displaying a fragment of the antigen, bound to a MHC molecule, on their membrane. The T cell recognizes and interacts with the antigen-MHC molecule complex on the membrane of the APC. An additional co-stimulatory signal is then produced by the APC, leading to activation of the T cell. The expression of co-stimulatory molecules is a typical feature of professional APCs.</p><p id="p-0382" num="0368">Professional APCs can be very efficient at internalizing antigen, either by phagocytosis or by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and then displaying a fragment of the antigen, bound to a MHC molecule, on their membrane. The T cell can recognize and interact with the antigen-MHC molecule complex on the membrane of the APC. An additional co-stimulatory signal can then be produced by the APC, leading to activation of the T cell. The expression of co-stimulatory molecules can be a defining feature of professional antigen-presenting cells. Examples of professional APCs can include, but are not limited to, dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and B-cells. Professional APCs may express high levels of MHC class II, ICAM-1 and B7-2.</p><p id="p-0383" num="0369">One of the main types of professional APCs is DCs, which have the broadest range of antigen presentation. Other main types of professional APCs include macrophages, B-cells, and certain activated epithelial cells. DCs are leukocyte populations that present antigens (e.g., antigens captured in peripheral tissues) to T cells via MHC class II and I antigen presentation pathways. DCs are capable of both activating na&#xef;ve and previously primed T cells (e.g., memory T cells). DCs can be leukocyte populations that present antigens captured in peripheral tissues to T cells via MHC class I and II antigen presentation pathways. DCs can be potent inducers of immune responses and the activation of these cells can be a critical step for the induction of antitumoral immunity.</p><p id="p-0384" num="0370">DCs can be categorized as &#x201c;immature&#x201d; and &#x201c;mature&#x201d; cells, which can be used as a simple way to discriminate between two well characterized phenotypes. However, this nomenclature should not be construed to exclude all possible intermediate stages of differentiation. Immature DCs can be characterized as APCs with a high capacity for antigen uptake and processing, which correlates with the high expression of Fc&#x3b3; receptor and mannose receptor. The mature phenotype can be typically characterized by a lower expression of these markers, but a high expression of cell surface molecules responsible for T cell activation such as class I and class II MHC, adhesion molecules (e.g., CD54 and CD11) and costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD40, CD80, CD86 and 4-1BB). Mature DCs may be CD11b<sup>+</sup>, CD11c<sup>+</sup>, HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>, CD80<sup>+</sup>, CD86<sup>+</sup>, CD54<sup>+</sup>, CD3<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, CD19<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, CD14<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, CD141<sup>+</sup> (BDCA-3), and/or CD1a<sup>+</sup>. DC maturation can be referred to as the status of DC activation at which such antigen presenting DCs lead to T cell priming, while presentation by immature DCs results in tolerance. DC maturation can be caused by biomolecules with microbial features detected by innate receptors (e.g., bacterial DNA, viral RNA, endotoxins, etc.), pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFs, interleukins, and interferons), ligation of CD40 on the DC surface by CD40L, and substances released from cells undergoing cell death. Further non-limiting examples of cytokines that can induce DC maturation include IL-4, GM-CSF, TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-1&#x3b2;, PGE1, and IL-6. For example, DCs may be derived by culturing bone marrow cells in vitro with cytokines, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x3b1;). For example, DCs may be derived from CD14&#x2032; monocytes isolated from PBMCs. Cytokines or growth factors that can be used for deriving monocytes into DCs include, but are not limited to, GM-CSF, IL-4, FLT3L, TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-1&#x3b2;, PGE1, IL-6, IL-7, IFN-&#x3b1;, R848, LPS, ss-rna40, and polyLC.</p><p id="p-0385" num="0371">Typically, non-professional antigen-presenting cells do not constitutively express MHC class II proteins.

Populations of leukocytes can be prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art. Such methods typically include collecting heparinized blood, apheresis or leukopheresis, preparation of buffy coats, rosetting, centrifugation, density gradient centrifugation (e.g., using Ficoll, colloidal silica particles, and sucrose), differential lysis non-leukocyte cells, and filtration.

For example, a subject can be given an agent while undergoing a course of treatment with a second therapeutic agent (e.g., chemotherapy). In certain embodiments, a neoantigen therapeutic will be administered within 1 year of the treatment with a second therapeutic agent. It will further be appreciated that the two (or more) agents or treatments can be administered to the subject within a matter of hours or minutes (i.e., substantially simultaneously).</p><p id="p-0454" num="0440">For the treatment of a disease, the appropriate dosage of a neoantigen therapeutic described herein depends on the type of disease to be treated, the severity and course of the disease, the responsiveness of the disease, whether the agent is administered for therapeutic or preventative purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history, and so on, all at the discretion of the treating physician. The neoantigen therapeutic can be administered one time or over a series of treatments lasting from several days to several months, or until a cure is effected or a diminution of the disease state is achieved (e.g., reduction in tumor size). Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the body of the patient and will vary depending on the relative potency of an individual agent. The administering physician can determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies, and repetition rates.</p><p id="p-0455" num="0441">In some embodiments, a neoantigen therapeutic can be administered at an initial higher &#x201c;loading&#x201d; dose, followed by one or more lower doses. In some embodiments, the frequency of administration can also change. In some embodiments, a dosing regimen can comprise administering an initial dose, followed by additional doses (or &#x201c;maintenance&#x201d; doses) once a week, once every two weeks, once every three weeks, or once every month. For example, a dosing regimen can comprise administering an initial loading dose, followed by a weekly maintenance dose of, for example, one-half of the initial dose; a dosing regimen can comprise administering an initial loading dose, followed by maintenance doses of, for example one-half of the initial dose every other week; or a dosing regimen can comprise administering three initial doses for 3 weeks, followed by maintenance doses of, for example, the same amount every other week.</p><p id="p-0456" num="0442">As is known to those of skill in the art, administration of any therapeutic agent can lead to side effects and/or toxicities. In some cases, the side effects and/or toxicities are so severe as to preclude administration of the particular agent at a therapeutically effective dose. In some cases, therapy must be discontinued, and other agents can be tried. However, many agents in the same therapeutic class display similar side effects and/or toxicities, meaning that the patient either has to stop therapy, or if possible, suffer from the unpleasant side effects associated with the therapeutic agent.</p><p id="p-0457" num="0443">In some embodiments, the dosing schedule can be limited to a specific number of administrations or &#x201c;cycles.&#x201d; In some embodiments, the agent is administered for 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more cycles. For example, the agent is administered every 2 weeks for 6 cycles, the agent is administered every 3 weeks for 6 cycles, the agent is administered every 2 weeks for 4 cycles, the agent is administered every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, etc. Dosing schedules can be decided upon and subsequently modified by those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0458" num="0444">The present disclosure provides methods of administering to a subject a neoantigen therapeutic described herein comprising using an intermittent dosing strategy for administering one or more agents, which can reduce side effects and/or toxicities associated with administration of an agent, chemotherapeutic agent, etc. In some embodiments, a method for treating cancer in a human subject comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective dose of a neoantigen therapeutic in combination with a therapeutically effective dose of a chemotherapeutic agent, wherein one or both of the agents are administered according to an intermittent dosing strategy.

The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. Fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Antibacterial and antifungal agents include, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid and thimerosal. Isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, and sodium chloride can be included in the composition.

For intravenous, injection, or injection at the site of affliction, the active ingredient will be in the form of a parenterally acceptable aqueous solution which is pyrogen-free and has suitable pH, isotonicity, and stability. Those of relevant skill in the art are well able to prepare suitable solutions using, for example, isotonic vehicles such as Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Lactated Ringer's Injection. Preservatives, stabilizers, buffers, antioxidants and/or other additives can be included, as needed. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating an active ingredient in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active ingredient into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation can be vacuum drying and freeze drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.</p><p id="p-0466" num="0452">Compositions can be conventionally administered intravenously, such as by injection of a unit dose, for example.

Proteins or peptides may be made by any technique known to those of skill in the art, including expression of proteins, polypeptides, or peptides through standard molecular biological techniques, isolation of proteins or peptides from natural sources, in vitro translation, or the chemical synthesis of proteins or peptides. In general, such disease-specific neoantigens may be produced either in vitro or in vivo. Immunogenic neoantigens may be produced in vitro as peptides or polypeptides, which may then be formulated into a personalized vaccine or immunogenic composition and administered to a subject. In vitro production of immunogenic neoantigens can comprise peptide synthesis or expression of a peptide/polypeptide from a DNA or RNA molecule in any of a variety of bacterial, eukaryotic, or viral recombinant expression systems, followed by purification of the expressed peptide/polypeptide. Alternatively, immunogenic neoantigens can be produced in vivo by introducing molecules (e.g., DNA, RNA, and viral expression systems) that encode an immunogenic neoantigen into a subject, whereupon the encoded immunogenic neoantigens are expressed.

The polynucleotide may be, e.g., DNA, cDNA, single- and/or double-stranded, native or stabilized forms of polynucleotides, or combinations thereof. A nucleic acid encoding an immunogenic neoantigen peptide may or may not contain introns so long as it codes for the peptide. In some embodiments in vitro translation is used to produce the peptide.</p><p id="p-0499" num="0485">Expression vectors comprising sequences encoding the neoantigen, as well as host cells containing the expression vectors, are also contemplated. Expression vectors suitable for use in the present disclosure can comprise at least one expression control element operationally linked to the nucleic acid sequence.

The vector is then introduced into the host bacteria for cloning using standard techniques. Useful expression vectors for eukaryotic hosts, especially mammals or humans include, for example, vectors comprising expression control sequences from SV40, bovine papilloma virus, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus. Useful expression vectors for bacterial hosts include known bacterial plasmids, such as plasmids from <i>E. coli</i>, including pCR 1, pBR322, pMB9 and their derivatives, wider host range plasmids, such as M13 and filamentous single-stranded DNA phages.

Representative flow cytometry results for a multimer assay are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>C</figref>. In this string, the sequence preceding the Gli3 sequence is from a non-natural context. This may have enhanced the processing and presentation of Gli3 from the poly-peptide string, and have increased the response compared to peptide. Additionally, the mRNA shortmer string gave rise to a ME-1 T cell response, which was not present in the congruent short peptide pool. In our strings, ME-1 has cleavage sites before and after the epitope sequence, and this enhanced processing and presentation on the epitope could lead to superior T cell responses.</p><heading
