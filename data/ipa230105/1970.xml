More particularly, in one example, the present disclosure relates to a one-wheeled carrier operable to support and carry a train car coupling knuckle. Specifically, in another example, the present disclosure relates to a compact single wheeled train car knuckle carrier operable to transport a train car knuckle over distance while occupying minimal space within a train engine or storage area.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Background Information</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Trains perform an important transportation function around the world, including the transportation and movement of goods and people over long distances and at potentially very high speeds. Trains typically consist of a powered car commonly referred to as an engine or locomotive and a series of rail cars, which may be commonly referred to as train cars or railroad cars. These rail cars may be used in the transport of goods and materials across a distance as part of a cargo or freight train or may be used to transport people as part of a passenger train. While these rail cars tend to take many different forms and include many different types, rail cars tend to include one common component, namely, the coupling mechanisms which are commonly referred to as coupling knuckles or, simply, knuckles.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">While these knuckles may take different forms and operate in different manners, they are generally standardized to fit rail cars of different types and different configurations across regions. For example, a common coupler known as the Janney coupler, is commonly used in North America, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Brazil, China, and elsewhere. As trains can be long and carry significant weight, these knuckles are quite robust, often weighing around 100 pounds or more to support the weight of the train being pulled by the engine or locomotive. Although they are robust, these knuckles are subjected to extreme stress and have a tendency to break over time. Thus, it is common that a train will have additional knuckles for use as replacements in the event of a knuckle break or failure.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Modern trains, particularly freight trains, can be extremely long, sometimes stretching longer than a mile or more from engine to the last car. In the event of a knuckle break, the engineer and/or other railroad employees must typically transport a new knuckle from its storage location in the engine to the location of the break. Again, as knuckles can be very heavy, typically around 100 pounds, and trains can be long, this may result in difficulty for the person or persons responsible for transporting a replacement knuckle to the location of the break.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, knuckle carriers exist to alleviate the burden of carrying a 100 pound or more components over a great distance; however, each of the current solutions available has additional shortcomings. First, it is common for two persons to carry a knuckle in tandem utilizing a solid straight bar which may be inserted through an aperture in the knuckle and supported on each end by a person. These set ups still require the full weight of the knuckle plus the weight of the bar to be borne by individuals and carried over what could be a significant distance resulting in fatigue, wasted time, and even a high potential for injury to the persons carrying the knuckle, especially considering that the terrain that the two-person tandem team must traverse. Other carriers utilizing wheeled dollies and the like tend to have two wheels and a significant support system which can be bulky and heavy of its own as well as may occupy a large amount of space for storage and transport within the engine or in the compartment. While they alleviate the stress on the user, these carriers take up space in an area, such as the cabin or a compartment in the engine, where space is inherently limited and may be heavy and difficult to maneuver in and of themselves.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure addresses these and other issues by providing a compact single wheeled knuckle carrier which may be easily stowed and take up minimal space within the engine, or other location on the train, while simultaneously being easily maneuverable and robust enough to assist a person in carrying a train knuckle over rough terrain and over distance.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure may provide a knuckle carrier comprising: a body having a handle at a first end thereof; a single wheel at a second end of the body of the knuckle carrier; a support plate attached to the body of the knuckle carrier proximate the wheel; a support member extending vertically from the support plate and parallel to the body of the knuckle carrier, the support member being configured to carry a coupler knuckle; and a slidable lock plate operable to lock the coupler knuckle in place on the support member.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect, an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure may provide a method of transporting a coupler knuckle comprising: sliding a lock plate to a first position on a body of a knuckle carrier, wherein the lock plate is not engaged with a support member extending parallel to the body and vertically from a support plate connected to the body of the knuckle carrier; engaging a coupler knuckle with the support member; sliding the lock plate from the first position to a second position on the body of the knuckle carrier wherein the lock plate engages the support member; and moving the knuckle carrier from a first location to a second location using a single wheel connected thereto.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another aspect, an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure may provide a method of replacing a coupler knuckle comprising: removing a single-wheeled knuckle carrier from a storage position within an engine of a train; sliding a lock plate to a first position on a body of the knuckle carrier, wherein the lock plate is not engaged with a support member extending parallel to the body and vertically from a support plate connected to the body of the knuckle carrier; engaging a first coupler knuckle with the support member; sliding the lock plate from the first position to a second position on the body of the knuckle carrier wherein the lock plate engages the support member; moving the knuckle carrier from a first location to a second location via the single wheel; removing the first coupler knuckle from the knuckle carrier when the knuckle carrier is in the second location; and replacing a second coupler knuckle on a rail car with the first coupler knuckle.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Sample embodiments of the present disclosure are set forth in the following description, are shown in the drawings and are particularly and distinctly pointed out and set forth in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a left side perspective isometric view of a compact knuckle carrier, according to one aspect of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a front lower perspective right side isometric view of a compact knuckle carrier of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a top plan view of a compact knuckle carrier of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a bottom plan view of a compact knuckle carrier, according to one aspect of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a left side elevation view of a compact knuckle carrier, according to one aspect of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a right side elevation view of a compact knuckle carrier, according to one aspect of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a rear elevation view of a compact knuckle carrier, according to one aspect of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a front elevation view of a compact knuckle carrier, according to one aspect of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an exploded rear perspective view of a compact knuckle carrier, according to one aspect of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a left side elevation exploded view of a compact knuckle carrier, according to one aspect of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is an operational view of a compact knuckle carrier, according to one aspect of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is an operational view of a compact knuckle carrier, according to one aspect of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Similar numbers refer to similar parts throughout the drawings.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a single wheeled compact knuckle carrier is shown and generally referenced as carrier <b>10</b>.

Carrier <b>10</b> may further include a knuckle attachment assembly <b>20</b> operable to interact with and hold a train coupling knuckle <b>22</b>, as discussed further herein.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Carrier <b>10</b> may be generally formed of a single length of material such as tubular steel or other similar materials and may extend vertically between handle <b>12</b> at a first end and wheel fork <b>16</b> at a second end opposite therefrom. Accordingly, handle <b>12</b> and body <b>14</b> may be integrally formed and may be shaped ergonomically, as discussed further herein, to assist and operator in utilizing carrier <b>10</b>, as discussed below. Alternatively, handle <b>12</b> may be separate and distinct from yet connected to body <b>14</b> through any suitable means including mechanical fasteners, welding, epoxies, adhesives, or the like.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Handle <b>12</b> may further include one or more grip portions and/or grips indicated in figures at reference numeral <b>24</b>. As shown and described herein, handle <b>12</b> may include a first grip <b>24</b>A and a second grip <b>24</b>B. Grips <b>24</b> may be placed strategically on handle <b>12</b> to provide multiple gripping surfaces that may be both ergonomically comfortable while providing maximum surface area for an operator to grip handle <b>12</b>. Grips <b>24</b> may be any suitable material which may be placed over handle <b>12</b> such as rubber, leather, or the like, or may be textured material or textured sections of handle <b>12</b> such as a rubberized coating and/or knurled surface or the like, as dictated by the desired implementation.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Handle <b>12</b> may further include one or more bent sections indicated at reference <b>26</b>, which may give handle <b>12</b> an ergonomic contour to allow ease in handling an operation while utilizing carrier <b>10</b>, as discussed below. According to one example, handle <b>12</b> may include a first curved portion <b>26</b>A which may provide that first grip <b>24</b>A may be substantially parallel with a ground surface when the length of body <b>14</b> of carrier <b>10</b> aligned directly vertical. Further, according to this example, handle <b>12</b> may then include a second curved portion <b>26</b>B to provide handle <b>12</b> with the proper contour while rejoining handle <b>12</b> with body <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Body <b>14</b> may then be an elongated generally vertical member extending between handle <b>12</b> at a first end and wheel fork <b>16</b> at the second end and may be, as discussed above, a generally straight section of tubular steel or other similar materials, as dictated by the desired implementation.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Wheel fork <b>16</b> may be joined to body <b>14</b> at joint <b>27</b> which may be a fixed or permanent connection such as through welding or the like, or may be a movable connection such as a swivel or the like. Alternatively, joints <b>27</b> may be formed using mechanical fasteners such as bolts, screws, or the like to allow wheel fork <b>16</b> and wheel <b>18</b> to be removed from body <b>14</b>, as desired and/or as necessary. Wheel fork <b>16</b> may be of suitable width and length to accommodate a wheel <b>18</b> with a tire <b>28</b> installed thereon of varying sizes, according to the desired implementation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Wheel <b>18</b> and tire <b>28</b> may be any standard or suitable wheel and tire arrangement including standard steel wheels <b>18</b> with pneumatic tire <b>28</b>, solid tire <b>28</b> and/or a fully integrated wheel and tire system, again as dictated by the desired implementation. According to one aspect, wheel <b>18</b> and tire <b>28</b> may be a solid urethane, polyurethane, or other suitable material flat-free or puncture resistant wheel/tire combination; however, it will be understood that any suitable wheel and tire arrangement may be utilized. Wheel <b>18</b> and tire <b>28</b> may be connected wheel fork <b>16</b> via a bolt <b>30</b> and nut <b>32</b>, as pictured, or through any other suitable attachment mechanism wherein wheel <b>18</b> and tire <b>28</b> may rotate and/or spin relative to carrier <b>10</b> through principles of normal operation. According to the example shown and described herein, wherein wheel <b>18</b> and tire <b>28</b> are attached via bolt <b>30</b> and nut <b>32</b>, bolt <b>30</b> and nut <b>32</b> may generally form an axle about which wheel <b>18</b> and tire <b>28</b> may spin. Wheel <b>18</b> and tire <b>28</b> may including a braking system operatively coupled thereto with a brake control connected to any portion of the body <b>14</b> or handle <b>12</b> that would allow an operator to effectuate a braking action of the wheel <b>18</b> and tire <b>28</b> through actuation of the brake control. Wheel <b>18</b> and/or tire <b>28</b> may be any suitable size having any suitable diameter, width, tread depth, height, or the like.

Knuckle attachment assembly <b>20</b> or simply knuckle assembly <b>20</b> may be operable to support, carry, and secure a knuckle <b>22</b> to carrier <b>10</b> for transport thereof, as described further herein. In particular, support member <b>38</b> may pass through an aperture <b>46</b> defined through knuckle <b>22</b> (best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Support plate <b>34</b> and gusset <b>36</b> may be fixedly attached to body <b>14</b> at or near wheel fork <b>16</b> through any suitable means including welding, mechanical fasteners, or the like, or any suitable combination of attachment mechanisms. However, it is possible for the support plate <b>34</b> to be affixed closer to handle <b>12</b>, yet this may be less desirable as the center of gravity of the carrier should be as low as possible to provide greater stability of the carrier <b>10</b> when the knuckle <b>22</b> is attached. Support plate <b>34</b> and gusset <b>36</b> may be formed of any suitable material provided that is configured and sufficiently strong enough to support the weight of knuckle <b>22</b> over repeated uses of carrier <b>10</b>, as well as during transport of knuckle <b>22</b>, which may be performed over rough terrain. According to one non-limiting example, as shown and described, support plate <b>34</b> and gusset <b>36</b> may be formed of steel of sufficient thickness and size, as to impart the desired strength to support knuckle <b>22</b> and may be welded to body <b>14</b> and/or wheel fork <b>16</b> to impart suitable strength thereto.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Support member <b>38</b> may then extend vertically from support plate <b>34</b> and may generally be parallel to body <b>14</b>. Support member <b>38</b> may be a section of tubular steel or similar materials suitably sized to secure knuckle <b>22</b> to knuckle assembly <b>20</b>, as described further herein. More particularly, support member <b>38</b> has a diameter that is complementary to or slightly smaller than the diameter of aperture <b>46</b> on knuckle <b>22</b> to allow the support member <b>38</b> to slidably receive the knuckle thereon through the aperture <b>46</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Lock plate <b>40</b> and lock collar <b>42</b> may be formed as a single unit, which may be vertically slidable about body <b>14</b> to allow clearance and space for knuckle <b>22</b> to be installed and removed from knuckle assembly <b>20</b>, as described further below. Lock plate <b>40</b> and lock collar <b>42</b> may be formed of any suitable material such as steel or other similar metals and may include a thumbscrew <b>44</b>, which may pass through a thumbscrew aperture <b>48</b> defined in collar <b>42</b> to interact with body <b>14</b>, as discussed below, to secure lock plate <b>40</b> and lock collar <b>42</b> in position. According to one aspect (as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>), body <b>14</b> may further include a screw aperture <b>50</b> which may be complementary to thumbscrew aperture <b>48</b> in lock collar, which may allow thumbscrew <b>44</b> to interact with both lock collar <b>42</b> and body <b>14</b> to secure lock plate <b>40</b> and lock collar <b>42</b> in a specific position, which may be a position defined by the standardized size of a train knuckle <b>22</b>. According to another aspect, screw aperture <b>50</b> may be omitted and thumbscrew <b>44</b> may operate on a tension principle wherein the tension between thumbscrew <b>44</b> and body <b>14</b> may secure or hold lock plate <b>40</b> and lock collar <b>42</b> in position, as desired. Lock plate <b>40</b> may further define an aperture <b>52</b> which may be placed and sized to accept a portion of support member <b>38</b> therethrough as to further secure knuckle <b>22</b> thereon, as discussed further below. Aperture <b>52</b> is best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Having thus described the elements and components of carrier <b>10</b>, the use and operation thereof will now be discussed.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, but with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, carrier <b>10</b> may be utilized in transporting a train coupler knuckle, such as knuckle <b>22</b>, across distance. Specifically, as mentioned above, carrier <b>10</b> may offer a lightweight, compact, easily stored system for carrying a train knuckle from a first point to a second point. It is common in the railroad industry for trains, particularly long and heavily-laden freight trains, to suffer a breakage or failure of a coupling knuckle, such as knuckle <b>22</b> which is operable to couple adjacent railcars within the train. When a knuckle fails, it typically cannot be repaired and/or cannot be repaired onsite. Therefore, it is common practice to have one or more spare knuckles, such as knuckle <b>22</b>, onboard the engine for ready replacement in the event of a knuckle failure. In such an event, the engineer must retrieve a replacement knuckle from its storage position and transport it to the location of the knuckle failure. Often, as these trains can be long, with some stretching over 1.5 miles or more, the railroad employee or engineer must transport the knuckle a significant distance from its storage position in the engine compartments to the location of the knuckle failure. As these knuckles can be heavy, this is a daunting task that often requires a second person and/or some form of transport device. Carrier <b>10</b>, therefore, may be utilized in transporting a knuckle over distance and over potentially rough terrain such as ballast or other uneven surfaces typically found surrounding train tracks, while sparing the engineer the need for a second person and/or providing relief in transporting a heavy replacement knuckle over a long distance.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Accordingly, in the event of a knuckle failure wherein a replacement knuckle is required, the engineer or train operator may first retrieve carrier <b>10</b> from a storage position given that carrier <b>10</b> is compact and only utilizes a single wheeled assembly, it may be more easily and readily stored and retrieved while taking up minimal space of already limited space within the locomotive cabin. Alternatively, carrier <b>10</b> configured as described herein, can be stored in other less conventional or common ways such as hanging carrier <b>10</b> from an elevated position such as a ceiling, wall, or the like via a hook. Further, given the strength of materials and robustness of carrier <b>10</b>, carrier <b>10</b> may be stored on an exterior wall of the engine if desired so as to not occupy space within the engine cabin.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Once the operator retrieves carrier <b>10</b> from its storage position, the operator may install a knuckle <b>22</b> thereon. Specifically, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the operator may remove or loosen thumbscrew <b>44</b> from lock collar <b>42</b> and may slide lock collar <b>42</b> vertically along body <b>14</b> to provide clearance for knuckle <b>22</b>. The sliding lock collar <b>42</b> vertically is indicated by Arrow A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. Once the lock collar <b>42</b> and lock plate <b>40</b> are clear of support member <b>38</b>, knuckle <b>22</b> may be moved into position over support member <b>38</b> as indicated by the dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. Namely, the aperture <b>46</b> on knuckle <b>22</b> is aligned with the support member <b>38</b> and slid downwardly towards the wheel <b>18</b> with the aperture <b>46</b> slidably receiving the support member <b>38</b>. Once knuckle <b>22</b> is slid down over support member <b>38</b> and placed in contact with support plate <b>34</b>, lock collar <b>42</b> may be slid downward into position above knuckle <b>22</b> such that aperture <b>52</b> in lock plate <b>40</b> may slide over a portion of support member <b>38</b> and contact an upper portion of knuckle <b>22</b>. Once in position, thumbscrew <b>44</b> may be tightened and, in embodiments wherein body <b>14</b> includes a screw aperture <b>50</b>, thumbscrew <b>44</b> may be aligned therewith and tightened to have at least a portion inserted into aperture <b>50</b> to secure lock collar <b>42</b> and lock plate <b>40</b> in position, thus further securing knuckle <b>22</b> onto support member <b>38</b>. In embodiments wherein aperture <b>50</b> is not present, thumbscrew <b>44</b> may be tightened until sufficient tension exists to secure lock collar <b>42</b> and lock plate <b>40</b> in position.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">With knuckle <b>22</b> thus installed on knuckle assembly <b>20</b> and carrier <b>10</b>, the engineer may then utilize handle <b>12</b> and/or grips <b>24</b> to steer and/or otherwise transport (i.e., push or pull) knuckle <b>22</b> to the desired location, i.e. the location of knuckle failure, to allow replace of the damaged or broken knuckle <b>22</b>. As configured and shown in the figures, it is contemplated that, during operation, the knuckle <b>22</b> will be transported above body <b>14</b> as handle is lowered to allow for the operator to utilize carrier <b>10</b>. The lowering of the handle &#x201c;tilts&#x201d; the carrier towards the ground to define an acute angle of the body <b>14</b> relative to the ground surface. This configuration further supports the weight of the knuckle above the wheel making carrier <b>10</b> more efficient and easier to maneuver as opposed to the weight of the knuckle being supported below the body <b>14</b> of carrier <b>10</b>. This further allows the weight of knuckle <b>22</b> to be distributed throughout the entire carrier <b>10</b> and reduces the stress and fatigue placed on support member <b>38</b>, support plate <b>34</b>, and gusset <b>36</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Once the knuckle <b>22</b> is transported to the desired location, the replacement knuckle <b>22</b> may be removed from carrier by reversing the previous steps. In particular, thumbscrew <b>44</b> may be loosened and lock collar <b>42</b> and lock plate <b>40</b> may be slid vertically out of the way and knuckle <b>22</b> may be raised up and off of support member <b>38</b> to remove it therefrom. Once the broken or damaged knuckle on the train is replaced with knuckle <b>22</b>, the broken or damaged knuckle may be similarly transported back to the engine compartment for storage and transport to a railyard or repair location, as desired or necessary.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Accordingly, carrier <b>10</b> may provide a single wheeled compact and easily stored system which may allow a single individual to transport a heavy knuckle, such as knuckle <b>22</b>, over a significant distance with reduced fatigue and/or stress applied to the train employee and without the need for a second individual. This may allow for a more safe operation as injuries caused by fatigue may be reduced and the second individual may monitor or maintain the engine and/or train while the user of carrier <b>10</b> may handle the replacement of a broken or damaged knuckle. Accordingly, carrier <b>10</b> provides benefits in the railroad industry in that it is compact and easily stored, taking up minimal space while providing a robust and safer system for use by a single individual in transporting and utilizing knuckle <b>22</b>, as described herein.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Various inventive concepts may be embodied as one or more methods, of which an example has been provided.
