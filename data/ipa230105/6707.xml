The communication device <b>300</b> is, for example, a mobile phone (for example, a smartphone), but is not limited thereto, and may be, for example, a wearable terminal (for example, a smartwatch) or the like. The radio frequency module <b>100</b> is a module being compatible with, for example, the Fourth Generation (4G) mobile communication standard, the Fifth Generation (5G) mobile communication standard, or the like. The 4G standard is, for example, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard. The 5G standard is, for example, the 5G New Radio (NR). The radio frequency module <b>100</b> is, for example, a module capable of supporting carrier aggregation and dual connectivity.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0037">For example, the radio frequency module <b>100</b> is configured to amplify a transmission signal (radio frequency signal) inputted from a signal processing circuit <b>301</b> and to output the amplified transmission signal to an antenna <b>310</b>. The radio frequency module <b>100</b> is configured to amplify a reception signal (radio frequency signal) inputted from the antenna <b>310</b> and to output the amplified reception signal to the signal processing circuit <b>301</b>. The signal processing circuit <b>301</b> is not a constituent element of the radio frequency module <b>100</b> but a constituent element of the communication device <b>300</b> including the radio frequency module <b>100</b>. The radio frequency module <b>100</b> is controlled by, for example, the signal processing circuit <b>301</b> included in the communication device <b>300</b>. The communication device <b>300</b> includes the radio frequency module <b>100</b> and the signal processing circuit <b>301</b>. The communication device <b>300</b> further includes the antenna <b>310</b>. The communication device <b>300</b> further includes a circuit board mounted with the radio frequency module <b>100</b>. The circuit board is, for example, a printed wiring board. The circuit board includes a ground electrode to which a ground potential is applied.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0038">The signal processing circuit <b>301</b> includes, for example, an RF signal processing circuit <b>302</b> and a baseband signal processing circuit <b>303</b>. The RF signal processing circuit <b>302</b> is, for example, a Radio Frequency Integrated Circuit (RFIC), and performs signal processing on a radio frequency signal. For example, the RF signal processing circuit <b>302</b> performs signal processing such as up-conversion on a radio frequency signal (transmission signal) outputted from the baseband signal processing circuit <b>303</b>, and outputs the radio frequency signal on which the signal processing has been performed. In addition, for example, the RF signal processing circuit <b>302</b> performs signal processing such as down-conversion on a radio frequency signal (reception signal) outputted from the radio frequency module <b>100</b>, and outputs the radio frequency signal, on which the signal processing has been performed, to the baseband signal processing circuit <b>303</b>. The baseband signal processing circuit <b>303</b> is, for example, a BaseBand Integrated Circuit (BBIC). The baseband signal processing circuit <b>303</b> generates an I-phase signal and a Q-phase signal from a baseband signal. The baseband signal is, for example, an audio signal, an image signal, or the like inputted from the outside. The baseband signal processing circuit <b>303</b> performs IQ modulation processing by combining the I-phase signal and the Q-phase signal, and then, outputs a transmission signal. At this time, the transmission signal is generated as modulation signals (IQ signal) obtained by amplitude-modulating a carrier signal having a predetermined frequency at a period longer than the period of the carrier signal. A reception signal processed by the baseband signal processing circuit <b>303</b> is used, for example, as an image signal for image display or as an audio signal for telephone speech.
