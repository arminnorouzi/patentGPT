In atypical automotive trade fair, various media people, consumers and businessmen participate. Automobile manufacturers, for example, car manufacturers, also participate in automotive trade fairs to demonstrate their cars. However, in a typical automotive trade fair scenario, the car is usually parked on its wheels on a platform. The car remains stationary on the platform allowing access to just the passenger compartment, engine bay and boot. Therefore, the existing automotive trade fair scenarios do not provide a stylistic display of the car to the people, as the vehicle remains stationary on the platform. Vehicle display ramps are used to display a car in a variety of stylistic display configurations. However, structures of such vehicle display ramps are made of metal tubes to support the weight of the car being displayed. Therefore, the structures of the vehicle display ramps are usually larger than the car being displayed on them. Accordingly, a viewer is unable to completely appreciate the beauty of the displayed car and the stylistic display configuration in which the car is displayed. Furthermore, vehicle display ramps are usually designed to display a single car.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hence there exists a long felt but unresolved need of an apparatus and a method for stylistically displaying cars in an automotive trade fair. There also exists a need for a compact and discrete apparatus for stylistically displaying a car without affecting the beauty of the displayed car. There also exists a need for an apparatus capable of displaying two inclined cars side by side of each other.
