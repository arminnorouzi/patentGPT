In particular, the invention relates to an image display unit that includes an image display part and a transparent protective part arranged on the image display part, with a cured resin arranged between the image display part and the protective part.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As this type of display unit, a liquid crystal display unit <b>101</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is known. The liquid crystal display unit <b>101</b> includes a liquid crystal display panel <b>102</b> and a transparent protective part <b>103</b> arranged on the liquid crystal display panel <b>102</b>. The protective part <b>103</b> is made of, for example, glass or plastic.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To protect the surface of the liquid crystal display panel <b>102</b> and a polarizer (not shown), a spacer <b>104</b> is arranged between the liquid crystal display panel <b>102</b> and the protective part <b>103</b> to form a gap <b>105</b> between the liquid crystal display panel <b>102</b> and the protective part <b>103</b>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the gap <b>105</b> between the liquid crystal display panel <b>102</b> and the protective part <b>103</b> scatters light, resulting in decreased contrast and luminance of the display unit. The presence of the gap <b>105</b> also makes it difficult to design thinner display units.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To address these problems, it has been proposed to fill the gap between the liquid crystal display panel and the protective part with a resin (see, for example, Patent Document 1). However, the stress generated when the resin cures and shrinks causes the deformation of the liquid crystal display panel, resulting in disrupted orientation of the liquid crystal material and other image defects.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">[Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2005-55641.</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0008">The present invention has been devised in view of the above-described problems associated with prior art. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a thin display unit that incorporates a high-luminance, high-contrast image display part that is free of image defects caused by the deformation of the display part.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0009">In an effort to achieve the foregoing object, the present inventors drew attention to the fact that the internal stress that builds up within a resin as the resin cures can be approximated by the product of the storage modulus and the cure shrinkage of the cured resin, and found an ideal resin composition for filling the above-described gap between the display part and the protective part of a display unit, that is, a resin composition that shrinks little when cured and has a storage modulus in a suitable range. This finding ultimately led to the present invention.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0010">The present invention devised based on the above-described finding provides an image display unit that includes an image display part, a light-transmitting protective part arranged on the image display part, and a cured resin layer arranged between the image display part and the protective part. The cured resin layer has a transmittance of 90% or higher in the visible range and a storage modulus at 25&#xb0; C. of 1&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>Pa or less.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0011">The present invention also provides the cured resin layer arranged between the image display part and the light-transmitting protective part of the image display unit. As described above, the cured resin layer has a transmittance of 90% or higher in the visible range and a storage modulus at 25&#xb0; C. of 1&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>Pa or less.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0012">The present invention further provides a resin composition for forming the above-described cured resin layer.

The thickness of the spacer is about in the range of from 0.05 mm to 1.5 mm and serves to keep the distance between the surfaces of the display part <b>2</b> and the protective part <b>3</b> at approximately 1 mm.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0040">The display unit <b>1</b> includes a cured resin layer <b>5</b> provided between the display part <b>2</b> and the protective part <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0041">In the present invention, the cured resin layer <b>5</b> has a transmittance of 90% or higher in the visible range and a storage modulus at 25&#xb0; C. of 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>Pa or less, and preferably from 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>3 </sup>to 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>Pa. The resin composition to make the cured resin layer <b>5</b> has a cure shrinkage of 5% or less, preferably 4.5% or less, and more preferably from 0 to 2%.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0042">The image display unit of the present invention is preferably configured without using the spacer <b>4</b> used in the above-described embodiments of the display unit <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>. Specifically, the resin composition layer <b>5</b> and the protective part <b>3</b> are sequentially overlaid on the display part <b>2</b>. Curing the resin composition completes an image display unit <b>1</b>B as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> without providing the spacer. In this configuration, the distance between the display part <b>2</b> and the protective part <b>3</b> (thus, the thickness of the cured resins layer <b>5</b>), which is determined by factors such as viscosity and density of the resin composition and weight of the protective part <b>3</b>, is typically in the range of from 50 &#x3bc;m to 200 &#x3bc;m. Such a configuration therefore makes it possible to design thinner image display units.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0043">In the present invention, the resin composition to make the cured resin layer <b>5</b> is preferably a photocurable resin composition in order to increase the productivity, although other resins may also be used.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0044">The resin composition for use in the present invention preferably contains at least one polymer, such as polyurethane acrylates, polyisoprene acrylates and esters thereof, hydrogenated terpene resins or butadiene polymers; at least one acrylate monomer, such as isobornyl acrylate, dicyclopentenyloxyethyl methacrylate or 2-hydroxybutyl methacrylate; and at least one photopolymerization initiator, such as 1-hydroxy-cyclohexyl-phenyl-ketone.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0045">Since the protective part <b>3</b> often has a UV-cutting function to protect the display part <b>2</b> against ultraviolet rays, the photopolymerization initiator for use in the present invention is preferably used together with a photopolymerization initiator that can cure in the visible range (such as SpeedCure TPO (trade name for 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyldiphenylphosphine oxide), Nihon Siber Hegner KK).</p><p id="p-0041" num="0046">The resin composition for use in the present invention is prepared such that the cured resin obtained by curing the resin composition by UV irradiation has a storage modulus (at 25&#xb0; C.) of 1&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>Pa or less, and preferably in the range of from 1&#xd7;10<sup>3 </sup>Pa to 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>Pa, has a refractive index preferably in the range of from 1.45 to 1.55, and more preferably in the range of from 1.51 to 1.52, and has a transmittance of 90% or higher in the visible range when formed into a 100 &#x3bc;m-thick layer. Different resin compositions containing the same major resin component but different auxiliary resin components and monomer components may be cured to have different storage moduli (at 25&#xb0; C.) that may, in some cases, exceed 1&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>Pa. Those resin compositions that are cured to have a storage modulus (at 25&#xb0; C.) of higher than 1&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>Pa are not included in the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0047">The resin composition of the present invention also has a preferable cure shrinkage of 5% or less, more preferably of 4.5% or less, and still more preferably in the range of from 0 to 2%. In this manner, the internal stress that builds up within the cured resin upon curing of the resin composition can be reduced, and the distortion generated at the interface between the cured resin layer <b>5</b> and the display part <b>2</b> or the protective part <b>3</b> can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0048">Thus, by arranging the resin composition between the display part <b>2</b> and the protective part <b>3</b> and then curing the resin composition, the amount of light scattered at the interface between the cured resin layer <b>5</b> and the display part <b>2</b> or the protective part <b>3</b> can be reduced. As a result, the luminance and the visibility of the displayed images can be improved.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0049">The magnitude of the internal stress that builds up within the cured resin upon curing of the resin composition can be evaluated by dropping the resin composition onto a flat surface and measuring the average surface roughness of the cured resin. In practice, the distortion generated at the interface between the display part <b>2</b> or the protective part <b>3</b> and the cured resin arranged in between would be negligible if, for example, a cured resin obtained by dropping 2 mg of the resin composition onto a glass plate and cured by UV irradiation to 90% or a higher cure ratio has an average surface roughness of 6 nm or less. By using the resin composition of the present invention, this average surface roughness can be kept at 6 nm or less, and preferably in the range of 1 nm to 3 nm.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0050">To fabricate the display unit <b>1</b> of the present invention, the spacer <b>4</b> and a ridge (not shown) are arranged on the display part <b>2</b> along its periphery. A predetermined amount of the above-described photocurable resin composition is then poured over the display member <b>2</b> in the area inside the spacer and the ridge.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0051">The protective part <b>3</b> is then placed on the display part <b>2</b> over the spacer <b>4</b> and the gap between the display part <b>2</b> and the protective part <b>3</b> is completely filled with the resin composition.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0052">Subsequently, the resin composition is irradiated with ultraviolet rays via the protective part <b>3</b> to cure the resin composition. This completes the desired display unit <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0053">When it is desired to fabricate the display unit <b>1</b>B in which the spacer <b>4</b> is omitted, the above-described photocurable resin composition is first applied onto the display part <b>2</b>. The protective part <b>3</b> is then placed over the coating of the resin composition and the ultraviolet rays are irradiated onto the resin composition from the side of the protective part <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0054">In the image display units <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>B of the present invention obtained in the foregoing manner, the effects of the stress generated as the resin cures and shrinks on the display part <b>2</b> and the protective part <b>3</b> can be minimized, so that little or no distortion is generated in the display part <b>2</b> and the protective part <b>3</b>. Since the display part <b>2</b> is not deformed during the production, it can display images at high luminance and high contrast without causing any image defects.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0055">In addition, the cured resin <b>5</b> that fills the gap between the display part <b>2</b> and the protective part <b>3</b> in the present embodiment reinforces the display unit <b>1</b> so that it can withstand high impacts.
