No. 63/218,101, entitled &#x201c;Blood Collection Device and Related System and Methods&#x201d;, filed Jul. 2, 2021, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Catheters are commonly used for a variety of infusion therapies. For example, catheters may be used for infusing fluids, such as normal saline solution, various medicaments, and total parenteral nutrition, into a patient. Catheters may also be used for withdrawing blood from the patient.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A common type of catheter device includes a catheter that is over-the-needle. As its name implies, the catheter that is over-the-needle may be mounted over an introducer needle having a sharp distal tip. A catheter assembly may include a catheter adapter, the catheter extending distally from the catheter adapter, and the introducer needle extending through the catheter. The catheter and the introducer needle may be assembled so that the distal tip of the introducer needle extends beyond a distal tip of the catheter with the bevel of the needle facing up away from skin of the patient. The catheter and introducer needle are generally inserted at a shallow angle through the skin into vasculature of the patient.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to verify proper placement of the introducer needle and/or the catheter in the blood vessel, a clinician generally confirms that there is &#x201c;flashback&#x201d; of blood in a flashback chamber of the catheter assembly. Once placement of the needle has been confirmed, the clinician may temporarily occlude flow in the vasculature and remove the needle, leaving the catheter in place for future blood withdrawal or fluid infusion.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Infusion and blood withdrawal using the catheter may be difficult for several reasons, particularly when an indwelling time of the catheter increase. A fibrin sheath or thrombus may form on an internal surface of the catheter assembly, an external surface of the catheter assembly, or within the vasculature near the distal tip of the catheter. The fibrin sheath or thrombus may block or narrow a fluid pathway through the catheter, which may impair infusion and/or collection of a high-quality blood sample.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The subject matter claimed herein is not limited to embodiments that solve any disadvantages or that operate only in environments such as those described above. Rather, this background is only provided to illustrate one example technology area where some implementations described herein may be practiced.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure relates generally to blood collection devices and related systems and methods.
