It involves diverting the venous blood from the inferior vena cava (IVC) and superior vena cava (SVC) to the pulmonary arteries without passing through the morphologic right ventricle; i.e., the systemic and pulmonary circulations are placed in series with the functional single ventricle. The procedure was initially performed 1968 by Francis Fontan and Eugene Baudet. Contemporary modifications of surgical techniques have significantly improved survival. However, the resulting Fontan physiology is associated with high morbidity (Van der Ven et al, <i>F</i>1000 <i>Research </i>(2018), 7(F1000 Faculty Rev), 935). There is still a progressive risk of attrition and failure of the Fontan circulation over time, which lead to clinical worsening of these patients over time (Beghetti et al, <i>Heart </i>(2010), 96, 911-916).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the improved outcome and the increasing number of procedures being performed, the number of surviving patients has risen and is expected to further rise substantially. Although life saving at the time of the operation, the Fontan procedure results in a pulmonary circulation that is very different from physiological conditions, with a progressive risk of attrition over time (Hosein et al., <i>Eur. J. Cardiothorac. Surg. </i>(2007), 31, 344-352). The number of patients likely to be affected is unknown, but the Fontan circulation may fail in many patients, leading to serious and potentially life-threatening sequalae (Gewillig, <i>Heart </i>(2005), 91, 839-846). Overall, the Fontan patients have decreased long-term survival, progressively deteriorating functional status and an increased risk of sudden death, which means that the procedure is considered to be palliative rather than curative (Fontan et al., <i>Circulation </i>(1990), 81, 1520-1536).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aside from the impact of the Fontan physiology, the process of ageing itself has potentially important effects on the pulmonary vascular pathophysiology such as increasing pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) (Kovacs et al., <i>Eur. Respir. J. </i>(2009), 34, 888-894) and ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Preservation of the Fontan physiology and prevention of failure is therefore of critical importance, but no treatment has been demonstrated to be efficacious. Should the Fontan circulation fail, there are currently limited surgical or medical options and a lack of evidence-based guidelines to assist in management.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the Fontan procedure was developed approximately three decades ago, the first patients are only now reaching their third and fourth decades of life and data in older patients with Fontan physiology will increasingly become available. Although the underlying pathophysiology of the failing Fontan is probably multifactorial, it is likely that a major underlying cause is alterations in, and damage to, the pulmonary vasculature.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many post-Fontan complications arise as a result of increased venous pressure and congestion, and chronic low blood flow/cardiac output. Given the lack of ventricular force to drive blood flow through the pulmonary arteries, a low resistance (pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR]) and high capacitance system are mandatory for a well-functioning Fontan circuit. In the postoperative period, even small increases in PVR can lead to systemic venous hypertension associated with a decreased cardiac output despite a technically successful operation (Kirklin et al., <i>Eur. J. Cardiothorac. Surg. </i>(1990), 4, 2-7). In fact, a slight increase in PVR at any time to levels that would be readily tolerated in normal physiology may result in progressive failure of the Fontan circulation. Importantly, high PVR is a strong predictor of mortality (Griffiths et al., <i>Ann. Thorac. Surg. </i>(2009), 88, 558-563).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Prostacyclins have been rarely used in perioperative Fontan patients; beraprost reduces mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and PVR in preoperative Fontan candidates with mild pulmonary hypertension, (Takahashi et al., <i>Pediatr. Int </i>(2003), 45, 671-675) and epoprostenol has been shown to prevent the rebound effect after inhaled nitric oxide (NO) cessation in the early postoperative phase (Miyaji et al., <i>J. Thorac. Cardiovasc. Surg. </i>(2003), 125, 437-439). When oral administration becomes possible, sildenafil is often used in the postoperative period as it is perceived as safe, with fast onset and good effectiveness. However, none of these medications (beraprost, epoprostenol, or sildenafil) are approved for these uses and there are no published data to confirm their efficacy or safety in this indication.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Bosentan has been shown to improve exercise capacity, functional class, health-related quality of life and haemodynamic parameters (including PVR and PAP) in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (Gabbay et al., <i>Vasc. Health Risk Manag. </i>(2007), 3, 887-900; Valerio and Coghlan, <i>Vasc. Health Risk Manag. </i>(2009), 5, 607-619). Long-term treatment with bosentan improved symptoms and aortic oxygen saturation, functional class, maximal and submaximal exercise capacity, the Borg dyspnoea index, mean PAP, pulmonary blood flow and PVR in a patient with plastic bronchitis following Fontan (Apostolopoulou et al., <i>J. Heart Lung Transplant. </i>(2005), 24, 1174-1176; and Hebert et al., &#x201c;The effect of Bosentan on exercise capacity in Fontan patients; rationale and design for the TEMPO study,&#x201d; <i>BMC Cardiovasc. Disord. </i>2013; 13: 36). The effect of long-term bosentan treatment on the liver is a potential concern for treating Fontan patients, especially in patients with hepatic complications. However, bosentan is not approved for these uses.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Given the important role of the pulmonary vascular circulation in Fontan physiology and the demonstrated increase in PAP with age, there is a major requirement for the development of effective and safe medical prevention or treatment for patients with worsening or failed Fontan system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is an object of the present invention to provide a medication and/or treatment regimen for pulmonary vascular disease and/or cardiac dysfunction in functional single ventricular heart disease patients, especially in Fontan-palliated patients.

In particular, it is possible to decrease the progress of pulmonary vascular disease and/or cardiac dysfunction, or even to improve the status of the pulmonary vascular disease and/or cardiac dysfunction.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the present invention, macitentan is defined as propylsulfamic acid [5-(4-bromo-phenyl)-6-[2-(5-bromo-pyrimidin-2-yloxy)-ethoxy]-pyrimidin-4-yl]-amide, i.e. a compound of formula (I)</p><p id="p-0015" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="38.35mm" wi="75.95mm" file="US20230000865A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate or morphological form thereof.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">Macitentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) that acts as an antagonist of two endothelin (ET) receptor subtypes, ET<sub>A </sub>and ET<sub>B </sub>(Kholdani et al, Macitentan for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. <i>Vasc. Health Risk Manag. </i>(2014), 10, 665-673).</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">Currently, macitentan is taken as a 10 mg oral dose once a day. Its half-life in humans is about 16 hours and steady state is reached by the third day of administration (Bruderer et al., Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of macitentan, a dual endothelin receptor antagonist, in humans. <i>Xenobiotica </i>(2012), 42(9), 901-910). It is absorbed slowly into the plasma (Sidharta et al., Macitentan: entry-into-humans study with a new endothelin receptor antagonist. <i>Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. </i>(2011), 67, 977-984). Macitentan dealkylates into the active metabolite ACT-132577, i.e. aprocitentan, which reaches its peak plasma concentration about 30 hours after the first dose is administered, and it has a half-life of approximately 48 hours. Although ACT-132577 has a lower affinity for the ET receptors than its parent compound (Iglarz et al., Pharmacology of macitentan, an orally active tissue-targeting dual endothelin receptor antagonist. <i>J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. </i>(2008), 327(3), 736-745), it maintains higher plasma concentrations than macitentan. Both compounds can be excreted from the body through the urine or feces.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">In the following, several aspects of the invention will be explained.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">(a) One aspect of the present invention relates to macitentan for use in the treatment of pulmonary vascular disease and/or cardiac dysfunction in functional single ventricular heart disease patients, especially in Fontan-palliated patients, wherein the dosage of macitentan is from 20 mg per day to 300 mg per day. The dosage may also be more than 20 mg per day to 300 mg per day. The dosage may be 25 mg per day to 300 mg per day. For example, the dosage is equal to or more than 20 mg per day to 250 mg per day.

However, with the present invention it is suggested to administer a high dosage of macitentan in order to improve the disease status, prevent the occurrence of disease worsening, and improve long-term survival and/or decrease hospitalization rate. Advantageously, if for instance compared to bosentan, there are fewer to no side effects on liver function and no or insignificant hepatotoxicity.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021">Further advantages are no further clinically relevant decrease in hemoglobin, no further clinically relevant decrease in blood pressure and/or no further clinically relevant increase in edema/fluid retention.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">(b) Another aspect of the present invention relates to macitentan for use in the treatment of pulmonary vascular disease and/or cardiac dysfunction in functional single ventricular heart disease patients, especially in Fontan-palliated patients according to aspect (a), wherein the treatment means the reduction of morbidity and/or mortality risk of pulmonary vascular disease and/or cardiac dysfunction in functional single ventricular heart disease patients, especially in Fontan-palliated patients.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">The reduction of morbidity and/or mortality risk of pulmonary vascular disease and/or cardiac dysfunction in functional single ventricular heart disease patients, especially in Fontan-palliated patients may be evaluated by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">Exercise intolerance, indicated by dyspnea and fatigue during exertion, is a cardinal manifestation of heart failure (HF) (R.
