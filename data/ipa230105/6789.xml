second-generation (2G) digital wireless phone service (including interim 2.5G and 2.75G networks), a third-generation (3G) high speed data, Internet-capable wireless service, a fourth-generation (4G) service (e.g., Long Term Evolution (LTE) or WiMax), a fifth-generation (5G) service, etc. There are presently many different types of wireless communication systems in use, including Cellular and Personal Communications Service (PCS) systems. Examples of known cellular systems include the cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), and digital cellular systems based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), the Global System for Mobile access (GSM) variation of TDMA, etc.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A fifth generation (5G) mobile standard calls for higher data transfer speeds, greater numbers of connections, and better coverage, among other improvements. The 5G standard, according to the Next Generation Mobile Networks Alliance, is designed to provide data rates of several tens of megabits per second to each of tens of thousands of users, with 1 gigabit per second to tens of workers on an office floor. Several hundreds of thousands of simultaneous connections should be supported in order to support large sensor deployments. Consequently, the spectral efficiency of 5G mobile communications should be significantly enhanced compared to the current 4G standard. Furthermore, signaling efficiencies should be enhanced and latency should be substantially reduced compared to current standards.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Obtaining the locations of mobile devices that are accessing a wireless network may be useful for many applications including, for example, emergency calls, personal navigation, asset tracking, locating a friend or family member, etc. Existing positioning methods include methods based on measuring radio signals transmitted from a variety of devices or entities including satellite vehicles (SVs) and terrestrial radio sources in a wireless network such as base stations and access points. It is expected that standardization for the 5G wireless networks will include support for various positioning methods, which may utilize reference signals transmitted by base stations in a manner similar to which LTE wireless networks currently utilize Positioning Reference Signals (PRS) and/or Cell-specific Reference Signals (CRS) for position determination.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an embodiment, a method of selectively transmitting a positioning signal from a TRP (transmission/reception point) includes: transmitting, unmuted from the TRP, a first intra-slot positioning signal resource segment in a first slot of a transmission schedule in accordance with a muting configuration, the transmission schedule indicating which one or more resource elements to sound in each of a plurality of consecutive symbols for transmitting at least a portion of the positioning signal within a slot of the transmission schedule, the muting configuration indicating whether to mute each of a plurality of intra-slot positioning signal resource segments; and muting transmission by the TRP of a second intra-slot positioning signal resource segment in the first slot of the transmission schedule in accordance with the muting configuration; where the plurality of intra-slot positioning signal resource segments includes the first intra-slot positioning signal resource segment in the first slot and the second intra-slot positioning signal resource segment in the first slot, each of the plurality of intra-slot positioning signal resource segments including at least one symbol and being a separate portion of a respective slot.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Implementations of such a method may include one or more of the following features.

For example, an apparatus such as a server can provide a muting configuration to a transmission/reception point (TRP) to indicate one or more segments of a slot of a transmission schedule to mute. A muting configuration may be produced or selected, e.g., by the server, to meet one or more criteria such as having unmuted segments of a slot be consecutive in time. The TRP may perform intra-slot muting based on one or more conditions being met such as that low-latency positioning signal triggering is in use, or that a user equipment will be able to resolve aliased time-domain peaks in view of muting indicated by a muting configuration in conjunction with a transmission schedule of symbols for conveying a positioning signal. Other configurations, however, may be used.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Items and/or techniques described herein may provide one or more of the following capabilities, as well as other capabilities not mentioned. Collisions of positioning signals may be reduced. Transmission and reception of positioning signals may be regulated to meet one or more performance criteria.

V2X communications may be cellular (Cellular-V2X (C-V2X)) and/or WiFi (e.g., DSRC (Dedicated Short-Range Connection)). The system <b>110</b> may support operation on multiple carriers (waveform signals of different frequencies). Multi-carrier transmitters can transmit modulated signals simultaneously on the multiple carriers. Each modulated signal may be a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) signal, a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) signal, an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) signal, a Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) signal, etc. Each modulated signal may be sent on a different carrier and may carry pilot, overhead information, data, etc.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The BTSs <b>120</b>-<b>123</b> may wirelessly communicate with the UEs <b>112</b>-<b>114</b> in the system <b>110</b> via one or more antennas. A BTS may also be referred to as a base station, an access point, a gNode B (gNB), an access node (AN), a Node B, an evolved Node B (eNB), etc. For example, each of the BTSs <b>120</b>, <b>121</b> may be a gNB or a transmission point gNB, the BTS <b>122</b> may be a macro cell (e.g., a high-power cellular base station) and/or a small cell (e.g., a low-power cellular base station), and the BTS <b>123</b> may be an access point (e.g., a short-range base station configured to communicate with short-range technology such as WiFi, WiFi-Direct (WiFi-D), Bluetooth&#xae;, Bluetooth&#xae;-low energy (BLE), Zigbee, etc. One or more of the BTSs <b>120</b>-<b>123</b> may be configured to communicate with the UEs <b>112</b>-<b>114</b> via multiple carriers.

The system <b>110</b> may include only macro TRPs or the system <b>110</b> may have TRPs of different types, e.g., macro, pico, and/or femto TRPs, etc. A macro TRP may cover a relatively large geographic area (e.g., several kilometers in radius) and may allow unrestricted access by terminals with service subscription. A pico TRP may cover a relatively small geographic area (e.g., a pico cell) and may allow unrestricted access by terminals with service subscription. A femto or home TRP may cover a relatively small geographic area (e.g., a femto cell) and may allow restricted access by terminals having association with the femto cell (e.g., terminals for users in a home).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The UEs <b>112</b>-<b>114</b> may be referred to as terminals, access terminals (ATs), mobile stations, mobile devices, subscriber units, etc. The UEs <b>112</b>-<b>114</b> may include various devices as listed above and/or other devices.

Groups of the UEs <b>112</b>-<b>114</b> communicating via D2D communications may utilize a one-to-many (1:M) system in which each UE may transmit to other UEs in the group. A TRP of the BTSs <b>120</b>-<b>123</b> may facilitate scheduling of resources for D2D communications. In other cases, D2D communications may be carried out between UEs without the involvement of a TRP.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a UE <b>200</b> is an example of one of the UEs <b>112</b>-<b>114</b> and comprises a computing platform including a processor <b>210</b>, memory <b>211</b> including software (SW) <b>212</b>, one or more sensors <b>213</b>, a transceiver interface <b>214</b> for a transceiver <b>215</b>, a user interface <b>216</b>, a Satellite Positioning System (SPS) receiver <b>217</b>, a camera <b>218</b>, and a position device (PD) <b>219</b>.

For example, known position-determination techniques include RTT, multi-RTT, OTDOA (also called TDOA and including UL-TDOA and DL-TDOA), Enhanced Cell Identification (E-CID), DL-AoD. UL-AoA, etc. RTT uses a time for a signal to travel from one entity to another and back to determine a range between the two entities. The range, plus a known location of a first one of the entities and an angle between the two entities (e.g., an azimuth angle) can be used to determine a location of the second of the entities. In multi-RTT (also called multi-cell RU), multiple ranges from one entity (e.g., a UE) to other entities (e.g., TRPs) and known locations of the other entities may be used to determine the location of the one entity. In TDOA techniques, the difference in travel times between one entity and other entities may be used to determine relative ranges from the other entities and those, combined with known locations of the other entities may be used to determine the location of the one entity. Angles of arrival and/or departure may be used to help determine location of an entity. For example, an angle of arrival or an angle of departure of a signal combined with a range between devices (determined using signal, e.g., a travel time of the signal, a received power of the signal, etc.) and a known location of one of the devices may be used to determine a location of the other device. The angle of arrival or departure may be an azimuth angle relative to a reference direction such as true north. The angle of arrival or departure may be a zenith angle relative to directly upward from an entity (i.e., relative to radially outward from a center of Earth). E-CID uses the identity of a serving cell, the timing advance (i.e., the difference between receive and transmit times at the UE), estimated timing and power of detected neighbor cell signals, and possibly angle of arrival (e.g., of a signal at the UE from the base station or vice versa) to determine location of the UE. In TDOA, the difference in arrival times at a receiving device of signals from different sources along with known locations of the sources and known offset of transmission times from the sources are used to determine the location of the receiving device.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">For positioning techniques using PRS (Positioning Reference Signal) signals (e.g., TDOA and RT). PRS signals sent by multiple TRPs are measured and the arrival times of the signals, known transmission times, and known locations of the TRPs used to determine ranges from a UE to the TRPs. For example, an RSTD (Reference Signal Time Difference) may be determined for PRS signals received from multiple TRPs and used in a TDOA technique to determine position (location) of the UE. The PRS signals are typically sent using the same power and PRS signals with the same signal characteristics (e.g., same frequency shift) may interfere with each other such that a PRS signal from a more distant TRP may be overwhelmed by a PRS signal from a closer TRP such that the signal from the more distant TRP may not be detected. PRS muting may be used to help reduce interference by muting some PRS signals (reducing the power of the PRS signal, e.g., to zero and thus not transmitting the PRS signal). In this way, a weaker (at the UE) PRS signal may be more easily detected by the UE without a stronger PRS signal interfering with the weaker PRS signal.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Positioning reference signals (PRS) include downlink PRS (DL PRS) and uplink PRS (UL PRS) (which may be called SRS (Sounding Reference Signal) for positioning). PRS may comprise PRS resources or PRS resource sets of a frequency layer. A DL PRS positioning frequency layer (or simply a frequency layer) is a collection of DL PRS resource sets, from one or more TRPs, that have common parameters configured by higher-layer parameters DL-PRS-PositioningFrequencyLayer, DL-PRS-ResourceSet, and DL-PRS-Resource. Each frequency layer has a DL PRS subcarrier spacing (SCS) for the DL PRS resource sets and the DL PRS resources in the frequency layer. Each frequency layer has a DL PRS cyclic prefix (CP) for the DL PRS resource sets and the DL PRS resources in the frequency layer. Also, a DL PRS Point A parameter defines a frequency of a reference resource block (and the lowest subcarrier of the resource block), with DL PRS resources belonging to the same DL PRS resource set having the same Point A and all DL PRS resource sets belonging to the same frequency layer having the same Point A. A frequency layer also has the same DL PRS bandwidth, the same start PRB (and center frequency), and the same value of comb-size.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">A TRP may be configured, e.g., by instructions received from a server and/or by software in the TRP, to send DL PRS per a schedule. According to the schedule, the TRP may send the DL PRS intermittently, e.g., periodically at a consistent interval from an initial transmission. The TRP may be configured to send one or more PRS resource sets. A resource set is a collection of PRS resources across one TRP, with the resources having the same periodicity, a common muting pattern configuration (if any), and the same repetition factor across slots. Each of the PRS resource sets comprises multiple PRS resources, with each PRS resource comprising multiple Resource Elements (REs) that may be in multiple Resource Blocks (RBs) within N (one or more) consecutive symbol(s) within a slot. An RB is a collection of REs spanning a quantity of one or more consecutive symbols in the time domain and a quantity (e.g., 12 for a 5G RB) of consecutive subcarriers in the frequency domain. Each PRS resource is configured with an RE offset, slot offset, a symbol offset within a slot, and a number of consecutive symbols that the PRS resource may occupy within a slot. The RE offset defines the starting RE offset of the first symbol within a DL PRS resource in frequency. The relative RE offsets of the remaining symbols within a DL PRS resource are defined based on the initial offset. The slot offset is the starting slot of the DL PRS resource with respect to a corresponding resource set slot offset. The symbol offset determines the starting symbol of the DL PRS resource within the starting slot. Transmitted REs may repeat across slots, with each transmission being called a repetition such that there may be multiple repetitions in a PRS resource. The DL PRS resources in a DL PRS resource set are associated with the same TRP and each DL PRS resource has a DL PRS resource ID. A DL PRS resource ID in a DL PRS resource set is associated with a single beam transmitted from a single TRP (although a TRP may transmit one or more beams).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">A PRS resource may also be defined by quasi-co-location and start PRB parameters. A quasi-co-location (QCL) parameter may define any quasi-co-location information of the DL PRS resource with other reference signals. The DL PRS may be configured to be QCL type D with a DL PRS or SS/PBCH (Synchronization Signal/Physical Broadcast Channel) Block from a serving cell or a non-serving cell. The DL PRS may be configured to be QCL type C with an SS/PBCH Block from a serving cell or a non-serving cell. The start PRB parameter defines the starting PRB index of the DL PRS resource with respect to reference Point A. The starting PRB index has a granularity of one PRB and may have a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 2176 PRBs.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">A PRS resource set is a collection of PRS resources with the same periodicity, same muting pattern configuration (if any), and the same repetition factor across slots. Every time all repetitions of all PRS resources of the PRS resource set are configured to be transmitted is referred as an &#x201c;instance&#x201d;. Therefore, an &#x201c;instance&#x201d; of a PRS resource set is a specified number of repetitions for each PRS resource and a specified number of PRS resources within the PRS resource set such that once the specified number of repetitions are transmitted for each of the specified number of PRS resources, the instance is complete. An instance may also be referred to as an &#x201c;occasion.&#x201d; A DL PRS configuration including a DL PRS transmission schedule may be provided to a UE to facilitate (or even enable) the UE to measure the DL PRS.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">RTT positioning is an active positioning technique in that RTT uses positioning signals sent by TRPs to UEs and by UEs (that are participating in RTT positioning) to TRPs. The TRPs may send DL-PRS signals that are received by the UEs and the UEs may send SRS (Sounding Reference Signal) signals that are received by multiple TRPs. A sounding reference signal may be referred to as an SRS or an SRS signal. In 5G multi-RTT, coordinated positioning may be used with the UE sending a single UL-SRS for positioning that is received by multiple TRPs instead of sending a separate UL-SRS for positioning for each TRP. A TRP that participates in multi-RTT will typically search for UEs that are currently camped on that TRP (served UEs, with the TRP being a serving TRP) and also UEs that are camped on neighboring TRPs (neighbor UEs). Neighbor TRPs may be TRPs of a single BTS (e.g., gNB), or may be a TRP of one BTS and a TRP of a separate BTS. For RTT positioning, including multi-RTT positioning, the DL-PRS signal and the UL-SRS for positioning signal in a PRS/SRS for positioning signal pair used to determine RTT (and thus used to determine range between the UE and the TRP) may occur close in time to each other such that errors due to UE motion and/or UE clock drift and/or TRP clock drift are within acceptable limits. For example, signals in a PRS/SRS for positioning signal pair may be transmitted from the TRP and the UE, respectively, within about 10 ms of each other. With SRS for positioning being sent by UEs, and with PRS and SRS for positioning being conveyed close in time to each other, it has been found that radio-frequency (RF) signal congestion may result (which may cause excessive noise, etc.) especially if many UEs attempt positioning concurrently and/or that computational congestion may result at the TRPs that are trying to measure many UEs concurrently.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">RTT positioning may be UE-based or UE-assisted.

According to the schedule, the TRP <b>300</b> may send the DL-PRS signals intermittently, e.g., periodically at a consistent interval from an initial transmission. The TRP <b>300</b> may be configured to send one or more PRS resource sets. Each of the resource sets comprises multiple resources, with each resource being a beam transmitted by the TRP <b>300</b>, and each resource being configured with a slot offset, a symbol offset within a slot, and a number of consecutive symbols that the resource may occupy. Each PRS resource is associated with one antenna port or beam, transmits a DL-PRS signal, and may repeat the transmission across slots, with each transmission being called a repetition such that there may be multiple repetitions in a resource.

For example, a bit value of &#x201c;1&#x201d; may indicate not to mute the corresponding PRS signal(s) transmission and a bit value of &#x201c;0&#x201d; may indicate to mute the corresponding PRS signal(s) transmission. The muting configuration may be inter-instance, in which case each bit in the bitmap indicates whether to mute all the PRS repetitions of all PRS resources in the corresponding configurable number of instances, or intra-instance, in which case each bit in the bitmap indicates whether to mute a corresponding PRS repetition of all PRS resources in an instance, or intra-slot, in which case each bit in the bitmap indicates whether to mute a corresponding symbol or set of symbols of one or more repetitions of one or more PRS resources. Thus, for an example of inter-instance muting with bitmap of <b>1010</b>, transmission of the 0<sup>th </sup>and 2<sup>nd </sup>instances is not muted, and transmission of the 1<sup>st </sup>and 3<sup>rd </sup>instances is muted. For the same bitmap of <b>1010</b> but with intra-instance muting, transmission of the 0<sup>th </sup>and 2<sup>nd </sup>repetitions within each instance is not muted, and transmission of the 1<sup>st </sup>and 3<sup>rd </sup>repetitions in each instance is muted. For the same bitmap of <b>1010</b> but with intra-slot muting, transmission of the 0<sup>th </sup>and 2<sup>nd </sup>symbols (or symbol groups) in a respective slot is not muted, and transmission of the 1<sup>st </sup>and 3<sup>rd </sup>symbols (or symbol groups) in a respective slot is muted. As discussed further below, different slots may have different intra-slot muting configurations.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, different muting configurations may be applied to different, e.g., neighboring, TRPs <b>300</b> to help reduce interference between the PRS signals from the neighboring TRPs. In this example, a PRS muting bitmap of <b>1010</b> is applied to TRP<b>1</b> and TRP<b>2</b>, and a PRS muting bitmap of <b>010</b><i>l </i>is applied to TRP<b>3</b> and TRP<b>4</b>. Thus, in this example, PRS transmissions <b>711</b>, <b>713</b> from TRP<b>1</b> are not muted and PRS transmissions <b>712</b>, <b>714</b> are muted. Similarly, PRS transmissions <b>721</b>, <b>723</b> from TRP<b>2</b> are not muted and PRS transmissions <b>722</b>, <b>724</b> are muted. Further, PRS transmissions <b>731</b>, <b>733</b>, <b>741</b>, <b>743</b> from TRP<b>3</b>, TRP<b>4</b>, respectively, are muted and PRS transmissions <b>732</b>, <b>734</b>, <b>742</b>, <b>744</b> are not muted. Each of the PRS transmissions may be a specific repetition (e.g. the first transmission in a batch of 4 repetitions) of a resource within an instance (for inter-instance muting) or a repetition (for intra-instance muting).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Inter-Instance Muting Configuration</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Numerous muting configurations may be used in combination with various scenarios of repetition quantity, symbols per repetition, comb types, and TRPs per repetition. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, an example of an inter-instance PRS muting configuration for a scenario of comb-2 transmission, two symbols per repetition, two repetitions per instance, and with a 2-bit muting bitmap is shown, although the comb-2 detail is not shown. A quantity of instances, e.g., consecutive instances, may be configurable and, in this example is one instance to help simplify the example. Comb-K indicates that in each symbol, the transmission scheduled is for each TRP to transmit in every K<sup>th </sup>subcarrier, with each TRP transmitting using different subcarriers in each symbol. Consequently, the different TRPs are frequency-division multiplexed to use different subcarriers to transmit PRS signals such that the PRS signals from different TRPs transmitted concurrently are frequency orthogonal to help prevent collisions between the PRS signals. Further, the TRPs may switch subcarriers, called staggering, for different symbols within a repetition to help fill holes in the frequency domain to help eliminate aliases in the time domain. For example, a repetition <b>810</b> comprising PRS signals sent from TRP<b>1</b> and TRP<b>2</b> includes a symbol <b>812</b> and a symbol <b>814</b>. In the symbol <b>812</b>, TRP<b>1</b> may transmit TRP<b>1</b>'s PRS signal using odd-numbered subcarriers and TRP<b>2</b> may transmit TRP<b>2</b>'s PRS signal using even-numbered subcarriers. In the symbol <b>814</b>, TRP<b>1</b> may transmit TRP<b>1</b>'s PRS signal using even-numbered subcarriers and TRP<b>2</b> may transmit TRP<b>2</b>'s PRS signal using odd-numbered subcarriers. The two repetitions per instance in this example are transmitted in consecutive slots (slot0 and slot1) although this is not required.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The muting configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> comprises a 2-bit muting bitmap for each pair of TRPs. In this example, a value of &#x201c;1&#x201d; in the bitmap corresponds to transmitting the PRS signal(s) without muting and a value of &#x201c;0&#x201d; in the bitmap corresponds to muting the PRS signal(s). Muted PRS signals are shown in dotted lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> and non-muted PRS signals are shown in solid lines. The TRP<b>1</b> and TRP<b>2</b> pair has a bitmap muting configuration of &#x201c;10&#x201d; and the TRP<b>3</b> and TRP<b>4</b> pair has a bitmap muting configuration of &#x201c;01&#x201d; in this example. While only one instance is shown corresponding to each bit in each bitmap, more than one instance may correspond to a bit in a bitmap, with the quantity of instances corresponding to a bit being configurable. Thus, a bit in the bitmap may correspond to a configurable number of (consecutive) instances of a DL-PRS resource set in a periodic transmission of DL-PRS resource sets. In the inter-instance muting shown, all DL-PRS resources within a DL-PRS resource set instance are muted for a DL-PRS resource set instance that is indicated to be muted by the bitmap.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">With the bitmaps shown, the TRPs TRP<b>1</b> and TRP<b>2</b> transmit PRS signals in both repetitions (the repetition <b>810</b> and a repetition <b>816</b>) without muting during the first instance and have PRS signals muted during the second instance, and the TRPs TRP<b>3</b> and TRP<b>4</b> have PRS signals muted during the first instance and transmit PRS signals in both repetitions (repetitions <b>818</b>, <b>820</b>) without muting during the second instance. Beginnings of the first and second instances are separated in time by a periodicity <b>822</b>, a value of which depends on parameters such as quantities of repetitions per instance and number of resources. The value of the periodicity <b>822</b> may be, for example, about 160 ms.

Similar to the inter-instance example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, there are four TRPs transmitting respective comb-2 PRS signals two symbols in length for each repetition. Each TRP is given a 2-bit bitmap muting configuration, with each bit corresponding to a respective repetition in a respective instance. In this scenario, the PRS signals from TRP<b>1</b> and TRP<b>2</b> are not muted during a first repetition <b>912</b> during the first instance, and are muted during a second repetition <b>914</b> during the first instance. Conversely, the PRS signals from TRP<b>3</b> and TRP<b>4</b> are muted during a first repetition <b>916</b> during the first instance, and are not muted during a second repetition <b>918</b> during the first instance. A similar schedule is followed for the second instance as for the first instance.

For example, bitmaps of other sizes may be used, e.g., 4 bits, 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits, etc. Thus, in an intra-instance scenario similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, but with a bitmap of four bits, each bit may correspond to each of four repetitions in an instance. Numerous muting configurations of repetitions within an instance may be used for different TRPs or sets of TRPs for intra-instance PRS muting scenarios. As another example, more than four TRPs may be transmitting PRS signals.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Intra-Slot Muting Configuration</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, an example of intra-slot PRS muting for a scenario of comb-2 transmission, six symbols per repetition, two repetitions per instance, and with a 3-bit muting bitmap is shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a transmission schedule <b>1000</b> for two slots, which is a portion of a larger transmission schedule for transmitting signals including a positioning signal. Here, the transmission schedule indicates four portions of positioning signals from two TRPs (TRP<b>1</b> and TRP<b>2</b>) to be carried by symbols 3-8 of each of a first slot <b>1001</b> and a second slot <b>1002</b>. A muting configuration <b>1020</b> is represented by bitmap portions <b>1021</b>, <b>1022</b> for the slots <b>1001</b>, <b>1002</b>, respectively. Each bit of the bitmap representing the muting configuration <b>1020</b> corresponds to a respective segment of the respective slot <b>1001</b>, <b>1002</b>. In this example, each segment is equal in size and corresponds to an intra-slot group of symbols, with each group indicating to sound all resource elements of the transmission schedule over a respective set of symbols. Different intra-slot groups may be the same (i.e., intra-slot repetitions with identical patterns of sounded resource elements) or different (i.e., have different resource element patterns over the symbols used, even if they sound all the same subcarriers). In this example, a quantity G of intra-slot groups is equal to N/K, where N is the length of the PRS resource in number of symbols in a slot (here, six symbols) and K is the comb type (i.e., comb number), and a quantity M of slot segments equals G (M=G). Thus, as shown, with a PRS resource length (i.e., the length of the resource in symbols) of six symbols and a comb type of 2, there are three intra-slot groups (G=3) of two symbols each, and three bits per bitmap portion (M=3), one bit for each intra-slot group, i.e., each segment corresponding to a bit in the bitmap also corresponding to one intra-slot group in this example.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The muting configuration <b>1020</b> is an example, both in terms of mapping of bits to symbols and in a pattern of bits shown, and other examples may be used. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, for a transmission schedule <b>1120</b> identical to the transmission schedule <b>1000</b>, a muting configuration <b>1130</b> has each slot segment corresponding to a bit in bitmap portions <b>1131</b>, <b>1132</b> representing the muting configuration <b>1130</b>. Each slot segment corresponds to a single symbol (instead of an intra-slot group of symbols as with the muting configuration <b>1020</b>) in respective slots <b>1101</b>, <b>1102</b>. In this example, the quantity M of slot segments is greater than the quantity G of intra-slot groups (M&#x3e;G), and is equal to N, the length of the PRS in number of symbols in a slot. The bitmap portions <b>1131</b>, <b>1132</b> thus, in this example, each have N bits where N is the length of the PRS in number of symbols in a slot.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">One or more constraints may be placed on using single-symbol muting granularity. For example, single-symbol slot segment granularity of transmission muting may be enabled only if the remaining symbols of the PRS resource (i.e., the collection of symbols in a slot for conveying the PRS signal) yield aliased peaks in the time domain that can be resolved by an expected RSTD (Reference Signal Time Difference) uncertainty window. That is, it may be a requirement that a UE to receive the PRS signal has a search window that is below a threshold amount of time such that the aliased peaks of the PRS signal can be resolved (i.e., will include only one aliased peak). In general, this means that the search window used by the UE would be less than T*1000/(14K) nsec where T is a slot size in microseconds, and K is the comb type (comb number). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, an example channel energy response (CER) 1200 corresponds to a comb-4, 4-symbol transmission schedule with three of the four symbols muted. The CER <b>1200</b> has four peaks <b>1211</b>, <b>1212</b>, <b>1213</b>, <b>1214</b> with the peak <b>1213</b> being the true peak and the peak <b>1211</b> being the strongest (highest power) peak.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">As another example, a muting configuration may vary over different slots and/or resources. Thus, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, an intra-slot muting configuration (which may be called an intra-resource muting configuration) may have different muting configurations for different slots and/or resources. A transmission schedule <b>1300</b> has comb-2, two symbols per intra-slot group, but with four symbols per repetition and eight repetitions per instance. As shown, a muting configuration <b>1320</b> is represented by bitmap portions <b>1311</b>, <b>1312</b>, <b>1318</b> for the slots shown, respectively, namely a first slot <b>1301</b>, a second slot <b>1302</b>, and an eighth slot <b>1308</b>. The bitmap portion <b>1311</b> is different from the bitmap portions <b>1312</b>, <b>1318</b>, with the bitmap portions <b>1312</b>, <b>1318</b> being the same. In this example, with four bits per repetition and eight repetitions per instance, the bitmap has 32 bits. Intra-slot muting may be different for different resources. For example, one muting configuration may apply to one or more resources and another muting configuration apply to one or more other resources, even in the same slot. For example, the muting configuration <b>1320</b> may apply to the resources from TRP<b>1</b> and TRP<b>2</b>, or may apply to the resource from TRP<b>1</b> and another muting configuration <b>1330</b> may apply to the resource from TRP<b>2</b>. The configuration shown is <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is an example only, and other muting configurations with different muting configurations for different slots may be used.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Bitmaps for intra-slot muting configurations may contain more bits than bitmaps for other muting configuration types (e.g., inter-instance muting and intra-instance muting discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, respectively). For example, for intra-slot muting with each segment corresponding to an intra-slot group of symbols (i.e., that indicate to sound all of the subcarriers), then B bits are used where B=N/K, where N is the length of the PRS in number of symbols in a slot and K is the comb type (i.e., comb number). For intra-slot muting with each segment corresponding to a symbol, then N bits are used for each slot muting configuration where N is the length of the PRS in number of symbols in a slot.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">PRS Muting Configuration Determination</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The server <b>400</b> may be configured to determine (e.g., produce and/or select) PRS muting configurations.

The server <b>400</b> may be configured to select a predefined starting bitmap that is well-balanced between muting and non-muting indications. Thus, as an example, the server <b>400</b> may be configured to start with a bitmap of four bits with two muting indications and two non-muting indications, then add another bitmap such as a randomly-generated 16-bit bitmap that meets specified criteria, then add one or more other bitmaps as appropriate.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The server <b>400</b> may be configured to perform a logical or mathematical operation on one or more bitmaps to produce another bitmap for a muting configuration. For example, the server <b>400</b> may be configured to perform a logical or a mathematical operation on the first bitmap portions <b>1021</b>, <b>1022</b> or the bitmap portions <b>1131</b>, <b>1132</b> to yield a different muting configuration than the muting configuration <b>1020</b> or the muting configuration <b>1130</b>. The server <b>400</b> may perform different logical or mathematical operations on the different bitmap portions <b>1021</b>, <b>1022</b> or the different bitmap portions <b>1131</b>, <b>1132</b>. As another example, the server <b>400</b> may be configured to perform logical operations on combinations of bitmaps. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, three bitmaps <b>1401</b>, <b>1402</b>, <b>1403</b> are shown corresponding to inter-instance muting (called Option 1), an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, intra-instance muting (called Option 2), an example of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, and intra-slot muting (called Option 3), examples of which are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b></figref>. The server <b>400</b> may be configured to calculate a logical and/or a mathematical combination of Option 1, Option 2, and/or Option 3 to produce a combination bitmap <b>1404</b> corresponding to an intra-slot muting configuration. For example, the server <b>400</b> may be configured to calculate a logical AND, a logical OR, a logical XOR, etc. of two or more of the bitmaps <b>1401</b>, <b>1402</b>, <b>1403</b>. The server <b>400</b> may be configured to calculate multiple logical combinations (e.g., an OR of the bitmaps <b>1402</b> and <b>1403</b> and an XOR of the result with the bitmap <b>1403</b>). In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the server <b>400</b> calculates a logical OR of all three of the bitmaps <b>1401</b>, <b>1402</b>, <b>1403</b> to yield the combination bitmap <b>1404</b>. Other, non-exhaustive, examples include a logical AND of Option 1 and Option 3, a logical AND of Option 2 and Option 3, or a logical AND of Option 1 and Option 2 and Option 3 (i.e., Option 1 AND Option 2 AND Option 3).</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The bitmap produced by the server <b>400</b> for a muting configuration may be repeated by the appropriate TRP(s). The server <b>400</b> may be configured to provide a completed bitmap to each TRP <b>300</b>. The server <b>400</b> may be configured to continue to add to the bitmap indefinitely, but will typically stop the bitmap at some finite length and provide this completed bitmap to the TRP <b>300</b>. The server <b>400</b> may be configured, however, to modify the bitmap over time, e.g., by sending the TRP <b>300</b> a new bitmap or an instruction to alter the existing bitmap.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The server <b>400</b> may be configured to consider one or more of a variety of criteria regarding positioning signal transmission and/or reception (e.g., key performance indicators) for a PRS muting configuration to meet. For example, the server <b>400</b> may be configured to analyze any selected or produced bitmap to determine whether all unmuted symbols in a slot are consecutive, and discard or otherwise ignore (and not use) any bitmap where all unmuted symbols in a slot are not consecutive. This may help operation of the TRP <b>300</b> by avoiding requiring the TRP <b>300</b> to transition between muting and unmuting back and forth quickly. As another example, the server <b>400</b> may be configured not to use a muting configuration that would result in a UE not having a small enough search window to be able to resolve aliases in the time domain due to a partially-staggered positioning signal resource. A partially-staggered positioning signal resource is not fully staggered in that not all of the subcarriers will be sounded by the resource. As another example, the server <b>400</b> may not use any muting configuration that does not have at least one positioning signal resource (e.g., PRS resource) that is fully staggered (i.e., will sound all subcarriers of a slot).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">As another example, the server <b>400</b> may be configured to try to keep a balance between muting and not muting PRS signals (e.g., a balance between l's and <b>0</b>'s in a bitmap) to help ensure measurement of PRS signals without excessive delay (e.g., due to waiting for a next transmission). The server <b>400</b> may be configured to provide one or more criteria for a muting configuration (e.g., randomly-generated pattern) to have a quantity of bits have a certain value (e.g., eight bits of a 16-bit bitmap must be 1's, or five bits of an 8-bit bitmap must be 0's), or to have a threshold quantity of bits have a certain value (e.g., at least three bits of an 8-bit bitmap must be 1's), or to have a ratio of bits of one value to bits of the other value, etc.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The server <b>400</b> may be configured to consider a desire to train a receive antenna pattern and/or a desire to help with signal integration in producing a PRS muting configuration. The server <b>400</b> may have a criterion for a bitmap to have a number of bits of the same value, e.g., indicating unmuted PR signals, which may facilitate or enable training of one or more receive schedules and/or help with integration of a PRS signal, e.g., a weakly-received PRS signal. For example, a criterion may be that the muting configuration has a threshold quantity of unmuted positioning signal indications to enable receive antenna pattern training. As another example, a criterion may be that the muting configuration has a threshold quantity of unmuted positioning signal indications to enable a threshold level of signal integration (e.g., a threshold level of total power). As another example, a criterion may be a maximum distance (e.g., maximum number of slots) between on-bits (indications not to mute). The UE <b>200</b> may be configured to observe the unmuted signal over multiple slots with the same antenna pattern and to integrate the received signal, e.g., to help receive a PRS signal with poor SNR (signal-to-noise ratio). The UE <b>200</b> may be configured to observe the unmuted signal over different slots with different antenna patterns to determine which antenna pattern yielded the strongest received signal. This information may be used to train one or more antenna patterns, e.g., to improve PRS signal reception.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The server <b>400</b> is configured, as appropriate, to obtain information relevant to the one or more criteria for the muting configurations. For example, the server <b>400</b> may be configured to obtain relevant information by receiving measurement information (e.g., raw measurements and/or processed measurements) from one or more UEs <b>200</b>, one or more TRPs <b>300</b>, and/or from taking measurements. As another example, the server <b>400</b> may be configured to obtain relevant information by being programmed with, or otherwise storing, information relevant to the one or more criteria (e.g., whether a TRP <b>300</b> is in a high-mobility area or a low-mobility area (i.e., whether UEs in a coverage area of the TRP <b>300</b> are expected to have high or low mobility). The server <b>400</b> may be configured to produce relevant information such as an RSTD uncertainty (a search window) that the server <b>400</b> provides to the UE <b>200</b> and uses to determine whether the RSTD uncertainty is small enough to enable the UE <b>200</b> to resolve aliased peaks due to intra-slot muting. The server <b>400</b> may be configured to use the obtained information to determine one or more of the criteria for the muting configuration.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">The server <b>400</b> may be configured to implement on-demand intra-slot muting, e.g., based on a type of positioning signal triggering. For example, the server <b>400</b> may be configured to cause the TRP <b>300</b> to perform intra-slot muting (e.g., only send an intra-slot muting configuration to the TRP <b>300</b>) only if MAC-CE-based (Media Access Control-Control Element based) DL PRS (Downlink PRS) triggering is used and/or DCI-based (Downlink Control Information based) DL PRS triggering is used. The server <b>400</b> may be configured to determine that MAC-CE-based DL PRS and/or that DCI-based DL PRS has been triggered (e.g., triggered by a serving TRP) and to respond by enabling intra-slot positioning signal (e.g., PRS) muting, e.g., by sending an intra-slot muting configuration to the TRP <b>300</b> or by sending an instruction (e.g., in a MAC-CE or DCI communication) to the TRP <b>300</b> to use an intra-slot muting configuration (e.g., previously sent to the TRP <b>300</b> or produced by the TRP <b>300</b>). Such on-demand triggering of intra-slot muting may help ensure high-quality performance because intra-slot muting may use rapid muting changes (muting to not muting and vice versa) and thus is a low-latency technique, and MAC-CE and DCI-based DL PRS are low-latency techniques as well.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, a signal and processing flow <b>1500</b> shows communications between the UE <b>200</b>, the server <b>400</b>, and two TRPs <b>300</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>300</b>-<b>2</b>, and processing by the server <b>400</b> to implement an intra-slot muting configuration. The signal and processing flow <b>1500</b> includes messages and stages shown and is an example only and not limiting.

The server <b>400</b> may generate a schedule using one or more techniques discussed herein and/or one or more other techniques for generating an intra-slot muting configuration (e.g., a bitmap corresponding to the schedule). The server <b>400</b> may only use a muting configuration that meets one or more criteria such as those discussed above, e.g., to have unmuted segments within a slot be consecutive. The one or more criteria may include one or more criteria regarding performance indications, facilitating antenna pattern training, balancing muting and non-muting, having one or more specified slot segments with specified bitmap values, helping to ensure orthogonality (e.g., reducing a probability of colliding with another signal to below a threshold probability), and/or facilitating positioning in high-mobility environments, etc. The one or more criteria may include that there must be at least three intra-slot groups (i.e., fully staggered sets of symbols) before the server <b>400</b> will determine an intra-slot muting configuration (or at least provide an intra-slot muting configuration to a TRP <b>300</b>). For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, if only the fourth resource R<b>4</b> of the resource set <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> has at least three intra-slot groups, here groups <b>1611</b>, <b>1612</b>, <b>1613</b>, then intra-slot muting (Option 3 muting) may only be applied to the fourth resource R<b>4</b>.

Thus, the &#x201c;first intra-slot positioning signal resource segment&#x201d; is a label and this segment need not be the first symbols for transmitting a positioning signal in a slot according to the transmission schedule. Similarly, the &#x201c;first slot&#x201d; is a label and does not require the slot to be the first slot of the transmission schedule. The server <b>400</b> may cause the TRP <b>300</b> to transmit the first segment, e.g., by sending the transmission schedule and the muting configuration to the TRP <b>300</b>, and the TRP <b>300</b> may use the transmission schedule to transmit the positioning signal, muting intra-slot segments as indicated by the muting configuration. Causing the TRP to transmit, unmuted, the first intra-slot positioning signal resource segment may comprise sending the transmission schedule and muting configuration to the TRP for execution. Transmitting, unmuted, the first intra-slot positioning signal resource segment may comprise executing the transmission schedule in view of the muting configuration by the TRP, with the transmission and muting configurations stored and/or produced by the TRP.

Each of the intra-slot groups may comprise an identical portion of the transmission schedule, with each intra-slot group having an identical pattern of sounded resource elements over the symbols of the intra-slot group. As another example, the first segment may be smaller in size than intra-slot groups of the first slot where each intra-slot group is fully staggered. For example, the first intra-slot positioning signal resource segment may be a single symbol whereas the intra-slot groups are at least two symbols in length. In this case, the number of intra-slot positioning signal resource segments may equal the number of positioning signal symbols in the first slot (i.e., the number of symbols in the first slot designated by the transmission schedule for conveying the positioning signal).</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">At stage <b>1712</b>, the method <b>1700</b> includes muting transmission by the TRP of a second intra-slot positioning signal resource segment of the first slot of the transmission schedule in accordance with the muting configuration.

The first and second intra-slot positioning signal resource segments of the first slot each comprises one or more subcarriers within one or more symbols of the slot, and are separate portions of the slot. The second intra-slot positioning signal resource segment, in this example, corresponds to an intra-slot group. Other sizes of segments, however, may be used. For example, each segment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> corresponds to a symbol, which is smaller than the intra-slot groups shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, which are two symbols long each. Thus, for example, the second intra-slot positioning signal resource segment may correspond to symbol number 3 of the first slot <b>1101</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, which is a portion of an intra-slot group consisting of slots 3 and 4 of the first slot <b>1101</b>. Thus, the intra-slot group consisting of slots 3 and 4 becomes unstaggered with transmission of slot 3 being muted. Causing the TRP to mute transmission of the second intra-slot positioning signal resource segment may comprise sending the transmission and muting configurations to the TRP for execution. Muting transmission of the second intra-slot positioning signal resource element may comprise executing the transmission schedule in view of the muting configuration by the TRP, with the transmission and muting configurations stored and/or produced by the TRP.

For example, the method <b>1700</b> may include stage <b>1714</b> of muting transmission of a first intra-slot positioning signal resource segment of a second slot of the transmission schedule, or transmitting, unmuted, a second intra-slot positioning signal resource segment of the second slot, or both of these, where the first and second segments of the first and second slots, respectively, are in the same relative slot positions. For example, first intra-slot positioning signal resource segments of the slots <b>1301</b>, <b>1302</b> may each correspond to symbol 0 of the slots <b>1301</b>, <b>1302</b>, respectively, and second intra-slot positioning signal resource segments of the slots <b>1301</b>, <b>1302</b> may each correspond to symbol 1 of the slots <b>1301</b>, <b>1302</b>. The processor <b>310</b>, possibly in combination with the memory <b>311</b> (e.g., the software <b>312</b>), and possibly in combination with the transceiver <b>315</b> (e.g., the wireless transmitter <b>342</b> and the antenna <b>346</b>), may comprise means for muting transmission of the first intra-slot positioning signal of a second slot or transmitting, unmuted, a second intra-slot positioning signal resource segment, or a combination thereof. The processor <b>410</b>, possibly in combination with the memory <b>411</b> (e.g., the software <b>412</b>), in combination with the transceiver <b>415</b> (e.g., the wireless transmitter <b>442</b> and the antenna <b>446</b>, and/or the wired transmitter <b>452</b>), may comprise means for causing the TRP to mute transmission of the first intra-slot positioning signal of a second slot or to transmit, unmuted, a second intra-slot positioning signal resource segment, or a combination thereof. As another example, the method <b>1700</b> may include stage <b>1716</b> of transmitting, from another TRP unmuted, a third intra-slot positioning signal resource segment according to another muting configuration. Thus, different resources may have different muting configurations (e.g., the muting configurations <b>1320</b>, <b>1330</b>) applied and thus may have segments transmitted, unmuted, in accordance with different muting configurations and/or mute transmissions differently in accordance with different muting configurations. The processor <b>310</b>, possibly in combination with the memory <b>311</b>, in combination with the transceiver <b>315</b> (e.g., the wireless transmitter <b>342</b> and the antenna <b>346</b>, and/or the wired transmitter <b>352</b>) of another TRP may comprise means for transmitting, unmuted, the third intra-slot positioning signal resource segment according to the other muting configuration. The processor <b>410</b>, possibly in combination with the memory <b>411</b> (e.g., the software <b>412</b>), in combination with the transceiver <b>415</b> (e.g., the wireless transmitter <b>442</b> and the antenna <b>446</b>, and/or the wired transmitter <b>452</b>), may comprise means for causing another TRP to transmit, unmuted, a third intra-slot positioning signal resource segment according to another muting configuration.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">One or more other stages may be included as part of, before, and/or after the method <b>1700</b>. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, several optional stages of a method <b>1800</b> are shown that may be performed before stage <b>1710</b> of the method <b>1700</b>. Each of the stages of the method <b>1800</b> shown is optional. One or more other stages may be included in the method <b>1800</b>. While the discussion of the method <b>1800</b> focuses on the server <b>400</b> being configured to perform and performing functions, the TRP <b>300</b> may be configured to perform, and perform, some or all of the functions.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">At stage <b>1808</b>, the method <b>1800</b> includes obtaining information for obtaining a muting configuration. For example, the server <b>400</b> or a TRP <b>300</b> may obtain configuration information for transmitting one or more positioning signal (e.g., PRS) resources by one or more TRPs <b>300</b>. For example, the server <b>400</b> may obtain configuration information from one or more of the TRPs <b>300</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>300</b>-<b>2</b> via one or more of the messages <b>1511</b>, <b>1512</b>. The configuration information may include, for example, a comb type, a resource length, a number of repetitions, etc. Also or alternatively, the server <b>400</b> may be configured to read configuration information (e.g., the muting configuration) from the memory <b>411</b> and/or to produce and send the configuration information (which may include the muting configuration) to the TRP(s) <b>300</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>300</b>-<b>2</b>, e.g., in the messages <b>1518</b>, <b>1520</b>. The TRP <b>300</b> may receive the configuration information and use the configuration information as appropriate (e.g., derive the muting configuration from the configuration information or read the muting configuration from the configuration information). The processor <b>410</b>, possibly in combination with the memory <b>411</b> (e.g., the software <b>412</b>) and/or the transceiver <b>415</b>, may comprise means for obtaining information for obtaining the muting configuration. Also or alternatively, the processor <b>310</b>, possibly in combination with the memory <b>311</b> (e.g., the software <b>312</b>) and/or the transceiver <b>315</b>, may comprise means for obtaining information for obtaining the muting configuration.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">At stage <b>1810</b>, the method <b>1800</b> may include obtaining the muting configuration, e.g., based on positioning signal resource configuration information such as comb type, resource length, number of repetitions, etc., and/or based on a combination of muting configurations. For example, the server <b>400</b> or a TRP <b>300</b> may determine segment sizes for a bitmap representing the muting configuration based on the comb type and resource length. For example, the server <b>400</b> may be configured to obtain the muting configuration using one or more of a variety of techniques. For example, the server <b>400</b> may be configured to derive the muting pattern, e.g., based on such parameters, and/or may be configured to select a stored muting pattern, e.g., based on such parameters, and/or may be configured to obtain the muting configuration using one or more other techniques. The muting configuration may be different for different slots and/or for different positioning signal resources. The server <b>400</b> may, for example, set a segment size to be equal to the number of symbols in a slot for transmitting the positioning signal divided by the comb number. The server <b>400</b> may determine a muting configuration based on a combination of muting configurations. For example, the server <b>400</b> may logically combine (e.g., with a logical AND) an intra-slot muting configuration with one or more other muting configurations. For example, the server <b>400</b> may be configured to determine Option 1 AND Option 3, or Option 2 AND Option 3, or Option 1 AND Option 2 AND Option 3. Thus, for example, only where all ANDed muting configurations indicate to transmit unmuted will the resultant muting configuration indicate to transmit unmuted. The processor <b>410</b>, possibly in combination with the memory <b>411</b> (e.g., the software <b>412</b>), may comprise means for determining the muting configuration. Also or alternatively, the processor <b>310</b>, possibly in combination with the memory <b>311</b> (e.g., the software <b>312</b>), may comprise means for determining the muting configuration.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">At stage <b>1812</b>, the method <b>1800</b> may include obtaining the muting configuration such that all indications to transmit corresponding segments in a slot unmuted are consecutive. For example, the processor <b>410</b> may not use (e.g., discard, ignore, not select) any potential muting configuration (e.g., produced by the processor <b>410</b>, or stored by the memory <b>411</b> and selected by the processor <b>410</b>) that has multiple indications to transmit a corresponding slot segment unmuted where the indications are not consecutive (e.g., to ignore a muting configuration of <b>1011</b>, but allow a muting configuration of <b>0111</b>). The processor <b>410</b>, possibly in combination with the memory <b>411</b> (e.g., the software <b>412</b>), may comprise means for determining the muting configuration. Also or alternatively, the processor <b>310</b>, possibly in combination with the memory <b>311</b> (e.g., the software <b>312</b>), may comprise means for determining the muting configuration.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">At stage <b>1814</b>, the method <b>1800</b> may include determining whether at least three intra-slot groups are included in the transmission schedule. For example, the server <b>400</b> may determine whether the length of a resource divided by the number of symbols in an intra-slot group is at least three. The server <b>400</b> may not implement intra-slot muting if there are not at least three intra-slot groups per slot (e.g., the server <b>400</b> may not determine such an intra-slot muting configuration, or at least not send such an intra-slot muting configuration to the TRP <b>300</b>, or not send an instruction to the TRP <b>300</b> for the TRP <b>300</b> to use such an intra-slot muting configuration produced by or stored by the TRP <b>300</b>). If there are not at least three intra-slot groups, then the method <b>1800</b> may end at stage <b>1816</b> without proceeding to the method <b>1700</b>. The processor <b>410</b>, possibly in combination with the memory <b>411</b> (e.g., the software <b>412</b>), may comprise means for determining that the muting configuration includes at least three intra-slot groups.

For example, the server <b>400</b> may be configured to determine whether MAC-CE-based DL PRS triggering is in use (e.g., has been requested) and/or configured to determine whether DCI-based DL PRS triggering is in use. If low-latency positioning signal triggering is not in use, then the method <b>1800</b> may end at stage <b>1816</b> without proceeding to the method <b>1700</b>.

For example, the server <b>400</b> may determine whether the UE has a small enough search window (e.g., an RSTD uncertainty below an acceptable threshold) to resolve aliased peaks if the muting configuration will cause partial staggering (less than all subcarriers being sounded) for conveying a positioning signal. The server <b>400</b> may, for example, obtain information about the search window from the UE <b>200</b>, or may have sent the search window to the UE <b>200</b> and thus may have the search window stored. The server <b>400</b> may proceed to the method <b>1700</b> in response to determining (only if the server <b>400</b> determines) that the UE <b>200</b> has a small enough search window to resolve the aliased peaks, and may end at stage <b>1816</b> otherwise.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</heading><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Other examples and implementations are within the scope of the disclosure and appended claims.
