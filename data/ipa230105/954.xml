Under stimulation of growth factors and vitamin D3, mesenchymal stem cells are converted into osteoprogenitor cells and osteoblasts to initiate osteogenesis. The osteoblasts secret type I collagen and calcium deposit to form osteoid, which is further mineralized to form bone tissues. On the other hand, under stimulation of macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (NF&#x3ba;B) ligand (RANKL), macrophages are transformed to form osteoclasts, which are responsible for bone resorption process called osteoclastogenesis. The balance between the bone resorption and formation processes is essential for maintaining homeostasis of the bone.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Osteoporosis is a disease that occurs when the mass or density of the bone is decreased because of an imbalance between the remodeling activities of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Medications available for the prevention and/or treatment of osteoporosis include bisphosphonatcs, calcitonin, estrogen (hormone therapy), estrogen agonists, parathyroid hormone (PTH) analog, RANK ligand (RANKL) inhibitor, and tissue-selective estrogen complex (TSEC). These drugs have side effects and cannot stimulate osteoblastogenesis and inhibit osteoclastogenesis simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Human thrombomodulin (TM) is a transmembrane protein and its structure consists of 5 domains, including a NH2-terminal lectin-like domain (D1), a domain with 6 epidermal growth factor (EGF)&#x2014;like structures (D2), an O-glycosylation site&#x2014;rich domain (D3), a transmembrane domain (D4), and a cytoplasmic tail domain (D5). Cheng et al. reported that TMD1 can inhibit osteoclastogenesis by reducing proinflammatory high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) signaling (&#x201c;Myeloid thrombomodulin lectin-like domain inhibits osteoclastogenesis and inflammatory bone loss&#x201d; Sci Rep. 2016; 6:28340).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat.

Briefly, the pCR3 or pPICZA vector (Invitrogen, Oregon) was used for the expression and secretion of recombinant TM domain proteins in the HEK293 or <i>Pichia pastoris </i>protein expression system.

Crystal violet (0.5%, 300 &#x3bc;L) were added in each well for 15 min, followed by ddH<sub>2</sub>O rinse at least five times. Acetic acid (10%, 300 &#x3bc;L) were added to dissolute the crystal violet. Then, taking 100 &#x3bc;L/well into a 96 well plate to get an OD595 measurement.

MG63 cells were seeded in 6-well plates (5&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well) and treated with recombinant TM domains for 28 days.

After washing, cells were stained with 40 mM Alizarin-red (pH 4.2) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Stained cells were further processed by five-times rinse with water and followed by a 15-minute wash in PBS with rotations to reduce nonspecific Alizarin-red stain.

After anesthesia, a 4 mm-diameter defect on the calvaria was created and the wound was sutured.

Bone healing was monitored radiographically using &#x3bc;CT (Skyscan 1076, Antwerp, Belgium) and histologically at indicated time points (weeks 0 and 8) after the surgery. The &#x3bc;CT scanner was operated at 50 kV, 220 mA, 1.2 s exposure time, with a pixel size of 2.5 mm, 0.5 mm aluminum filter, yielding isotopic 17.09 mm voxel with 2.5 mm slice thickness through a rotation of 180&#x2033;. To calculate the bone formation, a cylindrical volume of 4 mm diameter and 2 mm depth was chosen for the calvarial defect regeneration. The tomographic images were transformed into volumetric reconstruction using the NRecon program (Skyscan). The quantification of the removed and regenerated bone volume (mm<sup>3</sup>) performed by a 3D CT analyzer software (CTAN; Skyscan). For histological analysis, the specimens were decalcified in 10% EDTA for 1 week and then embedded in paraffin.

Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 7 (GraphPad software). Data are expressed as mean&#xb1;SD. For comparisons of multiple groups, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used.

A 4 mm-diameter hole was created in calvarial bone in each mouse. rTMD23 of various dosages was given once by subcutaneously injection near the calvarial bone opening at week 1 after the surgery.

These findings suggested that TMD1 cannot contribute to osteoblastic functions and bone healing. The calvarial bone healing assay was also used to evaluate the effect of TMD23 on bone healing. Both &#x3bc;CT measurements (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref>) and H&#x26;E staining (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>F</figref>) revealed that treatment with DCI to inhibit RHBDL2 and TM ectodomain shedding reduced regeneration of calvarial bone defect.

As illustrated, TMD23 can promote bone formation by functioning as a chemoattractant to attract osteoblast and preosteoblast cells MG63 (a human osteoblast-like cell line). MG63 cells are phenotypically arrested at pre-osteoblast state and can be induced for mineralization. It was demonstrated that TMD23 can promote bone healing in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Macrophage can be induced to form multinuclear osteoclast in a process of osteoclastogenesis by stimulation with macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 (MCSF-1) and RANK ligand (RANKL). TMD23, TMD123, or a bioactive variant thereof, can inhibit osteoclastogenesis of macrophages induced by MCSF-1 and RANK ligand (RANKL). As illustrated, rTMD23 can inhibit bone resorption by osteoclasts.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">In conclusion, thrombomodulin domain 23-containing proteins, including TMD23, TMD123, and bioactive variants thereof, can inhibit osteoclastogenesis and promote osteoblastogenesis. TMD23, TMD123 or a bioactive variant thereof can be applied for prevention and treatment of bone loss diseases, conditions, or disorder, including osteoporosis, osteopenia, rheumatoid arthritis, arthritis and periodontitis, and for promoting bone regeneration, osteoaugmentation, treatment of bone injuries and promoting bone healing.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">The foregoing description of the exemplary embodiments of the invention has been presented only for the purposes of illustration and description and is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed.
