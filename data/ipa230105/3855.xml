id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a sensing system (and its use). The invention also relates to an agricultural facility (and its use). Yet further, the invention relates to a plant monitoring method. The invention also relates to computer program product (for executing such plant monitoring method, e.g. with the sensing system).</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Methods, devices and system for detection, sensing, and identification of objects are known in the art. WO2018/194920, for instance, describes methods, devices and systems for detection, sensing and identification of objects using modulated polarized beams. An example polarization sensitive device includes an illumination source, and a modulator coupled to the illumination source to produce output beams in which polarization states or polarization parameters of the output beams are modulated to produce a plurality of modulated polarized beams. The device further includes a polarization sensitive detector positioned to receive a reflected portion of modulated polarized beams after reflection from an object and to produce information that is indicative of modulation and polarization states of the received beams. According to WO2018/194920, the information can be used to enable a determination of a distance between the polarization sensitive device and the object, or a determination of a polarization-specific characteristic of the object.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In large industrial horticulture installations, such as greenhouses and city farms, but also in open air horticulture, there is a trend to make use of automated inspection and handling as a replacement or support to the farmer and human workers. This automation is becoming required and almost mandatory in future because of e.g. the facts that observing, estimating (e.g. on ripeness, onset of disease, . . . ), handling (e.g. harvesting) of crops and fruits is highly time consuming, manual work is highly expensive and may require expert people. Further, even experts can make mistakes and may not be stable and objective in their analysis or actions. Further, when 24/7 monitoring is required it may be more comfortable to have the monitoring done at least part of the time by a machine. Hence, next to the use of automated harvesting and crop processing (e.g. spraying) machines, an automated plant and crop/fruit sensing may be desirable. Prior art systems, however, may have less functionalities than desired. Hence, it is an aspect of the invention to provide an alternative sensing system (and/or agricultural facility and/or (plant) monitoring method, and/or computer program product), which preferably further at least partly obviate one or more of above-described drawbacks. The present invention may have as object to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a first aspect, the invention provides a sensing system, especially for agricultural application, comprising a radiation generator (&#x201c;generator&#x201d;) and a sensing apparatus (which may be functionally coupled to the generator). Further, the sensing system may comprise a control system, which may especially be functionally coupled to the radiation generator and the sensing apparatus (which may also be indicated as &#x201c;sensor&#x201d;). Especially, in embodiments the sensing system may have one or more time-of-flight sensing modes of operation, wherein the generator is configured to generate a pulse of radiation in the one or more time-of-flight sensing modes of operation. Especially, the sensing apparatus may be configured to sense radiation coming from an object being sensed as a function of time in the one or more time-of-flight sensing modes, to provide a sensing system signal. In more specific embodiments, the sensing apparatus may be configured to sense (wavelength dependent) spectral intensities, such as wavelength dependent spectral intensity distributions, of (coming) radiation received by the sensing apparatus as a function of time in the one or more time-of-flight sensing modes, to provide a sensing system signal. Especially, the spectral intensities, such as wavelength dependent spectral intensity distributions, may be spectral power distributions. The sensing system signal is indicative of the wavelength dependent spectral intensity distribution of the received radiation as a function of time in the one or more time-of-flight sensing modes. Hence, especially in embodiments the invention provides (thus) a sensing system (especially for agricultural application) comprising a radiation generator, a sensing apparatus (functionally coupled to the generator), and a control system functionally coupled to the radiation generator and the sensing apparatus, wherein the sensing system has one or more time-of-flight sensing modes of operation, wherein the generator is configured to generate a pulse of radiation in the one or more time-of-flight sensing modes of operation, and wherein the sensing apparatus may be configured to sense radiation coming from an object being sensed as a function of time in the one or more time-of-flight sensing modes, to provide a sensing system signal. Further, especially in embodiments the invention provides (thus) a sensing system (especially for agricultural application) comprising a radiation generator, a sensing apparatus (functionally coupled to the generator), and a control system functionally coupled to the radiation generator and the sensing apparatus, wherein the sensing system has one or more time-of-flight sensing modes of operation, wherein the generator is configured to generate a pulse of radiation in the one or more time-of-flight sensing modes of operation, and wherein the sensing apparatus is configured to sense (wavelength dependent) spectral intensities, such as wavelength dependent spectral intensity distributions, of radiation received by the sensing apparatus as a function of time in the one or more time-of-flight sensing modes, to provide a sensing system signal.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Furthermore: The sensing system signal may be useful as such, for instance to get a better status overview of the object(s). However, the sensing system signal may also be used to control (another) device (or apparatus or system). Hence, the invention may additionally provide that the sensing system is functionally coupled to an agricultural device, wherein the agricultural device comprises a lighting device for illuminating a plant or plant part with a light recipe, wherein the control system controls the agricultural device to illuminate the plant or plant part with the light recipe in dependence of the sensing system signal.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">With such sensing system(s) the invention provides in embodiments a time-of-flight camera with multispectral illumination for horticultural applications. The active illumination of the time-of-flight camera may in embodiments use multiple wavelengths to acquired range information used to get shape properties of plants. This may in embodiments be combined with capturing and analyzing the intensity signal of different wavelengths which may contain information about plant health and development and can be used to e.g. classify different plant parts and/or determine the status of these plant parts. It may be possible to earlier detect diseases and/or to get a more accurate status of the plants or of individual plants. In this way, treatment and/or other actions, like pruning, disease management or harvesting may, also be executed more effectively. The term &#x201c;range information&#x201d; may especially refer to distance information.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As indicated above, the sensing system may especially be used for agricultural applications, like horticulture applications. The term &#x201c;agriculture&#x201d; may especially refer to the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock. Herein, the term &#x201c;agriculture&#x201d; may especially refer to the science and art of cultivating plants. This may be indoors or outdoors agriculture. This may be agriculture in greenhouses, in closed plant factories, etc. etc. This may be based on daylight only, on a combination of daylight and artificial light, or on artificial light only. The term &#x201c;agriculture&#x201d; may especially at least include &#x201c;horticulture&#x201d;. Amongst others, the invention is especially related to horticulture applications. The term &#x201c;horticulture&#x201d; relates to (intensive) plant cultivation for human use and is very diverse in its activities, incorporating plants for food (fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, culinary herbs) and non-food crops (flowers, trees and shrubs, turf-grass, hops, grapes, medicinal herbs). Horticulture is the branch of agriculture that deals with the art, science, technology, and business of growing plants. It may include the cultivation of medicinal plants, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, herbs, sprouts, mushrooms, algae, flowers, seaweeds and non-food crops such as grass and ornamental trees and plants. Here, the term &#x201c;plant&#x201d; is used to refer essentially any species selected from medicinal plants, vegetables, herbs, sprouts, mushrooms, plants bearing nuts, plants bearing seeds, plants bearing flowers, plants bearing fruits, non-food crops such as grass and ornamental trees, etc.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Herein, the term &#x201c;plant&#x201d; is used for essentially all stages. The term &#x201c;plant part&#x201d; may refer to root, stem, leaf, fruit (if any), etc. The term &#x201c;horticulture&#x201d; relates to (intensive) plant cultivation for human use and is very diverse in its activities, incorporating plants for food (fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, culinary herbs) and non-food crops (flowers, trees and shrubs, turf-grass, hops, grapes, medicinal herbs).

The terms &#x201c;horticulture&#x201d; and &#x201c;plant&#x201d; may also refer to one or more of Cannabis and Papaver (especially Papaver somniferum, also indicated as &#x201c;opium poppy&#x201d; or &#x201c;bread seed poppy&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The term &#x201c;crop&#x201d; is used herein to indicate the horticulture plant that is grown or was grown. Plants of the same kind grown on a large scale for food, clothing, etc., may be called crops. A crop is a non-animal species or variety that is grown to be harvested as e.g. food, livestock fodder, fuel, or for any other economic purpose. The term &#x201c;crop&#x201d; may also relate to a plurality of crops. Horticulture crops may especially refer to food crops (tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers and lettuce), as well as to plants (potentially) bearing such crops, such as a tomato plant, a pepper plant, a cucumber plant, etc. Horticulture may herein in general relate to e.g. crop and non-crop plants.

Amongst others, herein an (optimized) time-of-flight solution using active illumination with wavelengths which may be optimal for horticultural applications is proposed. By applying a wavelength tailored to the reflective/absorbing/luminescent properties of the plant or fruit, the accuracy and robustness of the range information may be improved. When applying two or more wavelengths, the difference in reflection of each wavelength can be used to classify the plant part or assess the condition and health of the plant (e.g. dehydration level or presence of diseases). It can be used for evaluation of the fruit status (e.g. ripeness, presence or concentration of certain components) to guarantee the quality of the fruit and automatically determine the best moment of harvesting. Also, a wavelength can be chosen such that it will penetrate through for example leaves and is reflected by a fruit. This enables the detection of fruits even in case of occlusion by leaves. Using an additional wavelength reflected by leaves will provide information how to approach the fruit with a robotized gripper. The provided functionality like seeing through leaves and multi-spectral analysis of plant/fruits is a very difficult, subjective and probably impossible task for (unskilled) workers.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Amongst others, active illumination for SNR improvement of range measurement may be provided. For instance, an active illumination with a wavelength which may be optimally reflected by the fruit/plant to be inspected may be used. For example, the reflectance of tomatoes appears to differ from leaves in the visible range but also in the SWIR range (1000-1900 nm). For instance, active illumination at 930 nm appears to be poorly reflected by tomatoes resulting in a lower SNR of the range signal, whereas for example using a 750 nm wavelength the SNR may be much better. Also, indirect light reflections scattering could have a negative effect on the range measurement. In case we are interested in range information of only tomatoes, a wavelength around the chlorophyll absorption spectrum of leaves and a relatively high reflectance for tomatoes can be selected (like e.g. 625 nm). The wavelengths could also be chosen such that the impact (disturbance) of sun light is reduced (see right picture for the spectrum).</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The absorption spectra of tomatoes and tomato leaves are partially overlapping and therefore a single wavelength can be used to measure the range. However, it may also be useful to use different wavelength, wherein at least one wavelength is selected from a wavelength range wherein there is small or no overlap. In case of fruits and flowers with low reflectance in the overlapping part of the spectrum of leaves (e.g. blue flowers in the example below) the active wavelength used could be chosen between 450-500 nm.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Further, amongst others monochromatic/multi-spectral active illumination for spectral measurement with range and shape compensation. In further embodiments, active illumination may be used where the intensity of the active illumination may be optimized for the range/geometry and optical characteristics of the fruit/plant to be inspected. The reflection/absorption/transmission of the active illumination may depend on the distance to the plant, the orientation of the surface orientation for different wave lengths. The active illumination may use the information to adapt the intensity of the active (multi-spectral) illumination source to improve the signal quality.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Yet further, amongst others multi-spectral active illumination for seeing through leaves may be applied. When observing both fruits and leaves, their difference in spectral response can be exploited to see through leaves. For instance, such wavelength that (partially) penetrates through vegetation and reflects on fruits may be used, while measuring the distance. By having an additional wavelength reflected by leaves, an automated solution can use the measured 3D properties of both the fruits and leaves to automate the picking of fruits.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In embodiments, multi-spectral active illumination for plant growth and health monitoring may be applied. For instance, when using two or more specific wavelengths, the growth or health status of plants can be retrieved by taking the ratio of the spectral responses. For instance, the maturity of a flower or of a fruit may be determined by monitoring the reflectance within an entire first spectral range as reference while using the reflectance at a subset of wavelengths within (or even outside) such first range. Similarly, diseases can be detected from comparison of multiple responses.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Further, in embodiments multi-spectral active illumination for penetration measurement may be applied. The penetration of light in plants may depend on the wavelength used. Long wavelength red or near infrared (NIR) light may penetrate deeper in the leaf compared with blue light, which may be due to higher scattering on cell membranes and cell-to-cell interfaces. The measured distance for the different spectral components can be used to determine the penetration depth of the different wavelengths.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In embodiments, multi-spectral active illumination for fluorescence measurement may be applied. For instance, fluorescence reabsorption within a leaf may depend on the luminescence wavelength. Red fluorescence may have a larger probability of (at least partially) being reabsorbed by chlorophyll within the leaf compared with far-red fluorescence, due to the characteristics of the chlorophyll absorption spectra. Likewise, when a broad band radiation in the red is provided, this may have a larger probability of (at least partially) being reabsorbed by chlorophyll within the leaf compared with a broad band radiation in the far-red. The active illumination can be both used for range sensing and fluorescence measurement.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Yet further, in embodiments multi-spectral active illumination for scatter and BRDF measurement may be provided. For instance, 3D information may be used to reconstruct the surface and thus incident angle of the active light to measure the characteristics of the light reflected. The light scatter or the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) can be used for monitoring plant development/health. The scatter effects could depend on the wavelength used.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In embodiments, multi-spectral active illumination for polarization measurement may be applied. For instance, a time-of-flight sensor with elements with different polarizations (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>) and non-polarized radiation may be applied. The effect of the plant on the polarization can be used for monitoring plant development (e.g. presence of cannabis flowers or ripening level of cannabis flowers based on e.g. detection and monitoring of amount and size of trichomes or terpene compounds in the trichomes). Another option is to use polarized light sources with sensing elements with(out) different polarization. However, also a combination of polarized radiation and a sensing apparatus which can measure different polarizations may be applied.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In yet further embodiments, multi-spectral active illumination for internal propagation/scatter measurement may be applied. For instance, the time-of-flight signal may be used to measure the propagation of light within the plant. By partially illuminating the plant with the active illumination the non-illuminated areas can be used as measurement location. One can measure the time for the light to enter the plant, propagate trough the plant (parts), and is next received by the sensor (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c </i></figref>(variant II)). The direct return reflection is measured by the sensing elements observing the areas illuminated by the active illumination, while the indirect reflection (that includes propagation through the plant) is measured via the sensing elements observing non-illuminated parts (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>c </i></figref>(variant II)). The propagation of light through the plant also depends on the wavelength, providing additional information Also propagation time depends on internal-plant scatter effects, providing e.g. information of type and number of scatter locations (e.g. cell types, -size and -numbers, osmotic pressure in the cells, hydration level of the tissue, etc.).</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">With the aid of monochromatic and/or polychromatic active illumination range information can be extracted, which can be used to adapt/calibrate the spectral information. With the aid of monochromatic and/or polychromatic active illumination shape (3D conformation) information can be extracted, which can be used to adapt/calibrate the spectral information.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>b </i></figref>schematically depict some embodiments of a sensing system <b>1000</b>, such as here for agricultural application.
