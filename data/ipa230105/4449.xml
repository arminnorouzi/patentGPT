Such systems may be a multi-resource access system <b>500</b> (described below in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> in Section E) that provides many benefits, including providing a user <b>524</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>B and <b>5</b>C</figref>) with the ability to seamlessly access multiple different resources from a user interface of a single application, e.g., the resource access application <b>522</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>B and <b>5</b>C</figref>. Such resources may be applications that are hosted remotely, content that is available from a cloud environment, virtual desktops providing access to other devices, and other resources. The multi-resource access system <b>500</b> may generate notifications when events occur at the resources that the user <b>524</b> has access to. For example, a first application may receive a paid time off (PTO) request, which the user <b>524</b> is responsible for approving, and a notification corresponding to receipt of the request may be presented to the user <b>524</b> via the resource access application <b>522</b>. Such notifications may be presented to the user <b>524</b> via an activity feed included in a user interface screen of the resource access application <b>522</b>. An example user interface screen <b>150</b> including an activity feed <b>544</b> in which a number of notifications <b>546</b><i>a</i>, <b>546</b><i>b</i>, <b>546</b><i>c </i>are presented is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Given the number of resources the user <b>524</b> can access and given the number of events occurring at each of the resources, a large number of notifications <b>546</b> may be presented in the user's activity feed <b>544</b>. At some point, the number of notifications <b>546</b> may hinder the user's productivity, such as by disturbing the user during performance of a significant task. The inventors have recognized and appreciated that receiving notifications <b>546</b> from different resources without any sequence or priority may disrupt a user's productivity. Some of the notifications <b>546</b> may be urgent, but others may not need immediate action or attention from the user.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Offered is a technique that enables the user <b>524</b> to control the order in which notifications <b>546</b> are presented in an activity feed <b>544</b>. In particular, the order of the notifications <b>546</b> may be determined based on keywords selected by the user <b>524</b>. For example, the user <b>524</b> may select a first keyword with a highest priority, and when the multi-resource access system <b>500</b> generates a first notification <b>546</b><i>a </i>relating to the first keyword, the resource access application <b>522</b> may present the first notification <b>546</b><i>a </i>at the top of the activity feed <b>544</b>. Continuing the example, the user <b>524</b> may select a second keyword with a second highest priority, and when the multi-resource access system <b>500</b> generates a second notification <b>546</b><i>b </i>relating to the second keyword, the resource access application <b>522</b> presents the second notification <b>546</b><i>b </i>after the first notification <b>546</b><i>a </i>in the activity feed <b>544</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Customizing the order of notifications <b>546</b> based on the user's selected keywords, enables the user <b>524</b> to control which notifications <b>546</b> are prioritized in the user's activity feed <b>544</b>. Thus, if the user <b>524</b> is working on a significant task, but also wants to keep track of any events that occur for another task, then the user <b>524</b> can prioritize presentation of notifications <b>546</b> for the other task by selecting a keyword(s) relating to the other task. The techniques of the present disclosure enables the user <b>524</b> to provide the user's own keyword or select a keyword from a list of keywords that may be generated based on the user's past interactions with the activity feed <b>544</b> and/or the types of notifications <b>546</b> received by the user <b>524</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">For purposes of reading the description of the various embodiments below, the following descriptions of the sections of the specification and their respective contents may be helpful:</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Section A provides an introduction to example embodiments of a system for keyword-based presentation of notifications;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Section B describes a network environment which may be useful for practicing embodiments described herein;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Section C describes a computing system which may be useful for practicing embodiments described herein;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Section D describes embodiments of systems and methods for accessing computing resources using a cloud computing environment;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Section E describes embodiments of systems and methods for managing and streamlining access by clients to a variety of resources;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Section F provides a more detailed description of example embodiments of the system for keyword-based presentation of notifications that was introduced in Section A; and</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Section G describes example implementations of methods, systems/devices, and computer-readable media in accordance with the present disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">A.

As described below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>B and <b>5</b>C</figref> in Section E, the user <b>524</b> may access resources <b>526</b> at the client device <b>202</b> via the resource access application <b>522</b>. The user <b>524</b> may log in to the resource access application <b>522</b> using his/her credentials (e.g., username, password, pin, dual-authentication techniques, fingerprint, etc.) to gain access to the resources via the single user interface of the resource access application <b>522</b>. While the user <b>524</b> is logged in to the resource access application <b>522</b>, the computing system <b>106</b>, which may include one or more components of the resource management services <b>502</b>, may generate notifications <b>546</b> for events that may occur at the resources <b>526</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">At a step <b>122</b> of the process <b>120</b>, the computing system <b>106</b> may access, using access credentials for the user <b>524</b>, data associated with the systems of record <b>526</b>. As described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, for example, in some implementations, the data integration provider service <b>530</b> may use access credentials associated with the user <b>524</b> (e.g., retrieved from the credential wallet service <b>532</b>) to access various systems of record <b>526</b> (e.g., via application programming interface (API) calls to the systems of record <b>526</b>) on behalf of the user <b>524</b>, and retrieve data from those systems of record <b>526</b> that is indicative of events that may have occurred and may be pertinent to the user <b>524</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the computing system <b>106</b> may use first access credentials <b>108</b><i>a </i>to access first data <b>110</b><i>a </i>relating to a first event(s) from a first system of record <b>526</b><i>a</i>, and may use second access credentials <b>108</b><i>b </i>to access second data <b>110</b><i>b </i>relating to a second event(s) from a second system of record <b>526</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">At a step <b>124</b> of the process <b>120</b>, the computing system <b>106</b> may generate a plurality of notifications <b>546</b> of events indicated by the accessed data.

Systems and Methods for Delivering Shared Resources Using a Cloud Computing Environment</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a cloud computing environment <b>400</b> is depicted, which may also be referred to as a cloud environment, cloud computing or cloud network. The cloud computing environment <b>400</b> can provide the delivery of shared computing services and/or resources to multiple users or tenants. For example, the shared resources and services can include, but are not limited to, networks, network bandwidth, servers, processing, memory, storage, applications, virtual machines, databases, software, hardware, analytics, and intelligence.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the cloud computing environment <b>400</b>, one or more clients <b>202</b> (such as those described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) are in communication with a cloud network <b>404</b>. The cloud network <b>404</b> may include back-end platforms, e.g., servers, storage, server farms and/or data centers. The clients <b>202</b> may correspond to a single organization/tenant or multiple organizations/tenants. More particularly, in one example implementation, the cloud computing environment <b>400</b> may provide a private cloud serving a single organization (e.g., enterprise cloud). In another example, the cloud computing environment <b>400</b> may provide a community or public cloud serving multiple organizations/tenants.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, a gateway appliance(s) or service may be utilized to provide access to cloud computing resources and virtual sessions. By way of example, Citrix Gateway, provided by Citrix Systems, Inc., may be deployed on-premises or on public clouds to provide users with secure access and single sign-on to virtual, SaaS and web applications. Furthermore, to protect users from web threats, a gateway such as Citrix Secure Web Gateway may be used. Citrix Secure Web Gateway uses a cloud-based service and a local cache to check for URL reputation and category.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In still further embodiments, the cloud computing environment <b>400</b> may provide a hybrid cloud that is a combination of a public cloud and one or more resources located outside such a cloud, such as resources hosted within one or more data centers of an organization. Public clouds may include public servers that are maintained by third parties to the clients <b>202</b> or the enterprise/tenant. The servers may be located off-site in remote geographical locations or otherwise. In some implementations, one or more cloud connectors may be used to facilitate the exchange of communications between one more resources within the cloud computing environment <b>400</b> and one or more resources outside of such an environment.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The cloud computing environment <b>400</b> can provide resource pooling to serve multiple users via clients <b>202</b> through a multi-tenant environment or multi-tenant model with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned responsive to different demands within the respective environment. The multi-tenant environment can include a system or architecture that can provide a single instance of software, an application or a software application to serve multiple users. In some embodiments, the cloud computing environment <b>400</b> can provide on-demand self-service to unilaterally provision computing capabilities (e.g., server time, network storage) across a network for multiple clients <b>202</b>. By way of example, provisioning services may be provided through a system such as Citrix Provisioning Services (Citrix PVS). Citrix PVS is a software-streaming technology that delivers patches, updates, and other configuration information to multiple virtual desktop endpoints through a shared desktop image. The cloud computing environment <b>400</b> can provide an elasticity to dynamically scale out or scale in response to different demands from one or more clients <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, the cloud computing environment <b>400</b> may include or provide monitoring services to monitor, control and/or generate reports corresponding to the provided shared services and resources.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, the cloud computing environment <b>400</b> may provide cloud-based delivery of different types of cloud computing services, such as Software as a service (SaaS) <b>402</b>, Platform as a Service (PaaS) <b>404</b>, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) <b>406</b>, and Desktop as a Service (DaaS) <b>408</b>, for example. IaaS may refer to a user renting the use of infrastructure resources that are needed during a specified time period. IaaS providers may offer storage, networking, servers or virtualization resources from large pools, allowing the users to quickly scale up by accessing more resources as needed. Examples of IaaS include AMAZON WEB SERVICES provided by Amazon.com, Inc., of Seattle, Wash., RACKSPACE CLOUD provided by Rackspace US, Inc., of San Antonio, Tex., Google Compute Engine provided by Google Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., or RIGHTSCALE provided by RightScale, Inc., of Santa Barbara, Calif.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">PaaS providers may offer functionality provided by IaaS, including, e.g., storage, networking, servers or virtualization, as well as additional resources such as, e.g., the operating system, middleware, or runtime resources. Examples of PaaS include WINDOWS AZURE provided by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., Google App Engine provided by Google Inc., and HEROKU provided by Heroku, Inc. of San Francisco, Calif.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">SaaS providers may offer the resources that PaaS provides, including storage, networking, servers, virtualization, operating system, middleware, or runtime resources. In some embodiments, SaaS providers may offer additional resources including, e.g., data and application resources. Examples of SaaS include GOOGLE APPS provided by Google Inc., SALESFORCE provided by Salesforce.com Inc. of San Francisco, Calif., or OFFICE 365 provided by Microsoft Corporation. Examples of SaaS may also include data storage providers, e.g. Citrix ShareFile from Citrix Systems, DROPBOX provided by Dropbox, Inc. of San Francisco, Calif., Microsoft SKYDRIVE provided by Microsoft Corporation, Google Drive provided by Google Inc., or Apple ICLOUD provided by Apple Inc. of Cupertino, Calif.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Similar to SaaS, DaaS (which is also known as hosted desktop services) is a form of virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) in which virtual desktop sessions are typically delivered as a cloud service along with the apps used on the virtual desktop. Citrix Cloud from Citrix Systems is one example of a DaaS delivery platform. DaaS delivery platforms may be hosted on a public cloud computing infrastructure, such as AZURE CLOUD from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., or AMAZON WEB SERVICES provided by Amazon.com, Inc., of Seattle, Wash., for example. In the case of Citrix Cloud, Citrix Workspace app may be used as a single-entry point for bringing apps, files and desktops together (whether on-premises or in the cloud) to deliver a unified experience.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">E. Systems and Methods for Managing and Streamlining Access by Client Devices to a Variety of Resources</heading><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a block diagram of an example multi-resource access system <b>500</b> in which one or more resource management services <b>502</b> may manage and streamline access by one or more clients <b>202</b> to one or more resource feeds <b>504</b> (via one or more gateway services <b>506</b>) and/or one or more software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications <b>508</b>. In particular, the resource management service(s) <b>502</b> may employ an identity provider <b>510</b> to authenticate the identity of a user of a client <b>202</b> and, following authentication, identify one or more resources the user is authorized to access. In response to the user selecting one of the identified resources, the resource management service(s) <b>502</b> may send appropriate access credentials to the requesting client <b>202</b>, and the client <b>202</b> may then use those credentials to access the selected resource. For the resource feed(s) <b>504</b>, the client <b>202</b> may use the supplied credentials to access the selected resource via a gateway service <b>506</b>. For the SaaS application(s) <b>508</b>, the client <b>202</b> may use the credentials to access the selected application directly.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The client(s) <b>202</b> may be any type of computing devices capable of accessing the resource feed(s) <b>504</b> and/or the SaaS application(s) <b>508</b>, and may, for example, include a variety of desktop or laptop computers, smartphones, tablets, etc. The resource feed(s) <b>504</b> may include any of numerous resource types and may be provided from any of numerous locations. In some embodiments, for example, the resource feed(s) <b>504</b> may include one or more systems or services for providing virtual applications and/or desktops to the client(s) <b>202</b>, one or more file repositories and/or file sharing systems, one or more secure browser services, one or more access control services for the SaaS applications <b>508</b>, one or more management services for local applications on the client(s) <b>202</b>, one or more internet enabled devices or sensors, etc. The resource management service(s) <b>502</b>, the resource feed(s) <b>504</b>, the gateway service(s) <b>506</b>, the SaaS application(s) <b>508</b>, and the identity provider <b>510</b> may be located within an on-premises data center of an organization for which the multi-resource access system <b>500</b> is deployed, within one or more cloud computing environments, or elsewhere.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a block diagram showing an example implementation of the multi-resource access system <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> in which various resource management services <b>502</b> as well as a gateway service <b>506</b> are located within a cloud computing environment <b>512</b>. The cloud computing environment may, for example, include Microsoft Azure Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, or IBM Cloud. It should be appreciated, however, that in other implementations, one or more (or all) of the components of the resource management services <b>502</b> and/or the gateway service <b>506</b> may alternatively be located outside the cloud computing environment <b>512</b>, such as within a data center hosted by an organization.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">For any of the illustrated components (other than the client <b>202</b>) that are not based within the cloud computing environment <b>512</b>, cloud connectors (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>) may be used to interface those components with the cloud computing environment <b>512</b>. Such cloud connectors may, for example, run on Windows Server instances and/or Linux Server instances hosted in resource locations and may create a reverse proxy to route traffic between those resource locations and the cloud computing environment <b>512</b>. In the illustrated example, the cloud-based resource management services <b>502</b> include a client interface service <b>514</b>, an identity service <b>516</b>, a resource feed service <b>518</b>, and a single sign-on service <b>520</b>. As shown, in some embodiments, the client <b>202</b> may use a resource access application <b>522</b> to communicate with the client interface service <b>514</b> as well as to present a user interface on the client <b>202</b> that a user <b>524</b> can operate to access the resource feed(s) <b>504</b> and/or the SaaS application(s) <b>508</b>. The resource access application <b>522</b> may either be installed on the client <b>202</b>, or may be executed by the client interface service <b>514</b> (or elsewhere in the multi-resource access system <b>500</b>) and accessed using a web browser (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>) on the client <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">As explained in more detail below, in some embodiments, the resource access application <b>522</b> and associated components may provide the user <b>524</b> with a personalized, all-in-one interface enabling instant and seamless access to all the user's SaaS and web applications, files, virtual Windows applications, virtual Linux applications, desktops, mobile applications, Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops&#x2122;, local applications, and other data.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">When the resource access application <b>522</b> is launched or otherwise accessed by the user <b>524</b>, the client interface service <b>514</b> may send a sign-on request to the identity service <b>516</b>. In some embodiments, the identity provider <b>510</b> may be located on the premises of the organization for which the multi-resource access system <b>500</b> is deployed. The identity provider <b>510</b> may, for example, correspond to an on-premises Windows Active Directory. In such embodiments, the identity provider <b>510</b> may be connected to the cloud-based identity service <b>516</b> using a cloud connector (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>), as described above. Upon receiving a sign-on request, the identity service <b>516</b> may cause the resource access application <b>522</b> (via the client interface service <b>514</b>) to prompt the user <b>524</b> for the user's authentication credentials (e.g., user-name and password). Upon receiving the user's authentication credentials, the client interface service <b>514</b> may pass the credentials along to the identity service <b>516</b>, and the identity service <b>516</b> may, in turn, forward them to the identity provider <b>510</b> for authentication, for example, by comparing them against an Active Directory domain. Once the identity service <b>516</b> receives confirmation from the identity provider <b>510</b> that the user's identity has been properly authenticated, the client interface service <b>514</b> may send a request to the resource feed service <b>518</b> for a list of subscribed resources for the user <b>524</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In other embodiments (not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>), the identity provider <b>510</b> may be a cloud-based identity service, such as a Microsoft Azure Active Directory. In such embodiments, upon receiving a sign-on request from the client interface service <b>514</b>, the identity service <b>516</b> may, via the client interface service <b>514</b>, cause the client <b>202</b> to be redirected to the cloud-based identity service to complete an authentication process. The cloud-based identity service may then cause the client <b>202</b> to prompt the user <b>524</b> to enter the user's authentication credentials. Upon determining the user's identity has been properly authenticated, the cloud-based identity service may send a message to the resource access application <b>522</b> indicating the authentication attempt was successful, and the resource access application <b>522</b> may then inform the client interface service <b>514</b> of the successfully authentication. Once the identity service <b>516</b> receives confirmation from the client interface service <b>514</b> that the user's identity has been properly authenticated, the client interface service <b>514</b> may send a request to the resource feed service <b>518</b> for a list of subscribed resources for the user <b>524</b>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The resource feed service <b>518</b> may request identity tokens for configured resources from the single sign-on service <b>520</b>. The resource feed service <b>518</b> may then pass the feed-specific identity tokens it receives to the points of authentication for the respective resource feeds <b>504</b>. The resource feeds <b>504</b> may then respond with lists of resources configured for the respective identities. The resource feed service <b>518</b> may then aggregate all items from the different feeds and forward them to the client interface service <b>514</b>, which may cause the resource access application <b>522</b> to present a list of available resources on a user interface of the client <b>202</b>. The list of available resources may, for example, be presented on the user interface of the client <b>202</b> as a set of selectable icons or other elements corresponding to accessible resources. The resources so identified may, for example, include one or more virtual applications and/or desktops (e.g., Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops&#x2122;, VMware Horizon, Microsoft RDS, etc.), one or more file repositories and/or file sharing systems (e.g., Sharefile&#xae;, one or more secure browsers, one or more internet enabled devices or sensors, one or more local applications installed on the client <b>202</b>, and/or one or more SaaS applications <b>508</b> to which the user <b>524</b> has subscribed. The lists of local applications and the SaaS applications <b>508</b> may, for example, be supplied by resource feeds <b>504</b> for respective services that manage which such applications are to be made available to the user <b>524</b> via the resource access application <b>522</b>. Examples of SaaS applications <b>508</b> that may be managed and accessed as described herein include Microsoft Office 365 applications, SAP SaaS applications, Workday applications, etc.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">For resources other than local applications and the SaaS application(s) <b>508</b>, upon the user <b>524</b> selecting one of the listed available resources, the resource access application <b>522</b> may cause the client interface service <b>514</b> to forward a request for the specified resource to the resource feed service <b>518</b>. In response to receiving such a request, the resource feed service <b>518</b> may request an identity token for the corresponding feed from the single sign-on service <b>520</b>. The resource feed service <b>518</b> may then pass the identity token received from the single sign-on service <b>520</b> to the client interface service <b>514</b> where a launch ticket for the resource may be generated and sent to the resource access application <b>522</b>. Upon receiving the launch ticket, the resource access application <b>522</b> may initiate a secure session to the gateway service <b>506</b> and present the launch ticket. When the gateway service <b>506</b> is presented with the launch ticket, it may initiate a secure session to the appropriate resource feed and present the identity token to that feed to seamlessly authenticate the user <b>524</b>. Once the session initializes, the client <b>202</b> may proceed to access the selected resource.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">When the user <b>524</b> selects a local application, the resource access application <b>522</b> may cause the selected local application to launch on the client <b>202</b>. When the user <b>524</b> selects a SaaS application <b>508</b>, the resource access application <b>522</b> may cause the client interface service <b>514</b> to request a one-time uniform resource locator (URL) from the gateway service <b>506</b> as well a preferred browser for use in accessing the SaaS application <b>508</b>. After the gateway service <b>506</b> returns the one-time URL and identifies the preferred browser, the client interface service <b>514</b> may pass that information along to the resource access application <b>522</b>. The client <b>202</b> may then launch the identified browser and initiate a connection to the gateway service <b>506</b>. The gateway service <b>506</b> may then request an assertion from the single sign-on service <b>520</b>. Upon receiving the assertion, the gateway service <b>506</b> may cause the identified browser on the client <b>202</b> to be redirected to the logon page for identified SaaS application <b>508</b> and present the assertion. The SaaS may then contact the gateway service <b>506</b> to validate the assertion and authenticate the user <b>524</b>. Once the user has been authenticated, communication may occur directly between the identified browser and the selected SaaS application <b>508</b>, thus allowing the user <b>524</b> to use the client <b>202</b> to access the selected SaaS application <b>508</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, the preferred browser identified by the gateway service <b>506</b> may be a specialized browser embedded in the resource access application <b>522</b> (when the resource application is installed on the client <b>202</b>) or provided by one of the resource feeds <b>504</b> (when the resource access application <b>522</b> is located remotely), e.g., via a secure browser service. In such embodiments, the SaaS applications <b>508</b> may incorporate enhanced security policies to enforce one or more restrictions on the embedded browser. Examples of such policies include (1) requiring use of the specialized browser and disabling use of other local browsers, (2) restricting clipboard access, e.g., by disabling cut/copy/paste operations between the application and the clipboard, (3) restricting printing, e.g., by disabling the ability to print from within the browser, (3) restricting navigation, e.g., by disabling the next and/or back browser buttons, (4) restricting downloads, e.g., by disabling the ability to download from within the SaaS application, and (5) displaying watermarks, e.g., by overlaying a screen-based watermark showing the username and IP address associated with the client <b>202</b> such that the watermark will appear as displayed on the screen if the user tries to print or take a screenshot. Further, in some embodiments, when a user selects a hyperlink within a SaaS application, the specialized browser may send the URL for the link to an access control service (e.g., implemented as one of the resource feed(s) <b>504</b>) for assessment of its security risk by a web filtering service. For approved URLs, the specialized browser may be permitted to access the link. For suspicious links, however, the web filtering service may have the client interface service <b>514</b> send the link to a secure browser service, which may start a new virtual browser session with the client <b>202</b>, and thus allow the user to access the potentially harmful linked content in a safe environment.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some embodiments, in addition to or in lieu of providing the user <b>524</b> with a list of resources that are available to be accessed individually, as described above, the user <b>524</b> may instead be permitted to choose to access a streamlined feed of event notifications and/or available actions that may be taken with respect to events that are automatically detected with respect to one or more of the resources. This streamlined resource activity feed, which may be customized for individual users, may allow users to monitor important activity involving all of their resources&#x2014;SaaS applications, web applications, Windows applications, Linux applications, desktops, file repositories and/or file sharing systems, and other data through a single interface, without needing to switch context from one resource to another. Further, event notifications in a resource activity feed may be accompanied by a discrete set of user interface elements, e.g., &#x201c;approve,&#x201d; &#x201c;deny,&#x201d; and &#x201c;see more detail&#x201d; buttons, allowing a user to take one or more simple actions with respect to events right within the user's feed. In some embodiments, such a streamlined, intelligent resource activity feed may be enabled by one or more micro-applications, or &#x201c;microapps,&#x201d; that can interface with underlying associated resources using APIs or the like. The responsive actions may be user-initiated activities that are taken within the microapps and that provide inputs to the underlying applications through the API or other interface. The actions a user performs within the microapp may, for example, be designed to address specific common problems and use cases quickly and easily, adding to increased user productivity (e.g., request personal time off, submit a help desk ticket, etc.). In some embodiments, notifications from such event-driven microapps may additionally or alternatively be pushed to clients <b>202</b> to notify a user <b>524</b> of something that requires the user's attention (e.g., approval of an expense report, new course available for registration, etc.).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> is a block diagram similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> but in which the available resources (e.g., SaaS applications, web applications, Windows applications, Linux applications, desktops, file repositories and/or file sharing systems, and other data) are represented by a single box <b>526</b> labeled &#x201c;systems of record,&#x201d; and further in which several different services are included within the resource management services block <b>502</b>.

Microapps may, for example, utilize APIs available within SaaS, web, or home-grown applications allowing users to see content without needing a full launch of the application or the need to switch context. Absent such microapps, users would need to launch an application, navigate to the action they need to perform, and then perform the action. Microapps may streamline routine tasks for frequently performed actions and provide users the ability to perform actions within the resource access application <b>522</b> without having to launch the native application. The system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> may, for example, aggregate relevant notifications, tasks, and insights, and thereby give the user <b>524</b> a dynamic productivity tool. In some embodiments, the resource activity feed may be intelligently populated by utilizing machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Further, in some implementations, microapps may be configured within the cloud computing environment <b>512</b>, thus giving administrators a powerful tool to create more productive workflows, without the need for additional infrastructure. Whether pushed to a user or initiated by a user, microapps may provide short cuts that simplify and streamline key tasks that would otherwise require opening full enterprise applications. In some embodiments, out-of-the-box templates may allow administrators with API account permissions to build microapp solutions targeted for their needs.

Connectors with out-of-the-box templates for several applications may be provided and integration with other applications may additionally or alternatively be configured through a microapp page builder. Such a microapp page builder may, for example, connect to legacy, on-premises, and SaaS systems by creating streamlined user workflows via microapp actions. The resource management services <b>502</b>, and in particular the data integration provider service <b>530</b>, may, for example, support REST API, JSON, OData-JSON, and 6ML.

In accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure, the user <b>524</b> may assign a priority level to the keywords, and the computing system <b>106</b> may determine an order in which to present notifications <b>546</b> based on the assigned priority level.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an example routine <b>600</b> that may be executed by the computing system <b>106</b>, which may correspond to one or more components of the resource management services <b>502</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref>, to implement the foregoing functionality in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, at a step <b>702</b>, the computing system <b>106</b> may process user historical data for the user <b>524</b>. The user historical data may, for example, include data representing past notifications <b>546</b> presented to the user <b>524</b> via the resource access application <b>522</b>. Such data for individual notifications <b>546</b> may, for example, include a time the notification <b>546</b> was presented, an application/resource corresponding to the notification <b>546</b>, and a description of the occurred event (i.e. the notification body). In some implementations, the user historical data may also include data indicating the user's <b>524</b> interaction with the notifications <b>546</b>. Such data may, for example, indicate a time the user <b>524</b> interacted with the notification <b>546</b> and/or the type of interaction/action the user <b>524</b> performed (e.g., opened the notification <b>546</b> to receive more information, dismissed/deleted the notification <b>546</b>, etc.). In some implementations, the computing system <b>106</b> may process the user historical data using one or more machine learning models.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">At a step <b>704</b>, the computing system <b>106</b> may determine recommended keywords using the user historical data. The computing system <b>106</b> may use one or more techniques to determine the keywords from at least the data representing the past notifications <b>546</b> presented to the user <b>524</b>. In an example embodiment, the computing system <b>106</b> may use a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique to derive keywords from the past notifications <b>546</b>. Other techniques may involve determining a word (e.g., a noun) as being a keyword based on how often the word appears in the past notifications <b>546</b>. Another technique may involve using the data indicating the user's interaction with the past notifications <b>546</b> to determine keywords. For example, the recommended keywords may be a word(s) from the past notifications <b>546</b> that the user <b>524</b> opens within a duration of time of being presented (e.g., the user <b>524</b> opens the notification <b>546</b> within 1 minute (5 minutes, 10 minutes, etc.) of the notification <b>546</b> being presented). Thus, the recommended keywords may be derived from past notifications <b>546</b> that the user <b>524</b> may consider as important/urgent and interacts with quickly. Another technique may involve filtering out past notifications <b>546</b> that the user <b>524</b> dismisses/deletes (as determined using the data indicating the user's interaction with the past notifications <b>546</b>), and determining the recommended keywords using the remaining past notifications <b>546</b>, thus, the recommended keywords are not related to notifications <b>546</b> that the user <b>524</b> does not consider important.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, at a step <b>608</b> of the routine <b>600</b>, the computing system <b>106</b> may present the recommended keywords at the client device <b>202</b>, for example, via the user interface element <b>160</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> (under the keywords list <b>162</b>).

One technique involves using one or more machine learning models that generate a vector representation for a word (e.g., a word embedding). In some implementations, the computing system <b>106</b> may use a word2vec technique that generates a 300-dimension word vector for a word. The computing system <b>106</b> may generate a word vector for each word in the notification <b>546</b> (e.g., words in the notification body, the application/resource name, and other words), and the word vector data corresponding to the generated notification <b>546</b> may be a set of word vectors.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">At a step <b>806</b>, the computing system <b>106</b> may determine word vector data corresponding to each keyword selected by the user <b>524</b>.

In other implementations, other techniques may be used to obtain inputs from the user <b>524</b> to customize the order in which notifications <b>546</b> are presented. For example, instead of the user <b>524</b> assigning a priority level to a keyword (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>), the user <b>524</b> may rank the selected keywords to indicate the order in which notifications <b>546</b> are to be presented. That is, the user <b>524</b> may create an ordered/ranked list of keywords, where the first keyword in the list may have &#x201c;1<sup>st </sup>rank&#x201d;, the second keyword in the list may have &#x201c;2<sup>nd </sup>rank&#x201d;, etc. Such ranks may not be explicitly indicated, but may be derived by the computing system <b>106</b> in determining the order in which notifications <b>546</b> are to be presented. In this example, a first notification <b>546</b> relating to the first keyword may be presented in the activity feed <b>544</b> before a second notification <b>546</b> relating to the second keyword, based on the order/ranking of the first and second keywords in the list of keywords.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In presenting the notifications <b>546</b> at the client device <b>202</b>, the computing system <b>106</b> may cause the resource access application <b>522</b> to update the activity feed <b>544</b>. For example, the activity feed <b>544</b> may already present one or more notifications <b>546</b> for previously occurred events, and the computing system <b>106</b> may cause the resource access application <b>522</b> to insert a new notification <b>546</b> in the activity feed <b>544</b> at the appropriate position based on the keyword and priority level relating to the new notification <b>546</b>. In some implementations, the computing system <b>106</b> may store data tracking the keyword and priority level relating to the notification(s) <b>546</b>, if any, already presented in the activity feed <b>544</b>. Such stored data for individual notifications <b>546</b> may be a mapping between the notification <b>546</b> (which may be identified using a notification id), the keyword and the priority level. For example, the stored data may be {first notification id-&#x3e;first keyword-&#x3e;1<sup>st </sup>priority level}, {second notification id-&#x3e;second keyword-&#x3e;2<sup>nd </sup>priority level}, and so on. Using such stored data, the computing system <b>106</b> can cause insertion of a new notification <b>546</b> in the activity feed <b>544</b> at the appropriate position. For example, if the new notification <b>546</b> relates to the first keyword assigned the 1<sup>st </sup>priority level, then using the stored data (tracking the already presented notifications) the new notification <b>546</b> may be inserted after the first notification <b>546</b> and before the second notification <b>546</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In some implementations, the computing system <b>106</b> may employ one or more techniques to resolve conflicts in determining the order in which the notifications <b>546</b> are presented. For example, there may be a first notification <b>546</b> relating to a keyword with a 1<sup>st </sup>priority level, and a second notification <b>546</b> relating to the same keyword with the 1<sup>st </sup>priority level. The computing system <b>106</b>, in some implementations, may determine to present the first notification <b>546</b> before the second notification <b>546</b> based on the time that the respective events occurred (i.e., a first event corresponding to the first notification <b>546</b> occurred before a second event corresponding to the second notification <b>546</b>). Alternatively, the computing system <b>106</b> may determine to present the first notification <b>546</b> after the second notification <b>546</b>, thus, presenting the most recently occurred event at the top of the activity feed <b>544</b>. Other techniques may involve alphabetically ordering notifications <b>546</b> relating to the same keyword, for example, based on the notification body or based on the application/resource name.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0000">G.
