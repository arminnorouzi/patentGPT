In addition, under an action of horizontal vibration, the effect of reciprocating rolling is formed in the plastic deformation zone, and the bidirectional shear force is applied to the composite layer, which accelerates the diffusion of atoms at the cladding interface and strengthens the physical bonding of the cladding interface, thereby producing the metal clad plate with high cladding strength.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The above embodiments are not limited to the technical solutions of the embodiments themselves, and the embodiments are able to be combined with each other to form new embodiments.
