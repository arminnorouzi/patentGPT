In case of polygonal-shaped weakening cavities <b>104</b>, the weakening portions of the polygonal-shaped weakening cavities <b>104</b> are corners <b>116</b> because the corners <b>116</b> of the weakening cavities <b>104</b> are sharper than other portions of the weakening cavities <b>104</b>, such as a straight line portion between the two corners, and under the same stress condition, the corners <b>116</b> are more concentrated in stress than the other portions (specifically, a stress concentration point is located at a vertex of the corner <b>116</b>) and are more easily torn off. For example, for diamond-shaped weakening cavities <b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, the four corners <b>116</b> of the weakening hole <b>104</b> are weakening portions. For triangular shaped weakening cavities <b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, the three corners <b>116</b> of the weakening hole <b>104</b> are weakening portions.
