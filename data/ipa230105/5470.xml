id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for responding to a user query based on captured images and audio. An audio signal captured by at least one microphone is analyzed to determine at least one word. At least one image captured by at least one image sensor is analyzed to determine at least one identifier of at least one of a person, an object, a location, or an event represented in the image. The at least one word and the at least one identifier are stored in a database. A question is received from the user and is analyzed to determine at least one term. The database is searched to determine a correlation between the at least one term and the at least one word or between the at least one term and the at least one identifier. A response to the question is generated based on the correlation and is provided to the user.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000"

Certain devices have been used to digitally record aspects and personal experiences of one's life in an exercise typically called &#x201c;lifelogging.&#x201d; Some individuals log their life so they can retrieve moments from past activities, for example, social events, trips, etc. Lifelogging may also have significant benefits in other fields (e.g., business, fitness and healthcare, and social research). Lifelogging devices, while useful for tracking daily activities, may be improved with capability to enhance one's interaction in his environment with feedback and other advanced functionality based on the analysis of captured image and audio data.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Even though users can capture images and audio with their smartphones and some smartphone applications can process the captured information, smartphones may not be the best platform for serving as lifelogging apparatuses in view of their size and design. Lifelogging apparatuses should be small and light, so they can be easily worn. Moreover, with improvements in image capture devices, including wearable apparatuses, additional functionality may be provided to assist users in navigating in and around an environment, identifying persons and objects they encounter, and providing feedback to the users about their surroundings and activities. Therefore, there is a need for apparatuses and methods for automatically capturing and processing images and audio to provide useful information to users of the apparatuses, and for systems and methods to process and leverage information gathered by the apparatuses.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments consistent with the present disclosure provide devices and methods for automatically capturing and processing images and audio from an environment of a user, and systems and methods for processing information related to images and audio captured from the environment of the user.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an embodiment, a system for responding to a user query based on captured images and audio includes at least one microphone configured to capture sounds from an environment of a user, at least one image sensor configured to capture a plurality of images from the environment of the user, and at least one processor.

The term &#x201c;extracting information&#x201d; includes any process by which information associated with objects, individuals, locations, events, etc., is identified in the captured image data by any means known to those of ordinary skill in the art. In some embodiments, apparatus <b>110</b> may use the extracted information to send feedback or other real-time indications to feedback outputting unit <b>230</b> or to computing device <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may identify in the image data the individual standing in front of user <b>100</b> and send computing device <b>120</b> the name of the individual and the last time user <b>100</b> met the individual. In another embodiment, processor <b>210</b> may identify in the image data, one or more visible triggers, including a hand-related trigger, and determine whether the trigger is associated with a person other than the user of the wearable apparatus to selectively determine whether to perform an action associated with the trigger. One such action may be to provide feedback to user <b>100</b> via feedback-outputting unit <b>230</b> provided as part of (or in communication with) apparatus <b>110</b> or via a feedback unit <b>545</b> provided as part of computing device <b>120</b>. For example, feedback-outputting unit <b>545</b> may be in communication with display <b>260</b> to cause the display <b>260</b> to visibly output information. In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may identify in the image data a hand-related trigger and send computing device <b>120</b> an indication of the trigger. Processor <b>540</b> may then process the received trigger information and provide an output via feedback outputting unit <b>545</b> or display <b>260</b> based on the hand-related trigger. In other embodiments, processor <b>540</b> may determine a hand-related trigger and provide suitable feedback similar to the above, based on image data received from apparatus <b>110</b>.

In some embodiments, after computing device <b>120</b> confirms that transferring the part of image data was successful, processor <b>540</b> may delete the part of the image data. The term &#x201c;delete&#x201d; means that the image is marked as &#x2018;deleted&#x2019; and other image data may be stored instead of it, but does not necessarily mean that the image data was physically removed from the memory.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">As will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art having the benefit of this disclosure, numerous variations and/or modifications may be made to the disclosed embodiments. Not all components are essential for the operation of apparatus <b>110</b>. Any component may be located in any appropriate apparatus and the components may be rearranged into a variety of configurations while providing the functionality of the disclosed embodiments. For example, in some embodiments, apparatus <b>110</b> may include a camera, a processor, and a wireless transceiver for sending data to another device. Therefore, the foregoing configurations are examples and, regardless of the configurations discussed above, apparatus <b>110</b> can capture, store, and/or process images.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Further, the foregoing and following description refers to storing and/or processing images or image data. In the embodiments disclosed herein, the stored and/or processed images or image data may comprise a representation of one or more images captured by image sensor <b>220</b>. As the term is used herein, a &#x201c;representation&#x201d; of an image (or image data) may include an entire image or a portion of an image. A representation of an image (or image data) may have the same resolution or a lower resolution as the image (or image data), and/or a representation of an image (or image data) may be altered in some respect (e.g., be compressed, have a lower resolution, have one or more colors that are altered, etc.).</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">For example, apparatus <b>110</b> may capture an image and store a representation of the image that is compressed as a .JPG file. As another example, apparatus <b>110</b> may capture an image in color, but store a black-and-white representation of the color image. As yet another example, apparatus <b>110</b> may capture an image and store a different representation of the image (e.g., a portion of the image). For example, apparatus <b>110</b> may store a portion of an image that includes a face of a person who appears in the image, but that does not substantially include the environment surrounding the person. Similarly, apparatus <b>110</b> may, for example, store a portion of an image that includes a product that appears in the image, but does not substantially include the environment surrounding the product. As yet another example, apparatus <b>110</b> may store a representation of an image at a reduced resolution (i.e., at a resolution that is of a lower value than that of the captured image). Storing representations of images may allow apparatus <b>110</b> to save storage space in memory <b>550</b>. Furthermore, processing representations of images may allow apparatus <b>110</b> to improve processing efficiency and/or help to preserve battery life.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In addition to the above, in some embodiments, any one of apparatus <b>110</b> or computing device <b>120</b>, via processor <b>210</b> or <b>540</b>, may further process the captured image data to provide additional functionality to recognize objects and/or gestures and/or other information in the captured image data. In some embodiments, actions may be taken based on the identified objects, gestures, or other information. In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> or <b>540</b> may identify in the image data, one or more visible triggers, including a hand-related trigger, and determine whether the trigger is associated with a person other than the user to determine whether to perform an action associated with the trigger.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">Some embodiments of the present disclosure may include an apparatus securable to an article of clothing of a user. Such an apparatus may include two portions, connectable by a connector. A capturing unit may be designed to be worn on the outside of a user's clothing and may include an image sensor for capturing images of a user's environment.

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, orientation adjustment unit <b>705</b> may include an eye-ball type adjustment mechanism. In alternative embodiments, orientation adjustment unit <b>705</b> may include gimbals, adjustable stalks, pivotable mounts, and any other suitable unit for adjusting an orientation of image sensor <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Image sensor <b>220</b> may be configured to be movable with the head of user <b>100</b> in such a manner that an aiming direction of image sensor <b>220</b> substantially coincides with a field of view of user <b>100</b>. For example, as described above, a camera associated with image sensor <b>220</b> may be installed within capturing unit <b>710</b> at a predetermined angle in a position facing slightly upwards or downwards, depending on an intended location of capturing unit <b>710</b>. Accordingly, the set aiming direction of image sensor <b>220</b> may match the field-of-view of user <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may change the orientation of image sensor <b>220</b> using image data provided from image sensor <b>220</b>. For example, processor <b>210</b> may recognize that a user is reading a book and determine that the aiming direction of image sensor <b>220</b> is offset from the text. That is, because the words in the beginning of each line of text are not fully in view, processor <b>210</b> may determine that image sensor <b>220</b> is tilted in the wrong direction. Responsive thereto, processor <b>210</b> may adjust the aiming direction of image sensor <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">Orientation identification module <b>601</b> may be configured to identify an orientation of an image sensor <b>220</b> of capturing unit <b>710</b>. An orientation of an image sensor <b>220</b> may be identified, for example, by analysis of images captured by image sensor <b>220</b> of capturing unit <b>710</b>, by tilt or attitude sensing devices within capturing unit <b>710</b>, and by measuring a relative direction of orientation adjustment unit <b>705</b> with respect to the remainder of capturing unit <b>710</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Orientation adjustment module <b>602</b> may be configured to adjust an orientation of image sensor <b>220</b> of capturing unit <b>710</b>.

Orientation adjustment unit <b>705</b> may be configured for rotational and/or lateral movement in response to commands from orientation adjustment module <b>602</b>. In some embodiments, orientation adjustment unit <b>705</b> may adjust an orientation of image sensor <b>220</b> via motors, electromagnets, permanent magnets, and/or any suitable combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some embodiments, monitoring module <b>603</b> may be provided for continuous monitoring. Such continuous monitoring may include tracking a movement of at least a portion of an object included in one or more images captured by the image sensor. For example, in one embodiment, apparatus <b>110</b> may track an object as long as the object remains substantially within the field-of-view of image sensor <b>220</b>. In additional embodiments, monitoring module <b>603</b> may engage orientation adjustment module <b>602</b> to instruct orientation adjustment unit <b>705</b> to continually orient image sensor <b>220</b> towards an object of interest. For example, in one embodiment, monitoring module <b>603</b> may cause image sensor <b>220</b> to adjust an orientation to ensure that a certain designated object, for example, the face of a particular person, remains within the field-of view of image sensor <b>220</b>, even as that designated object moves about. In another embodiment, monitoring module <b>603</b> may continuously monitor an area of interest included in one or more images captured by the image sensor. For example, a user may be occupied by a certain task, for example, typing on a laptop, while image sensor <b>220</b> remains oriented in a particular direction and continuously monitors a portion of each image from a series of images to detect a trigger or other event. For example, image sensor <b>210</b> may be oriented towards a piece of laboratory equipment and monitoring module <b>603</b> may be configured to monitor a status light on the laboratory equipment for a change in status, while the user's attention is otherwise occupied.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In some embodiments consistent with the present disclosure, capturing unit <b>710</b> may include a plurality of image sensors <b>220</b>.

For example, when a plurality of image sensors <b>220</b> are provided, the image sensors <b>220</b> may capture images having different resolutions, may capture wider or narrower fields of view, and/or may have different levels of magnification. Image sensors <b>220</b> may be provided with varying lenses to permit these different configurations. In some embodiments, a plurality of image sensors <b>220</b> may include image sensors <b>220</b> having different orientations. Thus, each of the plurality of image sensors <b>220</b> may be pointed in a different direction to capture different images.

Apparatus <b>110</b> may be configured to capture one or more images of the surrounding environment of user, for example, using image sensor <b>220</b>. The captured images may include a representation of a chin of user <b>100</b>, which may be used to determine user look direction <b>1750</b>.

Microphone <b>1720</b> may also be configured to determine a directionality of sounds in the environment of user <b>100</b>. For example, microphone <b>1720</b> may comprise one or more directional microphones, which may be more sensitive to picking up sounds in certain directions. For example, microphone <b>1720</b> may comprise a unidirectional microphone, designed to pick up sound from a single direction or small range of directions. Microphone <b>1720</b> may also comprise a cardioid microphone, which may be sensitive to sounds from the front and sides. Microphone <b>1720</b> may also include a microphone array, which may comprise additional microphones, such as microphone <b>1721</b> on the front of apparatus <b>110</b>, or microphone <b>1722</b>, placed on the side of apparatus <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, microphone <b>1720</b> may be a multi-port microphone for capturing multiple audio signals. The microphones shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>B</figref> are by way of example only, and any suitable number, configuration, or location of microphones may be utilized. Processor <b>210</b> may be configured to distinguish sounds within the environment of user <b>100</b> and determine an approximate directionality of each sound. For example, using an array of microphones <b>1720</b>, processor <b>210</b> may compare the relative timing or amplitude of an individual sound among the microphones <b>1720</b> to determine a directionality relative to apparatus <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">As a preliminary step before other audio analysis operations, the sound captured from an environment of a user may be classified using any audio classification technique. For example, the sound may be classified into segments containing music, tones, laughter, screams, or the like. Indications of the respective segments may be logged in a database and may prove highly useful for life logging applications. As one example, the logged information may enable the system to retrieve and/or determine a mood when the user met another person. Additionally, such processing is relatively fast and efficient, and does not require significant computing resources, and transmitting the information to a destination does not require significant bandwidth. Moreover, once certain parts of the audio are classified as non-speech, more computing resources may be available for processing the other segments.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">Based on the determined user look direction <b>1750</b>, processor <b>210</b> may selectively condition or amplify sounds from a region associated with user look direction <b>1750</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a schematic illustration showing an exemplary environment for use of a camera-based hearing aid consistent with the present disclosure. Microphone <b>1720</b> may detect one or more sounds <b>1820</b>, <b>1821</b>, and <b>1822</b> within the environment of user <b>100</b>. Based on user look direction <b>1750</b>, determined by processor <b>210</b>, a region <b>1830</b> associated with user look direction <b>1750</b> may be determined. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, region <b>1830</b> may be defined by a cone or range of directions based on user look direction <b>1750</b>. The range of angles may be defined by an angle, &#x3b8;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>. The angle, &#x3b8;, may be any suitable angle for defining a range for conditioning sounds within the environment of user <b>100</b> (e.g., 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 45 degrees).</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Processor <b>210</b> may be configured to cause selective conditioning of sounds in the environment of user <b>100</b> based on region <b>1830</b>. The conditioned audio signal may be transmitted to hearing interface device <b>1710</b>, and thus may provide user <b>100</b> with audible feedback corresponding to the look direction of the user. For example, processor <b>210</b> may determine that sound <b>1820</b> (which may correspond to the voice of an individual <b>1810</b>, or to noise for example) is within region <b>1830</b>. Processor <b>210</b> may then perform various conditioning techniques on the audio signals received from microphone <b>1720</b>. The conditioning may include amplifying audio signals determined to correspond to sound <b>1820</b> relative to other audio signals. Amplification may be accomplished digitally, for example by processing audio signals associated with <b>1820</b> relative to other signals Amplification may also be accomplished by changing one or more parameters of microphone <b>1720</b> to focus on audio sounds emanating from region <b>1830</b> (e.g., a region of interest) associated with user look direction <b>1750</b>. For example, microphone <b>1720</b> may be a directional microphone and processor <b>210</b> may perform an operation to focus microphone <b>1720</b> on sound <b>1820</b> or other sounds within region <b>1830</b>. Various other techniques for amplifying sound <b>1820</b> may be used, such as using a beamforming microphone array, acoustic telescope techniques, etc.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Conditioning may also include attenuation or suppressing one or more audio signals received from directions outside of region <b>1830</b>. For example, processor <b>1820</b> may attenuate sounds <b>1821</b> and <b>1822</b>. Similar to amplification of sound <b>1820</b>, attenuation of sounds may occur through processing audio signals, or by varying one or more parameters associated with one or more microphones <b>1720</b> to direct focus away from sounds emanating from outside of region <b>1830</b>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In some embodiments, conditioning may further include changing a tone of audio signals corresponding to sound <b>1820</b> to make sound <b>1820</b> more perceptible to user <b>100</b>. For example, user <b>100</b> may have lesser sensitivity to tones in a certain range and conditioning of the audio signals may adjust the pitch of sound <b>1820</b> to make it more perceptible to user <b>100</b>. For example, user <b>100</b> may experience hearing loss in frequencies above 10 kHz. Accordingly, processor <b>210</b> may remap higher frequencies (e.g., at 15 kHz) to 10 kHz. In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may be configured to change a rate of speech associated with one or more audio signals. Accordingly, processor <b>210</b> may be configured to detect speech within one or more audio signals received by microphone <b>1720</b>, for example using voice activity detection (VAD) algorithms or techniques. If sound <b>1820</b> is determined to correspond to voice or speech, for example from individual <b>1810</b>, processor <b>220</b> may be configured to vary the playback rate of sound <b>1820</b>. For example, the rate of speech of individual <b>1810</b> may be decreased to make the detected speech more perceptible to user <b>100</b>. Various other processing may be performed, such as modifying the tone of sound <b>1820</b> to maintain the same pitch as the original audio signal, or to reduce noise within the audio signal. If speech recognition has been performed on the audio signal associated with sound <b>1820</b>, conditioning may further include modifying the audio signal based on the detected speech. For example, processor <b>210</b> may introduce pauses or increase the duration of pauses between words and/or sentences, which may make the speech easier to understand.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">The conditioned audio signal may then be transmitted to hearing interface device <b>1710</b> and produced for user <b>100</b>. Thus, in the conditioned audio signal, sound <b>1820</b> may be easier to hear to user <b>100</b>, louder and/or more easily distinguishable than sounds <b>1821</b> and <b>1822</b>, which may represent background noise within the environment.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a flowchart showing an exemplary process <b>1900</b> for selectively amplifying sounds emanating from a detected look direction of a user consistent with disclosed embodiments.

The range may be associated with an angular width about the look direction (e.g., 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 45 degrees, etc.). Various forms of conditioning may be performed on the audio signal, as discussed above. In some embodiments, conditioning may include changing the tone or playback speed of an audio signal. For example, conditioning may include changing a rate of speech associated with the audio signal. In some embodiments, the conditioning may include amplification of the audio signal relative to other audio signals received from outside of the region associated with the look direction of the user. Amplification may be performed by various means, such as operation of a directional microphone configured to focus on audio sounds emanating from the region or varying one or more parameters associated with the microphone to cause the microphone to focus on audio sounds emanating from the region. The amplification may include attenuating or suppressing one or more audio signals received by the microphone from directions outside the region associated with the look direction of user <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">In step <b>1918</b>, process <b>1900</b> may include causing transmission of the at least one conditioned audio signal to a hearing interface device configured to provide sound to an ear of the user.

The processor performing process <b>1900</b> may further be configured to cause transmission to the hearing interface device of one or more audio signals representative of background noise, which may be attenuated relative to the at least one conditioned audio signal.

Components <b>2040</b> and <b>2041</b> may contain software instructions for execution by at least one processing device, e.g., processor <b>210</b>, included with a wearable apparatus. Components <b>2040</b> and <b>2041</b> are shown within memory <b>550</b> by way of example only and may be located in other locations within the system. For example, components <b>2040</b> and <b>2041</b> may be located in hearing interface device <b>1710</b>, in computing device <b>120</b>, on a remote server, or in another associated device.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0157">Facial recognition component <b>2040</b> may be configured to identify one or more faces within the environment of user <b>100</b>. For example, facial recognition component <b>2040</b> may identify facial features on the face <b>2011</b> of individual <b>2010</b>, such as the eyes, nose, cheekbones, jaw, or other features. Facial recognition component <b>2040</b> may then analyze the relative size and position of these features to identify the user. Facial recognition component <b>2040</b> may utilize one or more algorithms for analyzing the detected features, such as principal component analysis (e.g., using eigenfaces), linear discriminant analysis, elastic bunch graph matching (e.g., using Fisherface), Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH), Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), Speed Up Robust Features (SURF), or the like. Other facial recognition techniques such as 3-Dimensional recognition, skin texture analysis, and/or thermal imaging may also be used to identify individuals. Other features besides facial features may also be used for identification, such as the height, body shape, or other distinguishing features of individual <b>2010</b>.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0158">Facial recognition component <b>2040</b> may access a database or data associated with user <b>100</b> to determine if the detected facial features correspond to a recognized individual. For example, a processor <b>210</b> may access a database <b>2050</b> containing information about individuals known to user <b>100</b> and data representing associated facial features or other identifying features. Such data may include one or more images of the individuals, or data representative of a face of the user that may be used for identification through facial recognition. Database <b>2050</b> may be any device capable of storing information about one or more individuals, and may include a hard drive, a solid state drive, a web storage platform, a remote server, or the like. Database <b>2050</b> may be located within apparatus <b>110</b> (e.g., within memory <b>550</b>) or external to apparatus <b>110</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>. In some embodiments, database <b>2050</b> may be associated with a social network platform, such as Facebook&#x2122;, LinkedIn&#x2122;, Instagram&#x2122;, etc. Facial recognition component <b>2040</b> may also access a contact list of user <b>100</b>, such as a contact list on the user's phone, a web-based contact list (e.g., through Outlook&#x2122;, Skype&#x2122;, Google&#x2122;, SalesForce&#x2122;, etc.) or a dedicated contact list associated with hearing interface device <b>1710</b>. In some embodiments, database <b>2050</b> may be compiled by apparatus <b>110</b> through previous facial recognition analysis. For example, processor <b>210</b> may be configured to store data associated with one or more faces recognized in images captured by apparatus <b>110</b> in database <b>2050</b>. Each time a face is detected in the images, the detected facial features or other data may be compared to previously identified faces in database <b>2050</b>. Facial recognition component <b>2040</b> may determine that an individual is a recognized individual of user <b>100</b> if the individual has previously been recognized by the system in a number of instances exceeding a certain threshold, if the individual has been explicitly introduced to apparatus <b>110</b>, or the like.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">In some embodiments, user <b>100</b> may have access to database <b>2050</b>, such as through a web interface, an application on a mobile device, or through apparatus <b>110</b> or an associated device. For example, user <b>100</b> may be able to select which contacts are recognizable by apparatus <b>110</b> and/or delete or add certain contacts manually. In some embodiments, a user or administrator may be able to train facial recognition component <b>2040</b>. For example, user <b>100</b> may have an option to confirm or reject identifications made by facial recognition component <b>2040</b>, which may improve the accuracy of the system. This training may occur in real time, as individual <b>2010</b> is being recognized, or at some later time.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">Other data or information may also inform the facial identification process. In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may use various techniques to recognize the voice of individual <b>2010</b>, as described in further detail below. The recognized voice pattern and the detected facial features may be used, either alone or in combination, to determine that individual <b>2010</b> is recognized by apparatus <b>110</b>. Processor <b>210</b> may also determine a user look direction <b>1750</b>, as described above, which may be used to verify the identity of individual <b>2010</b>. For example, if user <b>100</b> is looking in the direction of individual <b>2010</b> (especially for a prolonged period), this may indicate that individual <b>2010</b> is recognized by user <b>100</b>, which may be used to increase the confidence of facial recognition component <b>2040</b> or other identification means.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0161">Processor <b>210</b> may further be configured to determine whether individual <b>2010</b> is recognized by user <b>100</b> based on one or more detected audio characteristics of sounds associated with a voice of individual <b>2010</b>. Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>, processor <b>210</b> may determine that sound <b>2020</b> corresponds to voice <b>2012</b> of user <b>2010</b>. Processor <b>210</b> may analyze audio signals representative of sound <b>2020</b> captured by microphone <b>1720</b> to determine whether individual <b>2010</b> is recognized by user <b>100</b>. This may be performed using voice recognition component <b>2041</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>) and may include one or more voice recognition algorithms, such as Hidden Markov Models, Dynamic Time Warping, neural networks, or other techniques. Voice recognition component and/or processor <b>210</b> may access database <b>2050</b>, which may further include a voiceprint of one or more individuals. Voice recognition component <b>2041</b> may analyze the audio signal representative of sound <b>2020</b> to determine whether voice <b>2012</b> matches a voiceprint of an individual in database <b>2050</b>. Accordingly, database <b>2050</b> may contain voiceprint data associated with a number of individuals, similar to the stored facial identification data described above. After determining a match, individual <b>2010</b> may be determined to be a recognized individual of user <b>100</b>. This process may be used alone, or in conjunction with the facial recognition techniques described above. For example, individual <b>2010</b> may be recognized using facial recognition component <b>2040</b> and may be verified using voice recognition component <b>2041</b>, or vice versa.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0162">In some embodiments, apparatus <b>110</b> may detect the voice of an individual that is not within the field of view of apparatus <b>110</b>. For example, the voice may be heard over a speakerphone, from a back seat, or the like. In such embodiments, recognition of an individual may be based on the voice of the individual only, in the absence of a speaker in the field of view. Processor <b>110</b> may analyze the voice of the individual as described above, for example, by determining whether the detected voice matches a voiceprint of an individual in database <b>2050</b>.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0163">After determining that individual <b>2010</b> is a recognized individual of user <b>100</b>, processor <b>210</b> may cause selective conditioning of audio associated with the recognized individual. The conditioned audio signal may be transmitted to hearing interface device <b>1710</b>, and thus may provide user <b>100</b> with audio conditioned based on the recognized individual. For example, the conditioning may include amplifying audio signals determined to correspond to sound <b>2020</b> (which may correspond to voice <b>2012</b> of individual <b>2010</b>) relative to other audio signals. In some embodiments, amplification may be accomplished digitally, for example by processing audio signals associated with sound <b>2020</b> relative to other signals. Additionally, or alternatively, amplification may be accomplished by changing one or more parameters of microphone <b>1720</b> to focus on audio sounds associated with individual <b>2010</b>. For example, microphone <b>1720</b> may be a directional microphone and processor <b>210</b> may perform an operation to focus microphone <b>1720</b> on sound <b>2020</b>. Various other techniques for amplifying sound <b>2020</b> may be used, such as using a beamforming microphone array, acoustic telescope techniques, etc.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0164">In some embodiments, selective conditioning may include attenuation or suppressing one or more audio signals received from directions not associated with individual <b>2010</b>. For example, processor <b>210</b> may attenuate sounds <b>2021</b> and/or <b>2022</b>. Similar to amplification of sound <b>2020</b>, attenuation of sounds may occur through processing audio signals, or by varying one or more parameters associated with microphone <b>1720</b> to direct focus away from sounds not associated with individual <b>2010</b>.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0165">Selective conditioning may further include determining whether individual <b>2010</b> is speaking. For example, processor <b>210</b> may be configured to analyze images or videos containing representations of individual <b>2010</b> to determine when individual <b>2010</b> is speaking, for example, based on detected movement of the recognized individual's lips. This may also be determined through analysis of audio signals received by microphone <b>1720</b>, for example by detecting the voice <b>2012</b> of individual <b>2010</b>. In some embodiments, the selective conditioning may occur dynamically (initiated and/or terminated) based on whether or not the recognized individual is speaking.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0166">In some embodiments, conditioning may further include changing a tone of one or more audio signals corresponding to sound <b>2020</b> to make the sound more perceptible to user <b>100</b>. For example, user <b>100</b> may have lesser sensitivity to tones in a certain range and conditioning of the audio signals may adjust the pitch of sound <b>2020</b>. In some embodiments processor <b>210</b> may be configured to change a rate of speech associated with one or more audio signals. For example, sound <b>2020</b> may be determined to correspond to voice <b>2012</b> of individual <b>2010</b>. Processor <b>210</b> may be configured to vary the rate of speech of individual <b>2010</b> to make the detected speech more perceptible to user <b>100</b>. Various other processing may be performed, such as modifying the tone of sound <b>2020</b> to maintain the same pitch as the original audio signal, or to reduce noise within the audio signal.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0167">In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may determine a region <b>2030</b> associated with individual <b>2010</b>. Region <b>2030</b> may be associated with a direction of individual <b>2010</b> relative to apparatus <b>110</b> or user <b>100</b>. The direction of individual <b>2010</b> may be determined using camera <b>1730</b> and/or microphone <b>1720</b> using the methods described above. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>, region <b>2030</b> may be defined by a cone or range of directions based on a determined direction of individual <b>2010</b>. The range of angles may be defined by an angle, &#x3b8;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>. The angle, &#x3b8;, may be any suitable angle for defining a range for conditioning sounds within the environment of user <b>100</b> (e.g., 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 45 degrees). Region <b>2030</b> may be dynamically calculated as the position of individual <b>2010</b> changes relative to apparatus <b>110</b>. For example, as user <b>100</b> turns, or if individual <b>1020</b> moves within the environment, processor <b>210</b> may be configured to track individual <b>2010</b> within the environment and dynamically update region <b>2030</b>. Region <b>2030</b> may be used for selective conditioning, for example by amplifying sounds associated with region <b>2030</b> and/or attenuating sounds determined to be emanating from outside of region <b>2030</b>.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0168">The conditioned audio signal may then be transmitted to hearing interface device <b>1710</b> and produced for user <b>100</b>. Thus, in the conditioned audio signal, sound <b>2020</b> (and specifically voice <b>2012</b>) may be louder and/or more easily distinguishable than sounds <b>2021</b> and <b>2022</b>, which may represent background noise within the environment.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0169">In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may perform further analysis based on captured images or videos to determine how to selectively condition audio signals associated with a recognized individual. In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may analyze the captured images to selectively condition audio associated with one individual relative to others. For example, processor <b>210</b> may determine the direction of a recognized individual relative to the user based on the images and may determine how to selectively condition audio signals associated with the individual based on the direction. If the recognized individual is standing to the front of the user, audio associated with that user may be amplified (or otherwise selectively conditioned) relative to audio associated with an individual standing to the side of the user. Similarly, processor <b>210</b> may selectively condition audio signals associated with an individual based on proximity to the user. Processor <b>210</b> may determine a distance from the user to each individual based on captured images and may selectively condition audio signals associated with the individuals based on the distance. For example, an individual closer to the user may be prioritized higher than an individual that is farther away.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0170">In some embodiments, selective conditioning of audio signals associated with a recognized individual may be based on the identities of individuals within the environment of the user. For example, where multiple individuals are detected in the images, processor <b>210</b> may use one or more facial recognition techniques to identify the individuals, as described above. Audio signals associated with individuals that are known to user <b>100</b> may be selectively amplified or otherwise conditioned to have priority over unknown individuals. For example, processor <b>210</b> may be configured to attenuate or silence audio signals associated with bystanders in the user's environment, such as a noisy office mate, etc. In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may also determine a hierarchy of individuals and give priority based on the relative status of the individuals. This hierarchy may be based on the individual's position within a family or an organization (e.g., a company, sports team, club, etc.) relative to the user. For example, the user's boss may be ranked higher than a co-worker or a member of the maintenance staff and thus may have priority in the selective conditioning process. In some embodiments, the hierarchy may be determined based on a list or database. Individuals recognized by the system may be ranked individually or grouped into tiers of priority. This database may be maintained specifically for this purpose or may be accessed externally. For example, the database may be associated with a social network of the user (e.g., Facebook&#x2122;, LinkedIn&#x2122;, etc.) and individuals may be prioritized based on their grouping or relationship with the user. Individuals identified as &#x201c;close friends&#x201d; or family, for example, may be prioritized over acquaintances of the user.</p><p id="p-0172" num="0171">Selective conditioning may be based on a determined behavior of one or more individuals determined based on the captured images. In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may be configured to determine a look direction of the individuals in the images. Accordingly, the selective conditioning may be based on behavior of the other individuals towards the recognized individual. For example, processor <b>210</b> may selectively condition audio associated with a first individual that one or more other users are looking at. If the attention of the individuals shifts to a second individual, processor <b>210</b> may then switch to selectively condition audio associated with the second user. In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may be configured to selectively condition audio based on whether a recognized individual is speaking to the user or to another individual. For example, when the recognized individual is speaking to the user, the selective conditioning may include amplifying an audio signal associated with the recognized individual relative to other audio signals received from directions outside a region associated with the recognized individual. When the recognized individual is speaking to another individual, the selective conditioning may include attenuating the audio signal relative to other audio signals received from directions outside the region associated with the recognized individual.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0172">In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may have access to one or more voiceprints of individuals, which may facilitate selective conditioning of voice <b>2012</b> of individual <b>2010</b> in relation to other sounds or voices. Having a speaker's voiceprint, and a high quality voiceprint in particular, may provide for fast and efficient speaker separation. A high quality voice print may be collected, for example, when the user speaks alone, preferably in a quiet environment. By having a voiceprint of one or more speakers, it is possible to separate an ongoing voice signal almost in real time, e.g., with a minimal delay, using a sliding time window. The delay may be, for example 10 ms, 20 ms, 30 ms, 50 ms, 100 ms, or the like. Different time windows may be selected, depending on the quality of the voice print, on the quality of the captured audio, the difference in characteristics between the speaker and other speaker(s), the available processing resources, the required separation quality, or the like. In some embodiments, a voice print may be extracted from a segment of a conversation in which an individual speaks alone, and then used for separating the individual's voice later in the conversation, whether the individual's voice is recognized or not.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0173">Separating voices may be performed as follows: spectral features, also referred to as spectral attributes, spectral envelope, or spectrogram may be extracted from a clean audio of a single speaker and fed into a pre-trained first neural network, which generates or updates a signature of the speaker's voice based on the extracted features. The audio may be for example, of one second of clean voice. The output signature may be a vector representing the speaker's voice, such that the distance between the vector and another vector extracted from the voice of the same speaker is typically smaller than the distance between the vector and a vector extracted from the voice of another speaker. The speaker's model may be pre-generated from a captured audio. Alternatively or additionally, the model may be generated after a segment of the audio in which only the speaker speaks, followed by another segment in which the speaker and another speaker (or background noise) is heard, and which it is required to separate.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0174">Then, to separate the speaker's voice from additional speakers or background noise in a noisy audio, a second pre-trained neural network may receive the noisy audio and the speaker's signature, and output an audio (which may also be represented as attributes) of the voice of the speaker as extracted from the noisy audio, separated from the other speech or background noise. It will be appreciated that the same or additional neural networks may be used to separate the voices of multiple speakers. For example, if there are two possible speakers, two neural networks may be activated, each with models of the same noisy output and one of the two speakers. Alternatively, a neural network may receive voice signatures of two or more speakers and may output the voice of each of the speakers separately. Accordingly, the system may generate two or more different audio outputs, each comprising the speech of the respective speaker. In some embodiments, if separation is impossible, the input voice may only be cleaned from background noise.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0175"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is a flowchart showing an exemplary process <b>2100</b> for selectively amplifying audio signals associated with a voice of a recognized individual consistent with disclosed embodiments.

As described above, the region may be determined based on a determined direction of the recognized individual based one or more of the plurality of images or audio signals. The range may be associated with an angular width about the direction of the recognized individual (e.g., 10 degrees, 20 degrees, 45 degrees, etc.).</p><p id="p-0180" num="0179">Various forms of conditioning may be performed on the audio signal, as discussed above. In some embodiments, conditioning may include changing the tone or playback speed of an audio signal. For example, conditioning may include changing a rate of speech associated with the audio signal. In some embodiments, the conditioning may include amplification of the audio signal relative to other audio signals received from outside of the region associated with the recognized individual. Amplification may be performed by various means, such as operation of a directional microphone configured to focus on audio sounds emanating from the region or varying one or more parameters associated with the microphone to cause the microphone to focus on audio sounds emanating from the region. The amplification may include attenuating or suppressing one or more audio signals received by the microphone from directions outside the region. In some embodiments, step <b>2116</b> may further comprise determining, based on analysis of the plurality of images, that the recognized individual is speaking and trigger the selective conditioning based on the determination that the recognized individual is speaking. For example, the determination that the recognized individual is speaking may be based on detected movement of the recognized individual's lips. In some embodiments, selective conditioning may be based on further analysis of the captured images as described above, for example, based on the direction or proximity of the recognized individual, the identity of the recognized individual, the behavior of other individuals, etc.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0180">In step <b>2118</b>, process <b>2100</b> may include causing transmission of the at least one conditioned audio signal to a hearing interface device configured to provide sound to an ear of the user. The conditioned audio signal, for example, may be transmitted to hearing interface device <b>1710</b>, which may provide sound corresponding to the audio signal to user <b>100</b>. The processor performing process <b>2100</b> may further be configured to cause transmission to the hearing interface device of one or more audio signals representative of background noise, which may be attenuated relative to the at least one conditioned audio signal. For example, processor <b>210</b> may be configured to transmit audio signals corresponding to sounds <b>2020</b>, <b>2021</b>, and <b>2022</b>. The signal associated with <b>2020</b>, however, may be amplified in relation to sounds <b>2021</b> and <b>2022</b> based on a determination that sound <b>2020</b> is within region <b>2030</b>. In some embodiments, hearing interface device <b>1710</b> may include a speaker associated with an earpiece.

Hearing interface device may also be external to the ear, such as a behind-the-ear hearing device, one or more headphones, a small portable speaker, or the like. In some embodiments, hearing interface device may include a bone conduction microphone, configured to provide an audio signal to user through vibrations of a bone of the user's head. Such devices may be placed in contact with the exterior of the user's skin or may be implanted surgically and attached to the bone of the user.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0181">In addition to recognizing voices of individuals speaking to user <b>100</b>, the systems and methods described above may also be used to recognize the voice of user <b>100</b>. For example, voice recognition unit <b>2041</b> may be configured to analyze audio signals representative of sounds collected from the user's environment to recognize the voice of user <b>100</b>. Similar to the selective conditioning of the voice of recognized individuals, the voice of user <b>100</b> may be selectively conditioned. For example, sounds may be collected by microphone <b>1720</b>, or by a microphone of another device, such as a mobile phone (or a device linked to a mobile phone). Audio signals corresponding to the voice of user <b>100</b> may be selectively transmitted to a remote device, for example, by amplifying the voice of user <b>100</b> and/or attenuating or eliminating altogether sounds other than the user's voice.

Accordingly, the microphone may include a directional microphone, a microphone array, a multi-port microphone, or various other types of microphones, as described above. In step <b>2212</b>, process <b>2200</b> may include identifying, based on analysis of the received audio signals, one or more voice audio signals representative of a recognized voice of the user. For example, the voice of the user may be recognized based on a voiceprint associated with the user, which may be stored in memory <b>550</b>, database <b>2050</b>, or other suitable locations. Processor <b>210</b> may recognize the voice of the user, for example, using voice recognition component <b>2041</b>.

In step <b>2216</b>, process <b>2200</b> may include preventing transmission, to the remotely located device, of at least one background noise audio signal different from the one or more voice audio signals representative of a recognized voice of the user. For example, processor <b>210</b> may attenuate and/or eliminate audio signals associated with sounds <b>2020</b>, <b>2021</b>, or <b>2022</b>, which may represent background noise. The voice of the user may be separated from other noises using the audio processing techniques described above.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0185">In an exemplary illustration, the voice audio signals may be captured by a headset or other device worn by the user. The voice of the user may be recognized and isolated from the background noise in the environment of the user. The headset may transmit the conditioned audio signal of the user's voice to a mobile phone of the user. For example, the user may be on a telephone call and the conditioned audio signal may be transmitted by the mobile phone to a recipient of the call. The voice of the user may also be recorded by the remotely located device. The audio signal, for example, may be stored on a remote server or other computing device.

For example, microphone <b>1720</b> may detect one or more sounds <b>2421</b>, <b>2422</b>, and <b>2423</b> within environment <b>2400</b>. In some embodiments, the sounds may represent voices of various individuals. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, sound <b>2421</b> may represent a voice of individual <b>2310</b> and sound <b>2422</b> may represent a voice of individual <b>2410</b>. Sound <b>2423</b> may represent additional voices and/or background noise within environment <b>2400</b>. Processor <b>210</b> may be configured to analyze sounds <b>2421</b>, <b>2422</b>, and <b>2423</b> to separate and identify audio signals associated with voices. For example, processor <b>210</b> may use one or more speech or voice activity detection (VAD) algorithms and/or the voice separation techniques described above. When there are multiple voices detected in the environment, processor <b>210</b> may isolate audio signals associated with each voice. In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may perform further analysis on the audio signal associated the detected voice activity to recognize the speech of the individual. For example, processor <b>210</b> may use one or more voice recognition algorithms (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Dynamic Time Warping, neural networks, or other techniques) to recognize the voice of the individual. Processor <b>210</b> may also be configured to recognize the words spoken by individual <b>2310</b> using various speech-to-text algorithms. In some embodiments, instead of using microphone <b>1710</b>, apparatus <b>110</b> may receive audio signals from another device through a communication component, such as wireless transceiver <b>530</b>. For example, if user <b>100</b> is on a video call, apparatus <b>110</b> may receive an audio signal representing a voice of user <b>2310</b> from display device <b>2301</b> or another auxiliary device.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0197">Processor <b>210</b> may determine, based on lip movements and the detected sounds, which individuals in environment <b>2400</b> are speaking. For example, processor <b>2310</b> may track lip movements associated with mouth <b>2311</b> to determine that individual <b>2310</b> is speaking. A comparative analysis may be performed between the detected lip movement and the received audio signals. In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may determine that individual <b>2310</b> is speaking based on a determination that mouth <b>2311</b> is moving at the same time as sound <b>2421</b> is detected. For example, when the lips of individual <b>2310</b> stop moving, this may correspond with a period of silence or reduced volume in the audio signal associated with sound <b>2421</b>. In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may be configured to determine whether specific movements of mouth <b>2311</b> correspond to the received audio signal. For example, processor <b>210</b> may analyze the received audio signal to identify specific phonemes, phoneme combinations, or words in the received audio signal. Processor <b>210</b> may recognize whether specific lip movements of mouth <b>2311</b> correspond to the identified words or phonemes. Various machine learning or deep learning techniques may be implemented to correlate the expected lip movements to the detected audio. For example, a training data set of known sounds and corresponding lip movements may be fed to a machine learning algorithm to develop a model for correlating detected sounds with expected lip movements. Other data associated with apparatus <b>110</b> may further be used in conjunction with the detected lip movement to determine and/or verify whether individual <b>2310</b> is speaking, such as a look direction of user <b>100</b> or individual <b>2310</b>, a detected identity of user <b>2310</b>, a recognized voiceprint of user <b>2310</b>, etc.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0198">Based on the detected lip movement, processor <b>210</b> may cause selective conditioning of audio associated with individual <b>2310</b>. The conditioning may include amplifying audio signals determined to correspond to sound <b>2421</b> (which may correspond to a voice of individual <b>2310</b>) relative to other audio signals. In some embodiments, amplification may be accomplished digitally, for example by processing audio signals associated with sound <b>2421</b> relative to other signals. Additionally, or alternatively, amplification may be accomplished by changing one or more parameters of microphone <b>1720</b> to focus on audio sounds associated with individual <b>2310</b>. For example, microphone <b>1720</b> may be a directional microphone and processor <b>210</b> may perform an operation to focus microphone <b>1720</b> on sound <b>2421</b>. Various other techniques for amplifying sound <b>2421</b> may be used, such as using a beamforming microphone array, acoustic telescope techniques, etc. The conditioned audio signal may be transmitted to hearing interface device <b>1710</b>, and thus may provide user <b>100</b> with audio conditioned based on the individual who is speaking.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0199">In some embodiments, selective conditioning may include attenuation or suppressing one or more audio signals not associated with individual <b>2310</b>, such as sounds <b>2422</b> and <b>2423</b>. Similar to amplification of sound <b>2421</b>, attenuation of sounds may occur through processing audio signals, or by varying one or more parameters associated with microphone <b>1720</b> to direct focus away from sounds not associated with individual <b>2310</b>.</p><p id="p-0201" num="0200">In some embodiments, conditioning may further include changing a tone of one or more audio signals corresponding to sound <b>2421</b> to make the sound more perceptible to user <b>100</b>. For example, user <b>100</b> may have lesser sensitivity to tones in a certain range and conditioning of the audio signals may adjust the pitch of sound <b>2421</b>. For example, user <b>100</b> may experience hearing loss in frequencies above 10 kHz and processor <b>210</b> may remap higher frequencies (e.g., at 15 kHz) to 10 kHz. In some embodiments processor <b>210</b> may be configured to change a rate of speech associated with one or more audio signals. Processor <b>210</b> may be configured to vary the rate of speech of individual <b>2310</b> to make the detected speech more perceptible to user <b>100</b>. If speech recognition has been performed on the audio signal associated with sound <b>2421</b>, conditioning may further include modifying the audio signal based on the detected speech. For example, processor <b>210</b> may introduce pauses or increase the duration of pauses between words and/or sentences, which may make the speech easier to understand. Various other processing may be performed, such as modifying the tone of sound <b>2421</b> to maintain the same pitch as the original audio signal, or to reduce noise within the audio signal.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0201">The conditioned audio signal may then be transmitted to hearing interface device <b>1710</b> and then produced for user <b>100</b>. Thus, in the conditioned audio signal, sound <b>2421</b> may be louder and/or more easily distinguishable than sounds <b>2422</b> and <b>2423</b>.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0202">Processor <b>210</b> may be configured to selectively condition multiple audio signals based on which individuals associated with the audio signals are currently speaking. For example, individual <b>2310</b> and individual <b>2410</b> may be engaged in a conversation within environment <b>2400</b> and processor <b>210</b> may be configured to transition from conditioning of audio signals associated with sound <b>2421</b> to conditioning of audio signals associated with sound <b>2422</b> based on the respective lip movements of individuals <b>2310</b> and <b>2410</b>. For example, lip movements of individual <b>2310</b> may indicate that individual <b>2310</b> has stopped speaking or lip movements associated with individual <b>2410</b> may indicate that individual <b>2410</b> has started speaking. Accordingly, processor <b>210</b> may transition between selectively conditioning audio signals associated with sound <b>2421</b> to audio signals associated with sound <b>2422</b>. In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may be configured to process and/or condition both audio signals concurrently but only selectively transmit the conditioned audio to hearing interface device <b>1710</b> based on which individual is speaking. Where speech recognition is implemented, processor <b>210</b> may determine and/or anticipate a transition between speakers based on the context of the speech. For example, processor <b>210</b> may analyze audio signals associate with sound <b>2421</b> to determine that individual <b>2310</b> has reached the end of a sentence or has asked a question, which may indicate individual <b>2310</b> has finished or is about to finish speaking.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0203">In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may be configured to select between multiple active speakers to selectively condition audio signals. For example, individuals <b>2310</b> and <b>2410</b> may both be speaking at the same time or their speech may overlap during a conversation. Processor <b>210</b> may selectively condition audio associated with one speaking individual relative to others. This may include giving priority to a speaker who has started but not finished a word or sentence or has not finished speaking altogether when the other speaker started speaking. This determination may also be driven by the context of the speech, as described above.</p><p id="p-0205" num="0204">Various other factors may also be considered in selecting among active speakers. For example, a look direction of the user may be determined and the individual in the look direction of the user may be given higher priority among the active speakers. Priority may also be assigned based on the look direction of the speakers. For example, if individual <b>2310</b> is looking at user <b>100</b> and individual <b>2410</b> is looking elsewhere, audio signals associated with individual <b>2310</b> may be selectively conditioned. In some embodiments, priority may be assigned based on the relative behavior of other individuals in environment <b>2400</b>. For example, if both individual <b>2310</b> and individual <b>2410</b> are speaking and more other individuals are looking at individual <b>2410</b> than individual <b>2310</b>, audio signals associated with individual <b>2410</b> may be selectively conditioned over those associated with individual <b>2310</b>. In embodiments where the identity of the individuals is determined, priority may be assigned based on the relative status of the speakers, as discussed previously in greater detail. User <b>100</b> may also provide input into which speakers are prioritized through predefined settings or by actively selecting which speaker to focus on.</p><p id="p-0206" num="0205">Processor <b>210</b> may also assign priority based on how the representation of individual <b>2310</b> is detected. While individuals <b>2310</b> and <b>2410</b> are shown to be physically present in environment <b>2400</b>, one or more individuals may be detected as visual representations of the individual (e.g., on a display device) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref>. Processor <b>210</b> may prioritize speakers based on whether or not they are physically present in environment <b>2400</b>. For example, processor <b>210</b> may prioritize speakers who are physically present over speakers on a display. Alternatively, processor <b>210</b> may prioritize a video over speakers in a room, for example, if user <b>100</b> is on a video conference or if user <b>100</b> is watching a movie. The prioritized speaker or speaker type (e.g., present or not) may also be indicated by user <b>100</b>, using a user interface associated with apparatus <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0207" num="0206"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> is a flowchart showing an exemplary process <b>2500</b> for selectively amplifying audio signals based on tracked lip movements consistent with disclosed embodiments. Process <b>2500</b> may be performed by one or more processors associated with apparatus <b>110</b>, such as processor <b>210</b>. The processor(s) may be included in the same common housing as microphone <b>1720</b> and camera <b>1730</b>, which may also be used for process <b>2500</b>. In some embodiments, some or all of process <b>2500</b> may be performed on processors external to apparatus <b>110</b>, which may be included in a second housing. For example, one or more portions of process <b>2500</b> may be performed by processors in hearing interface device <b>1710</b>, or in an auxiliary device, such as computing device <b>120</b> or display device <b>2301</b>. In such embodiments, the processor may be configured to receive the captured images via a wireless link between a transmitter in the common housing and receiver in the second housing.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0207">In step <b>2510</b>, process <b>2500</b> may include receiving a plurality of images captured by a wearable camera from an environment of the user. The images may be captured by a wearable camera such as camera <b>1730</b> of apparatus <b>110</b>. In step <b>2520</b>, process <b>2500</b> may include identifying a representation of at least one individual in at least one of the plurality of images. The individual may be identified using various image detection algorithms, such as Haar cascade, histograms of oriented gradients (HOG), deep convolution neural networks (CNN), scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), or the like. In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may be configured to detect visual representations of individuals, for example from a display device, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0208">In step <b>2530</b>, process <b>2500</b> may include identifying at least one lip movement or lip position associated with a mouth of the individual, based on analysis of the plurality of images. Processor <b>210</b> may be configured to identify one or more points associated with the mouth of the individual. In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may develop a contour associated with the mouth of the individual, which may define a boundary associated with the mouth or lips of the individual. The lips identified in the image may be tracked over multiple frames or images to identify the lip movement. Accordingly, processor <b>210</b> may use various video tracking algorithms, as described above.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0209">In step <b>2540</b>, process <b>2500</b> may include receiving audio signals representative of the sounds captured by a microphone from the environment of the user. For example, apparatus <b>110</b> may receive audio signals representative of sounds <b>2421</b>, <b>2422</b>, and <b>2423</b> captured by microphone <b>1720</b>. In step <b>2550</b>, process <b>2500</b> may include identifying, based on analysis of the sounds captured by the microphone, a first audio signal associated with a first voice and a second audio signal associated with a second voice different from the first voice. For example, processor <b>210</b> may identify an audio signal associated with sounds <b>2421</b> and <b>2422</b>, representing the voice of individuals <b>2310</b> and <b>2410</b>, respectively. Processor <b>210</b> may analyze the sounds received from microphone <b>1720</b> to separate the first and second voices using any currently known or future developed techniques or algorithms Step <b>2550</b> may also include identifying additional sounds, such as sound <b>2423</b> which may include additional voices or background noise in the environment of the user. In some embodiments, processor <b>210</b> may perform further analysis on the first and second audio signals, for example, by determining the identity of individuals <b>2310</b> and <b>2410</b> using available voiceprints thereof. Alternatively, or additionally, processor <b>210</b> may use speech recognition tools or algorithms to recognize the speech of the individuals.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0210">In step <b>2560</b>, process <b>2500</b> may include causing selective conditioning of the first audio signal based on a determination that the first audio signal is associated with the identified lip movement associated with the mouth of the individual. Processor <b>210</b> may compare the identified lip movement with the first and second audio signals identified in step <b>2550</b>. For example, processor <b>210</b> may compare the timing of the detected lip movements with the timing of the voice patterns in the audio signals. In embodiments where speech is detected, processor <b>210</b> may further compare specific lip movements to phonemes or other features detected in the audio signal, as described above. Accordingly, processor <b>210</b> may determine that the first audio signal is associated with the detected lip movements and is thus associated with an individual who is speaking.</p><p id="p-0212" num="0211">Various forms of selective conditioning may be performed, as discussed above. In some embodiments, conditioning may include changing the tone or playback speed of an audio signal. For example, conditioning may include remapping the audio frequencies or changing a rate of speech associated with the audio signal. In some embodiments, the conditioning may include amplification of a first audio signal relative to other audio signals. Amplification may be performed by various means, such as operation of a directional microphone, varying one or more parameters associated with the microphone, or digitally processing the audio signals. The conditioning may include attenuating or suppressing one or more audio signals that are not associated with the detected lip movement. The attenuated audio signals may include audio signals associated with other sounds detected in the environment of the user, including other voices such as a second audio signal. For example, processor <b>210</b> may selectively attenuate the second audio signal based on a determination that the second audio signal is not associated with the identified lip movement associated with the mouth of the individual. In some embodiments, the processor may be configured to transition from conditioning of audio signals associated with a first individual to conditioning of audio signals associated with a second individual when identified lip movements of the first individual indicates that the first individual has finished a sentence or has finished speaking.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0212">In step <b>2570</b>, process <b>2500</b> may include causing transmission of the selectively conditioned first audio signal to a hearing interface device configured to provide sound to an ear of the user. The conditioned audio signal, for example, may be transmitted to hearing interface device <b>1710</b>, which may provide sound corresponding to the first audio signal to user <b>100</b>. Additional sounds such as the second audio signal may also be transmitted. For example, processor <b>210</b> may be configured to transmit audio signals corresponding to sounds <b>2421</b>, <b>2422</b>, and <b>2423</b>. The first audio signal, which may be associated with the detected lip movement of individual <b>2310</b>, may be amplified, however, in relation to sounds <b>2422</b> and <b>2423</b> as described above. In some embodiments, hearing interface <b>1710</b> device may include a speaker associated with an earpiece. For example, hearing interface device may be inserted at least partially into the ear of the user for providing audio to the user. Hearing interface device may also be external to the ear, such as a behind-the-ear hearing device, one or more headphones, a small portable speaker, or the like. In some embodiments, hearing interface device may include a bone conduction microphone, configured to provide an audio signal to user through vibrations of a bone of the user's head. Such devices may be placed in contact with the exterior of the user's skin, or may be implanted surgically and attached to the bone of the user.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0213">Responding to a User Query Based on Captured Images and Audio</p><p id="p-0215" num="0214">The audio and video captured by apparatus <b>110</b> may represent a significant part of what the user experienced during the capturing period (e.g., a period of time during which apparatus <b>110</b> is active and capturing audio and/or video), and even more, as the user may be focused on one event or otherwise distracted, while apparatus <b>110</b> may continue capturing, and optionally analyzing or storing, the images and sound in the environment of the user.

For example, the keywords, identifiers, and/or metadata may relate to a person, an object, a location, an event, a date, or a time depicted in or associated with the audio and video, or any number or combination of the above. When the user asks a question, the question may be parsed to determine one or more terms associated with the question. The stored keywords, identifiers, and/or metadata may then be searched based on the one or more terms to determine a correlation between the keywords, identifiers, and/or metadata and the one or more terms. Based on the correlation, a response to the question may be generated and provided to the user.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0217">In some embodiments, a system for responding to a user query based on captured images and audio may include at least one microphone configured to capture sounds from an environment of a user, at least one image sensor configured to capture a plurality of images from the environment of the user, and at least one processor.

In some embodiments, the at least one word may be a person's name, a place name, an object name, a location name, or an event name. In some embodiments, the at least one word may include multiple words such as complete sentences or keywords (e.g., a sentence without any articles).</p><p id="p-0225" num="0224">In some embodiments, apparatus <b>110</b> may be configured to store encounters with individuals. The conversation between the user and the individuals the user met during the day may be diarized and transcribed, e.g., transformed into words and sentences, which may be stored. Transcription may also be followed by text analysis of the obtained text. The words, sentences, and extracted data may be stored in association with the side of the conversation that said them (e.g., with the speaker's name), the time at which they were said, or additional details such as a location of the conversation, other individuals present at the location, or the like.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0225">In some embodiments, the at least one processor may be programmed to analyze the at least one image to determine at least one identifier of at least one of a person, an object, a location, or an event represented in the at least one image. For example, the at least one image may be analyzed by using an image recognition algorithm. In some embodiments, machine learning algorithms may be used as part of the image recognition, including for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN), bag-of-words, support vector machines (SVM), face landmark estimation, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression, or a recurrent neural network (RNN). In some embodiments, the at least one identifier may include a single word. In some embodiments, the at least one identifier may include several individual words combined as a keyword or keyword phrase. For example, the at least one identifier may be a person's full name, such as &#x201c;Jon Smith.&#x201d; As another example, the at least one identifier may be one or more words to describe an event such as &#x201c;baseball game&#x201d; or &#x201c;Yankees versus Red Sox.&#x201d; In some embodiments, the at least one identifier may also include a timestamp associated with the image.

It will be appreciated that storing text takes a fraction of the memory required to store the audio or an image containing the text. Thus, the contents of conversations captured over longer time periods (e.g., more than two weeks ago) may be stored if handled as transcribed text than if stored as audio. Moreover, it is easier to search for words, phrases, or other parts of speech within text than within audio. Further, more options are available when searching text, such as searching for synonyms, homonyms, different sentence structures, using only keywords, or the like.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0229">In some embodiments, the at least one processor may be further programmed to capture first metadata associated with the at least one image or capture second metadata associated with the audio signal.

The system may also search for synonyms, homonyms, according to syntax, or the like.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">For example, the apparatus may identify a name of an individual within a user's question and may search for entries associated with the individual's name within the stored data. For example, in response to the question &#x201c;what did Jon say?&#x201d;, the last sentence or sentences said by the recognized individual Jon may be quoted or summarized. In another example, upon identifying a time indication, such as &#x201c;last week&#x201d;, &#x201c;noon&#x201d;, &#x201c;Sunday&#x201d;, etc., the apparatus may search the database for entries associated with the particular time, and then for entries around the time which are associated with other terms or names detected within the user's request.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">In a further example, after identifying objects' names within the user's query, the apparatus may search for stored entries related to objects detected within the images, such as a bus, store fronts, recognized locations, or the like. For example, in response to the question &#x201c;where did I leave my keys?&#x201d;, the apparatus may search for the last times keys were detected in a captured image. Some questions may be more global and may require searching entries over a long period of time, such as &#x201c;what was the last book I read?&#x201d;, &#x201c;how many books did I read in the last year?&#x201d;, or the like.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">In some embodiments, the at least one processor may be programmed to analyze the question to determine at least one term.

In some embodiments, generating the response to the question may include accessing the metadata. In some embodiments, the database may be searched based on the at least one term, the at least one word, the at least one identifier, the metadata, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0247">In some embodiments, the at least one processor may be programmed to generate a response to the question based on the correlation. In some embodiments, the response to the question may include an audio response. In some embodiments, the response may be provided as spoken audio provided to a speaker such as a speaker of apparatus <b>110</b>, to an external speaker, to a speaker of a paired device such as a mobile phone, to a hearing aid, or the like. In some embodiments, the response to the question may include a visual response. In some embodiments, the response may be provided as written text to a destination display, such as a paired device having a display. In some embodiments, the response may include an image, a sequence of still images, or a video. In some embodiments, the response to the question may include a visual response and an audio response. For example, the response may include a video with corresponding audio. As another example, the response may include a recent image of a person and an older audio recording of a conversation with that person.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0248">In some embodiments, the response may include a portion from the captured sounds or the captured plurality of images and a portion from material obtained from an online search. For example, if the user's question is &#x201c;what was the last baseball game I attended?&#x201d; the response may include an image the user captured while attending the baseball game and an audio summary of the baseball game obtained from the Internet (e.g., the audio summary may include &#x201c;The last baseball game you attended was the Tigers at the Yankees on Jun. 2, 2022. The Yankees won 13 to 0.&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0250" num="0249">In some embodiments, the at least one processor may be programmed to provide the response to the user. In some embodiments, the response may be provided to the user via apparatus <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the response may be provided to the user via a device associated with apparatus <b>110</b>, for example, computer device <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, the response is provided to the user via both apparatus <b>110</b> and a device associated with apparatus <b>110</b>. For example, if apparatus <b>110</b> includes a speaker, an audio portion of the response may be provided via the speaker.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0250">In some embodiments, the at least one processor may be further programmed to receive an indication from the user whether the response is acceptable to the user. For example, the response may not be the response the user was expecting or may not fully answer the user's question. In some embodiments, when the indication indicates that the response is not acceptable to the user, the at least one processor may be further programmed to analyze the information representing the question to determine at least one new term, search the database to determine a new correlation between the at least one new term and the at least one word or between the at least one new term and the at least one identifier, generate a new response to the question based on the new correlation, and provide the new response to the user. For example, the at least one new term may be different than the at least one term. As another example, the at least one new term may include the at least one term and one new term (e.g., combine the one new term with the previously determined term). In some embodiments, if a search template is used to search the database, a different template may be used in connection with the at least one new term. In some embodiments, if a search template is used to search the database, the different search template to be used may be based on the at least one new term.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0251">In some embodiments, the at least one processor may be further programmed to determine a linguistic register for the response and generate the response in accordance with the linguistic register. The term &#x201c;linguistic register&#x201d; refers to the way a person speaks differently in different situations. For example, a person may use different words or phrases to communicate content based on the social situation or the linguistic abilities of the listener, such as when speaking to a child, to a non-native language speaker, or in a business setting.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0252">In some embodiments, the response to the user's question may be phrased in accordance with a linguistic register. For example, if the user asked, &#x201c;what was the cost of the shirt?&#x201d;, the answer may be &#x201c;twenty-five dollars&#x201d;, &#x201c;the shirt is twenty-five dollars&#x201d;, &#x201c;the cost of the shirt is twenty-five dollars&#x201d;, or the like. In another example, two possible answers may be &#x201c;there are many cows&#x201d; and &#x201c;there is a herd of cows&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0253">In some embodiments, the at least one processor may be further programmed to determine the linguistic register in accordance with any one or more of: a setting, a linguistic register of the question, or a demographic parameter of the user. In some embodiments, the linguistic register may be set by the user operating a user interface of apparatus <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the linguistic register may be determined automatically and may depend on the status or cognitive skills of the user, for example a child or an adult, a newcomer or fluent in the language, or the like. For example, if the user is a child, the linguistic register may be different than if the user is an adult. In some embodiments, the linguistic register may be determined in an ad-hoc manner for a specific answer in accordance with the linguistic register the user used when asking the question.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0254"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref> is a flowchart showing an exemplary method <b>2900</b> for responding to a user query based on captured images and audio.
