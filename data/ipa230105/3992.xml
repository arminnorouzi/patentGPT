The color transformation of most photonic crystals depends on the blue (or red) shift (J. B. Kim, S.-H. Kim, et al. Designing Structural-Color Patterns Composed of Colloidal Arrays [J]. ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2019, 11(16):14485-14509), superposition (H. S. Lee, T. S. Shim, et al. Colloidal Photonic Crystals toward Structural Color Palettes for Security Materials [J]. Chem. Mater. 2013, 25(13): 2684-2690), or environmental stimulated formation of photonic bandgap (M. M. Ito, A. H. Gibbons, et al. Structural colour using organized microfibrillation in glassy polymer films [J]. Nature 2019, 570: 363-367). In specular reflection mode, these band gaps change with the expansion, contraction or formation of polymer micropores, which often requires the stimulation response of external environmental conditions (such as light, temperature, solvent, steam and pH). These devices require that the polymers used thereof have a single characteristic or special function, such as humidity response, temperature response, steam response, pressure response, light response or solvent response, and should not be too sensitive. Although such devices can meet the optical path manipulation under the stimulation of environmental conditions, but are not suitable for the optical manipulation without the above changes in environmental conditions (under the stimulation of non-environmental conditions), nor can achieve the optical manipulation under the non-specular reflection mode.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Besides, the optical path can also be manipulated by means of controlling the assembly mode, and regulating the spatial arrangement of the nanoparticles to change the lattice spacing. Such as magnetic assembly (Z. Li, M. Wang, et al. Magnetic Assembly of Nanocubes for Orientation-Dependent Photonic Responses [J]. Nano Lett. 2019, 19(9): 6673-6680) and Langmuir-Schaefer assembly (J. Lv, D. Ding, et al. Biomimetic Chiral Photonic Crystals [J]. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2019, 58(23): 7783-7787). However, a special assembly limits the band gap of photonic crystal and the process thereof is complex, which makes the reflected light of the device excessively undiversified. Some physical conversion methods have also been used to regulate the photonic band gap, including polymer scaffold (M. Wang, C. Zou, et al. Bias-Polarity Dependent Bidirectional Modulation of Photonic Bandgap in a Nanoengineered 3D Blue Phase Polymer Scaffold for Tunable Laser Application[J]. Adv. Optical Mater. 2018, 6(16): 1800409), glass transition (S. Yu, X. Cao, et al. Large-Area and Water Rewriteable Photonic Crystal Films Obtained by the Thermal Assisted Air-Liquid Interface Self Assembly [J]. ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2019, 11(25): 22777-22785) and deformable spherical nanoparticles (K. Wang, C. Li, et al. A facile fabrication strategy for anisotropic photonic crystals using deformable spherical nanoparticles [J]. Nanoscale 2019, 11: 14147-14154). These physical methods are usually based on 2D photonic crystals or 3D photonic crystals, and the obtained photonic band gap is continuous, which can only change the color of light, but the optical path does not have the characteristic of periodic opening and closing. And, the preparation of these nanoparticles needs to consider the surface charge, degree of hardness and softness (glass transition temperature) and stimulated deformation ability. For 2D photonic crystals, the assembly of monolayer nanospheres is much more difficult than that of 3D photonic crystals; and only specular reflection can realize the regulation of the optical path for 3D photonic crystals. In conclusion, the traditional way to induce the change of photonic band gap often requires the stimulation of external environmental conditions, and the preparation process of nanoparticles is complex and the optical path is single and continuous, which greatly limits the practical application of traditional photonic crystal devices.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recently, a reversible conversion between polychromatic light (two band gaps) and monochromatic light (one band gap) was realized by transparentizing the top layer of bilayer photonic crystal via refractive index matching (Y. Qi, L. Chu, et al. New Encryption Strategy of Photonic Crystals with Bilayer Inverse Heterostructure Guided from Transparency Response [J]. Adv. Funct. Mater. 2019, 29: 1903743). Research of the bilayer photonic crystals has attracted wide attention (Y. Qi, W. Niu, et al. Encoding and Decoding of Invisible Complex Information in a Dual-Response Bilayer Photonic Crystal with Tunable Wettability [J]. Adv. Funct. Mater. 2019, 29:1906799; Y. Meng, J. Qiu, et al. Biomimetic Structural Color Films with a Bilayer Inverse Heterostructure for Anticounterfeiting Applications [J]. ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2018, 10, 38459-38465). This kind of bilayer photonic crystals can obtain a variety of band gaps by means of only changing the angle or environmental stimulation without using complex nanoparticles. Compared with traditional photonic crystals, the bilayer photonic crystals have more regulatory sites and more complex color conversion characteristics. Even so, the reported bilayer photonic crystals at present still depend on the specular reflection of photonic crystals, the reflected light only changes in color, and cannot break or deflect the optical path. Therefore, it is still a major challenge to develop simpler band gap regulation method.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is an object of the present invention to provide a bilayer photonic crystal photoswitch thin-film device having the optical characteristics of both 2D and 3D photonic crystals, and a preparation method thereof.

The preparation method of the present disclosure is simple in process and mild in conditions. The obtained bilayer photonic crystal photoswitch thin-film device has good flexibility and will never fade. The thin-film also has the angle dependence of 2D photonic crystals. Rotating the bilayer photonic crystal can obtain multicolour pattern with periodic reproducibility. Rich color changes can be achieved by changing the light source or viewing angle. The opening and closing of the optical path can be realized without external environmental stimulation, and the diffraction band covering the all visible spectrum can be obtained under the condition of non-specular reflection. The diffraction bands are discontinuous with periodic reproducibility of 30&#xb0; and 60&#xb0;. So long as rotating the bilayer photonic crystal thin-film, the opening and closing of six directional periodic optical paths can be realized on the side of the light source. The prepared polymer material of the present disclosure has good flexibility, which is suitable for various curved surface devices. The prepared polymer material is also suitable for surface modification for various substrates, such as glass, metal, ceramics, various synthetic resin substrates, etc. The thin-film has low preparation cost, simple operation, green environmental protection and good universality, which is of great significance to promote the practical application of photonic crystals.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows, from left to right, the preparation flow diagram of the bilayer photonic crystal thin-film device in embodiment 1, which is also applicable to all embodiments.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows, from left to right, in Embodiment 1, the SEM top view of the silicon dioxide nanosphere template of about 283 nm, SEM top view of the inverse opal, and a 2D reflection spectrum (when the incident angle is 57.5&#xb0; and the angle between the detector and the light source is 10&#xb0;) and the corresponding digital photo (illustration).
