Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description which may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly or impliedly admitted as prior art against the present invention.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Recent generation mobile telecommunication systems, such as those based on the 3GPP defined UMTS and Long Term Evolution (LTE) architectures, are able to support a wider range of services than simple voice and messaging services offered by previous generations of mobile telecommunication systems. For example, with the improved radio interface and enhanced data rates provided by LTE systems, a user is able to enjoy high data rate applications such as mobile video streaming and mobile video conferencing that would previously only have been available via a fixed line data connection. In addition to supporting these kinds of more sophisticated services and devices, it is also proposed for newer generation mobile telecommunication systems to support less complex services and devices which make use of the reliable and wide ranging coverage of newer generation mobile telecommunication systems without necessarily needing to rely on the high data rates available in such systems. The demand to deploy such networks is therefore strong and the coverage area of these networks, i.e. geographic locations where access to the networks is possible, may be expected to increase ever more rapidly.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Future wireless communications networks will therefore be expected to routinely and efficiently support communications with a wider range of devices associated with a wider range of data traffic profiles and types than current systems are optimised to support. For example it is expected future wireless communications networks will be expected to efficiently support communications with devices including reduced complexity devices, machine type communication (MTC) devices, high resolution video displays, virtual reality headsets and so on. Some of these different types of devices may be deployed in very large numbers, for example low complexity devices for supporting the &#x201c;The Internet of Things&#x201d;, and may typically be associated with the transmissions of relatively small amounts of data with relatively high latency tolerance.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of this there is expected to be a desire for future wireless communications networks, for example those which may be referred to as 5G or new radio (NR) system/new radio access technology (RAT) systems, as well as future iterations/releases of existing systems, to efficiently support connectivity for a wide range of devices associated with different applications and different characteristic data traffic profiles.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As radio technologies continue to improve, for example with the development of 5G, the possibility arises for these technologies to be used not only by infrastructure equipment to provide service to wireless communications devices in a cell, but also for interconnecting infrastructure equipment to provide a wireless backhaul. In view of this there is a need for the effective management of routes between infrastructure equipment (which may through their wireless backhaul links act as relay nodes) and the core network, when such infrastructure equipment may be located remotely from the core network.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure can help address or mitigate at least some of the issues discussed above.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the present technique can provide a method of controlling communications within a wireless communications network. The communications network comprises a plurality of infrastructure equipment each being configured to communicate with one or more others of the infrastructure equipment via a backhaul communications link, one or more of the infrastructure equipment each being configured to communicate with one or more communications devices via a wireless access interface. The method comprises receiving, at a first of the infrastructure equipment acting as a donor node connected to a core network part of the wireless communications network, from a second of the infrastructure equipment, information relating to each of a plurality of different communications paths from the second infrastructure equipment to the first infrastructure equipment via one or more others of the infrastructure equipment acting as relay nodes, determining, based on the received information relating to the plurality of different communications paths, that either at least a part of a new communications path exists between the first of the infrastructure equipment and the second of the infrastructure equipment or at least a part of a previously known communications path no longer exists between the first of the infrastructure equipment and the second of the infrastructure equipment, and updating a communications path list by either adding the at least the part of the new communications path or deleting the at least the part of the previously known communications path that no longer exists.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Respective aspects and features of the present disclosure are defined in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary, but are not restrictive, of the present technology.

For example, after the IAB donor node <b>601</b> gets the candidate route information of the second IAB node <b>604</b> to the third IAB node <b>606</b>, it will send the admission request to the second IAB node <b>604</b> on behalf of the third IAB node <b>606</b>.

For example, one of the nodes on the route may have moved out of range of the other nodes on the route (or at least out of range of one of the next hop nodes on the route), or may have had a power issue or failure of some kind and has as such &#x201c;disappeared&#x201d; from the point of view of the other nodes on the path.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0084">As another alternative, the determining that the at least the part of the previously known communications path no longer exists comprises determining from the received information that one of the infrastructure equipment has indicated that the at least the part of the previously known communications path should no longer exist. The indication that the previously known communications path should know longer exist may be transmitted by one of the nodes on the (previously known) communications path in response to a particular or predetermined trigger, and received by the donor node as at least part of the information relating to the communications paths. Here, the IAB node can initiate route deletion or modification any time towards another node (either upstream or downstream). The trigger may be based on an overload at a node or due to load balancing requirements. This situation may occur after the route has been accepted initially, but later on due to, for example, traffic from normal UEs having increased or due to, for example, a change in radio conditions, the other node may either share the load or take over completely, thus requiring deletion or modification of the previously known communications path in the route table (communications path list).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0085">Again, as above, this route information may be sent, for example, via a dedicated RRC signaling or MAC CE or F1-AP or X2-AP or similar.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Flow Chart Representation</heading><p id="p-0079" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a flow diagram illustrating a process of communications in a communications system in accordance with embodiments of the present technique.
