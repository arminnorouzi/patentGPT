It is generally easier and more cost effective to manufacture a system as separate electronic subassemblies, such as printed circuit boards (&#x201c;PCBs&#x201d;), sensors, or battery packs, which may be joined together with electrical connectors. In some scenarios, the PCBs or other subassemblies to be joined each have connectors mounted to them, which may be mated to directly interconnect the subassemblies.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In other scenarios, the subassemblies are connected through a cable. Connectors may nonetheless be used to make such connections. The cable may be terminated at at least one end with a cable connector. A PCB or other subassembly may be mated with the cable connector. For example, in some automotive applications, an exhaust sensor may be fabricated on a substrate, such as ceramic wiring board. Connections between the sensor and an engine controller may be made through a cable, terminated with a cable connector. The sensor, on its substrate, may be inserted in the cable connector.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Electrical connectors may be designed to meet one or more requirements. Their designs may be intended to provide certain electrical properties in the conducting paths through the connector. Examples of electrical properties that may be considered in connector design include crosstalk, impedance, bulk resistance or contact resistance. In other instances, the overall connector characteristics may be considered, such as size, cost, weight, thermal resistance, or safety. In yet other instances, mechanical characteristics, such as mating force or un-mating force or reliability may be considered in designing a connector. Often, techniques to achieve one requirement interfere with achieving another requirement such that simultaneously achieving multiple design requirements can be challenging.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, an electrical connector comprises a ceramic housing and at least one terminal retained within the housing.

In situations in which real-time measurements of combustion events are desired, it may be advantageous to place the sensor as close to the combustion point as possible. Although such sensor placement would yield more accurate information about the operation of the engine compared to other locations and would therefore enable better control of engine operation, such as to reduce emissions, the proximity to the combustion point may impose extreme demands on an electrical connector connecting the sensor to an engine controller.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Those extreme demands have deterred others from developing suitable connectors for such demanding applications. The high temperature associated with a mounting location near a combustion point in an engine, for example, may destroy a conventional connector. Additionally, an electrical connector in such an environment may experience extreme temperature cycles, rapidly fluctuating between high temperatures and more moderate temperatures, which may lead to cracking of the connector components or other types of failures in a relatively short time.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The inventors have provided a high temperature connector providing one or more advantages and which may be used in an engine near a combustion point. Such a high temperature connector may be constructed with a housing of a high temperature material, such as molded ceramic. As a specific example, the housing may be formed of an alumina ceramic compound rated for temperatures at least to 1800&#xb0; F. In some embodiments, the housing may be cylindrical.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The housing may have a first face with a slot shaped to receive a substrate that holds or is connected to a sensor. The slot may extend through the housing and out a second face opposite the first face. The sensor substrate may have conductive pads on one or more surfaces. Terminals with compliant portions may be retained within the connector housing such that the compliant portions extend into the slot. The terminals may be retained in the housing such that the terminals may &#x201c;float&#x201d; relative to the housing to resist vibration and to avoid stress associated with differential thermal expansion of the housing and the terminals. The housing, for example, may be formed with channels that receive terminals to position the terminals for making contact with a sensor substrate inserted into the slot. The housing may have a pocket into which a tip of the terminal is inserted, partially retaining the terminal in the housing while allowing the terminal to float.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, each terminal may have multiple compliant portions, each configured to make contact with a pad on a sensor substrate inserted in the slot. Such a configuration may enhance reliable operation. The terminals may also be made of a high temperature material, such as <b>301</b>, half hardened stainless steel, such that the compliant portions generate spring force against conductive pads on the substrate when the substrate is inserted into the slot. In some embodiments, such as embodiments in which a tip of the terminal engages a pocket of the housing, the compliant portions may extend from an intermediate portion of the terminal.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Tails of the terminals may extend through a second face of the housing, which may be opposite the first face. The tails of the terminals may be connected to wires or other conductive structures that carry signals from the sensor, through the terminals to a remote location, such as an engine controller.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The terminals may be further retained in the housing with an end cap. The end cap may also be made of a high temperature material, such as alumina ceramic. The end cap may be fixed to the housing, blocking at least partially an opening in the second face of the housing through which the terminal tails extend. The end cap may be secured, for example with a high temperature epoxy, blocking the terminals from being withdrawn from the housing. In some embodiments, a high temperature epoxy may include an epoxy with a temperature resistance above 400&#xb0; F. Unless otherwise specified, as used herein the terms &#x201c;high temperature epoxy&#x201d;, &#x201c;high temperature material&#x201d;, and other similar terms may be associated with a temperature resistance above 400&#xb0; F.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the connector housing may be formed as a single component, such as with a molding operation. Such a component may have pockets, serving as terminal guides into which the terminals are inserted. In some embodiments, the housing may have voids, which may extend partially or fully from the first face to the second face. The voids may absorb and dissipate heat, thereby prevent cracking during thermal cycles.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In other embodiments, the connector housing may be made of two or more housing components. In some embodiments, the housing may have an inner housing and an outer housing. The inner housing may hold terminals that contact pads on a sensor substrate. The outer housing may have a shape configured for a desired end application, such as a cylinder configured for insertion into a manifold of combustion chamber in an engine. Ribs or other structures may be formed on outer surfaces of the housing to facilitate mounting of the connector in an engine manifold.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The inner housing may be held in the outer housing, such as by spring force generated by compliant components between the inner housing and the outer housing. In some embodiments, an outer surface of the inner housing may be held away from an inner surface of the outer housing, leaving one or more voids through the connector housing between the inner housing and the outer housing. One or more voids partially or fully through the connector housing may enhance thermal resistance of the connector.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, the inner housing may be formed of multiple components. Two inner housing portions, for example, may be held together to form opposite sides of the inner housing with a slot to receive a sensor substrate between them. Each housing portion may hold a row of terminals lining one side of the slot, so as to make contact with pads on a surface of a sensor substrate when inserted in the slot.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the inner housing portions may be held together with one or more clips. The clips may be exposed on an outer surface of the inner housing such that, when the inner housing is inserted into the outer housing, the clips are compressed between the inner and outer housing, retaining the inner housing in the outer housing. In some embodiments, the clips may be recessed relative to the outer surface of the inner housing, and a portion of the outer surface of the inner housing may directly contact an inner surface of the outer housing.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Turning to the figures, specific non-limiting embodiments are described in further detail. It should be understood that the various systems, components, features, and methods described relative to these embodiments may be used either individually and/or in any desired combination as the disclosure is not limited to only the specific embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref> show one embodiment of an electrical connector <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of the connector <b>100</b>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the connector <b>100</b>.
