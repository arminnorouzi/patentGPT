Early red dot sights included a single, static, brightness setting. Since the ambient light of the environment in which the shooter is operating may vary, manufacturers began offering user-controlled brightness settings. This allowed the user to manually increase the brightness of the target dot in bright conditions, and to reduce the brightness in dark conditions. Next came automatic brightness adjusters, where, based off readings from an ambient light sensor on the sight, the target dot would automatically increase brightness when the ambient light is brighter, and reduce the brightness of the target dot when there is less ambient light. A problem, exists in these automatic adjustment systems, however, in that the target itself may have a different brightness level than the ambient light gathered by the light sensor. For instance, the target may be brightly lit at the far end of a dark room. In such a condition, the ambient sensor correctly senses that the room is dark, and therefore reduces the target dot brightness accordingly. In this example, the target dot may not even be visible at the bright target because the ambient sensor caused the sight to reduce the brightness of the target dot.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of the disclosure address these and other limitations of the art.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a target dot sight having a target illumination sensor and automatic brightness control according to embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side view of the target dot sight illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to embodiments.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a front view of the target dot sight illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to embodiments.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a functional block diagram illustrating example operations of a brightness control of the target dot sight of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to embodiments.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a functional block diagram illustrating example operations of a brightness control of another target dot sight according to embodiments.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating example operations of a brightness control of the target dot sight of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to embodiments.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating example components of a brightness control system according to embodiments of the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In embodiments, a target dot sight includes a target illumination sensor that senses the amount of illumination at a target, rather than merely sensing the ambient sight of the entire operating environment. Then, based on the sensed target illumination, the target dot sight automatically compensates for the brightness of the target. Further, in some embodiments, the brightness of the target dot generated by the sight is not just a function of the input of the sensor, but rather includes logic to control the brightness in an intelligent way.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a target dot sight <b>100</b> having a target illumination sensor <b>110</b> and automatic brightness control according to embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side view of the target dot sight <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to embodiments. This view shows that the sensor <b>110</b> sits within a recess <b>112</b>, rather than being mounted at the front of the housing of the sight <b>100</b>, such as an ambient light sensor would be. The recess <b>112</b> blocks ambient light from entering the sensor <b>110</b>, and instead the sensor <b>110</b> senses light from the target itself. The shape and depth of the recess <b>112</b> may be implementation specific. In other words, for some embodiments, a deeper recess <b>112</b> provides better overall operation of the automatic brightness control of the sight <b>100</b>. In other embodiments, a shallower recess <b>112</b> may be used. In some embodiments the recess <b>112</b> may extend between 2 and 10 mm from the front surface of the sight <b>100</b>, with the sensor <b>110</b> mounted at the rear-most end of the recess, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In preferred embodiments the recess <b>112</b> may be 5-6 mm in length. In some embodiments the recess <b>112</b> is not a recess at all, but instead may be a protrusion from the sight <b>200</b> that functions to block ambient light from the sensor <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments a light pipe or fiber optic <b>116</b> may be mounted in the recess <b>112</b> to convey light from the target to the sensor <b>110</b>. The light pipe or fiber optic <b>116</b> carries light from a front end of the pipe to the sensor <b>110</b>, so that the sensor <b>110</b> may sense the light at the target, without having ambient light interfere with the sensor measurement.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In yet other embodiments a lens <b>118</b> may be mounted at or near the front opening of the recess <b>112</b>. In those embodiments, the lens <b>118</b> operates to focus the light from the target to the sensor <b>110</b> to minimize intrusion of ambient light. In some embodiments the lens <b>118</b> may be a Fresnel lens or have the same or similar function as a Fresnel lens to further block ambient light. Some embodiments include both a lens <b>118</b> as well as the light pipe (or fiber optic) <b>116</b> in the recess <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> also illustrates a light generating device <b>130</b>, such as an LED. When the LED <b>130</b> is ON, it generates light that shines through a lens <b>140</b> toward the target. A brightness control circuit <b>150</b> drives the LED <b>130</b> to generate different amounts of light, depending on the operating conditions, as described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a front view of the target dot sight illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to embodiments, which shows the sensor <b>110</b> within the recess <b>112</b> in the body of the sight <b>100</b>, as well as the lens <b>140</b> that focuses the light signal from the light generating device <b>130</b> on the target.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a functional block diagram illustrating example components and operations of a brightness control of a target dot sight <b>200</b>, which may be an example of the sight <b>100</b> described above, according to embodiments. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a variable output target light <b>230</b> may have the same function as the light generating device <b>130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For example, the target light <b>230</b> may generate a light signal <b>232</b>, such as a red dot, and projects the red dot onto a target <b>290</b>. In other embodiments the target light <b>230</b> may generate another color dot, or may generate a pattern, such as a target pattern. A target illumination sensor <b>210</b> may have the same function as the sensor <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which is to sense the illumination, or brightness level, or the lux, of the target <b>290</b>. As described above, the target illumination sensor <b>210</b> sits in a recess <b>212</b> sized and shaped so that the light from the target <b>290</b> is sensed more than the ambient light that is near the sight <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the target light <b>230</b> has multiple brightness settings, and the brightness of the light generated by the target light <b>230</b> is controlled by a brightness control <b>250</b>. The brightness control <b>250</b> may be controlled by user inputs <b>260</b>, or by an automatic adjuster <b>270</b>, or may be controlled by a combination of both of these at different times of operation. When the brightness control <b>250</b> is controlled by the user inputs <b>260</b>, the brightness control <b>250</b> causes the target light <b>230</b> to shine more brightly when the user increases the brightness level, and to shine less brightly when the user decreases the brightness level. Typically the user inputs <b>260</b> are a manual process, such as a pair of up/down buttons, or a single button that cycles through a number of predetermined power settings before repeating the brightness levels. In other embodiments the user inputs <b>260</b> may include a menu and menu selector. In an automatic mode, when the brightness control <b>250</b> is controlled by the automatic adjuster <b>270</b>, the user-set brightness level is not enabled and the brightness of the target light <b>230</b> is automatically set at a level determined by the automatic adjuster <b>270</b>. In some embodiments the sight <b>200</b> will alternate between the brightness control <b>250</b> being controlled by user inputs <b>260</b>, or by the automatic adjuster <b>270</b>, according operations as described below. In other embodiments the automatic adjustor <b>270</b> may store the present user setting and revert to the stored setting under certain conditions.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a functional block diagram illustrating example components and operations of another brightness control of a target dot sight <b>300</b>, which may be an example of the sight <b>100</b> described above, according to embodiments. The target dot sight <b>300</b> differs from the target dot sight <b>200</b> in that the target dot sight <b>300</b> further includes, in addition to the components of the target sight <b>200</b>, an ambient illumination sensor <b>380</b>. Differently than the target illumination sensor <b>310</b>, the ambient illumination sensor <b>380</b> sits at or near the front edge of the sight <b>300</b>. In this way the ambient illumination sensor <b>380</b> may sense light more near the target dot sight <b>300</b> itself than does the target illumination sensor, <b>310</b>, which instead senses light from the target <b>390</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A user may use the user inputs <b>360</b> to control which illumination sensor is operative on the target dot sight <b>300</b>. In other words, the user may select to use the target illumination sensor <b>310</b> or the ambient illumination sensor <b>380</b>. In other embodiments the user may select to use a combination of both of the sensors <b>310</b> and <b>380</b>. In yet other embodiments the user may set the sensors <b>310</b>, <b>380</b> to a desired relative weighting level. For instance, the user may set the target dot sight <b>300</b> to weight the target illumination sensor at <b>310</b> at 35% and the ambient illumination sensor <b>380</b> at 65%.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating example operations of a brightness control flow <b>400</b> of the target dot sight of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to embodiments. In general, after an initialization, the sight senses an amount of illumination from the target through a target illumination sensor, such as the sensor <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in an operation <b>402</b>. These sensed values are periodically stored in a series of the sensed values in an operation <b>408</b>, such as in a circular buffer, although other memory schema may be used. In some embodiments the stored illumination values are averaged in an operation <b>406</b> in a continually adjusting manner, as the target illumination changes. In some embodiments the average is determined by only those values stored in the circular buffer. In other embodiments the average may include historical values that have already been overwritten in the circular buffer, i.e., values that are older than the number of storage locations in the circular buffer.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Then, in an operation <b>408</b>, the flow <b>400</b> checks to see if the brightness control is currently in a light saturation mode or not. Light saturation mode means that the target is much more brightly illuminated than it previously was, whereas not being in saturation mode means that the target is not much more brightly illuminated than it previously was. In some embodiments, the level of brightness difference between saturation mode and non-saturation mode is user adjustable. The sight may change from non-saturation mode to saturation mode when another light source is suddenly directed to the target, such as from a flashlight, or other light source, for example. Note that the operation <b>408</b> determines whether the brightness controller is presently in the saturation mode. Causing the brightness controller to enter or leave the saturation mode is controlled by operations <b>414</b> and <b>422</b> described below.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">If the sight is not already in saturation mode, the flow <b>400</b> leaves the comparison <b>408</b> in the NO direction. Next, the process <b>400</b> compares an instantaneous reading from the illumination sensor to the present average of the stored values in a comparison operation <b>410</b>. If the instantaneous light reading is much greater than the running average, determined in the comparison <b>410</b>, then the flow <b>400</b> exits the comparison <b>410</b> in the YES direction. In some embodiments, the definition of &#x201c;much greater than the running average&#x201d; means exceeding the running average by 25 Lux, but different embodiments can use different threshold levels depending on the implementation.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">After exiting operation <b>410</b> in the YES direction, the flow <b>400</b> stores the present brightness, which may have been a user-selected brightness level, in an operation <b>412</b> and sets the brightness value of the device to maximum brightness in an operation <b>414</b>. The flow <b>400</b> sets the brightness value to maximum brightness because the target was suddenly illuminated very brightly, i.e., the present brightness value greatly exceeds the average brightness value, and the sight is responsive to bring up the brightness value of the target dot quickly. The flow <b>400</b> also changes its mode to &#x201c;currently in light saturation mode&#x201d; so that the operation <b>408</b> will be answered correctly the next time the process loops through the flow <b>400</b>. Then the flow <b>400</b> progresses to a wait state <b>416</b>, and waits until the next sampling interval occurs before repeating the process. In some embodiments the sampling interval is 100 ms. In other embodiments the sampling interval may be set to an interval between 10 ms and 500 ms. In some embodiments the interval is user controllable.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Returning back to operation <b>408</b>, if the sight is not presently in light saturation mode and the outcome of the comparison in operation <b>410</b> is NO, then this means the instantaneous sensor reading is higher than the average reading, but does not exceed the average by the threshold amount, such as 25 Lux. In this case, the flow <b>400</b> exits operation <b>410</b> in the NO direction to the wait state <b>416</b> before repeating the analysis again. This process provides a hysteresis effect to the operation of the flow <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Returning back to operation <b>408</b> once more, if the sight <b>200</b> is presently in light saturation mode, the flow <b>400</b> exits comparison <b>408</b> in the YES direction to another comparison <b>420</b>. Comparison <b>420</b> determines whether the running average of the light readings is much greater than the instantaneous light reading. In some embodiments, the definition of &#x201c;much greater than the instantaneous light reading&#x201d; means exceeding the instantaneous light reading by 25 Lux, but different embodiments can use different threshold levels depending on the implementation. If the running average is much greater than the instantaneous light reading, then the flow <b>400</b> exits operation <b>420</b> in the YES direction, which indicates that the illumination of the target has suddenly dropped from its previous illumination. In this case, the brightness level is set in an operation <b>422</b> to the level previously stored in the operation <b>412</b>, meaning that the brightness level of the target light returns to the level previously set by the user, and is no longer in the maximum brightness mode (unless the user had previously set the brightness level to its maximum).
