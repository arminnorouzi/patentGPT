For example, it is common for a user to manage appointments, photos, personal records, and multiple forms of communication from a single smartphone device. As new features are added to mobile devices, new digital interaction patterns are developed. For example, improvements in location positioning technologies have led to the development of route guidance and location-based searching capabilities on mobile devices. As computing and other features of mobile devices continually improve, new digital interaction and record keeping capabilities can be developed to take advantage of the device capabilities.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various embodiments of the invention are disclosed in the following detailed description and the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a system for rendering a digital element.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating an embodiment of a rendered visual representation of a digital element.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of a process for placing a digital element.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>E</figref> are diagrams illustrating an example user interface used to place a digital element.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of a process for retrieving a digital element.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of a process for rendering a digital element.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of a process for updating a target location of a digital element.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of a process for determining a next rendering location of a digital element.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of a process for biasing a rendering coordinate of a digital element.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of a process for retrieving a rendered digital element.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>C</figref> are diagrams illustrating an example user interface used to retrieve a digital element.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref> are diagrams illustrating example user interfaces used to interact with digital elements representing users.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as a process; an apparatus; a system; a composition of matter; a computer program product embodied on a computer readable storage medium; and/or a processor, such as a processor configured to execute instructions stored on and/or provided by a memory coupled to the processor. In this specification, these implementations, or any other form that the invention may take, may be referred to as techniques. In general, the order of the steps of disclosed processes may be altered within the scope of the invention. Unless stated otherwise, a component such as a processor or a memory described as being configured to perform a task may be implemented as a general component that is temporarily configured to perform the task at a given time or a specific component that is manufactured to perform the task. As used herein, the term &#x2018;processor&#x2019; refers to one or more devices, circuits, and/or processing cores configured to process data, such as computer program instructions.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A detailed description of one or more embodiments of the invention is provided below along with accompanying figures that illustrate the principles of the invention. The invention is described in connection with such embodiments, but the invention is not limited to any embodiment. The scope of the invention is limited only by the claims and the invention encompasses numerous alternatives, modifications and equivalents. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the invention may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For the purpose of clarity, technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the invention has not been described in detail so that the invention is not unnecessarily obscured.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Rendering a digital element associated with a physical region is disclosed. For example, a digital element such as a message, a record, a digital file, a user profile, a coupon, a gift card credit, cryptocurrencies (and related), etc. is placed by a user for a specific geographical location. The specific geographic location may be fixed (e.g., placed at a specific fixed location coordinate) or may be placed at a location that can dynamically change (e.g., location of a device that can be moved to different locations) in another embodiment. The digital element may be retrieved by one or more users by visiting the geographical location of the digital element and using a computing device application to retrieve the digital element. In some embodiments, an augmented reality world view is displayed using the computing viewing device and a user desiring to retrieve the digital element may view a visual representation of the digital element at the physical location where the digital element was placed. For example, the user may explore a physical location using a mobile device application as a viewer. If any digital element of interest exists in the physical location shown in the viewer, a visual graphic (e.g., icon) representing the digital element is superimposed on the view of the physical location to create an augmented reality view of the digital element being located at the physical location. In some embodiments, the representation of the digital element is associated with an audio, tactile and/or other somatosensory feedback. For example, an audio, tactile and/or other somatosensory feedback may be provided via the device to indicate the digital element. If a user desires to obtain the digital element, the user may indicate that the user desires to obtain the digital element shown in the viewer of the mobile device application.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Improving the perception of an augmented reality object is disclosed. For example, when a digital object is rendered in an augmented reality environment (e.g., captured using a camera of a mobile device), the digital object placed at a geographical location coordinate may seem to move erratically in the augmented reality environment due to errors of a geographical location sensor of the mobile device. This erratic movement may seem jarring to a user and by limiting movement of the digital object within the augmented reality environment, the user may experience an enhanced user experience. In some embodiments, a new location of an observing platform is received. For example, a new location coordinate is received from a location service (e.g., determined using GPS) of a mobile device used to view an augmented reality environment. In some embodiments, a new relative position of an augmented reality object on a display associated with the observing platform is calculated. For example, a new location of a viewing device is detected (e.g., either due to the mobile device moving and/or due to errors of a location detector) and a new relative position of the augmented reality object with respect to the mobile device is calculated. In some embodiments, the display is updated using a filtered new relative position of the augmented reality object in a manner that reduces rate of change in motion of the augmented reality object on the display. For example, the augmented reality object is only allowed to move at a predetermined maximum rate. In another example, one or more previously received new locations of the viewing device are averaged with the new location to determine an averaged new location that is utilized to determine the filtered new relative position.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Rendering a digital element is disclosed. For example, an augmented reality object is rendered within an augmented reality world environment displayed on a screen (or projected into the eye). In some embodiments, a digital element to render is selected. For example, it is determined that a location and an orientation of a viewing device (e.g., mobile device) meet a criteria to render the digital element on a screen. A heading value of the digital element is determined based at least in part on a determined geographical location of an observing platform. For example, a compass directional heading from the geographical location of the viewing platform to the geographical location of the digital element is determined. A captured image associated with the geographical location of the device is obtained. For example, an image captured by a camera at the geographical location is obtained to be displayed as the augmented reality world environment. The digital element is rendered on the captured image at least in part by using the heading value. For example, the captured image includes an image of a range of directions around a center directional heading and a visual representation of the digital element is rendered over the captured image at the heading value that corresponds to its position in the range of directional headings captured by the image.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Rendering a digital element is disclosed. In some embodiments, an orientation of an observing platform is determined. For example, the observing platform is utilized to explore the augmented reality world that includes digital objects that are to be obtained. By orienting the observing platform in different directions, different portions of the augmented reality world environment may be displayed and explored on a display. It is determined whether a current rendering location of a digital element rendered on a captured image associated with a geographical location of the device meets a criteria. For example, it is determined whether a user is attempting to capture the digital element. In the event the current rendering location meets the criteria, a second rendering location of the digital element is biased using the detected orientation of the device. For example, a next rendering location of the digital element is biased to stay near its current rendering location rather than move to an updated rendering location.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram illustrating an embodiment of a system for rendering a digital element.

Device <b>102</b> includes application <b>108</b>, sensor <b>110</b>, and storage <b>112</b>. In some embodiments, device <b>102</b> is used by a user to place and/or retrieve a digital element. Application <b>108</b> may include a software application that can be utilized to place, retrieve, and/or open a digital element. In some embodiments, application <b>108</b> includes a web browser. In some embodiments, application <b>108</b> includes a native application (e.g., Apple iOS application or Google Android application) for placing and/or retrieving a digital element.

In some embodiments, information from the sensor is used to place, retrieve, and/or display a digital element. For example, a current location and orientation of device <b>102</b> is obtained from sensor <b>110</b> and this information is used to determine which digital element to render on a screen of device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Digital element reference location device <b>120</b> is connected to server <b>106</b> via network <b>104</b>. In an example, a digital element is to be located at a location relative to a dynamically updated reference location (e.g., the digital element representative of a user is to be located at a location of a tracking device of the user) of digital element reference location device <b>120</b> and device <b>120</b> provides to server <b>106</b> a current location of device <b>120</b> that is utilized to update a location of its corresponding digital element.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, as reference location device <b>120</b> is moved in the physical world, reference location device <b>120</b> provides to server <b>106</b> via network <b>104</b> its location. This location information is then used to update the locations of one or more corresponding digital elements with locations that are linked to the location of reference location device <b>120</b>. Examples of reference location device <b>120</b> include a mobile device, a computer device, a vehicle, a tag device, a beacon device, a location tracking device, a smart watch, a digital collar, and any radio signal emitting device. In some embodiments, location information of reference location device <b>120</b> is received/detected by an external device (e.g., hub/beacon signal receiving device) that provides the location information to server <b>106</b> via network <b>104</b>. Digital element reference location device <b>120</b> includes one or more sensors and/or transmitters. Examples of these sensors and transmitters include a Global Positioning System (GPS) sensor, a wireless local area (Wifi) network sensor/transmitter, a personal area communication (e.g., Bluetooth) sensor/transmitter, a cellular signal radio/sensor, accelerometer, a gyroscope sensor, a device orientation sensor, a light sensor, a camera, a proximity sensor, and/or a microphone that can be utilized to detect a location of device <b>120</b>. A location of device <b>120</b> may be determined based on information detected by device <b>120</b> (e.g., detected GPS location) and/or based on a transmitted signal/information collected by sensors on other devices (e.g., based on signal detected by external beacons/hubs). For example, device <b>120</b> emits a signal that can be detected by other devices to determine (e.g., based on triangulation of signal strength) a location of device <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The digital element corresponding to device <b>120</b> may be specified to be located at a fixed relative distance offset from a reference location (e.g., reference location of device <b>120</b>) in a specified direction away from the reference location. In some embodiments, the digital element is to be located at the longitude and latitude coordinate of the reference location of the reference location device but a vertical height location of the digital element has been set to be a fixed value (e.g., fixed height value or fixed relative height angle relative to a viewing platform). In some embodiments, a plurality of digital elements are placed with respect to a reference location of device <b>120</b>. For example, digital elements are placed with respect to different offsets from the reference location of device <b>120</b>. In various embodiments, there exists many different reference locations of devices for various different digital elements associated with dynamic locations.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, storage <b>112</b> stores configuration information, preferences, content cached information, a list/database, and/or other information associated with one or more digital elements. For example, storage <b>112</b> includes user configuration information and a cached database of digital elements located near device <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, device <b>102</b> provides an augmented reality view displayed on a screen (e.g., a touch input display) of device <b>102</b>. For example, an environment such as an image captured by a camera (e.g., sensor <b>110</b>) of device <b>102</b> is modified to include a visual, sonic (e.g., audio), and/or somatic (e.g., tactile) representation of a digital element placed at a physical location depicted in the captured image.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the location where the digital element is placed on the captured image is determined using a detected location of device <b>102</b>. For example, a geographical location of device <b>102</b> is determined at least in part by using sensor <b>110</b> and the relative location of the digital element with respect to the device is calculated. Using the calculated relative location, the digital element is rendered on an augmented reality view displayed on a screen of device <b>102</b>. For example, the digital element is associated with a geographical location coordinate and a heading (e.g., compass degree), and a distance between the detected location of device <b>102</b> and the location coordinate of the digital object is calculated. Using the heading and distance, the digital object may be rendered on a display of device <b>102</b> when a field of view of an augmented reality view displayed on the display includes the heading of the digital object (e.g., size of digital object may be scaled using the distance).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The detected location of device <b>102</b> may be unstable and change over time due to errors and limitations of using sensor <b>110</b> to detect the location. When the detected location is fluctuating even though the device is stationary, a digital element may seem to move around erratically in the augmented reality environment due to the changing relative location of the device with respect to a geographical location coordinate where the digital object is located. In order to stabilize the appearance of the digital object's perceived location yet allow for intended movement of the device to be accurately registered, a detected location of device <b>102</b> may be filtered to reduce the relative rate of change in motion of the digital object in the augmented reality environment. For example, the digital object is only allowed to move at most at a maximum predetermined rate. In another example, one or more previous consecutively detected locations of device <b>102</b> are averaged with the new location to determine an averaged new location that is utilized to determine a filtered new relative position.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A user may navigate the augmented reality view by moving device <b>102</b> (e.g., augmented reality observing platform) in the physical world and a corresponding view of the physical world captured by the camera of device <b>102</b> is augmented with visual, audio, tactile (e.g., haptic feedback) and other somatosensory representations of digital elements at appropriate locations and displayed on a screen of device <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, rather than using images from a camera of device <b>102</b> to display the augmented reality world, a previously captured image and/or a virtual image may be utilized. In some embodiments, a user may retrieve/capture a digital element by performing a gesture with device <b>102</b> at an appropriate physical location by performing an input movement (e.g., touch detected on a touch screen of device <b>102</b> or a specific physical movement of device <b>102</b> detected by sensor <b>110</b>).</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, because the rendered location of the digital element may be unstable and change over time due to errors and limitations of using sensor <b>110</b> to detect the device location and variations in a dynamic location of the digital element (e.g., due to errors and limitations of detecting a reference location of reference location device <b>120</b> corresponding to the digital element), a digital object rendered on an augmented reality view displayed on a display of device <b>102</b> may be biased to remain on the display. For example, if a calculated heading of the digital object meets a criteria (e.g., heading of the digital object is within a preset range of a center heading of a field of view of the augmented reality view), the rendered location (e.g., heading) of the digital object is biased using a center heading of a field of view of the augmented reality view displayed on device <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, a user may retrieve/capture a digital element by hovering over the digital object for a preset amount of time. For example a center of a display of device <b>102</b> displays a target selection area (e.g., cross hairs) and when the digital object is aimed in the target selection area for at least a predetermined amount of time, the digital object is retrieved/captured. In some embodiments, because the rendered location of the digital element may be unstable and change over time due to errors and limitations of using sensor <b>110</b> to detect the device location, it may be difficult to aim and maintain the digital object within the target selection area. In some embodiments, a digital object rendered on an augmented reality view displayed on a display of device <b>102</b> may be biased to remain within a target selection area if the digital object is placed within the target area. For example, if a calculated heading of the digital object meets a criteria (e.g., heading of the digital object is within a preset range of a center heading of a target area of a field of view of the augmented reality view displayed on a screen of a viewing device), the rendered location (e.g., heading) of the digital object is biased using a heading pointed by the view device (e.g., heading pointed by orientation of device <b>102</b>).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, a user may retrieve/capture a digital element by touching and/or holding (e.g., for a predetermined amount of time) the digital object on a touch input screen of the device.

In some embodiments, application <b>108</b> communicates with server <b>106</b> to obtain one or more digital elements located near a location detected by sensor <b>110</b>. For example, a location detected by sensor <b>110</b> is provided to server <b>106</b> and server <b>106</b> provides a list of digital elements (e.g., obtained from storage <b>114</b>) that are located near the location and allowed to be accessed by a user of device <b>102</b>. A location of a digital element may be a dynamically updated location based on a current location of a reference location device (e.g., reference location device <b>120</b>) provided to server <b>106</b> by the reference location device <b>120</b>.

In some embodiments, the location is at least in part determined to be a current physical location of a device being used to place the digital element. In some embodiments, at least a portion of the location of the digital element to be placed is automatically determined using one or more of the following associated with the device being used to place the digital element: GPS data, an Internet Protocol (IP) address, a Wifi positioning data, a cellular signal positioning data, a captured image (e.g., machine vision utilizing visual pattern matching to determine location), a captured audio, and a user provided location identifier. In some embodiments, the digital element is only allowed to be placed at the physical location of the device being used to place the digital element. In some embodiments, the digital element may be placed within a geographical boundary associated with the device being used to place the digital element. For example, the digital element may be placed within a specified distance from the location of the device. In some embodiments, the digital element may be placed in any location regardless of the device location. In some embodiments, the digital element may be placed at a location specified by a user. For example, a user may select a location from a map where the digital element is to be placed. In some embodiments, a user may specify a location within an environment view displayed on the device. For example, a user may select a location in an image captured by a camera on the device. In some embodiments, the location of the digital element includes a location point. In some embodiments, the location of the digital element includes a region. In some embodiments, the location associated with digital element is dynamically modified.

In some embodiments, a first user may predefine (e.g., using a map, GPS, etc.) one or more locations for the first user and another user indicates to place the digital element at one or more predefined locations of the first user. For example, a sender user places a message/photo for a recipient user at a predefined home location of the recipient user. In some embodiments, a user placing the digital element does not know the actual location of the predefined location of the recipient. For example, a sender indicates to place the digital element at a predefined location of the recipient based on a text description of the predefined location without having access to the exact location of the predefined location. In some embodiments, a sender indicates to send the digital element to the recipient and the digital element is automatically placed at a predetermined default location for the recipient.

For example, the digital element is placed at a relative location relative to the location of another digital object. In some embodiments, the location associated with the digital element is a location relative to a dynamic location that may change. For example, a user indicates to place the digital object at a location relative to a dynamic current location of an object/device (e.g., relative to current location of a reference device) and the current location of the reference device (e.g., device <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) may change as the object/device is moved. When a change in the location of the reference object/device is received/detected, the corresponding location of the digital element is updated. For example, a server receives location updates of a reference location device (e.g., data indicating current location of the device) periodically and/or dynamically when the location of the reference location device is changed. In some embodiments, a specified location relative to another dynamic reference location may include a distance, a direction, and/or a location coordinate offset relative to the dynamic reference location. For example, when a new dynamic reference location is detected, the corresponding location of a digital element is calculated by applying the offset to the reference location and the location of the digital element updated.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the location associated with the digital element is the dynamic reference location. For example, the digital element is to be located at a location of a physical object (e.g., located at mobile device of a recipient) that can be dynamically moved in the physical world. The dynamic reference location may be dynamically determined based on a GPS, a beacon, Wifi, local area network signals, and/or cellular signals. In another example, the dynamic location may be dynamically specified/modified by a user. For example, the dynamic location is a location specified by a user rather than an automatically determined location. In some embodiments, a default relative location is utilized. For example, a user specifies to associate the digital element with a device and the digital element is placed at a default relative location relative to the dynamic current location of the device.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">At <b>308</b>, the digital element is finalized for placement.

For example, determining the physical location includes determining the physical location of device <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In some embodiments, determining the location includes automatically determining a location using one or more of the following: GPS data, an IP address, a Wi-Fi positioning data, a cellular signal positioning data, a captured image (e.g., machine vision utilizing visual pattern matching to determine location), a captured audio, and a user provided location identifier. In some embodiments, a user may specify a location identifier. For example, a user may select a location from a map. In some embodiments, the location cannot be specified by a user and must be determined using detected information. In some embodiments, determining the location includes at least in part detecting a location and at least in part receiving a user provided location identification. For example, a general location is detected using one or more location sensors and a user is provided a plurality of possible locations within the general location for selection. In some embodiments, determining the location includes using information from sensor <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

For example, the user configuration includes an identification of one or more types, users, distance values, and/or other filters/preferences associated with digital elements desired by a user. In one example, digital elements that have been specifically sent to a recipient user and associated with the determined location are requested. In another example, digital elements placed by one or more users that are socially connected to a recipient user and associated with the determined location are requested. In another example, digital elements placed by one or more users that are followed/subscribed by a recipient user and associated with the determined location are requested. The determined location may be used to identify relevant digital elements that are near the determined location (e.g., within a predetermined, user configured, and/or dynamically determined distance from the determined location).

Examples of the metadata include information about a digital element, a rule defining how and/or when a digital element can be obtained (e.g., time restriction associated with a digital element), information about a visual representation of a digital element (e.g., image/animation to be rendered to display a visual representation of a digital element in an augmented reality view), information about a sonic representation of a digital element (e.g., sound to be rendered to indicate a representation of a digital element in an augmented reality world), information about a somatic representation of a digital element (e.g., tactile/haptic feedback to be rendered to indicate a representation of a digital element in an augmented reality world), and information about a notification associated with a digital element (e.g., vibration, sound notification, or other somatosensory notification, if any, when near a digital element). In some embodiments, one or more digital elements identified in the received identification are selected using one or more user preferences. For example, a user may be only interested in a specified type of digital element. In another example, a user may be only interested in digital element(s) placed by a specific user. In some embodiments, the identification of one or more elements is periodically and/or dynamically received. For example, as a physical location of a device receiving the identification changes and/or as digital elements are updated, updated identification is received as updated and/or at a periodic interval.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, one or more digital elements identified in the identification are associated with a notification.

In some embodiments, determining the world view includes determining an orientation of the device. For example, a user may navigate an augmented reality world by moving the device in the physical world and a corresponding view of the physical world captured by the camera of the device is augmented with visual, sonic and/or somatic representations of digital elements at appropriate locations and displayed on a screen of the device. In some embodiments, the world view is to be augmented to provide the augmented reality view with a rendered visual, sonic and/or somatic representation of a digital element. In some embodiments, an image captured by a camera (e.g., sensor <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the device is to be modified to include a visual representation of the digital element placed at a location depicted in the captured image. In some embodiments, rather than using images from a camera of the device to display the augmented reality world, determining the world view that includes obtaining a previously captured image and/or a virtual image may be utilized (e.g., an image matching a current location and orientation of the device).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The detected orientation of the device may be used to determine whether and where a digital element (e.g., placed using the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) should be rendered on screen of the device.

In some embodiments, determining the orientation of the device includes utilizing one or more sensors (e.g., sensor <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) of the device. For example, one or more of the following sensors are utilized to detect the orientation: an accelerometer, a compass, a gyroscope, and an orientation sensor.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments, determining the orientation includes determining a horizontal heading/bearing pointed by the orientation of the device. For example, a compass directional bearing (e.g., numerical degree, compass direction, etc.) pointed by a camera of the device (e.g., pointing in the direction perpendicularly away from rear surface of device) in the plane of the earth horizon is determined. In some embodiments, the horizontal heading/bearing of the device is the center horizontal heading/bearing of a world view shown on a display of the device.

In some embodiments, the digital element to be rendered is associated with an augmented reality view to be displayed on a screen of a viewing device such as device <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, an identification of digital element(s) physically located near the device was received in step <b>508</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and stored in a storage such as storage <b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In some embodiments, only digital elements located within a specified distance from the viewing device are to be rendered. The specified distance may be preset and/or configurable. For example, using a slider, a user is able to adjust the distance value to increase or decrease the number of digital elements to be eligible to be rendered. A user may utilize the device to display an augmented reality view of the surrounding physical location, and if a digital element identified in the identification is physically located in the location to be displayed in the augmented reality view, the digital element is selected to be rendered. In some embodiments, selecting the digital element includes comparing a detected physical location and orientation of a viewing device with placement locations associated with identified digital elements and selecting one or more digital elements that are within the displayed augmented reality world view (e.g., located within a location depicted in an image captured with a camera of the device).</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some embodiments, one or more digital elements that are located within captured image view are selected from a group of eligible digital elements (e.g., elements received in <b>508</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) at least in part by using a determined heading/bearing of the device and a field of view of an augmented reality view to be displayed by the device. For example, for each digital element of the group of digital elements, a directional heading/bearing (e.g., horizontal and/or vertical heading/bearings) from a determined location of the device to the digital element is determined, and a digital element is selected to be rendered if a heading/bearing of the digital element is within a field of view range from a heading/bearing pointed by the device (e.g., determined in <b>602</b>).

The tilt component of the location coordinate of the digital element may be defined as a fixed tilt angle above a zero tilt angle of the device.

In one example, a digital object is located at 160 degrees horizontal bearing direction from the device and the device is pointing towards 150 degrees in the horizontal bearing direction. In this example, the digital object is to be rendered because the camera of the device has a 30 degree horizontal angle of view, which means that the device is able to view +/&#x2212;15 degrees (i.e., half of angle of view on each side) from the horizontal bearing direction (150 degrees) of the device, and the 160 degrees direction of the digital element is within this range (i.e., within 135-165 degrees range centered around horizontal bearing direction of the device). In the vertical direction, the digital object of the example is located at 50 degrees in the vertical bearing direction and the device is pointing towards 45 degrees in the vertical bearing direction, so the digital object is to be rendered because the camera of the device has a 40 degree vertical angle of view, which means that the device is able to view +/&#x2212;20 degrees (i.e., half of angle of view on each side) from the 45 degrees vertical bearing direction of the device, and the 50 degrees bearing direction of the digital element is within this range (i.e., within 25-65 degrees range centered around vertical bearing direction of the device).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The field of view range may depend on specifications (e.g., angle of view range determined using lens focal length and sensor size of the camera) of a camera (e.g., sensor <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that captured an image displayed as the augmented reality world environment.

For example, for each digital element to be rendered, a distance between the digital element and the viewing device is determined and a rendering size of the digital element may be at least in part proportional (e.g., smaller if further away and larger if closer) to the distance. In some embodiments, if a digital element is selected to be rendered, a representation of the digital element may be scaled between a maximum size and a minimum size based on a distance between the digital element and a viewing device.

In some embodiments, each of the selected digital elements is associated with a horizontal heading and a vertical heading that have been determined based on a placement location of the element with respect to a detected location of a viewing device.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In order to place the selected visual representation of the digital element, a display displaying the augmented reality environment is divided/mapped/labeled into screen locations identified by horizontal and vertical heading coordinates (e.g., within horizontal and vertical field of view ranges of the device from a horizontal and vertical heading pointed by an orientation of the viewing device). For example, a horizontal heading and a vertical heading pointed by the orientation of the device are set as the center of the displayed augmented reality world view with reference to the perpendicular heading coordinate axis radiating out from the center in both the horizontal and vertical directions (e.g., respective ends of the axis at the edges of the displayed augmented reality world view correspond to ends of field of view range of the device). A selected representation of the digital element may be placed in this axis corresponding to its determined horizontal and vertical headings. In one example, a camera of a device with a 30 degree horizontal angle of view is pointing towards horizontal bearing direction of 150 degrees (i.e., the horizontal axis of the augmented reality world view is divided from 135 degrees to 165 degrees), and the camera has a 40 degree vertical angle of view and is pointing towards vertical bearing direction of 45 degrees (i.e., the vertical axis of the augmented reality world view is divided from 25 degrees to 65 degrees).</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, a tilt angle/direction is utilized instead of the vertical heading when determining the placement location of the digital element. In some embodiments, the location associated with the digital element is dynamically modified. For example, a region associated with the digital element becomes smaller and/or larger based at least in part on a time value, an elapsed time, a number of times the digital element has been obtained, and/or any other changing factor. In another example, the digital element's placement location is changed due to movement of the digital element (e.g., due to dynamically updated location of a corresponding reference location device) and/or movement of the device used to explore the augmented reality world. In some embodiments, in order to stabilize a location of a digital element, the digital element's placement location is not modified due to change in detected location of the device.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">At <b>610</b>, the determined visual representation of the digital element is rendered over the determined world view. In some embodiments, rendering the visual representation includes superimposing the selected visual representation of the digital element (e.g., appropriately scaled/skewed following visual perspective rules based on a distance between a viewing device and digital element location) at the appropriate determined location on the determined world view corresponding to the location of the digital element (e.g., a selected representation of the digital element may be placed at its corresponding horizontal and vertical headings on a heading coordinate axis dividing/mapping/labeling locations on viewing device display). The created augmented reality view displays the digital element as being placed within the augmented reality world. As the device moves closer to the location of the digital element, the visual representation of the digital element may be scaled (e.g., to become larger) to follow visual perspective rules in creating an illusion that the user is approaching the digital element. The digital element may be animated to allow the digital element to move in the augmented reality world view. In some embodiments, the rendering of the digital element is associated with an audio, tactile and/or other somatosensory feedback. For example, an audio, tactile and/or other somatosensory feedback may be provided via the device to indicate the digital element.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, if a large number of visual representations of the digital elements are rendered close together (e.g., because they are all located in very close orientation from the viewing device), it may be difficult for a user to tell the digital elements apart and/or select a desired digital element. In some embodiments, when visual representations of the digital elements overlap, only the closest one to the view device may be eligible as selectable. In some embodiments, a user is able to zoom in and out (e.g., using pinch to zoom) of the world view and corresponding visual representations of the digital element are also made larger and smaller according to the zoom. This may enable a user to better distinguish and/or select a representation of a desired digital element among a cluster of visual representations of the digital elements. In some embodiments, a random noise factor is added to placement locations of clustered/overlapping visual representations to assist in visually separating the visual representations of the digital elements.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, a two-dimensional overhead view of locations of digital elements with respect to the viewing device is provided. For example, an overhead radar view is shown, where the center of the radar view represents the location of the viewing device and dots representing different digital elements surrounding the viewing device are mapped around the center with respect to the distance (e.g., further away digital element is shown further away from the center) and orientation (e.g., current horizontal orientation and field of view of the viewing device is indicated and respective directions of digital elements are shown) from the viewing device. The two-dimensional overhead view may be provided together with the augmented reality world view (e.g., radar view shown in a corner). In some embodiments, a user is able to switch between augmented reality world view and two-dimensional overhead view based on a tilt of the viewing device. For example, when a vertical tilt of the viewing device (e.g., detected using a tilt/gyroscope sensor) exceeds a threshold, the augmented reality world view is shown and when the vertical tilt of the viewing device is below the threshold, the overhead view is shown.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some embodiments, a rendering size of a digital element is calculated using real distance between user position and location assigned to the digital element.

In some embodiments, determining the directional heading for each of the one or more digital elements includes determining a vertical heading/bearing pointed by the orientation of the device. For example, a vertical directional bearing (e.g., numerical degree, etc.) in the plane perpendicular to the earth horizon from the height/altitude of the filtered current location to the height/altitude location of the digital element is determined. The height/altitude of the filtered location may be an altitude of the device at least in part detected using a sensor (e.g., GPS) or a preset default reference height (e.g., set as reference height of zero). The height/altitude location of the digital element may be an altitude or tilt of the device at least in part detected using a sensor (e.g., detected at <b>306</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) or a predetermined reference height offset from the height/altitude of the filtered location (e.g., three feet above the height/altitude of the filtered location).</p><p id="p-0119" num="0124">In an alternative embodiment, the target rendering coordinate of each of the one or more digital elements is not updated after it is initially determined.

In some embodiments, the target rendering coordinate of the digital element is the target rendering coordinate updated in <b>710</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> (e.g., updated due to movement of viewing device and/or movement of a reference location device of a dynamic location of a digital element). In some embodiments, the current rendering coordinate is associated with a location where a visual representation of the digital element is currently placed within an augmented reality environment. For example, the current rendering coordinate includes a directional heading/bearing (e.g., horizontal and/or vertical headings) and a distance between a location of the digital element and a current location of a viewing device that indicate a rendering location of a visual representation of the digital element.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0127">In some embodiments, a visual representation of the digital element is to be eventually visually animated towards the target rendering coordinate. For example, the rendering coordinate of the digital element may be specified relative to a current location of a viewing device and if the current location of the viewing device changes (e.g., due to location sensor error and/or physical movement of the viewing device) and/or a dynamic location of a digital element changes (e.g., due to location sensor error and/or physical movement of the reference location device associated with the digital element), the rendering location of the digital element needs to be modified to reflect the movement of the viewing device location and/or digital element. However, sudden movement of a visual representation of the digital element to a new rendering location may seem unnatural to a user if the visual presentation jumps from one new location to another. Additionally, a digital element that unpredictably moves around at a fast speed may be difficult for a user to select/capture. Thus, by animating movement of the visual representation of the digital element from its old location to a new location in a controlled manner (e.g., travel speed limited), movement of the visual representation may appear natural and predicable to a user.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0128">In some embodiments, determining the preliminary next rendering coordinate includes determining whether a difference between the current rendering coordinate and the target rendering coordinate differs beyond a threshold. For example, if the difference is at or below the threshold (e.g., threshold associated with a maximum rate of change, maximum coordinate value change, etc.), the preliminary next rendering coordinate is set as the target rendering coordinate and if the difference is above the threshold, the preliminary next rendering coordinate is set by modifying the current rendering coordinate up to the threshold for each component of the preliminary next rendering coordinate such that the preliminary next rendering coordinate is closest to the target rendering coordinate (e.g., preliminary next rendering coordinate is progressing towards the target rendering coordinate at a rate limited by a threshold maximum rate of change). In some embodiments, the target rendering coordinate is set as the preliminary next rendering coordinate regardless of the difference between the current rendering coordinate and the target rendering coordinate.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0129">At <b>804</b>, the preliminary next rendering coordinate is modified using a motion randomization component. For example, a visual representation of the digital element is desired to appear wavering/hovering (e.g., constantly moving slightly in random directions near the preliminary next rendering coordinate) even if the detected location of a viewing device has not changed. By constantly moving/animating the visual representation of the digital element within the augmented reality environment, a user is informed that the rendered location of the digital element within the augmented reality environment may fluctuate and is subject to change. Thus when the visual representation of the digital element is moved within the augmented reality environment (e.g., due to GPS error, viewing device movement, etc.), the user is not surprised that the visual representation is moving.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0130">In some embodiments, modifying the preliminary next rendering coordinate includes modifying the preliminary next rendering coordinate by adding a Brownian motion component to the preliminary next rendering coordinate. In some embodiments, a directional component of the randomization component is added to a directional component of the preliminary next rendering coordinate. In some embodiments, a distance component of the randomization component is added to a distance component of the preliminary next rendering coordinate. In some embodiments, determining the motion randomization component includes utilizing the current rendering coordinate and the preliminary next rendering coordinate. For example, a random factor portion of a difference between the current rendering coordinate and the preliminary next rendering coordinate is utilized in determining the randomization component. In some embodiments, the randomization component is determined using a random number generator. In some embodiments, the randomization component is limited in magnitude. For example, the randomization component is proportional to the difference between the current rendering coordinate and the preliminary next rendering coordinate. The motion randomization component may also assist in being able to visual separate clustered/overlapping visual representations of digital elements.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0131">At <b>806</b>, the modified preliminary next rendering coordinate is set as the next rendering coordinate. For example, the resulting preliminary next rendering coordinate modified in <b>804</b> is set as the next rendering coordinate. In some embodiments, the next rendering coordinate identifies the next rendering location where a visual representation of the digital element is to be located. For example, the visual representation of the digital element is to be visually moved with movement animation from its current rendering coordinate to the next rendering coordinate. The next rendering coordinate may include a directional heading/bearing (e.g., horizontal and/or vertical headings) and a distance between a location of the next rendering coordinate and a current location of a viewing device.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0132">At <b>808</b>, a visual representation of the digital element is animated from the current rendering coordinate to the next rendering coordinate. In some embodiments, animating the visual representation includes visually moving the visual representation within an augmented reality environment. For example, the visual representation of the digital element is rendered over a determined world view (e.g., world view determined in <b>602</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) in successively different appropriate locations (e.g., appropriately scaled/skewed following visual perspective rules based on a distance between a viewing device and digital element location) on the determined world view corresponding to the travel path from the current rendering coordinate to the next rendering coordinate. In some embodiments, animating the visual representation using cubic interpolation and/or other interpolation-based animation to animate movement of the visual representation from the current rendering coordinate to the next rendering coordinate is used.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0133">At <b>810</b>, the current rendering coordinate is updated with the value of the next rendering coordinate.

It may be desired to bias a rendering coordinate of the digital element to allow the digital element to be more easily selected by a user. For example, due to errors of determining an exact location of a viewing device, a visual representation of the digital element rendered using the rendering coordinate specified relative to a location of the viewing device may be moving within an augmented virtual reality environment. A user may select/capture the digital element to obtain additional digital content associated with the digital element by touching the visual representation displayed on a screen of the viewing device and/or orientating the view device such that a selection aim area (e.g., stationary crosshairs displayed on the center of the display screen of the view device) is placed over the digital element for at least a predetermined amount of time. However, if the visual representation is moving on the screen due to the fluctuations in the detected physical location of the view device, it may be difficult for the user to select the visual representation and/or orient the view device quickly enough to keep the moving visual representation within the selection aim area and/or touch the visual representation.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0136">In some embodiments, determining whether the rendering coordinate meets the bias criteria includes determining whether the digital element has been indicated by a user. For example, it is determined whether a visual representation of the digital element has been indicated with a touch selection input on a touch input screen of a viewing device. In another example, it is determined whether a visual representation of the digital element is within a selection aim area of a display of the viewing device (e.g., determine whether a center of the visual representation is currently placed within a displayed outlined area where the associated digital element is captured after the visual representation is placed within the area for a predetermined amount of time).</p><p id="p-0132" num="0137">In some embodiments, the rendering coordinate includes a directional component (e.g., a horizontal/vertical directional heading/bearing) and a distance component (e.g., distance between a location of the digital element and a current location of a viewing device). In some embodiments, determining whether the rendering coordinate meets the bias criteria includes determining whether a directional component of the rendering coordinate is within a determined range. For example, it is determined whether the heading of the rendering coordinate is within a threshold range (e.g., field of view range determined in <b>604</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) from a current heading of a viewing device (e.g., current heading determined in <b>602</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). By determining whether the heading of the rendering coordinate and the heading of the viewing device is within a threshold difference, it may be determined whether the viewing device is pointing towards (e.g., selecting aiming area is at the horizontal center of the screen of a viewing device) the rendering coordinate of the digital element. In another example, it is determined whether the visual representation of the digital element is being displayed on a screen of the viewing device by determining whether the directional component of the rendering coordinate is within the field of view of headings being displayed on the screen (e.g., headings included in field of view range determined in <b>604</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0133" num="0138">If at <b>902</b> it is determined that the digital element's rendering coordinate meets a bias criteria, at <b>904</b>, a second rendering coordinate of the digital element is modified in a manner associated with the bias criteria. The second rendering coordinate may be the target rendering coordinate determined in <b>706</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and/or the next rendering coordinate determined in <b>806</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0139">In some embodiments, modifying the second rendering coordinate includes biasing a directional component of the next rendering coordinate using a detected current heading (e.g., detected at <b>602</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) of a viewing device. For example, it is desired for a visual representation of the digital element to remain within the directional headings viewable in the angle of view of the viewing device by biasing the second rendering location of the visual representation of the digital element to be moved towards the center of directional heading pointed by the viewing device. Biasing the directional component of the second rendering coordinate using the detected current heading may include setting the direction component of the second rendering coordinate as a weighted sum of the original direction component of the second rendering coordinate and the directional heading pointed by the viewing device.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0140">In some embodiments, modifying the second rendering coordinate includes biasing a directional component of the second rendering coordinate using a directional heading associated with a selection aim area displayed on a viewing device. For example, it is desired for a visual representation of the digital element to remain within the selection aim area by biasing the second rendering location of the visual representation of the digital element to remain/move towards the center of selection aim area. Biasing the directional component of the second rendering coordinate using the directional heading associated with a selection aim area may include setting the direction component of the second rendering coordinate as a weighted sum of the original direction component of the second rendering coordinate and the current directional heading where the selection aim area is located.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0141">In some embodiments, modifying the second rendering coordinate of the digital element includes not updating the second rendering coordinate of the digital element and allowing the digital element to remain in its current rendering location. For example, at <b>904</b>, the next rendering coordinate in <b>806</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is modified to be the current rendering coordinate rather than the modified preliminary next rendering coordinate. In another example, at <b>904</b>, the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is paused/stopped until the digital element no longer meets the bias criteria. In another example, at <b>904</b>, the target rendering coordinate in <b>706</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is modified to be not updated in <b>706</b>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0142">If at <b>902</b> it is determined that the digital element's rendering coordinate does not meet the bias criteria, the process ends. The process may return to <b>902</b>. For example, the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> may be repeated at a periodic interval and/or dynamically (e.g., when an orientation and/or location of a viewing device is updated).</p><p id="p-0138" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating an embodiment of a process for retrieving a rendered digital element. The process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> may be at least in part implemented in device <b>102</b> and/or sever <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is used at least in part to obtain content of a digital element rendered in an augmented reality view. For example, the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is used to provide a rendered view of a digital element that may be obtained. In some embodiments, although a visual representation of a digital element can be seen on a display screen, the digital element may not be able to be obtained until the device is closer to a location of the digital element. For example, as the device is moved closer to the location of the digital element, a visual, sonic and/or somatic representation of the digital element becomes larger. In some embodiments, when the digital element is able to be obtained, an indication is provided. For example, the visual representation may blink, glow, pulsate, and/or change color to indicate that the element can be obtained. In some embodiments, the device may vibrate and/or emit a sound to indicate that the element can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0144">At <b>1002</b>, an indication of a selected digital element is received. In some embodiments, a displayed digital element that is able to be obtained may be selected to be obtained by providing a gesture input. For example, a visual representation of a digital element that is displayed in an augmented reality view may be selected by a user to be obtained at least in part by touching the visual representation on a touch screen display. In some embodiments, a user may perform a movement/gesture (e.g., detected using an accelerometer, orientation sensor, compass, and/or gyroscope) with a device rendering the digital element to select a digital element to be obtained. For example, a user may be required to swing the device in a semicircular motion to act out capturing the rendered digital element. In another example, a user may be required to rub the visual representation of the desired digital element displayed on a touchscreen surface to act out scratching a scratch card to reveal the digital element contents.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0145">In some embodiments, a user may capture a digital element by hovering over the digital object for a preset amount of time. For example a center of a display of a viewing device (e.g., device <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) displays a target selection area (e.g., cross hairs) and when the digital object is aimed in the target selection area for at least a predetermined amount of time, the digital object is indicated to be retrieved/captured. In some embodiments, a user may indicate to retrieve/capture a digital element by touching and/or holding (e.g., for a predetermined amount of time) the digital object on a touch input screen of the device. For example, a user may touch a rendered digital object on a display of a viewing device to retrieve/capture the digital object. In some embodiments, because the rendered location of the digital element may be unstable and change over time due to errors and limitations of using a sensor to detect the device location, it may be difficult to indicate a moving digital object. The process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> may be utilized to stabilize the digital element.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0146">At <b>1004</b>, the indication is processed.

In some embodiments, the received data may be used to research utilization behavior. In some embodiments, the provided data is used to update configurations associated with the selected digital element.

In some embodiments, the notification shown in screen <b>1104</b> is provided with an audio, tactile and/or other somatosensory notification. In some embodiments, the notification shown in screen <b>1104</b> was provided when the digital element was placed.

For example, the digital element is represented as emitting/reflecting a sound (e.g., music, pulse, tone, voice, sound/voice message, noise, sonar, etc.) and a user attempting to obtain the digital element is provided auditory clues on the relative location of the digital element with respect to a current location of the user. In some embodiments, binaural audio is utilized to indicate distance and/or directionality of a location of a digital element with respect to a user device location. For example, if a digital element is located left of a user device, a sound associated with the digital element is emitted stronger/sooner on the left audio output channel rather than the right audio output channel of the device. In some embodiments, a location (e.g., directionality) of a digital element with respect to a user/device is indicated using inter-aural time differences (e.g., time difference between left and right audio channels). In some embodiments, a location (e.g., distance) of a digital element with respect to a user/device is indicated using audio volume/intensity differences (e.g., sound of digital element rendered by the user device is louder as the user device is moved closer to the location of the digital object). In some embodiments, a location of a digital element with respect to a user/device is indicated using one or more head-related transfer functions (e.g., a response that characterizes how an ear receives a sound from a point in space).</p><p id="p-0146" num="0151"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref> are diagrams illustrating example user interfaces used to interact with digital elements representing users.

In some embodiments, users and their profiles are represented as visualized digital elements, floating as drops (or other visualizations in other embodiments) in an augmented reality/virtual environment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>. In various other embodiments, users could also be represented as sound files or any other type of digital content. The digital element representing a user is associated with a dynamic location based on a device of the user. For example, the digital element is to be located at a location based on a current longitude and latitude of a smartphone device of the user. The smartphone device provides updates on its current location to a server that uses the current location updates to determine a location of the digital element representing the user. The server provides the updated locations of the digital element to other viewing devices that are located near the digital element. Using a combination of a mobile device camera, GPS coordinates, and a gyroscope, these drops are rendered by viewing devices in the real world in the approximate location of each user relative to others. Location data of a digital element is updated so that the location of a user's drop follows the user as the user moves in physical space with the reference location of the user. This allows augmented reality (AR) to represent the location of oneself and others.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0153">A viewing/observing user may select (e.g., &#x201c;catch&#x201d;) another user's drop digital element (e.g., by touching it in the AR camera view). Each drop digital element (i.e., user representation digital element) may represent a profile of a corresponding user represented by the drop digital element. For example, when the drop digital element is selected, information about the corresponding user (e.g., biographical information, contact information, a description of the user, interests of the user, photographs, video, user state, current user emotional state, etc.) is provided. In some embodiments, shops or brands are allowed to be users. In these cases, brands will be allowed to attach coupons, offers, URLs, advertising, cryptocurrency information, etc. to the profile associated with its drop digital element. In some embodiments, a single user may have multiple different identities represented by different drop digital elements. For example, one drop digital element is associated with a professional profile while another drop digital element is associated with a personal relationship profile. Which profile/drop digital element to represent a user may be dynamically changed based on a current location of the user and/or time.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0154">A target user corresponding to a selected digital element is able to be friended or connected to the viewing/observing user as a contact. In some embodiments, the target user corresponding to the selected digital element must approve the connection request before being added as a contact of the viewing user. In some embodiments, once a drop digital element has been selected, the viewing user is able to add (or request to add) the corresponding target user of the drop digital element by swiping down on a visual element or indicate to not add the corresponding target user of the drop digital element by swiping down on the visual element. Once the target user has been added as an approved contact of the viewing user, the viewing user is provided the ability to interact with the target user. For example, users can send text, photos, and location information to each other. This information may be sent either privately (e.g., only the recipient can see it via messaging) or publicly (e.g., all users are able to see it via a public wall).</p><p id="p-0150" num="0155">In some embodiments, each drop digital element may be associated with a chat history. For example, the chat history with a user is accessible via the drop digital element of the user. When a viewing user catches a drop digital element of a target user, in addition to the profile information of the target user, the viewing user is provided access to a history of interactions (e.g., text conversations, photos, locations, etc.) of all the other users that have posted publicly to that users public wall. A user is able to control privacy settings to specify which information or type of information is to be shared with which users or groups of users. In some embodiments, a target user may be added to a contact list of the viewing user based on a specified identifier of the target user rather than requiring the drop digital element of the target user to be captured in the AR view.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0156">In some embodiments, in the augmented reality view of drop digital elements, a visual indication is provided to visually distinguish drop digital elements (e.g., add different color rings) that belong to the viewing user's contact list as compared to those that are not included in the viewing user's contact list. In some embodiments, a visual indication is provided to visually indicate which drop digital elements the viewing user has previously interacted with and which drop digital elements the viewing user has not previously interacted with. For example, drop digital elements that have never been selected by the viewing user previously are displayed inside a water droplet; drop digital elements that have been previously selected and stored in the viewing user's contacts are displayed with a halo surrounding their drop digital element; and drop digital elements that have been previously selected and rejected are displayed with no droplet surrounding them.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0157">In addition to human users, objects, dogs, and other animals may by represented by a digital element. Users might tag a dog, cat, or even a car to be represented as a digital element (e.g., associated with a tracking reference location device). In some embodiments, drop digital elements have the ability to interact with each other independently of their associated users. They may be able to &#x2018;search&#x2019; other digitally tagged locations for content/users and harvest information from their location. Drop digital elements will become a local, foraging search algorithm that adapts to the user's preferences.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0158"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> shows example user interface <b>1202</b> visualizing drop digital elements floating in an augmented reality environment.
