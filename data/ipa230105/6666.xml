EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In isolated gate driver devices, galvanic isolation may be required between a corresponding control stage, which, for example, includes a microcontroller or similar processing unit, which is designed to control operation of the power switches according to a desired logic and operates at low voltage, and a corresponding driving stage, which includes the circuit elements required for driving the same power switches and operates at high voltage.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In particular, the microcontroller, which executes an appropriate control algorithm, is generally required to operate at a certain distance from the power stage in order to prevent any malfunctioning caused by an excessive heat dissipation and by electromagnetic interference (EMI) due to the high-power switching activity.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Galvanic isolation may therefore be required between the control section and the power section so as to minimise the aforesaid undesired effects and moreover guarantee safety of the operators. Based on the applications, the isolation may be of a functional, basic, or double/reinforced type.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In such electrical systems, the use of isolated gate driver devices is therefore envisaged, in order to provide the aforesaid galvanic isolation and thus enable control and driving of the power switches, in particular of the corresponding control terminals (gate terminals).</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an isolated gate driver device <b>1</b> is generally configured to receive from a control stage <b>2</b>, including, for example, a microcontroller, low-voltage switching-control signals, for example pulse-width-modulation (PWM) signals, and to generate (high-voltage) power signals for driving a power stage <b>4</b>, which includes one or more power switches <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In particular, the isolated gate driver device <b>1</b> is configured to provide a galvanic isolation between the control stage <b>2</b> and the power stage <b>4</b>; for example, in a possible embodiment, the isolated gate driver device <b>1</b> comprises: a low-voltage section <b>1</b><i>a, </i>coupled to the control stage <b>2</b>; and a high-voltage section <b>1</b><i>b, </i>coupled to the power stage <b>4</b> and galvanically isolated from the low-voltage section <b>1</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In order to obtain a closed-loop control, the control stage <b>2</b> is moreover required to receive from the power stage <b>4</b> suitable feedback signals, preferably acquired in real time. Furthermore, the feedback signals are required not to be affected by switching noise and to be transferred to the control stage <b>2</b> in a reliable manner, guaranteeing the corresponding integrity.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Known solutions envisage the use of feedback circuit elements, designated as a whole by <b>6</b> in the aforesaid <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, external to the isolated gate driver device <b>1</b>, which include, for example (in a way not illustrated), elements for acquisition and amplification of the feedback signals from the power stage <b>4</b> and isolator elements, for isolated transmission of the feedback signals to the control stage <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Such known solutions have, however, the drawbacks of a difficult integration in a limited area and of a reliability that may be less than expected, in particular during the switching operation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">An isolated gate driver device has moreover been proposed, produced by Texas Instruments under the code UCC5870-Q1, which performs in an integrated manner not only a function of driving of a corresponding power stage based on PWM control signals received from a control stage, but also a function of communication of the feedback signals indicative of the operation of the same power stage.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In particular, this isolated gate driver device integrates: an ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) for receiving the feedback signals and converting them into digital signals (based on timing commands received from the control stage); and a bi-directional communication module, which in particular implements a communication line of a full-duplex type, for communication of these digital signals from a high-voltage section, coupled to the power stage, to a low-voltage section, coupled to the control stage.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The aforesaid isolated gate driver device has the advantage of not requiring external circuit stages, thus enabling in general a saving of area and a greater freedom in the design of the resulting electrical system.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present Applicant has, however, realized that the above device has some drawbacks.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the first place, implementation of the aforesaid bi-directional communication module requires a full-duplex communication in order to constantly update registers of the low-voltage section, preventing any conflicts with possible asynchronous commands arriving from the control stage; the full-duplex communication implies two independent isolation lines (one for transmission and the other for reception) with consequent area occupation.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Moreover, implementation of the bi-directional communication module requires a fast communication protocol for rapidly exchanging the digital signals, before arrival of a new edge of the PWM control signal; a higher speed in general means a higher current consumption.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The possibility of a new sample of the feedback signal not being correctly acquired may moreover arise in the case, for example, where the value of the duty-cycle of the control signal is very small or very high. In particular, this may occur even though an ADC with a very short conversion time (equal to 5.1 &#x3bc;s) is used; in this regard, it may be noted that a short conversion time leads to a consequent reduced immunity to noise.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">To guarantee acquisition as far as possible in real time, the implementation moreover requires transmission of a &#x201c;timestamp&#x201d; on the communication line; this implies a higher burden for the communication protocol.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Moreover, the system does not enable conversions on request by the control stage, which would instead be particularly useful for carrying out diagnostic checks upon switching-on, such as measurement of the gate threshold voltage, or for carrying out a so-called HardWare Self Check (HWSC).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The system also has an upper limit for the switching frequency, equal to 30 kHz, which may prove insufficient for some applications.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an isolated gate driver device <b>10</b> comprises, according to an embodiment of the present solution:</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">a low-voltage section <b>10</b><i>a, </i>which has a control input IN<sub>PWM</sub>, which is designed to receive, from a control stage <b>12</b> of an associated electrical power system <b>100</b>, PWM control signals S<sub>PWM </sub>at a switching frequency f<sub>PWM_HV </sub>(and corresponding switching period T<sub>PWM_HV</sub>) and moreover a feedback output OUT<sub>FB</sub>, which is designed to supply to the control stage <b>12</b> feedback output signals S<sub>out_FB</sub>, indicative of the operation of a power stage <b>14</b> of the electrical power system <b>100</b>, which is coupled to the same isolated gate driver device <b>10</b>;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">a high-voltage section <b>10</b><i>b, </i>galvanically isolated from the low-voltage section <b>10</b><i>a, </i>having a driving output OUT<sub>DRV</sub>, which is designed to supply gate-driving signals V<sub>G </sub>to the power stage <b>14</b>, and a feedback input IN<sub>FB</sub>, which is designed to receive at least one feedback signal S<sub>FB</sub>, indicative of the operation of the same power stage <b>14</b> (it is noted that the feedback input IN<sub>FB </sub>may possible be used in multiplexing, for receiving a plurality of feedback signals S<sub>FB</sub>); and</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">a communication channel <b>15</b>, configured to provide a half-duplex type communication through capacitive coupling between the low-voltage section <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the high-voltage section <b>10</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In a possible embodiment, the low-voltage section <b>10</b><i>a </i>and the high-voltage section <b>10</b><i>b </i>are made with two distinct dies of semiconductor material <b>10</b>&#x2032;, <b>10</b>&#x2033;, separated from one another by a galvanic-isolation barrier <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The aforesaid communication channel <b>15</b> couples in communication the low-voltage and high-voltage sections <b>10</b><i>a, </i><b>10</b><i>b, </i>enabling transfer of information and signals through the aforesaid galvanic-isolation barrier <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In particular, a first communication module (a transceiver module, RX/TX) <b>15</b><i>a </i>in the low-voltage section <b>10</b><i>a </i>(or low-voltage, LV, side) acts as master, sending queries at a given polling frequency f<sub>POL</sub>, for example 20 kHz, according to a question-and-answer (Q&#x26;A) mechanism.
