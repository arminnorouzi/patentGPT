During use, the processor <b>42</b> is configured to communicate with the output maps stored in the memory <b>50</b> by inputting a current set of vehicle operating states (e.g., vehicle speed, vehicle direction, throttle position, and the like) into the output map <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>b</i>, <b>56</b><i>c </i>whereby the output maps <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>b</i>, <b>56</b><i>c </i>return a pre-determined output torque vector.

For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the first output map <b>56</b><i>a </i>is configured to model a &#x201c;torque converter&#x201d; style drivetrain (e.g., a drivetrain having a torque converter for conveying torque between a power source, such as an ICE, and the driven elements <b>22</b>). As such, when the current operating states of the vehicle <b>14</b> are input into the first output map <b>56</b><i>a </i>by the processor <b>42</b>, the first output map <b>56</b><i>a </i>is configured to output a first torque vector <b>60</b><i>a </i>(e.g., a first output direction and a first output torque magnitude) that generally corresponds with the torque vector a torque converter style drivetrain would have output to the driven elements <b>22</b> if it was subject to the same operating states.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Similarly, in the illustrated embodiment, the second output map <b>56</b><i>b </i>is configured to model an &#x201c;eDrive&#x201d; style drivetrain (e.g., a drivetrain where an electric motor is directly connected to the drive elements <b>22</b>).

For example, in some embodiments one or more output maps may be crafted to produce a unique set of outputs based on desired operating characteristics and may not actually model or correspond to any existing form of drivetrain. Such output maps may eliminate certain operating characteristics that are viewed as undesirable and/or emphasize certain operating characteristics viewed as good or necessary. In still other embodiments, customized maps may be developed that modify a map modeling to physical drivetrain style to eliminate or emphasize particular attributes that drivetrain style contains.

By doing so, the user is able to continuously and infinitely adjust the manner in which the vehicle <b>14</b> behaves during operation by changing to what extent each drivetrain type is emphasized. In instances where a user wishes for the vehicle <b>14</b> to act more like a vehicle having a torque converter, the user can select, via the user interface <b>54</b>, to increase the utilization percentage for the first output map <b>56</b><i>a </i>that generally corresponds with the operational outputs of a torque converter. Similarly, if the user wishes to emphasize an eDrive or hydrostatic drive, the user may choose to increase the utilization percentages of the eDrive or the hydrostatic drive maps (e.g., the second output map <b>56</b><i>b</i>, or the third output map <b>56</b><i>c</i>, respectively) while correspondingly lowering the utilization percentage of the torque converter map (e.g., the first output map <b>56</b><i>a</i>).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">In the illustrated embodiment, the user interface <b>54</b> is configured so that the utilization percentages add up to 100%.

In another example, if the user wishes to have an evenly blended operating condition, the user may select 33% utilization for all three maps <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>b</i>, <b>56</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">The current controller <b>18</b> also permits the user to select any utilization percentage between &#x2212;100% to 200% for a given output map. When doing so, a 100% utilization is considered a 1:1 analog for the type of drivetrain system selected. In instances where a &#x201c;negative&#x201d; utilization is selected, the controller <b>18</b> is configured to output signals opposite to what the specific drivetrain would output. For example, if a certain set of operating states would cause an eDrive drivetrain to output a 100 Nm torque in a clockwise direction, a &#x2212;50% utilization percentage would result in the corresponding eDrive target torque value being 50 Nm in an anti-clockwise direction. This calculation would then be combined with the remaining output maps to produce an overall target torque vector <b>74</b> as described above. Operations with a negative utilization percentage are considered &#x201c;anti-drive&#x201d; conditions (e.g., anti-hydrostatic; anti-eDrive; and anti-torque converter).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">In contrast, utilization percentages greater than 100% (e.g., between 100% and 200%) would be considered &#x201c;super-drive&#x201d; conditions causing the controller <b>18</b> to operate in the same general manner in which the underlying drivetrain would operate but with increased torque values. For example, if a certain set of operating states would result in the corresponding eDrive target torque value being 100 Nm in a clockwise direction, a 200% utilization percentage would result in the corresponding eDrive target torque being 200 Nm in a clockwise direction. This calculation would then be combined with the remaining output maps to produce an overall target torque vector <b>74</b> as described above.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">While the above descriptions include three maps <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>b</i>, <b>56</b><i>c</i>, it is understood that in alternative embodiments two maps or more than three maps may also be present in the memory <b>50</b>. In such embodiments, the combined utilization percentages would still add up to 100% overall with each individual map being adjustable between &#x2212;100% and 200% utilization. Furthermore, in instances where more than two maps are present, it is also understood that some maps may be &#x201c;turned off&#x201d; such that the receive a utilization percentage of 0%.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">Still further, while the illustrated embodiment describes the controller <b>18</b> providing electrical current to an electrical motor <b>16</b> to produce the target torque vector <b>74</b>, it is understood that in alternative embodiments a hydraulic or other form of torque generation may be used to generate the output torque <b>34</b>. In such instances, the controller <b>18</b> would output the necessary type of signal so that the torque generation element would produce the needed output torque <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a graphical user interface <b>1000</b> for use with the infinitely adjustable drivetrain <b>10</b> described above. During use, the graphical user interface <b>1000</b> is displayed on the user interface <b>54</b> whereby the user can select each of the utilization percentages <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b</i>, <b>70</b><i>c </i>with a single input. More specifically, the graphical user interface <b>1000</b> includes a grid <b>1004</b> of points <b>1008</b> whereby each point <b>1008</b> represents a combined set of utilization percentages <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b</i>, <b>70</b><i>c </i>that add up to 100%. By selecting a single point <b>1008</b> (e.g., by touching the screen at the point's location or using a curser to select a point), the user is able to select all three utilization percentages <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b</i>, <b>70</b><i>c </i>with a single selection. The layout of the grid <b>1004</b> also provides a more intuitive environment for the user as moving the selected location in a particular direction causes the utilization percentages <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b</i>, <b>70</b><i>c </i>to all rise and fall proportionally and geometrically.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">In the illustrated embodiment, the grid <b>1004</b> is substantially &#x201c;triangular&#x201d; to correspond with the three output maps <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>b</i>, <b>56</b><i>c</i>. More specifically, the grid <b>1004</b> includes three &#x201c;home points&#x201d; <b>1012</b><i>a</i>, <b>1012</b><i>b</i>, <b>1012</b><i>c</i>, each corresponding to a combination of utilization percentages <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b</i>, <b>70</b><i>c </i>that are intended to produce a 1:1 analog of a particular map. For example, the first home point <b>1012</b><i>a </i>produces a 100% utilization of the torque converter map <b>56</b><i>a </i>and 0% utilization of the eDrive and hydrostatic maps <b>56</b><i>b</i>, <b>56</b><i>c</i>. Furthermore, the second home point <b>1012</b><i>b </i>produces 100% utilization of the eDrive map <b>56</b><i>b </i>while having 0% utilization of the hydrostatic and torque converter maps <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>c</i>. Finally, the third home point <b>1012</b><i>c </i>produces 100% utilization of the hydrostatic map <b>56</b><i>c </i>while having 0% utilization of the converter map <b>56</b><i>a </i>and the eDrive map <b>56</b><i>b</i>. Generally speaking, the first, second, and third home points <b>1012</b><i>a</i>, <b>1012</b><i>b</i>, <b>1012</b><i>c</i>, produce a 1:1 analog of the torque converter, the eDrive, and the hydrostatic drive, respectively.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">The grid <b>1004</b> also includes three home axis <b>1016</b><i>a</i>, <b>1016</b><i>b</i>, <b>1016</b><i>c </i>that pass through their corresponding home points <b>1012</b><i>a</i>, <b>1012</b><i>b</i>, <b>1012</b><i>c</i>. Each home axis <b>1016</b><i>a</i>, <b>1016</b><i>b</i>, <b>1016</b><i>c </i>illustrate all possible utilization percentage combinations where the home map is at 100%. For example, the first home axis <b>1016</b><i>a </i>represents all possible utilization percentages where the first torque converter map <b>56</b><i>a </i>has a utilization percentage of 100%.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">Graphically, moving the selected point perpendicular to a home axis <b>1016</b><i>a</i>, <b>1016</b><i>b</i>, <b>1016</b><i>c </i>causes the utilization percentage <b>70</b><i>a</i>, <b>70</b><i>b</i>, <b>70</b><i>c </i>of the corresponding map <b>56</b><i>a</i>, <b>56</b><i>b</i>, <b>56</b><i>c </i>to change. For example, moving the selected point in the first direction A relative to the first home axis <b>1016</b><i>a </i>causes the utilization percentage of the first torque converter map <b>56</b><i>a </i>to decrease. In contrast, moving the selected point in the second direction B relative to the first home axis <b>1016</b><i>a </i>causes the utilization percentage of the first torque converter map <b>56</b><i>a </i>to increase. This same dichotomy holds true for each home axis <b>1016</b><i>b</i>, <b>1016</b><i>c </i>and their corresponding maps <b>56</b><i>b</i>, <b>56</b><i>c</i>, respectively. As such, the utilization percentages for each point in the grid <b>1004</b> is the result of the points combined distances from each of the three home axes <b>1016</b><i>a</i>, <b>1016</b><i>b</i>, <b>1016</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">Together, the three home points <b>1012</b><i>a</i>, <b>1012</b><i>b</i>, <b>1012</b><i>c </i>and the three home axis <b>1016</b><i>a</i>, <b>1016</b><i>b</i>, <b>1016</b><i>c </i>produce a plurality or equilateral triangles or regions <b>1020</b>. All the points <b>1008</b> within a respective region, in turn, shares some common operational attributes.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">For example, all points <b>1008</b> in the first region <b>1020</b><i>a </i>between the three home points <b>1012</b><i>a</i>, <b>1012</b><i>b</i>, <b>1012</b><i>c</i>, include utilization percentage combinations where each entry is between 0% to 100%. This results in standard blended operations. In contrast, the points <b>1008</b> within the second region <b>1020</b><i>b </i>all correspond with points <b>1008</b> where anti-torque converter operations are present (e.g., where the first utilization percentage is negative). Similar attributes are present in the third and fourth regions <b>1020</b><i>c</i>, <b>1020</b><i>d </i>with respect to anti-eDrive and anti-hydrostat drive, respectively. Finally, the fifth, sixth, and seventh regions <b>1020</b><i>e</i>-<i>g </i>generally correspond with &#x201c;super-drive&#x201d; operations where the torque converter, eDrive, and hydrostat drive utilization percentages are greater than 100%, respectively.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">In all, the graphical layout of the grid <b>1004</b> and the points <b>1008</b> contained therein provide the user with an easy to use graphical interface that still displays all possible combinations of the utilization percentages. While the illustrated embodiment includes three home points and home axes corresponding with three active output maps, it is understood that in alternative embodiments more or fewer home points and home axes may be present to accommodate more or fewer output maps. Still further, in some embodiments the interface <b>1000</b> may be configured so that a sub-group of three output maps may be selected from a group greater than three for use in the grid <b>1004</b>.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
