In one implementation, the working fluid can be water. In another implementation, to enable further absorption of carbon dioxide from the volume of air into the working fluid, the working fluid can be treated with solvents configured to increase carbon dioxide absorption.

Further, the housing tube <b>178</b> can extend to a particular depth (e.g., less than 400 feet) below the surface such that the working fluid and entrained air&#x2014;forming the first mixture&#x2014;can be compressed via gravity while flowing vertically downward through the housing tube <b>178</b>.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The housing tube <b>178</b> can be configured to maximize heat transfer between the working fluid and the ground. For example, the housing tube <b>178</b> can be configured to: extend below the surface of the ground to a particular depth in order to maximize a surface area over which heat can transfer between the working fluid and the ground; and include walls of a maximum thickness in order to minimize a distance that heat must travel from the working fluid, through the housing tube <b>178</b>, and to the ground.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">For example, the working fluid can be mixed with air&#x2014;including carbon dioxide and the set of secondary gases&#x2014;to form the first mixture. The first mixture can then flow&#x2014;via gravity&#x2014;down the housing tube <b>178</b> from a surface of the ground toward a particular depth (e.g., 300 feet) below the surface. As the first mixture flows down the housing tube <b>178</b>, the pressure of the first mixture increases at greater depths below the surface, thus enabling absorption of carbon dioxide into the working fluid. Further, the first mixture can flow past a heat exchanger <b>124</b> configured to extract heat from the working fluid, thereby cooling the working fluid and enabling (near) isothermal compression of the first mixture. Heat extracted by this heat exchanger <b>124</b> can be released into the ground for geothermal heat exchange, thereby enabling heat transfer from the atmosphere into the ground.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">At a bottom (i.e., the high-pressure vessel <b>110</b>) of the housing tube <b>178</b>, the high-pressure high-energy secondary gases can separate from the working fluid and dissolved carbon dioxide. These secondary gases can be released from this high-pressure vessel <b>110</b> via the exhaust outlet <b>134</b> travelling upward through the housing tube <b>178</b>. The remaining second mixture&#x2014;including the working fluid and dissolved carbon dioxide&#x2014;can be pumped upward via a fluid return tube within the housing tube <b>178</b>. As the second mixture is pumped upward through the fluid return tube, the pressure of the high-pressure high-energy second mixture decreases at depths closer to the surface of the ground, thus enabling desorption of carbon dioxide from the working fluid. Therefore, at or near the surface of the ground, carbon dioxide can be separated from the working fluid and collected via the collection outlet <b>160</b>.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="2">10. Deployment</heading><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The system <b>100</b> can be deployed to various locations and/or types of locations for sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In particular, the system <b>100</b> includes few moving parts&#x2014;such as the compressor <b>120</b>, the turbine <b>140</b>, and the motor <b>150</b>, each mechanically coupled to a singular driveshaft <b>152</b>&#x2014;thereby enabling rapid assembly and deployment of the system <b>100</b> to various locations. For example, the system <b>100</b> can be assembled in a central facility (e.g., a central factory) and shipped (e.g., in a shipping container) to geographic locations remote from the central facility, such as on a flatbed, a trailer, a ship, and/or an aircraft.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Further, the system <b>100</b> can be scaled based on the location and/or type of location at which the system <b>100</b> will be deployed or installed. For example, a first instance of the system <b>100</b> configured for deployment to a large geographic region&#x2014;such as a geological sequestration site, a power station, and/or a farm&#x2014;can exhibit a first size (e.g., approximating a size of a shipping container) and be configured to intake large volumes of ambient air (e.g., atmospheric air) to sequester large volumes of carbon dioxide (e.g., greater than 100,000 metric tons per year). In this example, a second instance of the system <b>100</b> configured for deployment to a relatively small region&#x2014;such as a home or office building&#x2014;can exhibit a second size smaller than first size, such that the second instance of the system <b>100</b> can be installed within the small region (e.g., mounted to a building, installed within a home or yard). This second instance of the system <b>100</b> can be configured to intake smaller volumes of ambient air to sequester smaller volumes of carbon dioxide in the smaller region.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Once deployed to a particular location, the system <b>100</b> can integrate with existing infrastructure to rapidly install and power the system <b>100</b>. For example, the system <b>100</b> can be configured to access a local power supply (e.g., by connecting the system <b>100</b> into the local power supply)&#x2014;such as corresponding to a size of the system <b>100</b>&#x2014;and immediately begin ingesting ambient air for capturing carbon dioxide.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">For example, a first instance of the system <b>100</b> can be configured for deployment to a first location. This first instance of the system <b>100</b> can be configured to connect to a first power supply of a first magnitude (e.g., a 400-Amp power supply) at the first location to capture carbon dioxide from ambient air at the first location at a first carbon dioxide collection rate (e.g., exceeding 100,000 metric-tons-per-year). Additionally, a second instance of the system <b>100</b> can be configured for deployment to a second location. This second instance of the system <b>100</b> can be configured to connect to a power supply of a second magnitude (e.g., a 30-Amp power supply), less than the first magnitude, at the second location to capture carbon dioxide from ambient air at the second location at a second carbon dioxide collection rate (e.g., less than 100,000 metric-tons-per-year) less than the first carbon dioxide collection rate. Therefore, in this example, instances of the system <b>100</b>&#x2014;exhibiting various sizes based on location of deployment and/or target carbon dioxide collection rate&#x2014;can be configured to access a local power supply (e.g., an existing, local power supply) matched (e.g., proportional) to a size and/or target carbon dioxide collection rate of each instance of the system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Additionally and/or alternatively, in one implementation, the system <b>100</b> can be deployed as a modular unit&#x2014;distributed about a geographic region or location&#x2014;such that each individual unit, in the modular unit, is configured to capture carbon dioxide from the geographic region. In this implementation, the system <b>100</b> can be configured to: operate each unit of the modular unit continuously to continuously capture carbon dioxide from this location; operate each unit of the modular unit at a particular frequency; and/or operate different units of the modular unit over particular periods of time and/or at particular frequencies in order to balance a load of the modular unit.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In one example, the system <b>100</b> can be configured for deployment to a particular geographic location including a power station (e.g., a wind turbine farm, a solar farm, a power plant). In this example, the system <b>100</b> can include a set of modular units of the system <b>100</b> distributed about the particular geographic location, each modular unit, in the set of modular units, configured to intake ambient air from the particular geographic location and capture carbon dioxide from this ambient air. The system <b>100</b> can configured to selectively operate modular units, in the set of modular units, in order to achieve a target carbon dioxide collection rate (e.g., exceeding <b>100</b>,<b>100</b> metric-tons-per-year) at the particular geographic location. Further, the system <b>100</b> can be configured to selectively operate modular units, in the set of modular units, in order to enable load flexibility at this particular geographic location. The system <b>100</b> can therefore: selectively activate (e.g., by selectively accessing power generated by the power station) modular units in the set of modular units; and selectively disable modular units in the set of modular units in order to balance power consumption by the set of modular units and power supply to an electrical grid connected to the power station.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The systems and methods described herein can be embodied and/or implemented at least in part as a machine configured to receive a computer-readable medium storing computer-readable instructions.
