The SOFC is known as a versatile and highly efficient fuel cell. The SOFC is expected as a combined cycle power generation system that can achieve high-efficiency power generation by being combined with a turbocharger. For example, Patent Document 1 and Patent Document 2 each disclose an example of a combined cycle power generation system that includes the SOFC, and a turbocharger for combusting an exhaust fuel gas or exhaust air exhausted from the SOFC.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since an operating temperature of the SOFC is set high in order to increase ion conductivity, in such combined power generation system, it is possible to use air, which has been increased in temperature and pressure by a compressor of the turbocharger, as air (oxidizer) to be supplied to an air electrode side (that is, the compressor or the like functions as a pressurized air supply system). However, since an internal temperature of the SOFC is low at startup, if the compressed air, which has been increased in temperature and pressure, is supplied from the compressor, a condensable gas such as water vapor contained in the compressed air may become a drain and may condense in the SOFC, which causes deterioration in the SOFC.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In Patent Document 3, when air, which has been increased in temperature and pressure by a compressor, is supplied to a fuel cell, a condensable gas contained in air is recovered as a drain in advance by a condenser. Thereby, it is disclosed that the air after the condensable gas is recovered is supplied to an air electrode of the fuel cell, making it possible to prevent the generation of the drain in the fuel cell.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="2">Patent Document 1: JP2018-6004A</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Patent Document 2: JP2018-6003A</heading><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Patent Document 3: JP6081167B</heading><heading id="h-0008" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Document 3 described above requires a condenser for recovering the condensable gas as the drain from the air which has been increased in temperature and pressure by the compressor.

The pressurized air supply system <b>1</b>A is a system for supplying pressurized air to a pressurization object device <b>2</b>. The purpose of supplying the pressurized air to the pressurization object device <b>2</b> may be startup of the pressurization object device <b>2</b> or may be another purpose. Further, the pressurization object device <b>2</b> may be any device that requires pressurized air, and is, for example, a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) that requires pressurized air for operation. In this case, the pressurized air supply system <b>1</b>A is configured to supply pressurized air to an air electrode of the air electrode and a fuel electrode of the SOFC.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The pressurized air supply system <b>1</b>A includes a turbocharger <b>8</b> with a turbocharger compressor <b>4</b> and a turbine <b>6</b>, a recuperator <b>10</b> for performing heat exchange between discharged air discharged from the turbocharger compressor <b>4</b> via a discharged air line <b>5</b> and an exhaust gas exhausted from the turbine <b>6</b>, and a heater <b>14</b> for heating the air that has passed through the recuperator <b>10</b> from the discharged air line <b>5</b>. The turbocharger compressor <b>4</b> compresses air taken in from an air supply source <b>3</b> (atmosphere) and discharges the compressed air to the discharged air line <b>5</b> on the downstream side. The air discharged to the discharged air line <b>5</b> passes through the recuperator <b>10</b>, and then is supplied to the heater <b>14</b>. The heater <b>14</b> is configured to heat the flowing air supplied to the pressurization object device <b>2</b>. The air heated by the heater <b>14</b> is supplied to the pressurization object device <b>2</b> through a heated air line <b>32</b>. The air used in the pressurization object device <b>2</b> is exhausted to the turbine <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">An air supply system <b>16</b> includes a compressor <b>22</b> for pumping the air taken in from the air supply source <b>3</b>, and an air line <b>20</b> communicating with the discharged air line <b>5</b>.

Herein, if the temperature measured by the second temperature measuring device T<b>2</b> is lower than the atmospheric temperature (outside air temperature) measured by the atmospheric temperature measuring device Ta, the air from the air supply source <b>3</b> is increased in temperature by the heater <b>14</b> to prevent the generation of the drain due to moisture in the air.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">After the air from the air line <b>20</b> is supplied to the discharged air line <b>5</b>, the control device <b>60</b> operates the heater <b>14</b> (step S<b>101</b>). Thus, the air from the air line <b>20</b> supplied to the discharged air line <b>5</b> is increased in temperature by the heater <b>14</b>, and then supplied to the pressurization object device <b>2</b>. In the pressurization object device <b>2</b>, by supplying the heated air, the temperature gradually rises (so-called warm-up is performed).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Subsequently, the control device <b>60</b> controls the rotation speed of the compressor <b>22</b> or the opening degree of the fourth flow control valve <b>70</b><i>d </i>such that the temperature measured by the second temperature measuring device T<b>2</b> is higher than a saturated steam temperature (step S<b>102</b>). Thus, the temperature of the flowing air in the pressurization object device <b>2</b> is maintained higher than the saturated steam temperature (dew point), preventing the generation of the drain in the pressurization object device <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The saturated steam temperature used in step S<b>102</b> can be calculated based on the pressure and absolute humidity related to the flowing air of the pressurization object device <b>2</b>. In the present embodiment, the pressure measured by the second pressure measuring device P<b>2</b> is used as the pressure related to the flowing air of the pressurization object device <b>2</b>. Further, the absolute humidity of the atmosphere which is calculated based on the atmospheric temperature (outside air temperature) measured by the atmospheric temperature measuring device Ta, the atmospheric pressure (outside air pressure) measured by the atmospheric pressure measuring device Pa, and the atmospheric air relative humidity measured by the atmospheric air relative humidity measuring device Ha is used as the absolute humidity of the flowing air of the pressurization object device <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition to the atmospheric air relative humidity measured by the atmospheric air relative humidity measuring device Ha, an element for adding water vapor to the air flowing through the system may be considered in calculation of the saturated steam temperature used in step S<b>102</b>. For example, if a burner for generating water vapor in fuel combustion is used as the heater <b>14</b>, the amount of the water vapor generated by the combustion may be estimated based on the supply amount of the fuel input to the burner, and the estimation result may be considered in the calculation of the saturated steam temperature.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the control of the opening degree of the fourth flow control valve <b>70</b><i>d </i>in step S<b>102</b>, if the temperature measured by the second temperature measuring device T<b>2</b> is lower than the atmospheric temperature (outside air temperature) measured by the atmospheric temperature measuring device Ta, the opening degree control may be started after the opening degree of the fourth flow control valve <b>70</b><i>d </i>is initially set to a preset minimum opening degree. Thus, if the pressurization object device <b>2</b> is at the low temperature at the start of the control in step S<b>102</b>, the pressure of the object device can be kept low by suppressing the flow rate of the air to the pressurization object device <b>2</b>, making it possible to suitably prevent the generation of the drain.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Further, the control device <b>60</b> may do monitoring so that the temperature measured by the first temperature measuring device T<b>1</b> does not exceed a preset upper limit temperature threshold, after the heater <b>14</b> is started in step S<b>101</b>.

Therefore, since the pressure of the discharged air from the turbocharger compressor <b>4</b> is also lower than a downstream pressure of the first flow control valve <b>70</b><i>a</i>, the first flow control valve <b>70</b><i>a </i>is fully closed to exhaust the discharged air from the turbocharger compressor <b>4</b> to the outside via the first bypass line <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Subsequently, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, the control device <b>60</b> coordinately controls the opening degrees of the first flow control valve <b>70</b><i>a </i>and the second flow control valve <b>70</b><i>b </i>to start introduction of the discharged air from the turbocharger compressor <b>4</b> (step S<b>103</b>). More specifically, the control device <b>60</b> gradually decreases the opening degree of the second flow control valve <b>70</b><i>b</i>, which is in the fully open state in the initial state, as the output of the turbine <b>6</b> increases, thereby increasing the outlet pressure of the turbocharger compressor <b>4</b> (the pressure measured by the third pressure measuring device P<b>3</b>). Then, if the outlet pressure of the turbocharger compressor <b>4</b> becomes higher than the downstream pressure of the first flow control valve <b>70</b><i>a </i>(P<b>3</b>&#x3e;P<b>1</b>), the opening degree of the first flow control valve <b>70</b><i>a</i>, which is in the fully closed state in the initial state, is gradually increased.
