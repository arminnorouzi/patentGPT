In other words, the viewing permission setting information may be information for setting viewing permission of the live stream of the multimedia conference.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some scenarios, the viewing permission requires that the duration that a live viewer of the multimedia conference views a live stream is not less than a preset duration. The live viewer of the multimedia conference may be a viewer viewing the live stream of the multimedia conference.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In other scenarios, the viewing permission requires that the number of times that the live viewer exits viewing the live stream of the multimedia conference is not more than a preset number of times.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some optional implementations of this embodiment, the viewing permission requires that an identity attribute of each live viewer of the multimedia conference meets a preset condition.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The identity attribute may be an attribute representing the identity of the user. For example, an identity attribute may be an attribute that represents the organization (e.g., institution, business, etc.) to which the user is authenticated.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The preset condition may be a condition preset for the identity attribute of the live viewer.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Therefore, when the identity attribute of the live viewer meets the preset condition, they can have the viewing permission of the live stream of the multimedia conference.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some optional implementations of this embodiment, the preset condition includes: having the same identity attribute as a target participant user with a preset identity.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">A participant user may be a user participating in a multimedia conference. Correspondingly, the target participant user may be a participant user with a preset identity.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The preset identity may be an identity that is set in advance. The target participant user can be distinguished from other conference participant users of the multimedia conference by the preset identity.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Therefore, the live viewer who has the same identity attribute as the target participant user may have the permission to view the live stream of the multimedia conference.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In step <b>102</b>, it is determined whether to push the live stream of the multimedia conference to a requester requesting the live stream, based on an enabling status of live broadcast of the multimedia conference and the viewing permission setting information.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In this embodiment, after receiving the viewing permission setting information, the executive body may determine whether to push the live streaming of the multimedia conference to the requester requesting the live streaming based on the enabling status of live broadcast of the multimedia conference and the viewing permission setting information.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The enabling status of live broadcast may include a status that the live broadcast is enabled and a status that the live broadcast is not enabled.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some scenarios, the viewing permission setting information indicates pushing, when the multimedia conference is in the status that the live broadcast is enabled, the live streaming of the multimedia conference to a requester having a first viewing permission, and pushing, when the multimedia conference is in the status that the live broadcast is not enabled, the live stream of the multimedia conference to a requester having a second viewing permission. Therefore, when the multimedia conference is in the status that the live broadcast is enabled, in response to that a requester has the first viewing permission, the executive body determines to push the live stream of the multimedia conference to the requester. When the multimedia conference is in the status that the live broadcast is not enabled, in response to that a requester has the second viewing permission, the executive body determines to push the live stream of the multimedia conference to the requester.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some optional implementations of this embodiment, the execution subject may perform step <b>102</b> in the following manner.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Specifically, in the status that the live broadcast is not enabled, in response to receiving a live broadcast enabling request for the multimedia conference and determining that the requester has the viewing permission, it is determined to push the live stream of the multimedia conference to the requester.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is understandable that the live broadcast enabling request for the multimedia conference is a request for enabling the live broadcast of the multimedia conference.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Therefore, when the multimedia conference is in the status that the live broadcast is not enabled, when receiving a request for enabling live broadcast of the multimedia conference is received and determining that the requester has the viewing permission for the live stream of the multimedia conference, it is determined to push the live stream of the multimedia conference to the requester.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some optional implementations of this embodiment, before step <b>102</b>, the execution subject may perform the following steps.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Specifically, in response to determining that the requester is not logged into the multimedia conference application, prompt information for logging into the multimedia conference application is sent to the requester, to prompt the requester to log into the multimedia conference application.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">It is understandable that after receiving the prompt information for logging into the multimedia conference application sent by the execution body, the requester may log into the multimedia conference application. Thereby, on the basis that the requester logs into the multimedia conference application, the live stream of the multimedia conference is pushed to the requester.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In step <b>103</b>, in response to determining to push the live stream of the multimedia conference to the requester, the execution body pushes the live stream of the multimedia conference to the requester.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In this embodiment, in response to determining to push the live stream of the multimedia conference to the requester, the execution body may push the live stream of the multimedia conference to the requester.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an application scenario of the live stream pushing method according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

Therefore, by setting the viewing permission of the multimedia conference, the live stream of the multimedia conference is pushed to the requester having the viewing permission. Thus, the flexibility of pushing the live stream of the multimedia conference is improved. Based on the enabling status of live broadcast and viewing permission setting information of the multimedia conference, it is determined whether to push the live streaming of the multimedia conference to the requester requesting the live streaming. Therefore, whether to push the live streaming of the multimedia conference to the requester requesting the live streaming can be determined with reference to both the enabling status of live broadcast and the viewing permission setting information of the multimedia conference.

Therefore, during the live broadcast of the live stream of the multimedia conference, the viewing permission for viewing the live stream of the multimedia conference can be changed.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some optional implementations of the embodiments of the live stream pushing method of the present disclosure, the execution body may further perform the following steps.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In a first step, in response to receiving comment information for the live stream of the multimedia conference sent by a target live viewer, it is determined whether the target live viewer has logged into the multimedia conference application.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The target live viewer may be a live viewer who sends comment information for the live stream of the multimedia conference.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some scenarios, when the live viewer logs into the multimedia conference application, the execution body may store the login information of the live viewer logging into the multimedia conference. Therefore, if the login information indicating that the target live viewer has logged into the multimedia conference is stored, the execution body can determine that the target live viewer has logged into the multimedia conference application. Otherwise, the executive body determines that the target live viewer has not logged into the multimedia conference application.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In a second step, in response to that the target live viewer has logged into the multimedia conference application, the comment information is sent to other live viewers of the multimedia conference.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Thus, when the target live viewer has logged into the multimedia conference application, the target live viewer can interact with other live viewers by sending comment information of the target live viewer to other live viewers.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some optional implementations of the embodiments of the live stream pushing method of the present disclosure, the execution body may further perform the following steps.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In a first step, in response to that the target live viewer has not logged into the multimedia conference application, a prompt information for logging into the multimedia conference application is sent to the target live viewer.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In a second step, in response to receiving the login information indicating that the target live viewer has logged into the multimedia conference application, the comment information is sent to other live viewers.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Therefore, when the target live viewer has not logged into the multimedia conference application, the target live viewer is guided to log into the multimedia conference application by sending prompt information for logging into the multimedia conference application to the target live viewer. Further, the interaction between the target live viewer and other live viewers is realized.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some optional implementations of the embodiments of the live stream pushing method of the present disclosure, the execution body (such as the server <b>504</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) of the live stream pushing method may perform the following steps.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In step S1, in response to receiving the conference exiting information indicating that a target participant user with a preset identity exits the multimedia conference, it is determined whether there exists a user having assignment permission for the preset identity.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The conference exiting information may be information indicating that the target participant user already exits or applied for exiting the multimedia conference.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The assignment permission for the preset identity may be the permission to be assigned with the preset identity. In other words, the assignment permission may be the permission to undertake the preset identity. It can be seen that the user having the assignment permission may be a user having the permission to undertake the preset identity.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some scenarios, the executive body may determine whether there exists a user having the assignment permission for the preset identity among the participant users of the multimedia conference.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In step S2, in response to existence of the user having the assignment permission for the preset identity, the target user to be assigned with the preset identity is determined.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The target user may be the user to be assigned a preset identity is determined.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In practices, the execution subject may determine the target user to be assigned with the preset identity among the users having the assignment permission.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In step S3, the preset identity is assigned to the target user.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some scenarios, after the target user is determined, the execution body assigns the preset identity to the target user.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In other scenarios, after the target user is determined, if the target user is not a member of the multimedia conference, the executive body may add the target user as a member of the multimedia conference, and assign the preset identity to the target user.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Therefore, when the target participant user having the preset identity exits unexpectedly or actively applies for exiting the multimedia conference, the target user who undertakes the preset identity is determined from the users having the permission to undertake the preset identity. Therefore, the preset identity of the target participant user is transferred to the target user, while ensuring the smooth progress of the multimedia conference.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">As an example, the preset identity may be an identifier that indicates the user as the moderator of the multimedia conference. Correspondingly, the user having the assignment permission may be a user having the permission to play the role of the moderator. Thus, when the target participant user unexpectedly exits or applies for exiting the multimedia conference, the moderator identity of the target participant user is transferred to the target user who has the permission to undertake the moderator identity.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some optional implementations of the embodiments of the live stream pushing method of the present disclosure, the execution body (such as the server <b>504</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) of the live stream pushing method may perform the following steps.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Specifically, in response to the absence of a user having the assignment permission, the push of the live stream of the multimedia conference to live viewers of a predetermined live platform is suspended.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">It should be understood that the live platform may be a platform for live viewers to view the live stream of the multimedia conference. Correspondingly, the predetermined live broadcast platform may be one or more predetermined live broadcast platforms. Generally, a user with a preset identity plays an important role in the smooth progress of the multimedia conference. When there exists no participant user who undertakes the preset identity, the multimedia conference may not proceed smoothly, and further the viewing experience of the live stream of the multimedia conference may be poor.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Therefore, when there exists no user having the permission to undertake the preset identity, the push of the live stream of the multimedia conference to the live viewers of the live broadcast platform is suspended, so as not to push the live stream with poor viewing experience to the live viewers.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In some optional implementations of the embodiments of the live stream pushing method of the present disclosure, the conference exiting information includes designation information of a candidate user to be assigned the preset identity.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The designation information of the candidate user may be information designating the candidate user to be assigned with the preset identity.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some scenarios, when the target participant user applies for exiting the multimedia conference, the target participant user may designate a candidate user to be assigned with the preset identity.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In this way, through the designation information included in the conference exiting information, the candidate user to be assigned with the preset identity can be actively designated.
