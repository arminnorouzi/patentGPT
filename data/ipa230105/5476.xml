Korean Intellectual Property Receiving Office and claiming priority to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-0087688, filed on Jul. 5, 2021, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosures

electronic apparatus and a controlling method thereof, and for example, to an electronic apparatus for recognizing a wake-up word and performing voice recognition, and a controlling method thereof.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A voice recognition function may be started through a wake-up word. The wake-up word corresponds to a voice (or speech) recognition start command How the wake-up word, which is a designated keyword, corresponds to the user's utterance may be determined using a wake-up word recognition engine or the like. If a probability value for whether the wake-up word and the user utterance match is greater than or equal to a threshold value, voice recognition may be started based on the user utterance. An operation of starting voice recognition may be an operation of starting an application related to voice recognition.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For a threshold value which is a reference of whether the wake-up word is recognized, a single threshold value may be used and the single threshold value may be changed according to environments. In a quiet environment, a relatively low threshold value may be set to increase a recognition success rate, and in a noisy environment, a high threshold value may be set to reduce a misrecognition rate. However, when using a single threshold, it is difficult to adapt to a changed environment and a user may have difficulties in using voice recognition. For example, when a device for generating continuous noise in a fixed position, such as a radio, a speaker, or the like, is located around a microphone, the possibility of misrecognition may increase, and if a high threshold value is applied to prevent and/or reduce the misrecognition, voice recognition may be difficult to be used.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When a single threshold is changed collectively, the recognition rate of the wake-up word may be deteriorated. If a high threshold value is set in a noisy environment to reduce misrecognition rate, a noise source generating noise may be fixed at a specific location. However, if a single threshold is changed without considering a specific location, the misrecognition rate may become low, but a user has to make a loud and accurate utterance, and thus the user may feel inconvenience in using a voice recognition function.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosure relates to an electronic apparatus and a

The similarity may be a value for determining that text data corresponding to the sound and text data corresponding to the wake-up word are similar pronunciation.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">If the similarity is greater than or equal to the first threshold, the processor <b>130</b> may identify that sound matches the wake-up word. Accordingly, the processor <b>130</b> may perform a function corresponding to voice recognition. The processor <b>130</b> may execute a voice recognition-related application, and perform voice recognition on a subsequent sound received through the sound receiver <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">If the similarity is less than the first threshold value and greater than or equal to the second threshold value, the first threshold value may change.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The first threshold may be a reference value for determining whether to recognize the wake-up word, and the second threshold may be a reference value for distinguishing a specific noise. If the similarity is greater than the first threshold value, the processor <b>130</b> may determine that the sound is the same as the wake-up word and perform a function corresponding to the voice recognition. If the similarity is less than the first threshold value, the processor <b>130</b> may determine that the sound is not the same as the wake-up word, and may not perform a function corresponding to the voice recognition.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">It is possible to additionally determine whether the similarity is greater than or equal to the second threshold in the condition that the similarity is less than the first threshold value. The second threshold may be a threshold value for distinguishing target noise expected to affect the recognition rate of the wake-up word.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The target noise may refer, for example, to noise that interferes with the recognition of the wake-up word. For example, the target noise may refer, for example, to a human voice, a human conversation, a music sound, or the like. If it is possible to interfere with the recognition of the wake-up word, it should be similar enough to be confused with the wake-up word. The possibility that the machine sound or life noise is recognized as a wake-up word may be very low. Therefore, a sound having a low degree of similarity to be determined not to be a target noise does not need to perform a first threshold change operation. Thus, there is a need for a second threshold for this determination. If the similarity is greater than or equal to the second threshold, the processor <b>130</b> may determine that there is a need to change the first threshold. If the similarity is less than the second threshold, the processor <b>130</b> may ignore the corresponding sound. The detailed description related thereto is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The processor <b>130</b> may change the first threshold value if the similarity is less than the first threshold and the number of times of the reception of the sound that is greater than or equal to the second threshold is greater than or equal to the threshold number.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The processor <b>130</b> may repeatedly receive sound. The processor <b>130</b> may receive the sound during a predetermined time (or period) and calculate the number of times of reception of the sound corresponding to the receiving direction. For example, the processor <b>130</b> may accumulate the reception frequency of the sound for each receiving direction. For example, the processor <b>130</b> may store the information that the sound is received by three times in the fourth direction for one minute, and the sound has been received once in the first direction. Whenever a sound is received, the processor <b>130</b> may accumulate and store the reception times for each receiving direction whenever the sound is received.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In accumulating the number of reception, the processor <b>130</b> may check whether the sound is the same. The processor <b>130</b> may calculate the number of times received for each receiving direction with respect to the same sound. For example, sounds were received by three times in the first receiving direction, where sounds of two times may be the same but the sound of one time may be different. In this case, the cumulative value of the number of times the processor <b>130</b> accumulates may be two times, because if sounds are totally different, the importance of the number of reception times is low. When different sounds are recognized in the same receiving direction, the processor <b>130</b> may store the number of times that the number of times of reception is higher in the memory <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The reception times may be recited as the cumulative reception times. A description of the reception times and threshold times will be described in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">The processor <b>130</b> may change the first threshold value to be increased by a predetermined ratio if the similarity is less than the first threshold and is greater than or equal to the second threshold.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The processor <b>130</b> may change the first threshold according to a predetermined scheme. The predetermined scheme may be a method of changing the first threshold to a predetermined ratio (e.g., 150%). For example, if the first threshold for the first receiving direction is 20, the processor <b>130</b> may change the first threshold <b>20</b> to <b>30</b> based on the similarity. The processor <b>130</b> may change the first threshold value to be increased. The operation of increasing the first threshold may refer, for example, to the wake-up word being pronounced to be more accurate and louder. If it is determined that the wake-up word is not well recognized due to the current noise, it is possible to prevent and/or reduce a situation where the wake-up word is misrecognized by increasing the first threshold value.
