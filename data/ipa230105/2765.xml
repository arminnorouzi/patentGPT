The disclosure further relates to methods of using immunomodulatory compositions for the treatment of cell proliferative disorders or infectious disease, including, for example, cancer and autoimmune disorders.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A physiologic function of the immune system is to recognize and eliminate neoplastic cells. Therefore, an aspect of tumor progression is the development of immune resistance mechanisms. Once developed, these resistance mechanisms not only prevent the natural immune system from affecting the tumor growth, but also limit the efficacy of any immunotherapeutic approaches to cancer. An immune resistance mechanism involves immune-inhibitory pathways, sometimes referred to as immune checkpoints. The immune-inhibitory pathways play a particularly important role in the interaction between tumor cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, including Adoptive Cell Transfer (ACT) therapeutic agents.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various methods of adoptive cell transfer (ACT) involve ex vivo treatment of cells collected from a patient's samples, such as blood or tumor material. Common steps involved in the preparation of cell-based treatments are isolation of cells from the primary source (e.g., peripheral blood), gene editing (e.g., engineering of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells or engineered T-cell receptor (TCR) cells), activation, and expansion.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">During the ex vivo processing, the cells undergo certain phenotypic changes that may affect their therapeutic properties, such as trafficking to the tumor, proliferative ability and longevity in vivo, and their efficacy in the immunosuppressive environment, among others. For example, the state of T-cell differentiation and maturation typically progresses through the following sequence of subtypes: na&#xef;ve (T<sub>N</sub>)-stem cell memory (T<sub>SCM</sub>)-central memory (T<sub>CM</sub>)-effector memory (T<sub>EM</sub>)-terminally differentiated effector T cells (T<sub>EFF</sub>). It has been observed that phenotypic and functional attributes of early memory T-cells (T<sub>SCM</sub>/T<sub>CM</sub>) among CD8+ T cells demonstrate superior in vivo expansion, persistence, and antitumor efficacy than more differentiated effector cells (e.g., T<sub>EM</sub>, T<sub>EFF</sub>, etc.).</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some aspects, the disclosure relates to compositions and methods for controlling the differentiation process of T-cells during production of immunomodulatory compositions to enhance levels of desired subtypes of therapeutic T cells (e.g., T<sub>SCM </sub>and T<sub>CM</sub>).

Several advantages of INTASYL&#x2122; include: (i) INTASYL&#x2122; can be developed in a short period of time and can silence virtually any target including &#x201c;non-druggable&#x201d; targets, e.g., those that are difficult to inhibit by small molecules, e.g., transcription factors; (ii) compared to alternative ex vivo siRNA transfection techniques (e.g., lipid mediated transfection or electroporation), INTASYL&#x2122; can transfect a variety of cell types, including T cells with high transfection efficiency retaining a high cell viability; (iii) when added to cell culture media at an early expansion stage, INTASYL&#x2122; compounds provide transient silencing of targets of interest during 8-10 division cycles, allowing the silencing effect to disappear in the final population of cells by the time of their re-infusion into a patient; (iv) INTASYL&#x2122; can be used in combination to simultaneously silence multiple targets, thus providing considerable flexibility for the use in different types of cell treatment protocols.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Described herein are INTASYL&#x2122; compounds directed to specific targets involved in the differentiation of T cells, and the beneficial effect of such INTASYL&#x2122; on the phenotype of T cells during and or following ex vivo expansion.

No. 8,796,443, granted on Aug. 5, 2014, entitled &#x201c;REDUCED SIZE SELF-DELIVERING RNAI COMPOUNDS&#x201d;, U.S. Pat.

In preferred embodiments, the double stranded nucleic acid molecule has one end that is blunt or includes a one or two nucleotide overhang. INTASYL&#x2122; molecules can be optimized through chemical modification, and in some instances through attachment of hydrophobic conjugates. Each of the above-referenced patents and publications are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, an INTASYL&#x2122; comprises an isolated double stranded nucleic acid molecule comprising a guide strand and a passenger strand, wherein the region of the molecule that is double stranded is from 8-15 nucleotides long, wherein the guide strand contains a single stranded region that is 4-12 nucleotides long, wherein the single stranded region of the guide strand contains 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 phosphorothioate modifications, and wherein at least 40% of the nucleotides of the double stranded nucleic acid are modified.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The nucleic acid molecules of the invention are referred to herein as isolated double stranded or duplex nucleic acids, oligonucleotides or polynucleotides, nano molecules, nano RNA, sd-rxRNA<sup>nano</sup>, sd-rxRNA, INTASYL&#x2122; or RNA molecules of the invention.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">INTASYL&#x2122; molecules are much more effectively taken up by cells compared to conventional siRNAs. These molecules are highly efficient in silencing of target gene expression and offer significant advantages over previously described RNAi molecules including high activity in the presence of serum, efficient self-delivery, compatibility with a wide variety of linkers, and reduced presence or complete absence of chemical modifications that are associated with toxicity.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In contrast to single-stranded polynucleotides, duplex polynucleotides have traditionally been difficult to deliver to a cell as they have rigid structures and a large number of negative charges which makes membrane transfer difficult. INTASYL&#x2122; molecules however, although partially double-stranded, are recognized in vivo as single-stranded and, as such, are capable of efficiently being delivered across cell membranes. As a result, the polynucleotides of the invention are capable in many instances of self-delivery. Thus, the polynucleotides of the invention may be formulated in a manner similar to conventional RNAi agents or they may be delivered to the cell or subject alone (or with non-delivery type carriers) and allowed to self-deliver. In one embodiment of the present invention, self-delivering asymmetric double-stranded RNA molecules are provided in which one portion of the molecule resembles a conventional RNA duplex and a second portion of the molecule is single stranded.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The oligonucleotides of the invention in some aspects have a combination of asymmetric structures including a double stranded region and a single stranded region of 5 nucleotides or longer, specific chemical modification patterns and are conjugated to lipophilic or hydrophobic molecules. In some embodiments, this class of RNAi like compounds have superior efficacy in vitro and in vivo. It is believed that the reduction in the size of the rigid duplex region in combination with phosphorothioate modifications applied to a single stranded region contribute to the observed superior efficacy.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the RNAi compounds of the invention comprise an asymmetric compound comprising a duplex region (required for efficient RISC entry) of 8-15 bases long and a single stranded region of 4-12 nucleotides long. In some embodiments, the duplex region is 13 or 14 nucleotides long, and in some embodiments, the since stranded region is 6-7 nucleotides long. The single stranded region of the RNAi compounds (e.g., INTASYL&#x2122; molecules) also comprises 2-12 phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages (referred to as phosphorothioate modifications). In some embodiments, the single stranded region comprises 6-8 phosphorothioate internucleotide linkages. Additionally, the RNAi compounds of the invention also include a unique chemical modification pattern, which provides stability and is compatible with RISC entry. In some embodiments, the combination of these elements has resulted in unexpected properties which are highly useful for delivery of RNAi reagents in vitro and in vivo.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The chemical modification pattern, which provides stability and is compatible with RISC entry includes modifications to the sense, or passenger, strand as well as the antisense, or guide, strand. For instance, the passenger strand can be modified with any chemical entities which confirm stability and do not interfere with activity. Such modifications include 2&#x2032; ribo modifications (O-methyl, 2&#x2032;F, 2 deoxy and others) and backbone modifications, such as phosphorothioate modifications. In some embodiments, the chemical modification pattern in the passenger strand includes O-methyl modification of C and U nucleotides within the passenger strand or alternatively, the passenger strand may be completely O-methyl modified.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The guide strand, in some embodiments, may also be modified by any chemical modification which confirms stability without interfering with RISC entry. In some embodiments, the chemical modification pattern in the guide strand includes the majority of C and U nucleotides being 2&#x2032;F modified and the 5&#x2032; end being phosphorylated. In some embodiments, a chemical modification pattern in the guide strand includes 2&#x2032;O-methyl modification of position 1 and C/U in positions 11-18 and 5&#x2032; end chemical phosphorylation. In some embodiments, a chemical modification pattern in the guide strand includes 2&#x2032;O-methyl modification of position 1 and C/U in positions 11-18 and 5&#x2032; end chemical phosphorylation and 2&#x2032;F modification of C/U in positions 2-10. In some embodiments, the passenger strand and/or the guide strand contains at least one 5-methyl C or U modification.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, at least 30% of the nucleotides in the sd-rxRNA (e.g., INTASYL&#x2122; compound) are modified. For example, at least 30%, 31%, 32%, 33%, 34%, 35%, 36%, 37%, 38%, 39%, 40%, 41%, 42%, 43%, 44%, 45%, 46%, 47%, 48%, 49%, 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the nucleotides in the INTASYL&#x2122; compound are modified. In some embodiments, 100% of the nucleotides in the INTASYL&#x2122; compound are modified.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The above-described chemical modification patterns of the oligonucleotides of the invention are well tolerated and improve efficacy of asymmetric RNAi compounds. In some embodiments, elimination of any of the described components (guide strand stabilization, phosphorothioate stretch, sense strand stabilization and hydrophobic conjugate) or increase in size, in some instances, results in sub-optimal efficacy and, in some instances, complete loss of efficacy. The combination of elements results in development of a compound, which is fully active following passive delivery to cells such as HeLa cells or T-cells.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The INTASYL&#x2122; can be further improved in some instances by improving the hydrophobicity of compounds using novel types of chemistries. For example, one chemistry is related to use of hydrophobic base modifications. Any base in any position might be modified, as long as modification results in an increase of the partition coefficient of the base. The preferred locations for modification chemistries are positions 4 and 5 of the pyrimidines. The major advantage of these positions is (a) ease of synthesis and (b) lack of interference with base-pairing and A form helix formation, which are essential for RISC complex loading and target recognition. In some embodiments, INTASYL&#x2122; compounds where multiple deoxy uridines are present without interfering with overall compound efficacy are used. In addition, major improvement in tissue distribution and cellular uptake might be obtained by modifying the structure of the hydrophobic conjugate. In some embodiments, the structure of sterol is modified to alter (increase/decrease) C17 attached chain. This type of modification results in significant increase in cellular uptake and improvement of tissue uptake prosperities in vivo.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, a chemically-modified double stranded nucleic acid molecule is a hydrophobically modified siRNA-antisense hybrid molecule, comprising a double-stranded region of about 13-22 base pairs, with or without a 3&#x2032;-overhang on each of the sense and antisense strands, and a 3&#x2032; single-stranded tail on the antisense strand of about 2-9 nucleotides. In some embodiments, the chemically-modified double stranded nucleic acid molecule contains at least one 2&#x2032;-O-Methyl modification, at least one 2&#x2032;-Fluoro modification, and at least one phosphorothioate modification, as well as at least one hydrophobic modification selected from sterol, cholesterol, vitamin D, napthyl, isobutyl, benzyl, indol, tryptophane, phenyl, and the like hydrophobic modifiers. In some embodiments, a chemically-modified double stranded nucleic acid molecule comprises a plurality of such modifications.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some aspects, the disclosure relates to chemically-modified double stranded nucleic acid molecules that target genes encoding targets related to differentiation of cells (e.g., differentiation of T-cells), such as signal transduction/transcription factor targets, epigenetic targets, metabolic and co-inhibitory/negative regulatory targets. Examples of epigenetic proteins include but are not limited to BRD4. In some embodiments, a chemically-modified double stranded nucleic acid targets a gene encoding BRD4.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">As used herein, &#x201c;BRD4&#x201d; (also known as CAP, MCAP, HUNK1, HUNKI) refers to Bromodomain Containing Protein 4 or Bromodomain Containing 4, a member of the bromodomains and extraterminal (BET) family, which is a transcriptional and epigenetic regulator that plays a role during cancer development. BRD4 contains two bromodomains which recognize acetylated lysine residues on DNA histone tails. As a chromatin regulatory protein, BRD4 binds the acetylated histones, and is involved in the transmission of epigenetic memory across cell divisions and transcription regulation. Specifically, once the protein is bound, it remains with the acetylated chromatin during the entire cell cycle, providing epigenetic memory for postmitotic G1 gene transcription by preserving high-order chromatin structure. (Wang et al. (2012) <i>J. Biol. Chem. </i>287:10738-10752). BRD4 promotes gene transcription during the initiation and elongation steps, as it recruits P-TEFb, a positive transcription elongation factor (Yang et al. (2005) <i>Mol Cell. </i>19(4):535-45). BRD4 has been implicated in cancer because of its role in modulating transcription elongation of genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis, such as c-Myc and BCL2. (Jung et al. (2015) <i>Epigenomics, </i>7(3):487-501). In some embodiments, BRD4 is encoded by a nucleic acid sequence represented by NCBI Reference Sequence Number NM_058243.2.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Non-limiting examples of BRD4 sequences that may be targeted by chemically-modified double stranded nucleic acid molecules of the disclosure are listed in Table 2.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments a chemically-modified double stranded nucleic acid molecule comprises at least 12 nucleotides of a sequence within Table 2. In some embodiments, a chemically-modified double stranded nucleic acid molecule comprises at least one sequence within Table 2 (e.g., comprises a sense strand or an antisense strand comprising a sequence as set forth in any one of Table 2).

In some embodiments, 100% of the nucleotides in the sd-rxRNA are modified. In some embodiments, only the passenger strand of the rxRNAori contains modifications.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Thus, aspects of the invention relate to isolated double stranded nucleic acid molecules comprising a guide (antisense) strand and a passenger (sense) strand. As used herein, the term &#x201c;double-stranded&#x201d; refers to one or more nucleic acid molecules in which at least a portion of the nucleomonomers are complementary and hydrogen bond to form a double-stranded region. In some embodiments, the length of the guide strand ranges from 16-29 nucleotides long. In certain embodiments, the guide strand is 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, or 29 nucleotides long. The guide strand has complementarity to a target gene. Complementarity between the guide strand and the target gene may exist over any portion of the guide strand. Complementarity as used herein may be perfect complementarity or less than perfect complementarity as long as the guide strand is sufficiently complementary to the target that it mediates RNAi. In some embodiments complementarity refers to less than 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, or 1% mismatch between the guide strand and the target. Perfect complementarity refers to 100% complementarity. In some embodiments, siRNA sequences with insertions, deletions, and single point mutations relative to the target sequence have also been found to be effective for inhibition. Moreover, not all positions of a siRNA contribute equally to target recognition. Mismatches in the center of the siRNA are most critical and essentially abolish target RNA cleavage. Mismatches upstream of the center or upstream of the cleavage site referencing the antisense strand are tolerated but significantly reduce target RNA cleavage. Mismatches downstream of the center or cleavage site referencing the antisense strand, preferably located near the 3&#x2032; end of the antisense strand, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 nucleotides from the 3&#x2032; end of the antisense strand, are tolerated and reduce target RNA cleavage only slightly.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">While not wishing to be bound by any particular theory, in some embodiments of double stranded nucleic acid molecules described herein, the guide strand is at least 16 nucleotides in length and anchors the Argonaute protein in RISC. In some embodiments, when the guide strand loads into RISC it has a defined seed region and target mRNA cleavage takes place across from position 10-11 of the guide strand. In some embodiments, the 5&#x2032; end of the guide strand is or is able to be phosphorylated. The nucleic acid molecules described herein may be referred to as minimum trigger RNA.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some embodiments of double stranded nucleic acid molecules described herein, the length of the passenger strand ranges from 8-15 nucleotides long. In certain embodiments, the passenger strand is 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 nucleotides long. The passenger strand has complementarity to the guide strand. Complementarity between the passenger strand and the guide strand can exist over any portion of the passenger or guide strand. In some embodiments, there is 100% complementarity between the guide and passenger strands within the double stranded region of the molecule.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Aspects of the invention relate to double stranded nucleic acid molecules with minimal double stranded regions. In some embodiments the region of the molecule that is double stranded ranges from 8-15 nucleotides long. In certain embodiments, the region of the molecule that is double stranded is 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15 nucleotides long. In certain embodiments the double stranded region is 13 or 14 nucleotides long. In some embodiments, the region of the molecule that is double stranded is 13-22 nucleotides long. In certain embodiments, the region of the molecule that is double stranded is 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 or 22 nucleotides long.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">There can be 100% complementarity between the guide and passenger strands, or there may be one or more mismatches between the guide and passenger strands. In some embodiments, on one end of the double stranded molecule, the molecule is either blunt-ended or has a one-nucleotide overhang. The single stranded region of the molecule is in some embodiments between 4-12 nucleotides long. For example the single stranded region can be 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 nucleotides long. However, in certain embodiments, the single stranded region can also be less than 4 or greater than 12 nucleotides long. In certain embodiments, the single stranded region is at least 6 or at least 7 nucleotides long. In some embodiments, the single stranded region is 2-9 nucleotides long, including 2 or 3 nucleotides long.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">RNAi constructs associated with the invention can have a thermodynamic stability (&#x394;G) of less than &#x2212;13 kkal/mol. In some embodiments, the thermodynamic stability (&#x394;G) is less than &#x2212;20 kkal/mol. In some embodiments there is a loss of efficacy when (&#x394;G) goes below &#x2212;21 kkal/mol. In some embodiments a (&#x394;G) value higher than &#x2212;13 kkal/mol is compatible with aspects of the invention. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, in some embodiments a molecule with a relatively higher (&#x394;G) value may become active at a relatively higher concentration, while a molecule with a relatively lower (&#x394;G) value may become active at a relatively lower concentration. In some embodiments, the (&#x394;G) value may be higher than &#x2212;9 kkcal/mol. The gene silencing effects mediated by the RNAi constructs associated with the invention, containing minimal double stranded regions, are unexpected because molecules of almost identical design but lower thermodynamic stability have been demonstrated to be inactive (Rana et al 2004).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Without wishing to be bound by any theory, results described herein suggest that a stretch of 8-10 bp of dsRNA or dsDNA will be structurally recognized by protein components of RISC or co-factors of RISC. Additionally, there is a free energy requirement for the triggering compound that it may be either sensed by the protein components and/or stable enough to interact with such components so that it may be loaded into the Argonaute protein. If acceptable thermodynamics are present and there is a double stranded portion that is preferably at least 8 nucleotides, then the duplex will be recognized and loaded into the RNAi machinery.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, thermodynamic stability is increased through the use of LNA bases. In some embodiments, additional chemical modifications are introduced. Several non-limiting examples of chemical modifications include: 5&#x2032; Phosphate, 5&#x2032; Phosphonate, 5&#x2032; Vinyl Phosphonate, 2&#x2032;-O-methyl, 2&#x2032;-O-ethyl, 2&#x2032;-fluoro, ribothymidine, C-5 propynyl-dC (pdC) and C-5 propynyl-dU (pdU); C-5 propynyl-C (pC) and C-5 propynyl-U (pU); 5-methyl C, 5-methyl U, 5-methyl dC, 5-methyl dU methoxy, (2,6-diaminopurine), 5&#x2032;-Dimethoxytrityl-N4-ethyl-2&#x2032;-deoxyCytidine and MGB (minor groove binder). It should be appreciated that more than one chemical modification can be combined within the same molecule.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Molecules associated with the invention are optimized for increased potency and/or reduced toxicity. For example, nucleotide length of the guide and/or passenger strand, and/or the number of phosphorothioate modifications in the guide and/or passenger strand, can in some aspects influence potency of the RNA molecule, while replacing 2&#x2032;-fluoro (2&#x2032;F) modifications with 2&#x2032;-O-methyl (2&#x2032;OMe) modifications can in some aspects influence toxicity of the molecule. Specifically, reduction in 2&#x2032;F content of a molecule is predicted to reduce toxicity of the molecule. Furthermore, the number of phosphorothioate modifications in an RNA molecule can influence the uptake of the molecule into a cell, for example the efficiency of passive uptake of the molecule into a cell. Preferred embodiments of molecules described herein have no 2&#x2032;F modification and yet are characterized by equal efficacy in cellular uptake and tissue penetration. Such molecules represent a significant improvement over prior art, such as molecules described by Accell and Wolfrum, which are heavily modified with extensive use of 2&#x2032;F.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, a guide strand is approximately 18-20 nucleotides in length and has approximately 2-14 phosphate modifications. For example, a guide strand can contain 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or more than 14 nucleotides that are phosphate-modified. The guide strand may contain one or more modifications that confer increased stability without interfering with RISC entry. The phosphate modified nucleotides, such as phosphorothioate modified nucleotides, can be at the 3&#x2032; end, 5&#x2032; end or spread throughout the guide strand. In some embodiments, the 3&#x2032; terminal 10 nucleotides of the guide strand contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 phosphorothioate modified nucleotides. The guide strand can also contain 2&#x2032;F and/or 2&#x2032;OMe modifications, which can be located throughout the molecule. In some embodiments, the nucleotide in position one of the guide strand (the nucleotide in the most 5&#x2032; position of the guide strand) is 2&#x2032;OMe modified and/or phosphorylated and/or contains a vinyl phosphonate. C and U nucleotides within the guide strand can be 2&#x2032;F modified. For example, C and U nucleotides in positions 2-10 of a 20 nucleotide guide strand (or corresponding positions in a guide strand of a different length) can be 2&#x2032;F modified. C and U nucleotides within the guide strand can also be 2&#x2032;OMe modified. For example, C and U nucleotides in positions 11-18 of a 19 nucleotide guide strand (or corresponding positions in a guide strand of a different length) can be 2&#x2032;OMe modified. In some embodiments, the nucleotide at the most 3&#x2032; end of the guide strand is unmodified. In certain embodiments, the majority of Cs and Us within the guide strand are 2&#x2032;F modified and the 5&#x2032; end of the guide strand is phosphorylated. In other embodiments, position 1 and the Cs or Us in positions 11-18 are 2&#x2032;OMe modified and the 5&#x2032; end of the guide strand is phosphorylated. In other embodiments, position 1 and the Cs or Us in positions 11-18 are 2&#x2032;OMe modified, the 5&#x2032; end of the guide strand is phosphorylated, and the Cs or Us in position 2-10 are 2&#x2032;F modified.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some aspects, a passenger strand is approximately 11-14 nucleotides in length. The passenger strand may contain modifications that confer increased stability. One or more nucleotides in the passenger strand can be 2&#x2032;OMe modified. In some embodiments, one or more of the C and/or U nucleotides in the passenger strand is 2&#x2032;OMe modified, or all of the C and U nucleotides in the passenger strand are 2&#x2032;OMe modified. In certain embodiments, all of the nucleotides in the passenger strand are 2&#x2032;OMe modified. One or more of the nucleotides on the passenger strand can also be phosphate-modified such as phosphorothioate modified. The passenger strand can also contain 2&#x2032; ribo, 2&#x2032;F and 2 deoxy modifications or any combination of the above. Chemical modification patterns on both the guide and passenger strand can be well tolerated and a combination of chemical modifications can lead to increased efficacy and self-delivery of RNA molecules.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Aspects of the invention relate to RNAi constructs that have extended single-stranded regions relative to double stranded regions, as compared to molecules that have been used previously for RNAi. The single stranded region of the molecules may be modified to promote cellular uptake or gene silencing. In some embodiments, phosphorothioate modification of the single stranded region influences cellular uptake and/or gene silencing. The region of the guide strand that is phosphorothioate modified can include nucleotides within both the single stranded and double stranded regions of the molecule. In some embodiments, the single stranded region includes 2-12 phosphorothioate modifications. For example, the single stranded region can include 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 phosphorothioate modifications. In some instances, the single stranded region contains 6-8 phosphorothioate modifications.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Molecules associated with the invention are also designed for cellular uptake. In RNA molecules described herein, the guide and/or passenger strands can be attached to a conjugate. In certain embodiments the conjugate is hydrophobic. The hydrophobic conjugate can be a small molecule with a partition coefficient that is higher than 10. The conjugate can be a sterol-type molecule such as cholesterol, or a molecule with an increased length polycarbon chain attached to C17, and the presence of a conjugate can influence the ability of an RNA molecule to be taken into a cell with or without a lipid transfection reagent. The conjugate can be attached to the passenger or guide strand through a hydrophobic linker. In some embodiments, a hydrophobic linker is 5-12 C in length, and/or is hydroxypyrrolidine-based. In some embodiments, a hydrophobic conjugate is attached to the passenger strand and the CU residues of either the passenger and/or guide strand are modified. In some embodiments, at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90% or 95% of the CU residues on the passenger strand and/or the guide strand are modified. In some aspects, molecules associated with the invention are self-delivering (sd). As used herein, &#x201c;self-delivery&#x201d; refers to the ability of a molecule to be delivered into a cell without the need for an additional delivery vehicle such as a transfection reagent.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Aspects of the invention relate to selecting molecules for use in RNAi. In some embodiments, molecules that have a double stranded region of 8-15 nucleotides can be selected for use in RNAi. In some embodiments, molecules are selected based on their thermodynamic stability (&#x394;G). In some embodiments, molecules will be selected that have a (&#x394;G) of less than &#x2212;13 kkal/mol. For example, the (&#x394;G) value may be &#x2212;13, &#x2212;14, &#x2212;15, &#x2212;16, &#x2212;17, &#x2212;18, &#x2212;19, &#x2212;21, &#x2212;22 or less than &#x2212;22 kkal/mol. In other embodiments, the (&#x394;G) value may be higher than &#x2212;13 kkal/mol. For example, the (&#x394;G) value may be &#x2212;12, &#x2212;11, &#x2212;10, &#x2212;9, &#x2212;8, &#x2212;7 or more than &#x2212;7 kkal/mol. It should be appreciated that &#x394;G can be calculated using any method known in the art. In some embodiments &#x394;G is calculated using Mfold, available through the Mfold internet site (mfold.bioinfo.rpi.edu/cgi-bin/rna-form1.cgi).

An &#x201c;miRNA disorder&#x201d; shall refer to a disease or disorder characterized by an aberrant expression or activity of an miRNA.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">microRNAs are involved in down-regulating target genes in critical pathways, such as development and cancer, in mice, worms and mammals. Gene silencing through a microRNA mechanism is achieved by specific yet imperfect base-pairing of the miRNA and its target messenger RNA (mRNA). Various mechanisms may be used in microRNA-mediated down-regulation of target mRNA expression.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">miRNAs are noncoding RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides which can regulate gene expression at the post transcriptional or translational level during plant and animal development. One common feature of miRNAs is that they are all excised from an approximately 70 nucleotide precursor RNA stem-loop termed pre-miRNA, probably by Dicer, an RNase III-type enzyme, or a homolog thereof. Naturally-occurring miRNAs are expressed by endogenous genes in vivo and are processed from a hairpin or stem-loop precursor (pre-miRNA or pri-miRNAs) by Dicer or other RNAses. miRNAs can exist transiently in vivo as a double-stranded duplex but only one strand is taken up by the RISC complex to direct gene silencing.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some embodiments, a version of chemically modified double stranded nucleic acid compounds, which are effective in cellular uptake and inhibition of miRNA activity, are described. Essentially, the compounds are similar to RISC entering versions, but large strand chemical modification patterns are made to block cleavage and act as an effective inhibitor of the RISC action. For example, the compound might be completely or mostly O-methyl modified with the phosphorothioate content described previously. For these types of compounds, the 5&#x2032; phosphorylation is not necessary in some embodiments. The presence of a double stranded region is preferred as it promotes cellular uptake and efficient RISC loading.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Another pathway that uses small RNAs as sequence-specific regulators is the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, which is an evolutionarily conserved response to the presence of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the cell. The dsRNAs are cleaved into &#x2dc;20-base pair (bp) duplexes of small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by Dicer. These small RNAs get assembled into multiprotein effector complexes called RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs). The siRNAs then guide the cleavage of target mRNAs with perfect complementarity.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">Some aspects of biogenesis, protein complexes, and function are shared between the siRNA pathway and the miRNA pathway.

In this embodiment, between about 40% to about 90% of the nucleotides of the passenger strand between about 40% to about 90% of the nucleotides of the guide strand, and between about 40% to about 90% of the nucleotides of the single stranded region of the first polynucleotide are chemically modified nucleotides.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In an embodiment, the chemically modified nucleotide in the polynucleotide duplex may be any chemically modified nucleotide known in the art, such as those discussed in detail above. In a particular embodiment, the chemically modified nucleotide is selected from the group consisting of 2&#x2032;F modified nucleotides, 2&#x2032;-O-methyl modified and 2&#x2032;deoxy nucleotides. In another particular embodiment, the chemically modified nucleotides result from &#x201c;hydrophobic modifications&#x201d; of the nucleotide base. In another particular embodiment, the chemically modified nucleotides are phosphorothioates. In an additional particular embodiment, chemically modified nucleotides are combination of phosphorothioates, 2&#x2032;-O-methyl, 2&#x2032;deoxy, hydrophobic modifications and phosphorothioates. As these groups of modifications refer to modification of the ribose ring, back bone and nucleotide, it is feasible that some modified nucleotides will carry a combination of all three modification types.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">In another embodiment, the chemical modification is not the same across the various regions of the duplex. In a particular embodiment, the first polynucleotide (the passenger strand), has a large number of diverse chemical modifications in various positions. For this polynucleotide up to 90% of nucleotides might be chemically modified and/or have mismatches introduced.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">In another embodiment, chemical modifications of the first or second polynucleotide include, but not limited to, 5&#x2032; position modification of Uridine and Cytosine (4-pyridyl, 2-pyridyl, indolyl, phenyl (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH); tryptophanyl (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>6</sub>N)CH<sub>2</sub>CH(NH<sub>2</sub>)CO), isobutyl, butyl, aminobenzyl; phenyl; naphthyl, etc.), where the chemical modification might alter base pairing capabilities of a nucleotide. For the guide strand an important feature of this aspect of the invention is the position of the chemical modification relative to the 5&#x2032; end of the antisense and sequence. For example, chemical phosphorylation of the 5&#x2032; end of the guide strand is usually beneficial for efficacy. O-methyl modifications in the seed region of the sense strand (position 2-7 relative to the 5&#x2032; end) are not generally well tolerated, whereas 2&#x2032;F and deoxy are well tolerated. The mid part of the guide strand and the 3&#x2032; end of the guide strand are more permissive in a type of chemical modifications applied. Deoxy modifications are not tolerated at the 3&#x2032; end of the guide strand.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">A unique feature of this aspect of the invention involves the use of hydrophobic modification on the bases. In one embodiment, the hydrophobic modifications are preferably positioned near the 5&#x2032; end of the guide strand, in other embodiments, they localized in the middle of the guides strand, in other embodiment they localized at the 3&#x2032; end of the guide strand and yet in another embodiment they are distributed thought the whole length of the polynucleotide. The same type of patterns is applicable to the passenger strand of the duplex.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The other part of the molecule is a single stranded region. The single stranded region is expected to range from 7 to 40 nucleotides.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">In one embodiment, the single stranded region of the first polynucleotide contains modifications selected from the group consisting of between 40% and 90% hydrophobic base modifications, between 40%-90% phosphorothioates, between 40%-90% modification of the ribose moiety, and any combination of the preceding.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Efficiency of guide strand (first polynucleotide) loading into the RISC complex might be altered for heavily modified polynucleotides, so in one embodiment, the duplex polynucleotide includes a mismatch between nucleotide 9, 11, 12, 13, or 14 on the guide strand (first polynucleotide) and the opposite nucleotide on the sense strand (second polynucleotide) to promote efficient guide strand loading.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">More detailed aspects of the invention are described in the sections below.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Duplex Characteristics</heading><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Double-stranded oligonucleotides of the invention may be formed by two separate complementary nucleic acid strands.

The sense and antisense nucleotide sequences correspond to the target gene sequence, e.g., are identical or are sufficiently identical to effect target gene inhibition (e.g., are about at least about 98% identical, 96% identical, 94%, 90% identical, 85% identical, or 80% identical) to the target gene sequence.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In certain embodiments, the double-stranded oligonucleotide of the invention is double-stranded over its entire length, i.e., with no overhanging single-stranded sequence at either end of the molecule, i.e., is blunt-ended. In other embodiments, the individual nucleic acid molecules can be of different lengths. In other words, a double-stranded oligonucleotide of the invention is not double-stranded over its entire length. For instance, when two separate nucleic acid molecules are used, one of the molecules, e.g., the first molecule comprising an antisense sequence, can be longer than the second molecule hybridizing thereto (leaving a portion of the molecule single-stranded). Likewise, when a single nucleic acid molecule is used a portion of the molecule at either end can remain single-stranded.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In one embodiment, a double-stranded oligonucleotide of the invention contains mismatches and/or loops or bulges, but is double-stranded over at least about 70% of the length of the oligonucleotide.

For example, a pyrimidine base may be modified at the 2, 3, 4, 5, and/or 6 position of the pyrimidine ring. In some embodiments, the exocyclic amine of cytosine may be modified. A purine base may also be modified. For example, a purine base may be modified at the 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, or 8 position. In some embodiments, the exocyclic amine of adenine may be modified.

The use of 2&#x2032;-O-methylated or partially 2&#x2032;-O-methylated RNA may avoid the interferon response to double-stranded nucleic acids, while maintaining target RNA inhibition. This may be useful, for example, for avoiding the interferon or other cellular stress responses, both in short RNAi (e.g., siRNA) sequences that induce the interferon response, and in longer RNAi sequences that may induce the interferon response.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Overall, modified sugars may include D-ribose, 2&#x2032;-O-alkyl (including 2&#x2032;-O-methyl and 2&#x2032;-O-ethyl), i.e., 2&#x2032;-alkoxy, 2&#x2032;-amino, 2&#x2032;-S-alkyl, 2&#x2032;-halo (including 2&#x2032;-fluoro), 2&#x2032;-methoxyethoxy, 2&#x2032;-allyloxy (&#x2014;OCH<sub>2</sub>CH&#x2550;CH<sub>2</sub>), 2&#x2032;-propargyl, 2&#x2032;-propyl, ethynyl, ethenyl, propenyl, and cyano and the like.

No. 5,849,902 and WO 98/13526). For example, oligonucleotides can be made resistant by the inclusion of a &#x201c;blocking group.&#x201d; The term &#x201c;blocking group&#x201d; as used herein refers to substituents (e.g., other than OH groups) that can be attached to oligonucleotides or nucleomonomers, either as protecting groups or coupling groups for synthesis (e.g., FITC, propyl (CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>3</sub>), glycol (&#x2014;O&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;O&#x2014;) phosphate (PO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup>), hydrogen phosphonate, or phosphoramidite). &#x201c;Blocking groups&#x201d; also include &#x201c;end blocking groups&#x201d; or &#x201c;exonuclease blocking groups&#x201d; which protect the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; termini of the oligonucleotide, including modified nucleotides and non-nucleotide exonuclease resistant structures.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Exemplary end-blocking groups include cap structures (e.g., a 7-methylguanosine cap), inverted nucleomonomers, e.g., with 3&#x2032;-3&#x2032; or 5&#x2032;-5&#x2032; end inversions (see, e.g., Ortiagao et al. 1992<i>. Antisense Res. Dev. </i>2:129), methylphosphonate, phosphoramidite, non-nucleotide groups (e.g., non-nucleotide linkers, amino linkers, conjugates) and the like. The 3&#x2032; terminal nucleomonomer can comprise a modified sugar moiety. The 3&#x2032; terminal nucleomonomer comprises a 3&#x2032;-O that can optionally be substituted by a blocking group that prevents 3&#x2032;-exonuclease degradation of the oligonucleotide. For example, the 3&#x2032;-hydroxyl can be esterified to a nucleotide through a 3&#x2032;-3&#x2032; internucleotide linkage. For example, the alkyloxy radical can be methoxy, ethoxy, or isopropoxy, and preferably, ethoxy. Optionally, the 3&#x2032;-3&#x2032; linked nucleotide at the 3&#x2032; terminus can be linked by a substitute linkage. To reduce nuclease degradation, the 5&#x2032; most 3&#x2032;-5&#x2032; linkage can be a modified linkage, e.g., a phosphorothioate or a P-alkyloxyphosphotriester linkage. Preferably, the two 5&#x2032; most 3&#x2032;-5&#x2032; linkages are modified linkages. Optionally, the 5&#x2032; terminal hydroxy moiety can be esterified with a phosphorus containing moiety, e.g., phosphate, phosphorothioate, or P-ethoxyphosphate.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the synthetic methods, as described herein, utilize a variety of protecting groups. By the term &#x201c;protecting group,&#x201d; as used herein, it is meant that a particular functional moiety, e.g., O, S, or N, is temporarily blocked so that a reaction can be carried out selectively at another reactive site in a multifunctional compound. In certain embodiments, a protecting group reacts selectively in good yield to give a protected substrate that is stable to the projected reactions; the protecting group should be selectively removable in good yield by readily available, preferably non-toxic reagents that do not attack the other functional groups; the protecting group forms an easily separable derivative (more preferably without the generation of new stereogenic centers); and the protecting group has a minimum of additional functionality to avoid further sites of reaction.

In some instances, particles are alkali-extracted, acid-extracted or organic solvent-extracted to remove intracellular components and/or the outer mannoprotein layer of the cell wall. Such protocols can produce particles that have a glucan (w/w) content in the range of 50%-90%. In some instances, a particle of lower purity, meaning lower glucan w/w content may be preferred, while in other embodiments, a particle of higher purity, meaning higher glucan w/w content may be preferred.</p><p id="p-0294" num="0268">Glucan particles, such as yeast cell wall particles, can have a natural lipid content.

As used herein, an &#x201c;immunomodulatory composition&#x201d; is a composition comprising a host cell that comprises a chemically-modified nucleic acid molecule as described herein and/or a host cell that has been treated with a chemically-modified nucleic acid molecule as described herein. An immunomodulatory composition can optionally further comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or carriers. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, immunomodulatory compositions as described by the disclosure are characterized by a population of immune cells (e.g., T-cells, NK-cells, antigen-presenting cells (APC), dendritic cells (DC), stem cells (SC), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), etc.) that have been engineered to have an enriched population of a particular cell subtype (e.g., T-cell subtype, such as T<sub>SCM </sub>or T<sub>CM </sub>T-cells), and are thus useful, in some embodiments, for modulating (e.g., stimulating or inhibiting) the immune response of a subject.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0273">As used herein, a &#x201c;host cell&#x201d; is a cell to which one or more chemically-modified double stranded nucleic acid molecules have been introduced.

For example, a cell or cells may be isolated from a biological sample obtained from a donor, such as a healthy donor, such as bone marrow or blood. As used herein &#x201c;healthy donor&#x201d; refers to a subject that does not have, or is not suspected of having, a proliferative disorder or an infectious disease (e.g., a bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection). However, in some embodiments, a host cell is derived from a subject having (or suspected of having) a proliferative disease or an infectious disease, for example in the context of autologous cell therapy.</p><p id="p-0300" num="0274">In some embodiments a cell (e.g., a host cell) is an immune cell, for example a T-cell, B-cell, dendritic cell (DC), granulocyte, natural killer cell, macrophage, etc. In some embodiments, a cell (e.g., a host cell) is a cell that is capable of differentiating into an immune cell, such as a stem cell (SC) or induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC).

In some embodiments the T-cell is a killer T-cell (e.g., a CD8+ T-cell). In some embodiments, the T-cell is a helper T-cell (e.g., a CD4+ T-cell).

In some embodiments, the methods comprise, introducing into a cell one or more chemically-modified double stranded nucleic acid molecules (e.g., INTASYL&#x2122;), wherein the chemically-modified double stranded nucleic acid molecules target BRD4, thereby producing a host cell with a specific cell subtype or T-cell subtype (e.g., T<sub>SCM </sub>or T<sub>CM</sub>).</p><p id="p-0306" num="0280">Methods of producing immunomodulatory compositions (e.g., producing a host cell or populations of host cells) may be carried out in vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo, in, for example, mammalian cells in culture, such as a human cell in culture. In some embodiments, target cells (e.g., cells obtained from a donor) may be contacted in the presence of a delivery reagent, such as a lipid (e.g., a cationic lipid) or a liposome to facilitate entry of the chemically-modified double stranded nucleic acid molecules into the cell, as described in further detail elsewhere in the disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="2">Carriers and Complexing Agents</heading><p id="p-0307" num="0281">The disclosure further relates to compositions comprising RNAi constructs as described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. In some aspects, the disclosure relates to immunomodulatory compositions comprising the RNAi constructs described herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0282">As used herein, &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable carrier&#x201d; includes appropriate solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, it can be used in the therapeutic compositions. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0283">For example, in some embodiments, oligonucleotides may be incorporated into liposomes or liposomes modified with polyethylene glycol or admixed with cationic lipids for parenteral administration. Incorporation of additional substances into the liposome, for example, antibodies reactive against membrane proteins found on specific target cells, can help target the oligonucleotides to specific cell types (e.g., immune cells, such as T-cells).</p><p id="p-0310" num="0284">Encapsulating agents entrap oligonucleotides within vesicles. In another embodiment of the invention, an oligonucleotide may be associated with a carrier or vehicle, e.g., liposomes or micelles, although other carriers could be used, as would be appreciated by one skilled in the art. Liposomes are vesicles made of a lipid bilayer having a structure similar to biological membranes. Such carriers are used to facilitate the cellular uptake or targeting of the oligonucleotide, or improve the oligonucleotide's pharmacokinetic or toxicologic properties.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0285">For example, the oligonucleotides of the present invention may also be administered encapsulated in liposomes, pharmaceutical compositions wherein the active ingredient is contained either dispersed or variously present in corpuscles consisting of aqueous concentric layers adherent to lipidic layers. The oligonucleotides, depending upon solubility, may be present both in the aqueous layer and in the lipidic layer, or in what is generally termed a liposomic suspension. The hydrophobic layer, generally but not exclusively, comprises phospholipids such as lecithin and sphingomyelin, steroids such as cholesterol, more or less ionic surfactants such as dicetylphosphate, stearylamine, or phosphatidic acid, or other materials of a hydrophobic nature. The diameters of the liposomes generally range from about 15 nm to about 5 microns.</p><p id="p-0312" num="0286">The use of liposomes as drug delivery vehicles offers several advantages. Liposomes increase intracellular stability, increase uptake efficiency and improve biological activity. Liposomes are hollow spherical vesicles composed of lipids arranged in a similar fashion as those lipids which make up the cell membrane. They have an internal aqueous space for entrapping water soluble compounds and range in size from 0.05 to several microns in diameter. Several studies have shown that liposomes can deliver nucleic acids to cells and that the nucleic acids remain biologically active. For example, a lipid delivery vehicle originally designed as a research tool, such as Lipofectin or LIPOFECTAMINE&#x2122; 2000, can deliver intact nucleic acid molecules to cells.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0287">Specific advantages of using liposomes include the following: they are non-toxic and biodegradable in composition; they display long circulation half-lives; and recognition molecules can be readily attached to their surface for targeting to tissues. Finally, cost-effective manufacture of liposome-based pharmaceuticals, either in a liquid suspension or lyophilized product, has demonstrated the viability of this technology as an acceptable drug delivery system.</p><p id="p-0314" num="0288">In some aspects, formulations associated with the invention might be selected for a class of naturally occurring or chemically synthesized or modified saturated and unsaturated fatty acid residues. Fatty acids might exist in a form of triglycerides, diglycerides or individual fatty acids. In another embodiment, the use of well-validated mixtures of fatty acids and/or fat emulsions currently used in pharmacology for parenteral nutrition may be utilized.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0289">Liposome based formulations are widely used for oligonucleotide delivery. However, most of commercially available lipid or liposome formulations contain at least one positively charged lipid (e.g., a cationic lipid). The presence of this positively charged lipid is believed to be essential for obtaining a high degree of oligonucleotide loading and for enhancing liposome fusogenic properties. Several methods have been performed and published to identify functional positively charged lipid chemistries. However, the commercially available liposome formulations containing cationic lipids are characterized by a high level of toxicity. In vivo limited therapeutic indexes have revealed that liposome formulations containing positive charged lipids are associated with toxicity (e.g., elevation in liver enzymes) at concentrations only slightly higher than concentration required to achieve RNA silencing.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0290">Nucleic acids associated with the invention can be hydrophobically modified and can be encompassed within neutral nanotransporters. Further description of neutral nanotransporters is incorporated by reference from PCT Application PCT/US2009/005251, filed on Sep. 22, 2009, and entitled &#x201c;Neutral Nanotransporters.&#x201d; Such particles enable quantitative oligonucleotide incorporation into non-charged lipid mixtures. The lack of toxic levels of cationic lipids in such neutral nanotransporter compositions is an important feature.</p><p id="p-0317" num="0291">As demonstrated in PCT/US2009/005251, oligonucleotides can effectively be incorporated into a lipid mixture that is free of cationic lipids and such a composition can effectively deliver a therapeutic oligonucleotide to a cell in a manner that it is functional. For example, a high level of activity was observed when the fatty mixture was composed of a phosphatidylcholine base fatty acid and a sterol such as a cholesterol. For instance, one preferred formulation of neutral fatty mixture is composed of at least 20% of DOPC or DSPC and at least 20% of sterol such as cholesterol. Even as low as 1:5 lipid to oligonucleotide ratio was shown to be sufficient to get complete encapsulation of the oligonucleotide in a non-charged formulation.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0292">The neutral nanotransporters compositions enable efficient loading of oligonucleotide into neutral fat formulation. The composition includes an oligonucleotide that is modified in a manner such that the hydrophobicity of the molecule is increased (for example a hydrophobic molecule is attached (covalently or no-covalently) to a hydrophobic molecule on the oligonucleotide terminus or a non-terminal nucleotide, base, sugar, or backbone), the modified oligonucleotide being mixed with a neutral fat formulation (for example containing at least 25% of cholesterol and 25% of DOPC or analogs thereof). A cargo molecule, such as another lipid can also be included in the composition. This composition, where part of the formulation is built into the oligonucleotide itself, enables efficient encapsulation of oligonucleotide in neutral lipid particles.</p><p id="p-0319" num="0293">In some aspects, stable particles ranging in size from 50 to 140 nm can be formed upon complexing of hydrophobic oligonucleotides with preferred formulations. The formulation by itself typically does not form small particles, but rather, forms agglomerates, which are transformed into stable 50-120 nm particles upon addition of the hydrophobic modified oligonucleotide.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0294">In some embodiments, neutral nanotransporter compositions include a hydrophobic modified polynucleotide, a neutral fatty mixture, and optionally a cargo molecule. A &#x201c;hydrophobic modified polynucleotide&#x201d; as used herein is a polynucleotide of the invention (e.g., sd-rxRNA) that has at least one modification that renders the polynucleotide more hydrophobic than the polynucleotide was prior to modification. The modification may be achieved by attaching (covalently or non-covalently) a hydrophobic molecule to the polynucleotide. In some instances the hydrophobic molecule is or includes a lipophilic group.</p><p id="p-0321" num="0295">The term &#x201c;lipophilic group&#x201d; means a group that has a higher affinity for lipids than its affinity for water. Examples of lipophilic groups include, but are not limited to, cholesterol, a cholesteryl or modified cholesteryl residue, adamantine, dihydrotesterone, long chain alkyl, long chain alkenyl, long chain alkynyl, olely-lithocholic, cholenic, oleoyl-cholenic, palmityl, heptadecyl, myrisityl, bile acids, cholic acid or taurocholic acid, deoxycholate, oleyl litocholic acid, oleoyl cholenic acid, glycolipids, phospholipids, sphingolipids, isoprenoids, such as steroids, vitamins, such as vitamin E, fatty acids either saturated or unsaturated, fatty acid esters, such as triglycerides, pyrenes, porphyrines, Texaphyrine, adamantane, acridones, biotin, coumarin, fluorescein, rhodamine, Texas-Red, digoxygenin, dimethoxytrityl, t-butyldimethylsilyl, t-butyldiphenylsilyl, cyanine dyes (e.g., Cy3 or Cy5), Hoechst 33258 dye, psoralen, or ibuprofen. The cholesterol moiety may be reduced (e.g., as in cholestan) or may be substituted (e.g., by halogen). A combination of different lipophilic groups in one molecule is also possible.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0296">The hydrophobic molecule may be attached at various positions of the polynucleotide. As described above, the hydrophobic molecule may be linked to the terminal residue of the polynucleotide such as the 3&#x2032; of 5&#x2032;-end of the polynucleotide. Alternatively, it may be linked to an internal nucleotide or a nucleotide on a branch of the polynucleotide. The hydrophobic molecule may be attached, for instance to a 2&#x2032;-position of the nucleotide. The hydrophobic molecule may also be linked to the heterocyclic base, the sugar or the backbone of a nucleotide of the polynucleotide.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0297">The hydrophobic molecule may be connected to the polynucleotide by a linker moiety. Optionally the linker moiety is a non-nucleotidic linker moiety. Non-nucleotidic linkers are e.g. abasic residues (dSpacer), oligoethyleneglycol, such as triethyleneglycol (spacer 9) or hexaethylenegylcol (spacer 18), or alkane-diol, such as butanediol. The spacer units are preferably linked by phosphodiester or phosphorothioate bonds. The linker units may appear just once in the molecule or may be incorporated several times, e.g., via phosphodiester, phosphorothioate, methylphosphonate, or amide linkages.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0298">Typical conjugation protocols involve the synthesis of polynucleotides bearing an aminolinker at one or more positions of the sequence, however, a linker is not required. The amino group is then reacted with the molecule being conjugated using appropriate coupling or activating reagents. The conjugation reaction may be performed either with the polynucleotide still bound to a solid support or following cleavage of the polynucleotide in solution phase. Purification of the modified polynucleotide by HPLC typically results in a pure material.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0299">In some embodiments the hydrophobic molecule is a sterol type conjugate, a PhytoSterol conjugate, cholesterol conjugate, sterol type conjugate with altered side chain length, fatty acid conjugate, any other hydrophobic group conjugate, and/or hydrophobic modifications of the internal nucleoside, which provide sufficient hydrophobicity to be incorporated into micelles.</p><p id="p-0326" num="0300">For purposes of the present invention, the term &#x201c;sterols&#x201d;, refers or steroid alcohols are a subgroup of steroids with a hydroxyl group at the 3-position of the A-ring. They are amphipathic lipids synthesized from acetyl-coenzyme A via the HMG-CoA reductase pathway. The overall molecule is quite flat. The hydroxyl group on the A ring is polar. The rest of the aliphatic chain is non-polar. Usually sterols are considered to have an 8 carbon chain at position 17.</p><p id="p-0327" num="0301">For purposes of the present invention, the term &#x201c;sterol type molecules&#x201d;, refers to steroid alcohols, which are similar in structure to sterols. The main difference is the structure of the ring and number of carbons in a position 21 attached side chain.</p><p id="p-0328" num="0302">For purposes of the present invention, the term &#x201c;PhytoSterols&#x201d; (also called plant sterols) are a group of steroid alcohols, phytochemicals naturally occurring in plants. There are more than 200 different known PhytoSterols.</p><p id="p-0329" num="0303">For purposes of the present invention, the term &#x201c;sterol side chain&#x201d; refers to a chemical composition of a side chain attached at the position 17 of sterol-type molecule. In a standard definition, sterols are limited to a 4 ring structure carrying an 8 carbon chain at position 17. In this invention, the sterol type molecules with side chain longer and shorter than conventional are described. The side chain may be branched or contain double back bones.</p><p id="p-0330" num="0304">Thus, sterols useful in the invention, for example, include cholesterols, as well as unique sterols in which position 17 has attached side chain of 2-7 or longer than 9 carbons. In some embodiments the length of the polycarbon tail is varied between 5 and 9 carbons. Such conjugates may have significantly better in vivo efficacy, in particular delivery to liver. These types of molecules are expected to work at concentrations 5 to 9 fold lower then oligonucleotides conjugated to conventional cholesterols.</p><p id="p-0331" num="0305">Alternatively the polynucleotide may be bound to a protein, peptide or positively charged chemical that functions as the hydrophobic molecule. The proteins may be selected from the group consisting of protamine, dsRNA binding domain, and arginine rich peptides. Exemplary positively charged chemicals include spermine, spermidine, cadaverine, and putrescine.</p><p id="p-0332" num="0306">In another embodiment hydrophobic molecule conjugates may demonstrate even higher efficacy when it is combined with specific chemical modification patterns of the polynucleotide (as described herein in detail), containing but not limited to hydrophobic modifications, phosphorothioate modifications, and 2&#x2032; ribo modifications.</p><p id="p-0333" num="0307">In another embodiment the sterol type molecule may be a naturally occurring PhytoSterols. The polycarbon chain may be longer than 9 and may be linear, branched and/or contain double bonds. Some PhytoSterol-containing polynucleotide conjugates may be significantly more potent and active in delivery of polynucleotides to various tissues. Some PhytoSterols may demonstrate tissue preference and thus be used as a way to delivery RNAi specifically to particular tissues.</p><p id="p-0334" num="0308">The hydrophobic modified polynucleotide is mixed with a neutral fatty mixture to form a micelle. The neutral fatty acid mixture is a mixture of fats that has a net neutral or slightly net negative charge at or around physiological pH that can form a micelle with the hydrophobic modified polynucleotide. For purposes of the present invention, the term &#x201c;micelle&#x201d; refers to a small nanoparticle formed by a mixture of non-charged fatty acids and phospholipids. The neutral fatty mixture may include cationic lipids as long as they are present in an amount that does not cause toxicity. In some embodiments the neutral fatty mixture is free of cationic lipids. A mixture that is free of cationic lipids is one that has less than 1% and preferably 0% of the total lipid being cationic lipid. The term &#x201c;cationic lipid&#x201d; includes lipids and synthetic lipids having a net positive charge at or around physiological pH. The term &#x201c;anionic lipid&#x201d; includes lipids and synthetic lipids having a net negative charge at or around physiological pH.</p><p id="p-0335" num="0309">The neutral fats bind to the oligonucleotides of the invention by a strong but non-covalent attraction (e.g., an electrostatic, van der Waals, pi-stacking, etc. interaction).</p><p id="p-0336" num="0310">The neutral fat mixture may include formulations selected from a class of naturally occurring or chemically synthesized or modified saturated and unsaturated fatty acid residues.

Choline based fatty acids include for instance, synthetic phosphocholine derivatives such as DDPC, DLPC, DMPC, DPPC, DSPC, DOPC, POPC, and DEPC. DOPC (chemical registry number 4235-95-4) is dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (also known as dielaidoylphosphatidylcholine, dioleoyl-PC, dioleoylphosphocholine, dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine).

Cargo molecules include but are not limited to intralipid, small molecules, fusogenic peptides or lipids or other small molecules might be added to alter cellular uptake, endosomal release or tissue distribution properties. The ability to tolerate cargo molecules is important for modulation of properties of these particles, if such properties are desirable. For instance the presence of some tissue specific metabolites might drastically alter tissue distribution profiles. For example use of Intralipid type formulation enriched in shorter or longer fatty chains with various degrees of saturation affects tissue distribution profiles of these type of formulations (and their loads).</p><p id="p-0342" num="0316">An example of a cargo lipid useful according to the invention is a fusogenic lipid. For instance, the zwiterionic lipid DOPE (chemical registry number 4004-5-1, 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-Glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine) is a preferred cargo lipid.</p><p id="p-0343" num="0317">Intralipid may be comprised of the following composition: 1 000 mL contain: purified soybean oil 90 g, purified egg phospholipids 12 g, glycerol anhydrous 22 g, water for injection q.s. ad 1 000 mL. pH is adjusted with sodium hydroxide to pH approximately 8. Energy content/L: 4.6 MJ (190 kcal). Osmolality (approx.): 300 mOsm/kg water. In another embodiment fat emulsion is Liposyn that contains 5% safflower oil, 5% soybean oil, up to 1.2% egg phosphatides added as an emulsifier and 2.5% glycerin in water for injection. It may also contain sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. pH 8.0 (6.0-9.0). Liposyn has an osmolarity of 276 m Osmol/liter (actual).</p><p id="p-0344" num="0318">Variation in the identity, amounts and ratios of cargo lipids affects the cellular uptake and tissue distribution characteristics of these compounds. For example, the length of lipid tails and level of saturability will affect differential uptake to liver, lung, fat and cardiomyocytes. Addition of special hydrophobic molecules like vitamins or different forms of sterols can favor distribution to special tissues which are involved in the metabolism of particular compounds. In some embodiments, vitamin A or E is used. Complexes are formed at different oligonucleotide concentrations, with higher concentrations favoring more efficient complex formation.</p><p id="p-0345" num="0319">In another embodiment, the fat emulsion is based on a mixture of lipids. Such lipids may include natural compounds, chemically synthesized compounds, purified fatty acids or any other lipids. In yet another embodiment the composition of fat emulsion is entirely artificial. In a particular embodiment, the fat emulsion is more than 70% linoleic acid. In yet another particular embodiment the fat emulsion is at least 1% of cardiolipin. Linoleic acid (LA) is an unsaturated omega-6 fatty acid. It is a colorless liquid made of a carboxylic acid with an 18-carbon chain and two cis double bonds.</p><p id="p-0346" num="0320">In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the alteration of the composition of the fat emulsion is used as a way to alter tissue distribution of hydrophobically modified polynucleotides. This methodology provides for the specific delivery of the polynucleotides to particular tissues.</p><p id="p-0347" num="0321">In another embodiment the fat emulsions of the cargo molecule contain more than 70% of Linoleic acid (C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>32</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and/or cardiolipin.</p><p id="p-0348" num="0322">Fat emulsions, like intralipid have been used before as a delivery formulation for some non-water soluble drugs (such as Propofol, re-formulated as Diprivan). Unique features of the present invention include (a) the concept of combining modified polynucleotides with the hydrophobic compound(s), so it can be incorporated in the fat micelles and (b) mixing it with the fat emulsions to provide a reversible carrier. After injection into a blood stream, micelles usually bind to serum proteins, including albumin, HDL, LDL and other. This binding is reversible and eventually the fat is absorbed by cells. The polynucleotide, incorporated as a part of the micelle will then be delivered closely to the surface of the cells. After that cellular uptake might be happening though variable mechanisms, including but not limited to sterol type delivery.</p><p id="p-0349" num="0323">Complexing agents bind to the oligonucleotides of the invention by a strong but non-covalent attraction (e.g., an electrostatic, van der Waals, pi-stacking, etc. interaction). In one embodiment, oligonucleotides of the invention can be complexed with a complexing agent to increase cellular uptake of oligonucleotides. An example of a complexing agent includes cationic lipids. Cationic lipids can be used to deliver oligonucleotides to cells. However, as discussed above, formulations free in cationic lipids are preferred in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0350" num="0324">The term &#x201c;cationic lipid&#x201d; includes lipids and synthetic lipids having both polar and non-polar domains and which are capable of being positively charged at or around physiological pH and which bind to polyanions, such as nucleic acids, and facilitate the delivery of nucleic acids into cells. In general cationic lipids include saturated and unsaturated alkyl and alicyclic ethers and esters of amines, amides, or derivatives thereof. Straight-chain and branched alkyl and alkenyl groups of cationic lipids can contain, e.g., from 1 to about 25 carbon atoms. Preferred straight chain or branched alkyl or alkene groups have six or more carbon atoms. Alicyclic groups include cholesterol and other steroid groups. Cationic lipids can be prepared with a variety of counterions (anions) including, e.g., Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, Br<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, I<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, F<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, acetate, trifluoroacetate, sulfate, nitrite, and nitrate.</p><p id="p-0351" num="0325">Examples of cationic lipids include polyethylenimine, polyamidoamine (PAMAM) starburst dendrimers, Lipofectin (a combination of DOTMA and DOPE), Lipofectase, LIPOFECTAMINE&#x2122; (e.g., LIPOFECTAMINE&#x2122; 2000), DOPE, Cytofectin (Gilead Sciences, Foster City, Calif.), and Eufectins (JBL, San Luis Obispo, Calif.). Exemplary cationic liposomes can be made from N-[l-(2,3-dioleoloxy)-propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA), N-[1-(2,3-dioleoloxy)-propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP), 3&#x3b2;-[N&#x2014;(N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-dimethylaminoethane)carbamoyl]cholesterol (DC-Chol), 2,3-dioleyloxy-N-[2(sperminecarboxamido)ethyl]-N,N-dimethyl-1-propanaminium trifluoroacetate (DOSPA), 1,2-dimyristyloxypropyl-3-dimethyl-hydroxyethyl ammonium bromide; and dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDAB). The cationic lipid N-(1-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA), for example, was found to increase 1000-fold the antisense effect of a phosphorothioate oligonucleotide. (Vlassov et al., 1994, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1197:95-108). Oligonucleotides can also be complexed with, e.g., poly (L-lysine) or avidin and lipids may, or may not, be included in this mixture, e.g., steryl-poly (L-lysine).</p><p id="p-0352" num="0326">Cationic lipids have been used in the art to deliver oligonucleotides to cells (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,855,910; 5,851,548; 5,830,430; 5,780,053; 5,767,099; Lewis et al. 1996<i>. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA </i>93:3176; Hope et al. 1998<i>. Molecular Membrane Biology </i>15:1). Other lipid compositions which can be used to facilitate uptake of the instant oligonucleotides can be used in connection with the claimed methods. In addition to those listed supra, other lipid compositions are also known in the art and include, e.g., those taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,235,871; 4,501,728; 4,837,028; 4,737,323.</p><p id="p-0353" num="0327">In one embodiment lipid compositions can further comprise agents, e.g., viral proteins to enhance lipid-mediated transfections of oligonucleotides (Kamata, et al., 1994<i>. Nucl. Acids. Res. </i>22:536). In another embodiment, oligonucleotides are contacted with cells as part of a composition comprising an oligonucleotide, a peptide, and a lipid as taught, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,736,392. Improved lipids have also been described which are serum resistant (Lewis, et al., 1996<i>. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </i>93:3176). Cationic lipids and other complexing agents act to increase the number of oligonucleotides carried into the cell through endocytosis.</p><p id="p-0354" num="0328">In another embodiment N-substituted glycine oligonucleotides (peptoids) can be used to improve uptake of oligonucleotides. Peptoids have been used to create cationic lipid-like compounds for transfection (Murphy, et al., 1998<i>. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. </i>95:1517). Peptoids can be synthesized using standard methods (e.g., Zuckermann, R. N., et al. 1992<i>. J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>114:10646; Zuckermann, R. N., et al. 1992<i>. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. </i>40:497). Combinations of cationic lipids and peptoids, liptoids, can also be used to improve uptake of the subject oligonucleotides (Hunag, et al., 1998<i>. Chemistry and Biology. </i>5:345). Liptoids can be synthesized by elaborating peptoid oligonucleotides and coupling the amino terminal submonomer to a lipid via its amino group (Hunag, et al., 1998<i>. Chemistry and Biology. </i>5:345).</p><p id="p-0355" num="0329">It is known in the art that positively charged amino acids can be used for creating highly active cationic lipids (Lewis et al. 1996<i>. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. </i>93:3176). In one embodiment, a composition for delivering oligonucleotides of the invention comprises a number of arginine, lysine, histidine or ornithine residues linked to a lipophilic moiety (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,777,153).</p><p id="p-0356" num="0330">In another embodiment, a composition for delivering oligonucleotides of the invention comprises a peptide having from between about one to about four basic residues. These basic residues can be located, e.g., on the amino terminal, C-terminal, or internal region of the peptide. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., glycine (can also be considered non-polar), asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine). Apart from the basic amino acids, a majority or all of the other residues of the peptide can be selected from the non-basic amino acids, e.g., amino acids other than lysine, arginine, or histidine. Preferably a preponderance of neutral amino acids with long neutral side chains are used.</p><p id="p-0357" num="0331">In one embodiment, a composition for delivering oligonucleotides of the invention comprises a natural or synthetic polypeptide having one or more gamma carboxyglutamic acid residues, or &#x3b3;-Gla residues. These gamma carboxyglutamic acid residues may enable the polypeptide to bind to each other and to membrane surfaces. In other words, a polypeptide having a series of &#x3b3;-Gla may be used as a general delivery modality that helps an RNAi construct to stick to whatever membrane to which it comes in contact. This may at least slow RNAi constructs from being cleared from the blood stream and enhance their chance of homing to the target.</p><p id="p-0358" num="0332">The gamma carboxyglutamic acid residues may exist in natural proteins (for example, prothrombin has 10 &#x3b3;-Gla residues). Alternatively, they can be introduced into the purified, recombinantly produced, or chemically synthesized polypeptides by carboxylation using, for example, a vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. The gamma carboxyglutamic acid residues may be consecutive or non-consecutive, and the total number and location of such gamma carboxyglutamic acid residues in the polypeptide can be regulated/fine-tuned to achieve different levels of &#x201c;stickiness&#x201d; of the polypeptide.</p><p id="p-0359" num="0333">In one embodiment, the cells to be contacted with an oligonucleotide composition of the invention are contacted with a mixture comprising the oligonucleotide and a mixture comprising a lipid, e.g., one of the lipids or lipid compositions described supra for between about 12 hours to about 24 hours. In another embodiment, the cells to be contacted with an oligonucleotide composition are contacted with a mixture comprising the oligonucleotide and a mixture comprising a lipid, e.g., one of the lipids or lipid compositions described supra for between about 1 and about five days. In one embodiment, the cells are contacted with a mixture comprising a lipid and the oligonucleotide for between about three days to as long as about 30 days. In another embodiment, a mixture comprising a lipid is left in contact with the cells for at least about five to about 20 days.

Preferably, after the transfection period the cells are substantially viable. In one embodiment, after transfection, the cells are between at least about 70% and at least about 100% viable. In another embodiment, the cells are between at least about 80% and at least about 95% viable. In yet another embodiment, the cells are between at least about 85% and at least about 90% viable.</p><p id="p-0362" num="0336">In one embodiment, oligonucleotides are modified by attaching a peptide sequence that transports the oligonucleotide into a cell, referred to herein as a &#x201c;transporting peptide.&#x201d; In one embodiment, the composition includes an oligonucleotide which is complementary to a target nucleic acid molecule encoding the protein, and a covalently attached transporting peptide.</p><p id="p-0363" num="0337">The language &#x201c;transporting peptide&#x201d; includes an amino acid sequence that facilitates the transport of an oligonucleotide into a cell. Exemplary peptides which facilitate the transport of the moieties to which they are linked into cells are known in the art, and include, e.g., HIV TAT transcription factor, lactoferrin, Herpes VP22 protein, and fibroblast growth factor 2 (Pooga et al. 1998<i>.

For example, in one embodiment, oligonucleotides bearing an activated thiol group are linked via that thiol group to a cysteine present in a transport peptide (e.g., to the cysteine present in the &#x3b2; turn between the second and the third helix of the antennapedia homeodomain as taught, e.g., in Derossi et al. 1998<i>. Trends Cell Biol. </i>8:84; Prochiantz. 1996<i>. Current Opinion in Neurobiol. </i>6:629; Allinquant et al. 1995. J Cell Biol. 128:919). In another embodiment, a Boc-Cys-(Npys)OH group can be coupled to the transport peptide as the last (N-terminal) amino acid and an oligonucleotide bearing an SH group can be coupled to the peptide (Troy et al. 1996<i>. J. Neurosci. </i>16:253).</p><p id="p-0365" num="0339">In one embodiment, a linking group can be attached to a nucleomonomer and the transporting peptide can be covalently attached to the linker. In one embodiment, a linker can function as both an attachment site for a transporting peptide and can provide stability against nucleases. Examples of suitable linkers include substituted or unsubstituted C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>20 </sub>alkyl chains, C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>20 </sub>alkenyl chains, C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>20 </sub>alkynyl chains, peptides, and heteroatoms (e.g., S, O, NH, etc.).

In some embodiments, immunomodulatory compositions as described herein are characterized as population of immune cells (e.g., T-cells, NK-cells, antigen-presenting cells (APC), dendritic cells (DC), stem cells (SC), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), etc.) having reduced (e.g., inhibited) expression or activity of one or more genes associated with controlling the differentiation process of T-cells (e.g., BRD4).</p><p id="p-0369" num="0343">As used herein, a &#x201c;proliferative disease&#x201d; refers to diseases and disorders characterized by excessive proliferation of cells and turnover of cellular matrix, including cancer, atherlorosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, scleroderma, cirrhosis of the liver, etc. Examples of cancers include but are not limited to neoplasms, malignant tumors, metastases, or any other disease or disorder characterized by uncontrolled cell growth such that it would be considered cancerous.

Examples of ACT modalities include but are not limited to autologous cell therapy (e.g., a subject's own cells are removed, genetically-modified, and returned to the subject), tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and heterologous cell therapy (e.g., cells are removed from a donor, genetically-modified, and placed into a recipient). In some embodiments, cells utilized in ACT therapeutic methods may be genetically-modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), which are engineered T-cell receptors displaying specificity against a target antigen based on a selected antibody moiety. Accordingly, in some embodiments, CAR T-cells (e.g. CARTs) may be transfected with a chemically-modified double stranded nucleic acid using methods described herein for the purpose of ACT therapy.</p><p id="p-0373" num="0347">With respect to in vivo applications, the formulations of the present invention can be administered to a patient in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, e.g., parenterally, orally, or intraperitoneally. Parenteral administration, which is preferred, includes administration by the following routes: intravenous; intramuscular; intratumorally; interstitially; intraarterially; subcutaneous; intra ocular; intrasynovial; trans epithelial, including transdermal; pulmonary via inhalation; ophthalmic; sublingual and buccal; topically, including ophthalmic; dermal; ocular; rectal; and nasal inhalation via insufflation.</p><p id="p-0374" num="0348">Pharmaceutical preparations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble or water-dispersible form. In addition, suspensions of the active compounds as appropriate oily injection suspensions may be administered. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils, for example, sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, for example, ethyl oleate or triglycerides. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension and include, for example, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran, optionally, the suspension may also contain stabilizers. The oligonucleotides of the invention can be formulated in liquid solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hank's solution or Ringer's solution. In addition, the oligonucleotides may be formulated in solid form and redissolved or suspended immediately prior to use. Lyophilized forms are also included in the invention.</p><p id="p-0375" num="0349">Drug delivery vehicles can be chosen e.g., for in vitro, for systemic administration. These vehicles can be designed to serve as a slow release reservoir or to deliver their contents directly to the target cell. An advantage of using some direct delivery drug vehicles is that multiple molecules are delivered per uptake. Such vehicles have been shown to increase the circulation half-life of drugs that would otherwise be rapidly cleared from the blood stream. Some examples of such specialized drug delivery vehicles which fall into this category are liposomes, hydrogels, cyclodextrins, biodegradable nanocapsules, and bioadhesive microspheres.</p><p id="p-0376" num="0350">Administration of an active amount of an oligonucleotide of the present invention is defined as an amount effective, at dosages and for periods of time necessary to achieve the desired result. For example, an active amount of an oligonucleotide may vary according to factors such as the type of cell, the oligonucleotide used, and for in vivo uses the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of the oligonucleotide to elicit a desired response in the individual. Establishment of therapeutic levels of oligonucleotides within the cell is dependent upon the rates of uptake and efflux or degradation. Decreasing the degree of degradation prolongs the intracellular half-life of the oligonucleotide. Thus, chemically-modified oligonucleotides, e.g., with modification of the phosphate backbone, may require different dosing.</p><p id="p-0377" num="0351">The exact dosage of an immunomodulatory composition and number of doses administered will depend upon the data generated experimentally and in clinical trials. Several factors such as the desired effect, the delivery vehicle, disease indication, and the route of administration, will affect the dosage. Dosages can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art and formulated into the subject pharmaceutical compositions. Preferably, the duration of treatment will extend at least through the course of the disease symptoms.</p><p id="p-0378" num="0352">Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the target therapeutic responses. For example, the immunomodulatory composition may be repeatedly administered, e.g., several doses may be administered daily, or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily be able to determine appropriate doses and schedules of administration of the subject chemically-modified double stranded nucleic acid molecules or immunomodulatory compositions, whether they are to be administered to cells or to subjects.</p><p id="p-0379" num="0353">Administration of immunomodulatory compositions, such as through intradermal injection or subcutaneous delivery, can be improved through testing of dosing regimens. In some embodiments, a single administration is sufficient. To further prolong the effect of the administered immunomodulatory compositions, the compositions can be administered in a slow-release formulation or device, as would be familiar to one of ordinary skill in the art.</p><p id="p-0380" num="0354">In other embodiments, the chemically-modified double stranded nucleic acid molecules or immunomodulatory compositions are administered multiple times. In some instances it is administered daily, bi-weekly, weekly, every two weeks, every three weeks, monthly, every two months, every three months, every four months, every five months, every six months or less frequently than every six months. In some instances, it is administered multiple times per day, week, month and/or year. For example, it can be administered approximately every hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 9 hours, 10 hours, 12 hours or more than twelve hours.
