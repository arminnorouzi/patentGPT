Thus, when the coating liquids are supplied from the respective flow paths to the mixing nozzle, the coating liquids are guided to be mixed together while increasing in flow velocity in the interior space of the mixing nozzle. By deflecting the coating liquids as described above, the coating liquids can be mixed together. By deflecting the coating liquids flowing through the nozzle for mixing as described above, a region where the coating liquids have a minimum flow velocity can be prevented compared with a case where the baffle for agitation is provided. Clogging of the nozzle with the coating liquids can thus be prevented. Maintainability can be improved due to reduction of work to eliminate clogging with the coating liquids.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the above-mentioned coating liquid mixing method, the above-mentioned mixing nozzle is prepared, and, in the supply step, the coating liquids are mixed using the mixing nozzle.

In the present embodiment, the coating liquid mixing device <b>20</b> is provided as a portion of a coating device, for example. Specifically, the coating liquid mixing device <b>20</b> is disposed at a location close to a jet of the coating device to eject the coating liquids. For example, the coating device includes a coating robotic device having a distal end movable to any location and orientation, an ejection device disposed at the distal end of the robotic device and ejecting the coating liquids, a supply device supplying the coating liquids from a storage tank storing the coating liquids to the ejection device, and a control device. The control device controls the robotic device, the ejection device, and the supply device.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The control device provides operating instructions to a robot, so that the robot can move the jet of the ejection device to a predetermined location and a predetermined orientation. The control device controls the ejection device and the supply device to eject a predetermined quantity of the coating liquids at a predetermined ejection time.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The coating device according to the present embodiment may include a bell cup <b>160</b> to micronize the coating liquids. The bell cup <b>160</b> forms a residence space <b>163</b> in which the coating liquids reside, and discharges the coating liquids residing in the residence space <b>163</b> radially outward by centrifugal force due to rotation. More particularly, the coating device includes a mixing nozzle <b>40</b> disposed upstream from the bell cup <b>160</b> and discharging the coating liquids to the residence space <b>163</b>. The coating liquids discharged from the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> collide with a wall surface <b>164</b> disposed downstream in a direction of ejection in the residence space <b>163</b> of the bell cup <b>160</b>. The bell cup <b>160</b> rotates around an ejection axis of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> at a high speed. The coating liquids in the residence space <b>163</b> adhering to the bell cup <b>160</b> move radially outward by centrifugal force while rotating along with the bell cup <b>160</b>. The coating liquids move along a wall surface of the bell cup <b>160</b>, and are discharged out of the residence space <b>163</b> by centrifugal force through an opening S formed in the residence space <b>163</b>. The coating liquids further move radially along the wall surface of the bell cup <b>160</b> in a thin-film form, change into a particle form at an edge of the bell cup <b>160</b>, and are splashed radially outward from the bell cup <b>160</b>. The splashed coating liquids are further atomized by an electrostatic effect, and move toward a coating target. The coating device according to the present embodiment sprays the atomized coating liquids onto the coating target as described above. For example, the coating device is used for exterior coating of a body of a vehicle, such as an automobile, a motorcycle, and a construction machine. The coating target may be an automotive part, an electronic device, a metal part, and the like.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The coating device according to the embodiment of the present invention mixes coating liquids, and supplies the mixed coating liquids to the residence space <b>163</b> of the bell cup <b>160</b>. The coating device discharges a mixture <b>15</b> of a coating liquid to be a main agent to determine a color and a curing agent to cure the main agent to the residence space <b>163</b> of the bell cup <b>160</b>. The mixture <b>15</b> is one example of a coating liquid. The main agent is selected as appropriate according to a required coating form (e.g., a coating color). A common curing agent may be used regardless of the required coating form (coating color). Known materials used as coating liquids can be used for the main agent and the curing agent.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The coating liquid mixing device <b>20</b> includes a supply tube <b>30</b> and the mixing nozzle <b>40</b>. The supply tube <b>30</b> includes flow paths <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. A curing agent <b>12</b> and a main agent <b>14</b> are supplied from a proximal end of the supply tube <b>30</b>. The curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> flow respectively through the flow path <b>32</b> and the flow path <b>34</b>, and flow out of respective outlets. The mixing nozzle <b>40</b> communicates with an outlet of the supply tube <b>30</b>. As described above, the curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> are mixed in the mixing nozzle <b>40</b>, and flow out of an outlet of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> toward the residence space <b>163</b> of the bell cup <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The supply tube <b>30</b> includes tubular flow paths. More specifically, the supply tube <b>30</b> includes, as the flow paths, a central flow path <b>32</b> and an annular flow path <b>34</b> to be an outer flow path. In the present embodiment, a coating liquid to be the main agent <b>14</b> is supplied to the annular flow path <b>34</b>. A coating liquid to be the curing agent <b>12</b> is supplied to the central flow path <b>32</b>. The viscosity of the curing agent <b>12</b> is higher than the viscosity of the main agent <b>14</b>. Specific gravity of the curing agent <b>12</b> is higher than specific gravity of the main agent <b>14</b>. The main agent <b>14</b> is supplied so that a flow rate (the volume of the agent flowing per unit time) of the main agent <b>14</b> is higher than a flow rate of the curing agent <b>12</b>. The flow paths through which the main agent <b>14</b> and the curing agent <b>12</b> pass may be reversed.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The central flow path <b>32</b> is formed so that a central axis thereof extends along a central axis of the supply tube <b>30</b>. The central flow path <b>32</b> has an outlet that is open downstream in a flow direction. In the present embodiment, the central flow path <b>32</b> is formed to have a circular cross-section perpendicular to the central axis.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The annular flow path <b>34</b> is located radially outward of the central flow path <b>32</b>. The annular flow path <b>34</b> is formed so that a central axis thereof extends along the central axis of the supply tube <b>30</b>. The annular flow path <b>34</b> has an outlet that is open downstream in the flow direction. In this example, the annular flow path <b>34</b> is formed to surround the central flow path <b>32</b>. The annular flow path <b>34</b> is annularly formed to fully circumferentially cover the central flow path <b>32</b>. More specifically, the annular flow path <b>34</b> is annularly formed to be centered at the central axis of the central conduit. That is to say, the central flow path and the annular flow path are formed to be concentric with each other.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The supply tube <b>30</b> as described above can be formed by a combination of two tubes. For example, a spacer member to position a central tube at a fixed location relative to an outer tube may be interposed between the central tube and the outer tube. A state of the annular flow path <b>34</b> being formed around the central flow path <b>32</b> may be maintained as described above. A communication path to communicate the flow paths of the supply tube is not formed, and the curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> flowing respectively through the central flow path and the annular flow path flow from an inlet to the outlet without being mixed in the supply tube <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The cross-section perpendicular to the axis of the central flow path <b>32</b> may not be circular, and may be elliptical or polygonal, for example. The annular flow path <b>34</b> may not have a circular annular cross-section, and may have an elliptical annular cross-section or a polygonal annular cross-section. The shape and the size of each of the flow path <b>32</b> and the flow path <b>34</b> may differ at the inlet and at the outlet of the supply tube <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The mixing nozzle <b>40</b> communicates with the outlet of the supply tube <b>30</b>. The mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is in the form of a tube that is open at opposite ends along an axis. An inlet of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is connected to the outlet of the supply tube <b>30</b>. An outlet of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is located downstream from the outlet of the supply tube <b>30</b> in the flow direction. The majority of an interior space <b>42</b> of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is thus disposed downstream from the supply tube <b>30</b> in the flow direction of the coating liquids. Specifically, the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is shaped to cover the outlet of the annular flow path <b>34</b>. The outlet of the central flow path <b>32</b> and the outlet of the annular flow path <b>34</b> are open to the interior space of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b>. The curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> having passed respectively through the flow path <b>32</b> and the flow path <b>34</b> thus join together in the interior space <b>42</b> of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b>. The mixing nozzle <b>40</b> in this example is in the form of a cylindrical tube coaxial with the supply tube <b>30</b>. In other words, the interior space <b>42</b> of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is formed to be coaxial with the central flow path <b>32</b> and the annular flow path <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The mixing nozzle <b>40</b> includes a reduced diameter portion gradually narrowing toward the outlet. Specifically, the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> includes, in addition to the reduced diameter portion, a connection portion connected to the supply tube <b>30</b> and an ejection portion in which a jet is formed. The connection portion, the reduced diameter portion, and the ejection portion of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> are arranged along the axis from an upstream side to a downstream side in the flow direction. In this example, the connection portion is connected to the supply tube <b>30</b> by being fit onto the supply tube <b>30</b> from radially outside the supply tube <b>30</b>. The connection portion communicates with the reduced diameter portion on a side downstream in the flow direction. The reduced diameter portion communicates with the ejection portion on a side downstream in the flow direction. In this example, the ejection portion is in the form of a cylindrical tube having a uniform diameter along the axis.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the interior space <b>42</b> of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is formed so that an open area S<b>4</b> at an outlet at which the jet is formed is smaller than a total open area S<b>1</b> of the flow path <b>32</b> and the flow path <b>34</b> (S<b>4</b>&#x3c;S<b>1</b>). Specifically, the interior space <b>42</b> is shaped to have a cross-sectional area gradually reduced toward the jet to be the outlet by the reduced diameter portion. In the present embodiment, the total open area S<b>1</b> of the flow path <b>32</b> and the flow path <b>34</b> is the sum of an open area S<b>2</b> at the outlet of the central flow path <b>32</b> and an open area S<b>3</b> at the outlet of the annular flow path <b>34</b>. The interior space <b>42</b> herein includes a proximal end side space <b>43</b>, an intermediate space <b>44</b>, and a distal end side space <b>45</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The proximal end side space <b>43</b> is in the form of a cylinder having an outer diameter greater than an outer diameter of the annular flow path <b>34</b>. Herein, the outer diameter of the proximal end side space <b>43</b> is set to be the same as an outer diameter of the supply tube <b>30</b>, and the proximal end side space <b>43</b> extends further downstream from an end at the outlet of the supply tube <b>30</b> in the flow direction. The distal end side space <b>45</b> is formed in a portion of a cylindrical space having a smaller outer diameter than the proximal end side space <b>43</b>. The open area S<b>4</b> at a distal end in the distal end side space <b>45</b> is smaller than the above-mentioned total area S<b>1</b>. In the present embodiment, the area S<b>4</b> in the distal end side space <b>45</b> is set to be smaller than the open area S<b>2</b> of the central flow path <b>32</b>. The central flow path <b>32</b> may have a greater cross-sectional area (cross-sectional area along the axis) than the annular flow path <b>34</b> at an outer periphery of the central flow path <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The intermediate space <b>44</b> is shaped to be gradually reduced from the proximal end side space <b>43</b> toward the distal end side space <b>45</b>. The intermediate space <b>44</b> is herein shaped to have an outer diameter continuously reduced from the proximal end side space <b>43</b> toward the distal end side space <b>45</b>. In other words, the intermediate space <b>44</b> is formed in a space in the form of a truncated cone obtained by cutting off the top of a cone.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The mixing nozzle <b>40</b> as described above may be formed by ductile deformation or cutting of a metal tube. In this example, the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is formed to have an outer shape corresponding to the above-mentioned interior space <b>42</b>. The mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is only required to have the above-mentioned interior space <b>42</b> therein, and the outer shape of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is not particularly limited.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the present embodiment, the supply tube <b>30</b> and the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> are formed to be separate from each other. The outer diameter at a distal end of the supply tube <b>30</b> and an inner diameter at a proximal end of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> are set so that the proximal end of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> can be fit onto the distal end of the supply tube <b>30</b>. The proximal end of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> can thus be fit onto the distal end of the supply tube <b>30</b>, so that the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> has an attachment structure removably attached to the supply tube <b>30</b>. The structure in which the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is removably attached to the supply tube <b>30</b> may be a structure in which one of the distal end of the supply tube and the proximal end of the mixing nozzle is press fit into the other one of the distal end of the supply tube and the proximal end of the mixing nozzle. The connection portion in which the supply tube and the mixing nozzle are connected may have a structure to prevent removal to maintain the connection, for example. For example, the mixing nozzle is removably attached to the supply tube by a fastening member, such as a bolt member and a clamp member. The attachment structure may be a structure in which the distal end of the supply tube and the proximal end of the mixing nozzle have engaging threads, and they engage with each other. Alternatively, the attachment structure may be a structure in which a screw threaded into the mixing nozzle is pressed against an outer periphery of the supply tube <b>30</b> or a structure in which a hook structure provided to one of the supply tube <b>30</b> and the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is caught by the other one of the supply tube <b>30</b> and the mixing nozzle <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A structure to supply the curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> respectively to the flow path <b>32</b> and the flow path <b>34</b> will be described.

The main agent supply source <b>66</b> is a tank storing the main agent <b>14</b> as a coating liquid <b>14</b>. A main agent pump <b>68</b> is disposed along the main agent supply <b>67</b>. Due to driving of the main agent pump <b>68</b>, the main agent <b>14</b> stored in the main agent supply source <b>66</b> is supplied toward the annular flow path <b>34</b>. A flow velocity (pressure) of the main agent <b>14</b> flowing through the annular flow path <b>34</b> is adjusted through control of operation of the main agent pump <b>68</b>. The above-mentioned pumps <b>62</b> and <b>68</b> are connected to a control unit <b>16</b>. The control unit <b>16</b> includes a computer including a central processing unit (CPU), a main storage, an auxiliary storage, and the like.

In this case, the tank and the main agent supply are provided for each of the different main agents, and a switching device to switch a supply path is provided. The control unit controls the switching device to switch the main agent supplied to the supply tube. The control device thus allows for supply of different main agents depending on the coating target.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A coating liquid mixing method will be described. The coating liquid mixing method includes (a) a preparation step of preparing the supply tube <b>30</b> and the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> described above and (b) a supply step of supplying, after the preparation step, the curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> respectively to the flow path <b>32</b> and the flow path <b>34</b> of the supply tube <b>30</b>, and mixing the curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> from the outlet of the supply tube <b>30</b> in the interior space <b>42</b> of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The interior space <b>42</b> of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is a space in which the curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> are mixed, and is thus one example of a mixing space. The interior space <b>42</b> includes a reduced diameter portion narrowing toward the outlet. Thus, the curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> are guided to be mixed together while increasing in flow velocity in the interior space <b>42</b> of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b>. By deflecting the curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> as described above, the curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> can be mixed together. Due to so-called shear mixing as described above, a region where the coating liquids have a minimum flow velocity can be prevented compared with a case where a baffle for agitation is provided to the supply. Clogging of the nozzle with the coating liquids can thus be prevented. Maintainability can be improved due to reduction of work to eliminate clogging with the coating liquids. In the present embodiment, clogging with the coating liquids can be prevented as described above, so that, in addition to reduction of a work step, the quantity of a cleaning agent used to eliminate clogging with the coating liquids can be reduced. Waste liquid treatment of the cleaning agent can thus be reduced, leading to reduction in cost of the waste liquid treatment and load on an environment. Shear mixing herein refers to mixing while shearing force is mainly applied to each of the coating liquids.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In the present embodiment, the flow rate (volume of the agent flowing per unit time) of the main agent <b>14</b> flowing through the annular flow path <b>34</b> is set to be higher than the flow rate of the curing agent <b>12</b> flowing through the central flow path <b>32</b>. The flow velocity of the main agent <b>14</b> flowing through the annular flow path <b>34</b> may be set to be higher than the flow velocity of the curing agent <b>12</b> flowing through the central flow path <b>32</b>. The flow velocity herein refers to the flow velocity at the outlet of each of the central flow path <b>32</b> and the annular flow path <b>34</b>. The flow rate or the flow velocity as described above may be set through control of driving of each of the above-mentioned pumps <b>62</b> and <b>68</b> and the like in view of the area of each of the central flow path <b>32</b> and the annular flow path <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The main agent <b>14</b> is supplied from the annular flow path <b>34</b> toward a radially outward region in the interior space <b>42</b>. As described above, an inner peripheral wall surrounding the main agent <b>14</b> supplied from the annular flow path <b>34</b> narrows in the interior space <b>42</b>. The inner peripheral wall in the interior space <b>42</b> thus deflects the main agent <b>14</b> to a radially inward region, and increases the flow velocity of the main agent <b>14</b>. This makes the main agent <b>14</b> more likely to move toward the curing agent <b>12</b> flowing through the radially inward region, and to be mixed with the curing agent <b>12</b>. In other words, the increase in flow velocity (flow rate) of the main agent <b>14</b> facilitates creation of a flow of the main agent <b>14</b> entering into the radially inward region in the interior space <b>42</b>, and can further promote the so-called shear mixing. The flow velocity (or the flow rate) of the curing agent <b>12</b> flowing through the central flow path <b>32</b> may be set to be the same as or higher than the flow velocity (or the flow rate) of the main agent <b>14</b> flowing through the annular flow path <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the present embodiment, the viscosity of the main agent <b>14</b> flowing through the annular flow path <b>34</b> is set to be lower than the viscosity of the curing agent <b>12</b> flowing through the central flow path <b>32</b>. Such setting may be achieved by making setting so that the viscosity of the curing agent <b>12</b> stored in the curing agent supply source <b>60</b> is higher than the viscosity of the main agent <b>14</b> stored in the main agent supply source <b>66</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">By making setting so that the viscosity of the main agent <b>14</b> flowing through the annular flow path <b>34</b> is lower as described above, the main agent <b>14</b> flowing through the radially outward region in the interior space <b>42</b> is easily deflected. This facilitates movement of the main agent <b>14</b> flowing through the radially outward region toward the radially inward region and creation of the flow of the main agent <b>14</b> entering into the radially inward region from the radially outward region in the interior space <b>42</b>, and can further promote the so-called shear mixing. The viscosity of the curing agent <b>12</b> flowing through the central flow path <b>32</b> may be set to be the same as or higher than the viscosity of the main agent <b>14</b> flowing through the annular flow path <b>34</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to the coating liquid mixing device <b>20</b> and the coating liquid mixing method described above, the different coating liquids <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> can be mixed as described above. In the present embodiment, the mixture <b>15</b> discharged by the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> reaches the residence space <b>163</b> in the bell cup <b>160</b>, and is further agitated in the bell cup <b>160</b>. Mixing before reaching the coating target can thus be further enhanced. In other words, mixing can be performed both in the bell cup <b>160</b> and in the mixing nozzle <b>40</b>, so that a degree of mixing before reaching the coating target can be improved compared with a case where mixing is performed only in the mixing nozzle <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The interior space of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> may be formed in the intermediate space <b>44</b> shaped to be gradually continuously reduced toward the distal end side space <b>45</b>. In this case, a corner to which the curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> are likely to adhere can be suppressed. Furthermore, even if the curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> adhere to the inner peripheral wall of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b>, the adhering agents are easily cleaned with a cleaning liquid due to prevention of any irregularity in the inner peripheral surface. The mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is easily cleaned, for example, and thus has high maintainability. Although the interior space is in the form of the truncated cone in the present embodiment, the interior space may have any other cross-sectional shapes along the axis. For example, the inner peripheral surface may extend curvilinearly, for example, parabolically, and may gradually be reduced in diameter toward the outlet.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The annular flow path <b>34</b> may annularly be formed to circumferentially surround the central flow path <b>32</b>. In this case, the main agent <b>14</b> supplied from the annular flow path <b>34</b> to the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> can be guided from a region fully circumferentially provided around the central axis toward the central axis of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b>. A lack of circumferential balance of a degree of mixing can thus be suppressed. The curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> can thus more suitably be mixed.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The mixing nozzle <b>40</b> may be shaped to be removably attached to the supply tube <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this case, the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> can be removed from the supply tube <b>30</b> for cleaning. The main agent <b>14</b> and the curing agent <b>12</b> are mixed in the mixing nozzle <b>40</b>, and are thus more likely to adhere to the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> than to the upstream portion due to curing. By removing the portion, a portion to which the main agent <b>14</b> and the curing agent <b>12</b> adhere can more intensively be cleaned compared with a case where the portion is cleaned along with the supply tube <b>30</b>. The coating liquid mixing device <b>20</b> has high maintainability from this perspective. Furthermore, the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is connected to a downstream end (the distal end) to be a downstream outlet of the supply tube <b>30</b> in the present embodiment. The mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is thus more accessible from a downstream side on which the bell cup <b>160</b> is located compared with a case where the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is disposed upstream from the supply tube <b>30</b>. The mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is thus easily removed and attached, leading to reduction in time required to remove the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> for cleaning.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The mixing nozzle <b>40</b> may be formed so that the open area S<b>4</b> at the distal end in the interior space <b>42</b> is smaller than the total open area S<b>1</b> of the flow path <b>32</b> and the flow path <b>34</b> (S<b>4</b>&#x3c;S<b>1</b>). In this case, the flow velocity of the curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> discharged from the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> can be higher than the flow velocity of the curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> flowing through the supply tube. Such reduction in open area at the distal end can promote mixing in the mixing space, and enhance the degree of mixing of the curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b>. Since the open area in a region upstream from the outlet of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> is smaller than the total open area S<b>1</b> of the flow path <b>32</b> and the flow path <b>34</b>, the flow velocity of the curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> can be increased before discharge, and the degree of mixing can further be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The open area S<b>2</b> of the central flow path <b>32</b> may be greater than the area S<b>4</b> at the outlet of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b>. In this case, mixing in the mixing space can further be promoted by further reducing the area S<b>4</b>. The flow velocity of the curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> is increased in the mixing nozzle <b>40</b>. Mixing of the curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> can thus further be promoted.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The mixing device <b>20</b> may include an outer peripheral flow path <b>136</b> at an outer periphery of the flow path <b>32</b> and the flow path <b>34</b>.

In this case, the outer peripheral flow path <b>136</b> reaches the distal end of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b> through the outer periphery of the mixing nozzle <b>40</b>, and is thus less likely to reach the openings of the flow path <b>32</b> and the flow path <b>34</b>. The cleaning liquid <b>112</b> is thus less likely to be mixed with the curing agent <b>12</b> and the main agent <b>14</b> supplied respectively from the flow path <b>32</b> and the flow path <b>34</b>, and the mixture <b>15</b> can stably be manufactured.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">{Modifications}</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Although an example in which the mixing device <b>20</b> is used for the coating device including the bell cup <b>160</b> has been shown in the present embodiment, the present invention is not limited to the example.

The flow velocity of the cleaning liquid passing through the recess <b>35</b><i>a </i>can thus be higher than the flow velocity of the cleaning liquid flowing at a location upstream from the recess <b>35</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">A cleaning effect can be enhanced by providing the recess <b>35</b><i>a </i>as one example of a guide to guide the cleaning liquid to a region radially inward of a slope of the mixing nozzle <b>140</b> as described above.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the present embodiment, the proximal end of the mixing nozzle <b>140</b> completely covers an open end of the supply tube <b>30</b>B forming an inner partition of a path through the cleaning liquid flows. The proximal end of the mixing nozzle <b>140</b> may partially cover or may not cover the open end of the supply tube <b>30</b>B.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The recess <b>35</b><i>a </i>is only required to be shaped to radially penetrate the supply tube <b>30</b>B, and the shape thereof is not particularly limited. The guide to guide the cleaning liquid inward of the mixing nozzle <b>140</b> may not necessarily be the recess radially penetrating the supply tube <b>30</b>B. For example, the inward facing surface <b>141</b>Sa itself may be the guide to guide the cleaning liquid inward of the mixing nozzle <b>140</b>, and, in this case, the recess <b>35</b><i>a </i>may be omitted. Alternatively, a guide flow path to guide the cleaning liquid inward of the mixing nozzle <b>140</b> due to a combination of irregularities may be formed between the outer periphery at the distal end of the supply tube and the inward facing surface <b>141</b>Sa.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">A case where only two-liquid mixing coating is performed without allowing the cleaning liquid to flow is also included in the present invention.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Configurations described in the above-mentioned embodiment and modifications can be combined with each other as appropriate unless any contradiction occurs.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">While the present invention has been described in detail, the foregoing description is in all aspects illustrative and not restrictive. It is understood that numerous unillustrated modifications can be devised without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As described above, the present application includes the following aspects.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">A first aspect is a coating liquid mixing device including: a supply tube including flow paths through which respective coating liquids flow and which are distally open; and a mixing nozzle communicating with an outlet of the supply tube so that the coating liquids flowing through the flow paths are supplied to an interior space, and including a reduced diameter portion in which the interior space is reduced toward an outlet so that an open area of the mixing nozzle is smaller than a total open area of the flow paths.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The mixing device includes the mixing nozzle having the interior space shaped to be reduced toward the outlet so that the open area of the mixing nozzle is smaller than the total open area of the flow paths. Thus, when the coating liquids are supplied from the respective flow paths to the mixing nozzle, the coating liquids are guided to be mixed together while increasing in flow velocity in the interior space of the mixing nozzle. By deflecting the coating liquids as described above, the coating liquids can be mixed together. By deflecting the coating liquids flowing through the nozzle for mixing as described above, a region where the coating liquids have a minimum flow velocity can be prevented compared with a case where the baffle for agitation is provided. Clogging of the nozzle with the coating liquids can thus be prevented. Maintainability can be improved due to reduction of work to eliminate clogging with the coating liquids.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">A second aspect is the coating liquid mixing device according to the first aspect, wherein the reduced diameter portion is shaped so that an open area is gradually continuously reduced toward the outlet. In this case, a corner to which the coating liquids are likely to adhere can be suppressed. Furthermore, even if the coating liquids adhere to the inner peripheral wall of the mixing nozzle, the adhering coating liquids are easily cleaned with the cleaning liquid due to prevention of any irregularity in the inner peripheral surface. The mixing nozzle is easily cleaned, for example, and thus has high maintainability.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">A third aspect is the coating liquid mixing device according to the first or second aspect, wherein the flow paths include a central flow path and an annular flow path circumferentially surrounding the central flow path. The coating liquid supplied from the annular flow path to the mixing nozzle can thus be guided from a region fully circumferentially provided around the central axis toward the central axis of the mixing nozzle. A lack of circumferential balance of a degree of mixing can thus be suppressed. The coating liquids can thus more suitably be mixed.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">A fourth aspect is the coating liquid mixing device according to any one of the first to third aspects, wherein the mixing nozzle is shaped to be removably attached to the supply tube. The mixing nozzle can thus be removed from the supply tube for cleaning. The coating liquid mixing device has high maintainability from this perspective.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">A fifth aspect is the coating liquid mixing device according to any one of the first to fourth aspects, wherein the mixing nozzle is attached to a downstream end of the supply tube. The mixing nozzle is thus more accessible from a downstream side compared with a case where the mixing nozzle is disposed upstream from the supply tube. The mixing nozzle is thus easily removed and attached, leading to reduction in time required to remove the mixing nozzle for cleaning.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">A sixth aspect is the coating liquid mixing device according to any one of the first to fifth aspects, wherein the flow paths include a central flow path located in a center of the supply tube and an outer flow path located radially outward of the central flow path, and an open area at the outlet of the mixing nozzle is smaller than an open area at an outlet of the central flow path. Mixing in the mixing space can further be promoted by further reducing the area of the mixing nozzle. The flow velocity of the coating liquids is increased in the mixing nozzle. Mixing of the coating liquids can thus further be promoted.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">A seventh aspect is the coating liquid mixing device according to any one of the first to sixth aspects, wherein the coating liquid mixing device is provided with a rotating member forming a residence space in which a coating liquid ejected from the mixing nozzle resides, and discharging the coating liquid residing in the residence space radially outward by centrifugal force due to rotation. In this case, the liquid discharged by the mixing nozzle reaches the residence space in the bell cup, and is further agitated in the bell cup. Mixing before reaching the coating target can thus be further enhanced.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">An eighth aspect is the coating liquid mixing device according to any one of the first to seventh aspects, further including a tube covering an outer periphery of the supply tube, and communicating with the mixing nozzle, wherein a cleaning liquid flow path is located between the supply tube and the tube, the cleaning liquid flow path allowing a cleaning liquid to pass between the supply tube and the tube and to be supplied to the interior space of the mixing nozzle. The interior of the mixing nozzle can thus be cleaned with the cleaning liquid.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">A coating liquid mixing method according to a ninth aspect is a coating liquid mixing method including: (a) a preparation step of preparing a supply tube and a mixing nozzle, the supply tube including flow paths through which respective coating liquids flow and which are distally open, the mixing nozzle communicating with an outlet of the supply tube so that the coating liquids flowing through the flow paths are supplied to an interior space, and including a reduced diameter portion in which the interior space is gradually reduced toward an outlet so that an open area of the mixing nozzle is smaller than a total open area of the flow paths; and (b) a supply step of supplying, after the preparation step, the coating liquids to the respective flow paths of the supply tube, and mixing the coating liquids from the outlet of the supply tube in the interior space of the mixing nozzle.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">According to the coating liquid mixing method, the above-mentioned mixing nozzle is prepared, and, in the supply step, the coating liquids are mixed using the mixing nozzle. Clogging of the nozzle with the coating liquids can thus be prevented to improve maintainability as described above.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">A tenth aspect is the coating liquid mixing method according to the ninth aspect, wherein the flow paths of the supply tube prepared in the preparation step (a) include a central flow path and an annular flow path circumferentially surrounding the central flow path, and, in the supply step (b), different coating liquids are supplied to the central flow path and the annular flow path, and a flow velocity of a coating liquid flowing through the annular flow path is set to be higher than a flow velocity of a coating liquid flowing through the central flow path. An inner peripheral wall surrounding the coating liquid supplied from the annular flow path narrows in the interior space of the mixing nozzle. The inner peripheral wall in the interior space thus deflects the coating liquid to a radially inward region, and increases the flow velocity of the coating liquid. This makes the coating liquid supplied from the annular flow path more likely to move toward the coating liquid supplied from the central flow path to facilitate mixing of the coating liquids.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">An eleventh aspect is the coating liquid mixing method according to the ninth or tenth aspect, wherein the flow paths of the supply tube prepared in the preparation step (a) include a central flow path and an annular flow path circumferentially surrounding the central flow path, and, in the supply step (b), a viscosity of a coating liquid supplied to the annular flow path is set to be lower than a viscosity of a coating liquid supplied to the central flow path. The coating liquid flowing through the radially outward region in the interior space of the mixing nozzle is thus easily deflected. This facilitates movement of the coating liquid flowing through the radially outward region toward the radially inward region and creation of the flow of the coating liquid entering into the radially inward region from the radially outward region in the interior space, and can further promote the so-called shear mixing.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">A twelfth aspect is the coating liquid mixing method according to any one of the ninth to eleventh aspect, wherein the flow paths of the supply tube prepared in the preparation step (a) include a central flow path and an annular flow path circumferentially surrounding the central flow path, and, in the supply step (b), a coating liquid to be a main agent is supplied to the annular flow path, and a curing agent to cure the main agent is supplied to the central flow path. The coating liquid to be the main agent is deflected to the radially inward region in the interior space of the mixing nozzle while increasing in flow velocity. This makes the main agent more likely to move toward the curing agent flowing through the radially inward region, and to be mixed with the curing agent.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">EXPLANATION OF REFERENCE SIGNS</heading><p id="p-0092" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0091"><b>12</b> curing agent (coating liquid)</li>        <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0092"><b>14</b> main agent (coating liquid)</li>        <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0093"><b>20</b>, <b>20</b>B coating liquid mixing device</li>        <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0094"><b>30</b> supply tube</li>        <li id="ul0003-0005" num="0095"><b>32</b> central flow path</li>        <li id="ul0003-0006" num="0096"><b>34</b> annular flow path</li>        <li id="ul0003-0007" num="0097"><b>40</b> mixing nozzle</li>        <li id="ul0003-0008" num="0098"><b>42</b> interior space</li>        <li id="ul0003-0009" num="0099"><b>134</b> tube</li>        <li id="ul0003-0010" num="0100"><b>160</b> bell cup</li>        <li id="ul0003-0011" num="0101"><b>163</b> residence space</li>        <li id="ul0003-0012" num="0102">S<b>1</b> total open area</li>        <li id="ul0003-0013" num="0103">S<b>2</b> open area of central flow path</li>        <li id="ul0003-0014" num="0104">S<b>3</b> open area of annular flow path</li>        <li id="ul0003-0015" num="0105">S<b>4</b> open area of mixing nozzle</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
