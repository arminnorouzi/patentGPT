The SSB comprises a Primary Synchronization Signal (PSS), a Secondary Synchronization Signal (SSS), and a Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH). An illustration of the NR SSB is given in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. As shown, the SSB is mapped to 4 orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols in the time domain and 20 Resource Blocks (RBs) in the frequency domain. Each RB comprises 12 subcarriers, which means that the SSB is mapped to 240 subcarriers in the frequency domain. The PSS is mapped to the first OFDM symbol and the SSS is mapped to the third OFDM symbol. They are both mapped to 127 subcarriers in the frequency domain. These 127 subcarriers are placed in the middle of the 240 subcarriers of the SSB. The PBCH is mapped to the second, third and fourth OFDM symbol. The PBCH is mapped to 20 RBs in the second and fourth OFDM symbol. In the third OFDM symbol, the PBCH is mapped to the 4 RBs above and the 4 RBs below the SSS.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Multiple SSBs may be transmitted within e.g. a 5 ms time window, e.g. in the first four slots in the 5 ms time window. These multiple SSBs are further transmitted periodically in an SS-burst-set period of e.g. 20 ms intervals. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates one example of time domain occurrence of the SSBs. The size of the time window and the intervals may be configured by the network.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">System Information (SI) in NR is delivered through a Master Information Block (MIB) and System Information Blocks (SIBs).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The MIB is transmitted on the PBCH within the SSB. It contains a small amount of information, necessary for the UE to receive the remaining SI in the SIBs. The MIB contains a configuration of a Control Resource Set #0 (CORESET #0) and Search Space #0. The CORESET #0 is a time and frequency region where the UE monitors for a Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH). The Search Space defines e.g. monitoring locations of the CORESET in time.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The structure of the MIB is specified in the standard. Therefore, changes between releases may break backwards compatibility. Currently, the smallest possible CORESET #0 size in the frequency domain is 24 RBs, while the MIB occupies 20 RBs. All the bits in the MIB have a specific meaning defined by the current NR standard, except one bit which is still reserved.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The SIBs are scheduled in a similar way as normal data transmission but are repeated periodically by being scheduled in a SI window. The PDCCH indicates to the UE that a Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) is to be received, where the PDSCH may contain the SIB (or SIBs).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Implementation of low-cost and/or low-complexity UEs is needed for the 5G system, e.g., for massive industrial sensors deployment or wearables. NR-Light has been used as the running name for the discussion of such low-cost and/or low-complexity UEs in 3GPP. NR-Light relates to reduced capability wireless devices and is therefore also referred to as NR-Redcap. NR-Light is a new feature that is under discussion and could be introduced as early as in 3GPP Release 17. NR-Light is intended for use cases that do not require a device to support full-fledged NR capability and IMT-2020 performance requirements. For example, the data rate may not need to reach above 1 Gbps, and the latency may not need to be as low as 1 ms. By relaxing the data rate and latency targets, NR-Light enables low-cost and/or low-complexity UE implementation. In 3GPP Release 15, an NR UE is required to support 100 MHz carrier bandwidth in Frequency Range (FR) 1 (from 410 MHz to 7125 MHz) and 200 MHz carrier bandwidth in FR2 (from 24.25 GHz to 52.6 GHz). For a UE operating in NR-Light (e.g. an NR-Light UE), supporting 100 MHz or 200 MHz bandwidth is superfluous. For example, a UE bandwidth of 8.64 MHz might be sufficient if the use cases do not require a data rate higher than 20 Mbps. A reduced UE bandwidth may result in cost and/or complexity reduction and a possible energy consumption reduction.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One of the initial cell access steps is for the UE to acquire SIB type 1 (SIB1), which is acquired after the UE acquires the MIB. SIB1 is scheduled through PDCCH using Search Space #0 associated with CORESET #0. In NR, CORESET #0 has bandwidths 4.32 MHz, 8.64 MHz, or 17.28 MHz in FR1, and 34.56 MHz or 69.12 MHz in FR2. The bandwidth of CORESET #0 depends on the subcarrier spacing indicated in MIB (by parameter subCarrierSpacingCommon) and is configured by the network.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">For example, if CORESET #0 uses 30 kHz subcarrier spacing for PDCCH, the bandwidth of CORESET #0 can be either 8.64 MHz or 17.28 MHz. The network may choose either bandwidth option. Between the two options, some implementation consideration may favor the configuration of 17.28 MHz bandwidth for CORESET #0. For example, with 30 kHz subcarrier spacing and 17.28 MHz CORESET #0 bandwidth, PDCCH can operate with Aggregation Level (AL) 16, which offers a higher PDCCH coverage. In comparison, configuring CORESET #0 with bandwidth 8.64 MHz supports AL 8 when PDCCH is configured with 30 kHz subcarrier spacing, which results in approximately 3 dB coverage reduction compared to AL 16. Furthermore, using a higher CORESET #0 bandwidth gives rise to higher scheduling capacity. However, using 17.28 MHz bandwidth, may result in that CORESET #0 cannot be used by low-cost and/or low-complexity UEs, such as e.g. NR-Light UEs. These UEs may only support smaller bandwidths, especially considering that currently only an interleaved mapping is supported by CORESET #0, which means a PDCCH candidate may span the entire bandwidth of CORESET #0.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A PDCCH mapped to resources in CORESET #0 may be used to transmit Downlink Control Information (DCI) which schedules PDSCH carrying SIB1. In that case, the DCI is masked with a SI Radio Network Temporary Identifier (SI-RNTI). This means that the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) of the PDCCH is scrambled with SI-RNTI.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Currently, DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI is used to schedule the SIBs in NR. DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI for scheduling SIB1 is given in Table 1.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>DCI format 1_0 with CRC scrambled by SI-RNTI which used to schedule SIB1</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="147pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Field (Item)</entry><entry>Bits</entry><entry>Reference</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Frequency domain</entry><entry>Variable</entry><entry>Variable with DL BWP N_RB</entry></row><row><entry>resource assignment</entry><entry/><entry>&#x250c;log<sub>2</sub>(N<sub>RB</sub><sup>DL, BWP</sup>(N<sub>RB</sub><sup>DL, BWP </sup>+ 1)/2)&#x2510;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>N<sub>RB</sub><sup>DL, BWP </sup>indicates the size of CORESET 0</entry></row><row><entry>Time domain resource</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>Carries the row index of the items in Default</entry></row><row><entry>assignment</entry><entry/><entry>PDSCH time domain table given in 38.214</entry></row><row><entry>VRB-to-PRB mapping</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>According to 38.212 Table 7.3.1.1.2-33</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>0: Non-Interleaved</entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry>1: Interleaved</entry></row><row><entry>Modulation and coding</entry><entry>5</entry><entry>38.214 - Table 5.1.3.1-1: MCS index</entry></row><row><entry>scheme</entry><entry/><entry>table 1 for PDSCH</entry></row><row><entry>Redundancy Version</entry><entry>2</entry></row><row><entry>System Information</entry><entry>1</entry><entry>0: SIB1</entry></row><row><entry>Indicator</entry><entry/><entry>1: SI messages</entry></row><row><entry>Reserved</entry><entry>15</entry><entry>Reserved</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">All NR cells may not support NR-Light UEs (e.g. having reduced bandwidth).

This determination may depend on other information such as e.g. information transmitted on the broadcast channel. This information may e.g. correspond to the system frame number (SFN).

Here, an SS S-L <b>503</b> (which is an example of the indication signaling referred to in the methods <b>300</b> and <b>400</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>) is placed near or within the NR SSB (which is an example of the synchronization signaling referred to in the methods <b>300</b> and <b>400</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>) as an indication of that the cell supports NR-Light service (e.g. by supporting a reduced bandwidth). In this way, the NR-Light UE can quickly identify whether the cell supports NR-Light without being required to read, e.g., the MIB in the PBCH and/or other system information. If the SSS-L is not found, the NR-Light UE can continue to search for another SSB of a new cell at another frequency. The term &#x201c;SSS-L&#x201d;, used as an example for the indication signaling, should be seen as an example for illustration purposes only. It should not be seen as a limitation of the signal design. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates several different examples of the SSS-L <b>503</b> placements with respect to the NR SSB.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0084">In one example, the NR-Light UE may detect the NR SSB. The NR SSB comprises a PSS <b>501</b> (which is an example of the first synchronization signal), an SSS <b>502</b> (which is an example of the second synchronization signal), and a PBCH <b>504</b> (which is an example of the broadcast channel).

The eMIB may be an example of the extended system information. Therefore, in one example, when the NR-Light UE detects the SSS-L, it may search for the eMIB (different than the legacy MIB) and may access the cell by reading/decoding the necessary system information from the eMIB. The eMIB may contain information needed by the NR-Light UE for further accessing the cell. A legacy UE may not decode the eMIB.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">In one example, the time and/or frequency location of the SSS-L signal may be derived from the time and/or frequency location of at least one of the PSS, the SSS, the PBCH, and/or the SSB. The time and/or frequency location may correspond to specific time and frequency resources.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">In one example, the SSS-L may be placed before or after the PSS, SSS, PBCH, and/or SSB in time, either right before or right after the PSS, SSS, PBCH, and/or SSB without any gap, or with a gap. The gap may be specified in the specification, and e.g. preconfigured to the NR-Light UE. The frequency location of the SSS-L is derived based on the frequency location of the PSS, SSS, PBCH, and/or SSB, e.g., in the same frequency location as PSS, SSS, PBCH, and/or SSB or with some offset. The offset may be specified in the specification, and e.g. preconfigured to the NR-Light UE.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">In one example, the SSS-L signal may be placed within the SSB, e.g. within the 20 RBs and the four OFDM symbols of the SSB.

The SSS-L may be used by itself or together with one or more other signals, e.g., the PSS, the SSS, and/or a Demodulation Reference Signal (DMRS), to determine an identity of the cell (e.g. a Physical Layer Cell ID). In another example, the SSS-L signal may be based on an m-sequence made up of at least 127 values.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">In one example, the SSS-L signal may use the same sequence(s) as the SSS. The SSS-L may be mapped to the resource elements by using a complex conjugate of the m-sequence(s).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">In one example, the SSS-L is based on the same sequence(s) as the SSS but may in addition be scrambled by a pseudo-random noise sequence, which is different from the one used for SSS, when mapped to the resource elements. The scrambling sequence may be fixed or may be cell specific.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">In one example, the SSS-L may use the same sequence(s) as the SSS but may be placed at a difference time and/or frequency location as the SSS.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0096">In one example, the UE may assume that the network has configured the same mapping of the SSS-L antenna ports to the physical antennas, as it has for the SSS. A gNB (which is an example of the network node) may in other words use the same precoder for the SSS-L and SSS transmissions.

It may be configured by the network to facilitate NR-Light UE SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ and/or SS-SINR measurements. It may follow the 3GPP Release 15 SMTC definition and may be defined by a reoccurring time and frequency window used for measuring the SSS-L e.g. for the support of NR-Light mobility.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099">In one example, the SSS-L may be constituted of additional SSB repetitions which are beneficial to reduce the NR-Light UE energy consumption. A legacy UE may consider the SSB configurations as defined in Rel-15 and Rel-16 NR. An NR-Light UE may consider additional SSB instances in a time and/or frequency location which may not be confused with legacy SSB transmission. If the additional SSB instance is detected, the UE may interpret this an SSS-L indication and that NR-Light is supported in the cell.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">In one example, information for quick acquisition may be repeated in SSS-L (e.g. selected content of SSB transmitted in SSS-L, e.g. with redundancy coding or simple repetition coding). This may further reduce UE energy consumption for NR-Light. In one example, if the NR-Light UEs have to accumulate over more SSB instances, repetition of SSS content in the SSS-L resources could be used for reduced acquisition time.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0101">In one example, the SSS-L may be placed at the same time locations as the SSB. This may be done in order to not extend the reception time of the NR-Light UE, which may have a negative impact on the UE energy consumption and battery life. The amount of frequency resources used may depend on the bandwidth capability of NR-Light UEs. E.g. if 24 PRBs are supported by NR-Light UEs (4.32 MHz with 15 kHz subcarrier spacing), 4 PRBs may be used for SSS-L transmission.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0102">In one example, the SSS-L may span over several OFDM symbols. In this case, the SSS-L may be used in early mobility state estimation (e.g. without having to process other signals).
