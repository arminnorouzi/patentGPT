ICs may include one or more processing circuits that execute application instructions and quickly process information. The instructions and other information may be stored in memory arrays of a memory system. The information stored in memory arrays also includes data that is used by, and may be generated by, the instructions. Examples of such data include photographs, video games, data bases and application user data.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To accommodate the large amount of data stored in an IC, memory arrays may occupy a significant percentage of the area of an IC. Memory arrays may also consume a significant percentage of the power consumed by the IC. Power consumption in an IC generates heat and can reduce battery life in mobile devices. Memory arrays may consume power at a higher rate when addressed memory bit cell circuits are being accessed to read or write information during instruction processing. Memory arrays may also be powered when not being accessed in an inactive mode when they are not being accessed for data retention. There may be leakage current that causes the memory arrays to consume power in the inactive mode. Therefore, the manufacturers of ICs seek ways to reduce power consumption by reducing leakage current in memory arrays during active and inactive modes.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Exemplary aspects disclosed herein include memory systems including memory arrays employing column read circuits to control floating of column read bit lines. Related methods of performing a read operation in a memory array employing column read circuits to control floating of column read bit lines are also disclosed. The memory system includes one or more bit cell columns each including a plurality of memory bit cells (e.g., static random-access memory (SRAM) bit cells) that each store a logic state. The logic state stored in a selected one of the memory bit cells can control a read port circuit in the memory bit cell to determine a logic state generated onto a read bit line. The read port circuit includes a read port output and the read port outputs of multiple memory bit cells in the same column are coupled to the read bit line. The memory system includes a column read circuit to evaluate the logic state on the read port output of the selected memory bit cell. The column read circuit includes an evaluation output line coupled to the read port circuits by the read bit line in a dynamic read circuit structure. The column read circuit also includes a pre-charge circuit that is activated to pre-charge the evaluation output line in an idle stage and in a pre-charge stage of a read operation. The column read circuit includes a float control circuit coupled inline between the evaluation output line and the read bit line. The memory system includes a read control circuit to control activation and deactivation of the float control circuit. While the evaluation output line is pre-charged by the pre-charge circuit in the idle stage between read operations, the float control circuit is deactivated to isolate the evaluation output line from the read bit line and the read port circuits. In other words, the read bit line and the read port outputs of the read port circuits are kept floating in the idle stage so the pre-charge circuit only pre-charges the evaluation output line, which reduces power consumption caused by leakage current through the read port circuits. Because there are a plurality of memory bit cells in a column and each includes a read port circuit, the power loss due to leakage would be much higher if the evaluation output line is coupled to the read bit line in the idle stage. In the pre-charge stage of the read operation, prior to an evaluation stage of the read operation, the float control circuit is activated to couple the evaluation output line to the read bit line and the read port circuits to briefly pre-charge the dynamic read circuit for evaluation. Due to a voltage drop across the float control circuit, the read bit line and the read port outputs are pulled up to a voltage lower than the power supply voltage, which saves power and reduces charging time. The pre-charge circuit is deactivated in the evaluation stage of the read operation and the read port circuit of the selected memory bit cell is activated to provide an evaluation of the stored logic state to the evaluation output line. A read word line (RWL) coupled to the selected memory bit cell activates the read port circuit in the evaluation stage and the stored logic state controls the read port circuit to indicate the stored logic state on the evaluation output line. The read port circuit can be two stacked transistors controlled by the RWL and the stored logic state, respectively, to pre-charge or discharge the read bit line based on the logic state stored in the memory bit cell. After the read operation, the float control circuit is deactivated in the idle stage.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Performance of the memory system in a memory read operation may be improved by reducing a number of memory bit cells to which the read bit line is coupled in a column. In this manner, both the length of the read bit line and the number of capacitive loads may be reduced. For this reason, the memory bit cells in each column may be divided among a plurality of (e.g., two or more) read bit lines and each read bit line is coupled to the evaluation output line through a corresponding float control circuit. Since only one memory bit cell in a column may be read in a read operation, only the float control circuit of the read bit line coupled to the selected memory bit cell is activated, while all the other float control circuits remain deactivated to reduce power loss.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In exemplary aspects disclosed herein a memory system is disclosed.

The read control circuit <b>222</b> turning on the keep-up circuits <b>228</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>228</b>(<b>2</b>) includes providing a control signal <b>248</b> to the transistors <b>246</b>(<b>1</b>) and <b>246</b>(<b>2</b>) at a low voltage.

Herein, the term &#x201c;floating&#x201d; or being in a &#x201c;floating state&#x201d; indicates that the read bit line <b>406</b> and the read port outputs <b>410</b> are not electrically coupled (e.g., by a low resistance or highly conductive path) to a supply voltage rail, so as to not receive a supply voltage (e.g., V<sub>DD</sub>), a ground voltage (e.g., V<sub>SS</sub>), or any intermediate voltage between the supply voltage and the ground voltage. Thus, a node that is floating is not charged or quickly discharged, although a leakage current can slowly discharge a node that is charged when put in a floating state. Because there are a plurality of memory bit cells <b>404</b> in a column <b>412</b> and each memory bit cell <b>404</b> includes a read port circuit <b>408</b>, power loss due to leakage would be much higher if the evaluation output line <b>416</b> is coupled to the read bit line <b>406</b> in the idle stage.

Prior to a read operation, the evaluation output line <b>416</b> is pulled-up to a first pre-charged state. The first read bit line <b>406</b> is in a floating state and may be in a discharged state due to leak current. A read operation is initiated at time T1 in response to a read enable signal RDEN and an indication of a read address ADDR. In response to the indication of a read address ADDR and the read enable signal RDEN, the first read bit line <b>406</b> is coupled to the evaluation output line <b>416</b> and begins charging to a pre-charged state. The second read bit line <b>446</b> continues to remain in a floating state. At a time T2, a system clock signal CLK transitions (e.g., rises), which triggers the read control circuit <b>422</b>, at time T3, to turn off the pre-charge circuit <b>418</b> to stop charging the evaluation output line <b>416</b>, and activate the read word line signal RWL, which turns on the transistor <b>426</b> on the read port circuit <b>408</b>. In the read operation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the first read bit line <b>406</b> is discharged because a stored data in the memory bit cell circuit <b>404</b> is in a high state, causing the evaluation output line <b>416</b> to transition to the low state. In response to the evaluation output line <b>416</b> transitioning to the low state, the column output signal <b>432</b> transitions to a high state at time T4. At time T5 the system clock signal CLK transitions again (e.g., falling edge), causing the read control circuit <b>422</b> to start charging the evaluation output line <b>416</b>, and turn off the read word line signal RWL. At time T6 the indication of the read address ADDR may change, causing the first read bit line <b>406</b> to decouple from the evaluation output line <b>416</b>, leaving the first read bit line <b>406</b> in a floating state.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a block diagram of an exemplary processor-based system <b>700</b> that includes a processor <b>702</b> (e.g., a microprocessor) that includes an instruction processing circuit <b>704</b>.
