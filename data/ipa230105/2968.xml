Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention relates to the field of tensile strength members such as multi-stranded synthetic cables. More specifically, the invention comprises devices and methods for creating a synthetic tensile member having a fixed and stable length.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The term &#x201c;tensile member&#x201d; encompasses a very broad range of known devices, including steel rods, helically wrapped wire ropes/cables, fiber ropes/cables, wound slings, rope slings grommets, etc. These devices have for many years been made using steel. For a fixed installation&#x2014;such as a bridge stay&#x2014;a relatively rigid rod may be used. For a more mobile or dynamic installations&#x2014;such as the rigging on the boom of a crane&#x2014;helically wrapped wire rope may be used. Steel tensile members have been mass produced for over one hundred years and the properties of these tensile members are very well understood. For example, it is well understood how to manufacture a steel tensile member to a precise level of performance and a precise overall length.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such wire ropes may need to be &#x201c;set&#x201d; or &#x201c;bedded&#x201d; when they are first assembled. This process involves applying tension to tighten the interwoven nature of the strands within the rope. An initial &#x201c;stretch&#x201d; will occur, after which a wire rope remains in the &#x201c;set&#x201d; state. Significantly, the amount of set needed is predictable. It is therefore possible to create a wire rope that is &#x201c;short&#x201d; by a calculated amount so that when the wire rope is set it will lengthen by a known amount and wind up being the proper length.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A termination must generally be added to a tensile member in order to transmit a load into or out of the tensile member. A terminations is most commonly affixed to the end of a tensile member, though it can be affixed to an intermediate point as well. In this context, the term &#x201c;termination&#x201d; means a structure that is affixed to the tensile member (or otherwise caused to become present on the tensile member) to transmit a load to or from the tensile member. The term encompasses solid anchors, soft splices, and round grommet or sling structures. The term also includes terminations that may be incorporated on a subcomponent of a larger tensile member, such as a sub-rope or strand.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As stated previously, wire rope is an example of a steel tensile member. A hook or loading eye is often added to wire rope. The hook or loading eye in this context is a termination. Such prior art terminations on large wire ropes commonly include a socket. A length of the wire rope is placed within the socket and &#x201c;upset&#x201d; into an enlarged diameter. The upset portion is then potted into the socket using molten lead or&#x2014;more recently&#x2014;a strong epoxy. Once the potted portion solidifies, the end of the wire rope is locked into the socket and the termination is thereby permanently affixed.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In recent years materials much stronger than steel have become available for use in the construction of cables and other tensile strength members. Many different materials are used for the filaments in a synthetic cable. These include DYNEEMA, SPECTRA, TECHNORA, TWARON, KEVLAR, VECTRAN, PBO, carbon fiber, nano-tubes, and glass fiber (among many others). In general the individual filaments have a thickness that is less than that of human hair. The filaments are very strong in tension, but they are not very rigid. They also tend to have low surface friction. These facts make such synthetic filaments difficult to handle during the process of adding a termination and difficult to organize. The present invention is particularly applicable to terminated tensile members made of such high-strength synthetic filaments, for reasons which will be explained in the descriptive text to follow. While the invention could in theory be applied to older cable technologies&#x2014;such as wire rope&#x2014;it likely would offer little advantage for that application. Thus, the invention is not really applicable to wire rope and other similar cables made of very stiff elements.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this disclosure the term &#x201c;synthetic tensile member&#x201d; should be understood to encompass a tensile member made primarily of synthetic filaments. However, it should be understood that other traditional constituents (such as metallic strands) may be present in these &#x201c;synthetic&#x201d; cables as well. Synthetic tensile member is also intended to apply to subcomponents of larger assemblies or tensile members, such as the sub-rope or strand of a large rope/cable. Additionally, the terms &#x201c;rope&#x201d; and &#x201c;cable&#x201d; will be used interchangeably&#x2014;as they are both common industry terms that apply to nearly all structural materials.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is applicable to many different types of tensile members (not just cables). However, because cables are a very common application and because the inventive principles will be the same across the differing types of tensile members, cables are used in the descriptive embodiments. Some terminology used in the construction of cables will therefore benefit the reader's understanding, though it is important to know that the terminology varies within the industry and even varies within descriptive materials produced by the same manufacturer. For purposes of this patent application, the smallest individual component of a cable is known as a &#x201c;filament.&#x201d; A filament is often created by an extrusion process (though others are used). Many filaments are grouped together to create a strand. The filaments are braided and/or twisted together using a variety of known techniques in order to create a cohesive strand. There may also be sub-groups of filaments within each strand. As the overall cable size gets larger, more and more layers of filament organization will typically be added. The strands are typically braided and/or twisted together to form a cable. In other examples the strands may be purely parallel and encased in individual surrounding jackets. In still other examples the strands may be arranged in a &#x201c;cable lay&#x201d; pattern that is well known in the fabrication of wire ropes.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The inventive principles to be disclosed may be applied to an individual strand. They may also be applied to an entire cable made up of many strands. Thus, the invention may be applied to a completed tensile member and it may be applied to a component of an overall tensile member before the component is installed into the final assembly.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref> provide some background materials to aid the reader's understanding. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts a very simple cable <b>10</b> that is made of three helically wrapped strands <b>12</b>.

Anchor <b>18</b> in this example is a radially symmetric component with an expanding central passage <b>19</b>. A length of the cable is placed in this expanding internal passage and splayed apart. Potting compound is introduced into the passage in a liquid state. The potting compound is any substance which transitions from a liquid to a solid over time (such as an epoxy). The potting compound hardens to form potted region <b>20</b>. Once the potted region is formed, anchor <b>18</b> is locked to the end of cable <b>10</b> and a termination <b>36</b> is thereby created.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In other examples the cable will be locked to the anchor without the use of a potting compound. Those skilled in the art will know that frictional devices (such as a &#x201c;spike-and-cone&#x201d; system) can be used to lock the anchor to the cable). In still other examples the anchor will be formed as a splice in which an end of the cable is formed into a loop and woven back into itself.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> provides an example with a more complex organization.

If one of the cables is slightly shorter, it will carry a disproportionally higher share of the overall load.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Producing synthetic tensile members with a consistent and predictable overall length is presently a serious industry challenge. The problems result from one or more of the following factors:</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">1. The mechanical properties of synthetic filaments vary from batch to batch. While this is true of more traditional materials, the variance is synthetic materials is much greater;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">2. Most strands or cables must be created by braiding together thousands to millions of individual synthetic filaments. Two braiding or interweaving machines may appear to produce a similar result but in fact the properties will vary;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">3. There are many steps in fabricating a completed cable assembly using synthetic filaments. Each step introduces additional variations and these variations tend to accumulate;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">4. Synthetic filaments must generally be elastically bent and interwoven during the manufacturing process. These filaments have a low coefficient of friction, and since they are not stiff they are designed to move and &#x201c;bed&#x201d; during use. This bedding or setting process changes both the mechanical properties of a cable as a whole (such as the modulus of elasticity) and the overall length;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">5. Synthetic filaments are temperature sensitive. This fact affects stiffness and length in the normal working range; and</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">6. The addition of a termination to a cable end introduces a considerable slip variable (&#x201c;setting&#x201d; or &#x201c;bedding&#x201d;) when the cable assembly is first loaded. This variable increases the overall cable length, but the amount of increase has proved to be unpredictable. This is especially the case with friction or grip based termination methods, such as a splice (which is the most common method of synthetic cable termination).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">All these issues tend to grow more significant as a cable assembly increases in length, strength, and complexity. It is difficult to predict the behavior of larger tensile members due to the accumulation of manufacturing tolerances for all the subcomponents. Further, it may be some time before the length becomes stable as the length of some cable assemblies may continue to grow under tension as the interworking elements stabilize. If such a tension member is combined in parallel with other tension members, an uneven distribution of the overall load results.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">For these reasons, it is not presently common to use synthetic cables where a precise length or stability is important. Exemplary applications include large crane boom stays, bridge stays, and multi-point lifting slings or multi-cable bridle assemblies Because of the enormous loads involved, it is common to use a parallel assembly of four or more cables in these applications.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">There are length-adjusting mechanisms known in the prior art. One example is a large turnbuckle. It is rarely practical to include such a large and heavy item. Further, a turnbuckle does not remedy the concerns of length or load stability unless it is periodically readjusted (A turnbuckle must be initially tensioned and then periodically re-tensioned as the cable &#x201c;sets&#x201d;). A suitable turnbuckle will also require a substantial torque to adjust, and it is often difficult to apply such a large amount of torque in the field. One may imagine a turnbuckle on a dragline crane that is 50 meters in the air. Adjusting such a turnbuckle would not be easy. Further, an improper adjustment may permanently damage the boom if not properly matched with adjustments to the other cables.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present invention seeks to remedy both the problem of length consistency and the problem of length stability. The invention solves these problems across all types of synthetic filament-based tensile members and termination methods&#x2014;without the need for a field adjustment device.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present invention comprises a method for producing a synthetic filament tensile member having a precisely known and stable length. The invention also comprises equipment configured to carry out the method. A tensile member is prepared by attaching terminations to an assembly of synthetic filaments. The tensile member is then attached to a loading apparatus that subjects the tensile member to a pre-defined loading process. The tensile member is thereby conditioned to a stable length. The length is then measured and a length adjusting component is added to the tensile member (or a suitable modification is made to the tensile member) to create a precise length that is configured for the tensile member's particular application.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"

level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0093" num="0092">A cable made according to the present invention will generally have a first termination on its first end and a second termination on its second end. The first termination will have a first attachment reference&#x2014;such as the center axis of a first cross bore through the first termination. The second termination will likewise have a second attachment reference&#x2014;such as the center axis of a second cross bore through the second termination.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, those skilled in the art will know that the parallel assembly of three cables will typically have a loading block <b>32</b> or analogous anchoring component on each end. The example shown uses a large transverse pin joint to connect the terminations <b>36</b> to the loading block <b>32</b>. For this particular installation, there is a known distance between the pin joint axis on the loading block <b>32</b> shown and the pin joint axis on the loading block on the opposite end of the cables. The cables must match this known distance in order to be correctly installed. In other words, the distance between the first and second attachment references on the cables must be equal to the known distance.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a synthetic cable assembly created by adding a termination <b>36</b> to each end of cable <b>10</b>. The first termination is connected to static fixture <b>40</b>. First attachment reference <b>45</b> on the first termination is the center line of a pin joint used to attach the first termination to the static fixture (Note that the first attachment reference could be at some other point along the assembly and need not coincide with the attachment point).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">The second termination is attached to loading fixture <b>38</b>. A predetermined tension profile is then applied through loading fixture <b>38</b>. Second attachment reference <b>47</b> on the second termination is the center line of a pin joint used to attach the second termination to loading fixture <b>38</b> (Note that the second attachment reference could be at some other point along the assembly and need not coincide with the attachment point).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">This tension profile may assume many forms, but it is preferable to include a pull test to a higher load than is anticipated in the end-use application. Where practical, it is also preferable to include multiple pulls to better condition the cable.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> depicts an exemplary tension profile. The &#x201c;design load&#x201d; represents the maximum tension the cable assembly is expected to see in its upcoming installation. In this example, two ramped &#x201c;pulls&#x201d; are made to a level exceeding the design load by 20%. A third pull is established with a sinusoidal component applied over an extended period. With some fiber types, it is also beneficial to hold a load for a defined period so that the fibers will permanently elongate and better distribute the load.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The tension profile is configured to fully &#x201c;bed&#x201d; (&#x201c;set&#x201d;) both the terminations and the lay of the cable itself. The length of the overall assembly will tend to extend for some period and then stabilize. Once the length has stabilized, the distance between the first attachment reference on the first termination and the second attachment reference on the second termination is determined. Two carefully pre-cut and terminated cable assemblies may have lengths that are very nearly the same. However, the length variation will tend to grow with the bedding process.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">This step may be accomplished in many ways. As one example, if the first and second attachment references are simple cross bores through tangs on the terminations, then closely fitted dowels can be placed in these cross bores. The assembly can then be placed under a suitable tension level and the distance between the dowels can be measured.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">In many instances it will be desirable to design the cable and terminations so that the bedded cable assembly winds up being a bit short. A length-adjustment component may then be added to bring the overall assembly of the now-stabilized cable to the proper length. There are many ways to provide such a length-adjustment component. The following embodiments illustrate some of these ways.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a second termination <b>36</b> on the second end of cable <b>10</b>. The termination includes tang <b>48</b>. A cross bore through the tang is used to attach the termination. The central axis of this cross bore is the second attachment reference used to determine the overall length of the cable assembly.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Extension link <b>42</b> is provided to increase the effective length of the cable assembly. The extension link includes first clevis <b>52</b> and second clevis <b>54</b>. The extension link also includes first cross bore <b>44</b> and second cross bore <b>46</b>. First cross bore <b>44</b> is aligned with the cross bore in tang <b>48</b> and pin <b>50</b> is inserted to connect the extension link to the second termination. Second cross bore <b>46</b> is offset a distance &#x201c;D&#x201d; from first cross bore <b>44</b>. In this example the second cross bore <b>46</b> becomes a third attachment reference. If one then measures the distance from the first attachment reference (on the opposite end of the cable) and the new third attachment reference created by the presence of second cross bore <b>46</b>, the overall length of the cable will be increased.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">To improve accuracy, it is preferable to take the length measurements while the cable assembly is under a fixed reference load. The reference load is preferably as close as possible to the load anticipated for the end-use application.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The process as applied in this exemplary embodiment may then be summarized as follows:</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">1. A known distance is the target value needed for the cable's desired installation at the anticipated reference load;</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">2. The cable is created with an overall length that is marginally too short for the known distance and defined reference load;</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">3. The cable undergoes the setting process depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">4. The distance between the first and second attachment references is accurately determined;</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">5. An offset distance between the second attachment reference and a desired third attachment reference is calculated; and</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">6. An extension link <b>42</b> of suitable length is manufactured (or possibly pulled from inventory) and attached to the second termination, where the extension link provides the additional distance needed for the cable to have the correct overall length.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Using exemplary numbers, the known distance for a particular installation is 30.260 meters. Once manufactured and set (as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), the distance between the first and second attachment references is carefully measured to be 29.900 meters. An extension link is manufactured where the distance &#x201c;D&#x201d; between the first and second cross bores <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> is 0.360 meters. This extension link is then installed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The cable assembly thus made now has the exact length desired (30.260 meters). And, the length is stable as the cable assembly has already been properly set. In this way countless assemblies can be created to exacting specification with a length that is stable and predictable over time.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> provides another embodiment in which the second termination <b>36</b> is provided with an extended tang <b>56</b>. Loading cross bore <b>59</b> is provided so that the cable assembly can be attached to loading fixture <b>38</b> (as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). Once the loading process has been used to set the cable and its terminations, a second cross bore <b>60</b> is created in extended tang <b>56</b>. In this example, both loading cross bore <b>59</b> and cross bore <b>60</b> are located with respect to reference axis <b>58</b>. The cable is again manufactured a bit short. Cross bore <b>60</b> is offset by a distance (D<b>2</b>-D<b>1</b>). Cross bore <b>60</b> then becomes the desired third attachment reference and provides the correct overall length for the cable.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a second termination <b>36</b> made using a splice. A splice involves passing a length of cable around a thimble <b>62</b> and then weaving it back on itself. Such a termination can be very strong. However, because the interweaving is a highly-skilled manual process, it introduces considerable uncertainty regarding the final length of the cable following the setting process depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. While generally improved, similar process variation challenges are also involved in round slings, grommets, reeved cable block tension members, or wound slings. These types of looped tensile members will commonly include a thimble of some sort for support of high loads.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts a cross section through thimble <b>62</b>. The reader will note how the thimble in this example includes a concave channel configured to receive the cable strands <b>64</b> (and jacket <b>66</b> in this case). The inward facing surface of thimble <b>62</b> is planar. In many cases thimble <b>62</b> may simply be a pulley or sheave configuration with a central cross bore.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts thimble block <b>68</b>, which is configured to slide laterally into the thimble. When the thimble block is installed within the middle portion of the thimble, loading cross bore <b>59</b> allows the cable assembly to be set as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Once a stable length is achieved a distance between the first and second attachment references is determined. An additional length required for the cable is determined. Cross bore <b>60</b> is then created in the thimble block. The additional length needed will be equal to (D<b>2</b>-D<b>1</b>) in the depiction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. Cross bore <b>60</b> then becomes the desired third attachment reference.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Up to this point the second and third attachment references have been the centerlines of cross bores. This will not always be the case, as there are many different components used to attach terminations to external components. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref> illustrate a different approach.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The second termination <b>36</b> in this example includes a long threaded shaft <b>70</b>. The cable assembly is attached to an external object by passing threaded shaft <b>70</b> through a hole in a thick steel plate and then threading a nut onto the exposed end of the threaded shaft. The nut is then tightened. Bearing surface <b>76</b> on termination <b>36</b> provides the desired second attachment reference.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In this example&#x2014;once the cable assembly is set as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>&#x2014;the cable assembly's length is again too short. Extension bushing <b>72</b> is provided to address this problem. Extension bushing <b>72</b> has mating surface <b>74</b> and bearing surface <b>76</b> on its opposite end. It also includes through bore <b>78</b>. Through bore <b>78</b> is slipped over threaded shaft <b>70</b> and mating surface <b>74</b> on extension bushing <b>72</b> is mated to bearing surface <b>76</b> on termination <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The mated assembly is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. Bearing surface <b>76</b> has thereby been extended by the distance &#x201c;D&#x201d; to form the desired third attachment reference. The two mating surfaces may be joined by adhesives, welding, or some other suitable method to create fusion <b>80</b>. The termination and the extension bushing thereafter behave as one integrated part. Where possible, it is desirable for the length adjustment part to be permanent. The purpose of the fusion is simply to provide this permanence.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a second termination incorporating eye <b>82</b> and an enlarged cross bore <b>84</b>. Plug <b>86</b> is configured to slide laterally into cross bore <b>84</b>. Offset cross bore <b>88</b> provides the desired third attachment reference. It is offset from the center of plug <b>86</b> an appropriate amount to produce the desired overall length for the cable assembly.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows an embodiment where an extension link <b>42</b> is added to a spliced type of termination. A length of cable is wrapped around a thimble and woven back into itself to create spliced eye <b>90</b>. The extension link is connected to this spliced eye by passing a lateral pin through the extension link and the spliced eye.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In the prior examples a cable that was marginally too short was extended by the addition of a length-adjustment component. In other instances the cable will be made marginally too long and the length-adjustment component will need to shorten its effective length. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows a second termination <b>36</b> that includes a planar posterior bearing surface where the cable exits the anchor. In this example two bushing halves <b>92</b> have been clamped around the cable up against this posterior bearing surface. The two bushing halves create bearing surface <b>76</b>&#x2014;effectively reducing the length of the cable. Bearing surface <b>76</b> then becomes the desired third attachment reference. The reader should note that this type of corrective bushing can be added to each of the individual anchors as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in order to apply a length correction to the entire cable (three bushing assemblies would be required for the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows a length-adjustment component used to increase or decrease the effective cable length for the type of anchor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. Correction block <b>94</b> includes a cavity to receive termination <b>36</b>. Overhang <b>96</b> abuts the posterior bearing surface on the termination. Cross bore <b>60</b> is provided a distance &#x201c;D&#x201d; from the posterior bearing surface. Thus, cross bore <b>60</b> extends the effective length of the cable assembly and provides the third attachment reference.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In the preceding examples the length-adjustment component has been added to an end of the cable assembly. It is also possible to add the length-adjustment component to an intermediate location. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows an embodiment in which a third and fourth termination <b>36</b> have been added in the middle of the cable. These third and fourth terminations can simply be linked together for the tensioning process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. An extension link <b>42</b> can then be added between the third and fourth terminations to increase the length of the cable assembly to match the desired length.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Cables have been used as the examples in this disclosure, but the reader should bear in mind the fact that the principles disclosed apply to many other types of tensile members. These include synthetic rope/cable/cord grommets, choked assemblies, reeved block assemblies, and looped slings or pendants where a loop of filaments, strands, or cables are wound around two end points, and the two end points thereby become terminations.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Additionally, the inventive process is not specific to the termination type/method or length correction component. The examples are merely meant to represent a design based on certain termination configurations. These designs are not to be viewed as limiting, like that of the tensile member, they will vary broadly from application to application&#x2014;and countless variations are possible.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The invention includes many other functional variations that are assumed throughout the examples, such as:</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">1. An embodiment in which a length-adjustment component is added to both ends of the cable. In many applications this is preferable and should be assumed to be the case in all embodiments in this disclosure. The simplified depiction of a second termination receiving a length adjustment feature is simply meant to assume that at least one end, if not both ends receive such a component;</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">2. An embodiment in which multiple length-adjustment components are &#x201c;stacked&#x201d; or otherwise configured for use on at least one end of the cable;</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">3. An embodiment in which the length-adjustment component is simply a modification of a component already on the cable (such as milling away a final load bearing surface or drilling a cross bore hole on the termination body itself as examples);</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">4. An embodiment in which the length-adjustment component is tamper resistant so that it cannot be easily modified in the field;</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">5. An embodiment in which the length-adjustment component is made visibly out of alignment should it be out of factory setting;</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">6. A configuration in which adjustment is possible in both directions, such that a tensile member can be made at the target length, and length correction can be designed to be either shorter or longer. (For example, the cable length and bushing halves <b>92</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> can be configured to first target the nominal length, and adjustments can then be made to the cable by simply using shorter or longer bushing halves <b>92</b>. It need not be only adjustable in one direction as simplified in this disclosure.)</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">7. An embodiment in which the inventive process and length adjustment component is made to the strand or sub-rope of a larger tensile member. In most cases this would include similar length adjustment components with all or most of the loaded subcomponents. This can be used to balance subcomponents within a large assembly, just as if they were individual tension members requiring matched and stable lengths.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">Although the preceding description contains significant detail, it should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but rather as providing illustrations of the preferred embodiments of the invention. Those skilled in the art will be able to devise many other embodiments that carry out the present invention. Thus, the language used in the claims shall define the invention rather than the specific embodiments provided.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>Having described my invention, I claim:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
