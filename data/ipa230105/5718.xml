Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates generally to variable inductor, and more particularly to systems, apparatuses, and methods for using one or more variable inductors to selectively apply power to a load.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In plasma processing applications, such as the manufacture of semiconductors, solar panels, flat panel displays, Radio Frequency (RF) power generators operating over a wide range of frequencies may apply a voltage or current to an impedance load in a plasma chamber or otherwise. The impedance load can either be a plasma or a substrate within the chamber, and the chamber can be configured for plasma deposition of thin films on the substrate or for etching material from the substrate. In some cases, a matching network can be arranged between an RF power generator and the load and can be designed to provide an efficient transfer of power from the RF power generator to the plasma load in the chamber by matching the different impedances between the generator and the plasma load at the fundamental frequency of the RF power generator.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One form of plasma processing is called plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition, or PECVD, and is widely used for solar panel fabrication. Manufacturers have long used sinusoidal waveforms to power the PECVD plasma load, but processes sometimes call for more power than a sinusoidal waveform can provide. Additionally, arcs can be difficult to detect with a sinusoidal waveform. As a result, some fabrication labs (also referred to as fabs) have turned to square wave generators that can achieve greater power delivery at the same voltage.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, square waves have sharp edges that lead to harmonics that can influence thin film uniformity across a panel. For instance, some fabs use systems with many dozens or even hundreds of panels supported by elongated supports (e.g., 1.5 meters long), and a single power supply, meaning that the various electrodes in the chamber are all different electrical distances from the supply. Because of these different distances, slight differences in power are seen at the various electrodes and each panel may be influenced differently by the harmonics.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some circumstances, power supply topologies produce load dependent waveforms. Thus, a supply that is intended to provide a square wave to a plasma load, may actually produce more of a triangular wave when the load impedance is low and more of a square wave when the load impedance is high. Several factors, including harmonics, waveform shape, consistency of waveform shape, etc., affect deposition uniformity. However, currently used techniques for reducing the harmonics and maintaining an output waveform are lacking. Thus, there is a need for a refined system for waveform control in power supply topologies.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following presents a simplified summary relating to one or more aspects and/or embodiments disclosed herein. As such, the following summary should not be considered an extensive overview relating to all contemplated aspects and/or embodiments, nor should the following summary be regarded to identify key or critical elements relating to all contemplated aspects and/or embodiments or to delineate the scope associated with any particular aspect and/or embodiment. Accordingly, the following summary has the sole purpose to present certain concepts relating to one or more aspects and/or embodiments relating to the mechanisms disclosed herein in a simplified form to precede the detailed description presented below.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">As described above, some power supplies produce load-dependent outputs. However, as the impedance of a load, such as a plasma load, changes, deposition uniformity may be impacted without adequate control of the output waveform shape, harmonics, etc. In some cases, a fixed inductor can be added to a power supply output to soften the edges of a wave (e.g., a square wave, an exponential wave, etc.) and reduce the harmonics, thereby improving deposition uniformity. However, even with the use of a fixed output inductor, the power supply produces a load dependent output waveform (e.g., an output waveform that is a function of L-R), thus limiting the possibilities and performances achievable from them. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates one topology of a PECVD power supply using a single fixed inductor at the output to help smoothen the edges of a waveform output, such as a square waveform output, provided to the matching network and plasma load.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another means to reduce harmonics is to use a trapezoidal pulse rather than a square wave. In these examples, the &#x201c;top&#x201d; of a pulse gradually rises from the rising edge toward the falling edge causing the leading edge transition to the &#x201c;top&#x201d; to be less severe and thus reducing harmonics compared to a pulse square wave. One known product producing such a trapezoidal pulse waveform is the TRUMPF HUETTINGER TruPlasma Bipolar 4000 power supply.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The following references are pertinent to understanding the disclosure and are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">[1] J.

generally to a system for waveform control. More specifically, but without limitation, the present disclosure relates to a power supply unit configured to maintain an output waveform through the use of a variable inductor.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Preliminary note: the flowcharts and block diagrams in the following Figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. In this regard, some blocks in these flowcharts or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). It should also be noted that, in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the block may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved. It will also be noted that each block of the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustrations, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustrations, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts, or combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used herein to mean &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any embodiment described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As described above, some power supply topologies produce load-dependent outputs. In such cases, if the impedance of the load changes, one or more characteristics of the output waveform may also change. For instance, a shape of the output waveform, a rise time, a fall time, and/or a relationship between a peak to peak value and a measured time (e.g., rise time, fall time, timespan between a first and a second pre-defined voltage or current level, etc.) may also change, to name a few non-limiting examples. In some circumstances, an output waveform that is load dependent may adversely impact a plasma process, such as PECVD. Harmonics aside, a changing relationship between a peak to peak voltage (or current) value and a measured time (e.g., a product between the two) may also influence thin film uniformity across a panel. In some cases, plasma processes may be optimized by maintaining a constant or substantially constant relationship between a peak to peak voltage (or current) value and a measured time for output waves. In some cases, the relationship may relate to a product of the two (e.g., a product of the peak to peak voltage and a measured time for the output waves should be constant or substantially constant).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Resonant inverters are electrical inverters based on resonant current oscillation and comprise one or more resonant components (e.g., fixed inductors) and switching devices (e.g., MOSFETs, thyristors, etc.). Traditional resonant inverter topologies rely on adjustment of switching frequency to adjust one or more characteristics (e.g., a voltage) of an output waveform. In some cases, a fixed inductor in a resonant inverter topology may be replaced by a variable inductor, and the resonant inductance of the variable inductor may be controlled in lieu of the switching frequency. The resonant inductance of the variable inductor may be controlled by means of a DC current, although other types of control techniques are contemplated in different embodiments. In some cases, a variable inductor may facilitate the use of a constant or substantially constant switching frequency. Additionally or alternatively, a variable inductor may allow inherent isolated control, more linear control, constant electrode power, and enhanced efficiency, to name a few non-limiting examples. In another example, a variable inductor may enhance efficiency, Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), and/or SOA in resonant inverter topologies, further described below.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some cases, the use of an inductor having a variable and a controllable inductance value may facilitate in optimizing behavior/performance of a plasma generator topology and/or expand existing functionalities. In one non-limiting example, a bipolar power supply producing a load-dependent output waveform may be utilized in a PECVD process and may have a fixed output inductor to smooth transitions. For instance, the output waveform may follow the behavior of an inductive-resistive (L-R) circuit, where the waveform may tend towards a triangular shape when the impedance or resistance decreases (i.e., as R becomes smaller) and a square shape when the impedance or resistance increases (i.e., as R becomes larger). In this example, by replacing the fixed output inductor with a variable inductor, the shape of the output waveform may be maintained (i.e., kept relatively constant) even with some load variation (e.g., changing R). In another example, a snubber circuit may be utilized between a DC-to-pulse section and an output filter (or alternatively, output terminals) of a power supply unit. In some cases, the snubber circuit may serve to suppress transients (e.g., voltage transients) at the output of the power supply unit. Additionally or alternatively, the snubber circuit may serve as a buffer and limit the rate of change of current (i.e., by serving as a</p><p id="p-0058" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mfrac>  <mi>di</mi>  <mi>dt</mi> </mfrac></math></maths></p><p id="p-0059" num="0000">limiter), for instance, in the event of a short circuit (e.g., arcs) at the output. In some cases, for instance, while operating in high-voltage-high-frequency conditions, current may accumulate in the snubber circuit, which may trip a breaker or security to avoid saturation. In such cases, using a variable inductor may enable higher levels of saturation (e.g., by lowering variable inductance value) and offer extended usable standard/safe operating area (SOA) for the power supply. In some cases, the SOA refers to the voltage and/or current conditions over which a device (e.g., a power semiconductor device) may be expected to operate without self-damage. SOA combines one or more limitations of the device, such as, maximum voltage, current, power, junction temperature, and/or secondary breakdown into a single curve, which allows for a simplified design of protection circuitry. In some cases, SOA may be presented as a graph with VCE (collector-emitter voltage) on the x-axis and I<sub>CE </sub>(collector-emitter current) on the y-axis, where the SOA refers to the area under the curve.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0057">Some power supply topologies produce load-dependent outputs. For example, when the impedance of a load changes, one or more of a shape and characteristics (e.g., smoothness of edges, rise time, fall time, etc.) of an output waveform may also change. Broadly, this disclosure describes systems, methods, and apparatuses using a variable inductor at an output of a power supply to maintain a shape and/or characteristics of a waveform when the power supply otherwise produces a load-dependent output. For instance, the variable inductor may allow an output waveform, such as an exponential waveform, or a square waveform having smooth edges, to be maintained despite a change in load impedance (e.g., impedance of a plasma load). It should be noted that, other types of waveforms (e.g., triangular waveform, sawtooth waveform) besides square and exponential waveforms may be controlled and their shapes maintained in alternative embodiments.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0058">In some cases, variable inductors may be used in lieu of fixed output inductors for bias power supplies utilized in cathodic arc processes. In some cases, arc power supplies may be utilized for cathodic arc deposition. Such applications can have significant ripple on bias power supply output voltage, for instance, when combined with an arc supply on a system. This ripple is mainly due to the significant current variation requested to the bias power supply. The variable inductor may enable this ripple to be decreased as compared to a fixed output inductor.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0059">In yet other cases, some arc power supplies utilize a non-linear inductor at their output terminals to smooth saturation. In some cases, these non-linear output inductors may comprise a custom air gap depending on the use case. Further, these non-linear inductors may be utilized to keep the arc ignited, especially at low current (i.e., since arcs have a higher propensity for extinguishing under low current conditions). In such cases, the non-linear inductor may be replaced by a variable inductor, which may not only add adjustability depending on current setpoint but also facilitate faster transitions for pulsed arc supplies.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0060">In some cases, variable inductors may also serve to enhance a power factor (PF) of the passive front end of a power supply, for instance, under low power conditions. In some cases, the passive front end of a power supply is mainly composed of a three phases rectifier and a L-C filter. For given L-C values, the power factor is dependent on the power drawn from the main, with a higher power factor at higher power. Using a variable inductor for the L-C filter can allow higher inductance at low power, thereby increasing power factor.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0061">In some cases, the fixed output inductor in a pulsing power supply unit (e.g., for single or dual-magnetron sputtering) may be replaced with a variable inductor, which may facilitate ignition at lower chamber pressures. In some cases, ignition in such power supplies may entail raising the voltage until a plasma is ignited. Further, once plasma ignition starts, the current in the plasma ramps up and voltage drops across the plasma (due to the plasma behavior and voltage drop across the inductor). However, if the voltage drop across the plasma exceeds a threshold, the plasma may extinguish (i.e., goes out). In such cases, adjusting the variable inductance value (e.g., decreasing the effective inductance of the VI after plasma ignition starts) may allow the plasma ignition to be maintained by ensuring the voltage drop across the plasma does not exceed the threshold.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a power supply unit <b>100</b> using a single fixed output inductor <b>102</b>. In some cases, the power supply unit <b>100</b> may further comprise an AC-DC converter (not shown) coupled across the input terminals (V<sub>in </sub>denotes the output voltage from the AC-DC converter or some other DC source), a snubber circuit <b>105</b>, a DC-pulsed circuit <b>110</b>, one or more current sensors <b>115</b> (e.g., current sensor <b>115</b>-<i>a, </i>current sensor <b>115</b>-<i>b, </i>current sensor <b>115</b>-<i>c</i>), and an optional output filter <b>120</b> at output terminals <b>130</b> (e.g., output terminal <b>130</b>-<i>a, </i>output terminal <b>130</b>-<i>b</i>) of the power supply unit <b>100</b>. In some cases, the power supply unit <b>100</b> may comprise two output terminals <b>130</b>-<i>a </i>and <b>130</b>-<i>b, </i>where Pulse A and Pulse B denote the waveforms at the respective output terminals. Although not required, usually, the output voltage provided by the power supply unit <b>100</b> may comprise a differential output voltage (e.g., Pulse A voltage-Pulse B voltage). As shown, the snubber circuit <b>105</b> may comprise one or more inductors (L<sub>in</sub>, L<sub>snub</sub>), an optional current sensor <b>115</b>-<i>c, </i>a switch or diode (D<sub>1</sub>), a capacitor (C<sub>snub</sub>), and a switch (Q<sub>9</sub>). In some cases, the switch (Q<sub>9</sub>) may be a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), although another type of switch, such as a Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) or Junction Gate Field Effect Transistor (JFET) may be utilized in some embodiments. In some cases, the snubber circuit <b>105</b> may comprise one or more additional components not shown herein. Further, the DC-pulse section <b>110</b> may be configured to be coupled between the snubber circuit <b>110</b> and the output terminals <b>130</b>, for instance, between the snubber circuit <b>110</b> and the fixed output inductor <b>102</b>. As illustrated, the DC-pulse section <b>110</b> may comprise one or more switches (e.g., Q<sub>1</sub>-Q<sub>8</sub>) arranged in a bridge configuration (e.g., two or more half- or full-bridges). In some cases, the one or more switches (Q<sub>1</sub>-Q<sub>8</sub>) may be implemented using MOSFETs, such as p-type or n-type MOSFETs, although other types of switches are contemplated in different embodiments. Further, it should be noted that the switches Q<sub>1</sub>-Q<sub>8 </sub>need not be identical. For instance, in one non-limiting example, switch Q<sub>1 </sub>may be implemented using a MOSFET, while switch Q<sub>2 </sub>may be implemented using a BJT.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0063">The power supply unit <b>100</b> illustrates one example topology of a PECVD power supply using a single fixed inductor (i.e., inductor <b>102</b>) at the output. The inductor <b>102</b> may help smoothen the edges of a waveform output (e.g., an exponential waveform, a square waveform) at the output terminals <b>130</b>. As noted above, the waveform output produced by the power supply unit may refer to a differential output waveform derived from the output terminals (e.g., Pulse A voltage-Pulse B voltage). In some cases, the output terminals <b>130</b> may be coupled to a load, such as a plasma load. Further, a matching network (not shown) may be provided between the output terminals <b>130</b> and the plasma load to optimize power transfer efficiency to the plasma load.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a power supply unit <b>200</b> configured to maintain an output waveform (e.g., an exponential wave, a square wave, etc.) through a variable inductor <b>202</b> at the output, according to an embodiment of the disclosure. In some cases, the output waveform may comprise a differential output voltage waveform (e.g., between output terminal <b>130</b>-<i>a </i>and output terminal <b>130</b>-<i>b, </i>or vice-versa). In some cases, the power supply unit <b>200</b> may implement one or more aspects of the power supply unit <b>100</b>, previously described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For instance, the power supply unit <b>200</b> may comprise an AC-DC converter (not shown) coupled across the input terminals, where V<sub>in </sub>denotes the output voltage from the AC-DC converter, a snubber circuit <b>105</b>, a DC-pulse section <b>110</b>, and an optional filter <b>220</b> (e.g., a common mode choke, an inductor, etc.). In some cases, the variable inductor <b>202</b> may be used in lieu of a fixed output inductor (e.g., inductor <b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). As shown, the variable inductor <b>202</b> may be configured to be coupled at one end to the DC-pulse section <b>110</b> and at another end to at least one output terminal (e.g., output terminal <b>130</b>-<i>a</i>) of the power supply <b>200</b>. In some cases, an effective inductance of the variable inductor <b>202</b> may be controllable using a controller <b>206</b> and/or a DC bias (e.g., a DC current source). For instance, the controller <b>206</b> may be configured to control a DC bias <b>207</b> applied by a DC current source <b>211</b> to the variable inductor <b>202</b>, further described in relation to the figures below. In some cases, the variable inductor <b>202</b> may influence both rising and falling edges of the output pulses (e.g., Pulse A at output terminal <b>130</b>-<i>a, </i>Pulse B at output terminal <b>130</b>-<i>b</i>). Additionally or alternatively, the variable inductor <b>202</b> may influence both rising and falling edges of the differential output voltage waveform, the differential output voltage waveform derived by subtracting Pulse A and Pulse B voltages, or vice-versa. Further, the controller <b>206</b> may be configured to receive one or more measurements, such as a current measurement from the current sensor <b>115</b>-<i>b, </i>a first voltage measurement (A) from a first one of the output terminals (e.g., output terminal <b>130</b>-<i>a</i>), and a second voltage measurement (B) from a second one of the output terminals (e.g., output terminal <b>130</b>-<i>b</i>). The controller <b>206</b> may determine the DC bias <b>207</b> for application based at least in part on the one or more current and/or voltage measurements (e.g., differential output voltage, A&#x2212;B). Further, the controller <b>206</b> may instruct the DC current source <b>211</b> to apply the DC bias <b>207</b>, where the DC bias <b>207</b> may be applied to a control arm or winding of the variable inductor <b>202</b>. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the DC current source <b>211</b> as being within the controller <b>206</b>, in other embodiments, the DC current source may be separate from the controller <b>206</b> and in electronic communication with the controller <b>206</b>. It should be noted that, the variable inductor <b>202</b> and/or the current sensor <b>115</b>-<i>b </i>may be coupled to either of the output terminals of the power supply unit <b>200</b>, and the arrangement in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is not intended to be limiting. In some cases, the optional output filter <b>220</b> may also be referred to as a common mode choke and may comprise at least one inductor. The common mode choke may be configured to minimize or reduce transients (e.g., voltage transients) at the output terminals <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0065">In the example shown, the switches (Q<sub>1</sub>-Q<sub>8</sub>) of the DC-pulse section <b>110</b> are arranged in one or more full bridge configurations, where a first full bridge comprises switches Q<sub>1</sub>-Q<sub>4 </sub>and a second full bridge comprises switches Q<sub>5</sub>-Q<sub>8</sub>. It should be noted that the DC-pulse section <b>110</b> configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is not intended to be limiting, and other applicable topologies (e.g., one or more half-bridge pairs of switches) may be utilized in different embodiments.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates an exemplary square waveform <b>300</b>-<i>a </i>that might be produced by the power supply unit with a fixed inductor, such as the power supply unit <b>100</b> with the fixed output inductor <b>102</b> previously described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates an exemplary exponential waveform <b>300</b>-<i>b </i>that might be produced by a power supply with a variable inductor and a first DC bias, such as the power supply unit <b>200</b> with the variable inductor <b>202</b> previously described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> illustrates an exemplary exponential waveform <b>300</b>-<i>c </i>that might be produced by a power supply with a variable inductor and a second DC bias, such as the power supply unit <b>200</b> with the variable inductor <b>202</b> previously described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In some cases, the first and second DC biases applied to the variable inductor (e.g., variable inductor <b>202</b>) may be different. In some cases, exponential waveforms <b>300</b>-<i>b </i>and/or <b>300</b>-<i>c </i>may be easier to maintain than a square waveform (e.g., square waveform <b>300</b>-<i>a</i>), since a smaller variation in inductance may allow the exponential waveform shape to be maintained. Said another way, larger inductance variations may be needed to maintain a square waveform, as opposed to an exponential waveform, when the load impedance changes.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0067">In some cases, a power supply unit with an output inductor (e.g., a fixed or variable inductor) may produce one of the waveforms <b>300</b>-<i>b </i>or <b>300</b>-<i>c </i>when a static or fixed load is coupled to the output terminal(s). In other words, either one of a fixed or a variable inductor may achieve the beveling of the corners of the pulses seen in waveforms <b>300</b>-<i>b </i>and/or <b>300</b>-<i>c. </i>However, when the impedance of a load, such as a plasma load, changes, a fixed output inductor may cause the waveform shape to swing (e.g., between waveform <b>300</b>-<i>b </i>and <b>300</b>-<i>c</i>). According to aspects of this disclosure, the shape of a waveform (e.g., waveform <b>300</b>-<i>b</i>) may be maintained (i.e., in spite of variations in the load impedance) through the use of a variable, rather than a fixed, inductor at the output. For instance, when the impedance of a load changes, the effective inductance of the variable inductor may be adjusted so that the shape of waveform <b>300</b>-<i>b </i>may be maintained. As noted above, the effective inductance of the variable inductor may be controlled using a controller and a DC current source. In one non-limiting example, the controller may determine a DC bias to be applied to the variable inductor to adjust the effective inductance of the variable inductor. Further, the controller may instruct the DC current source to apply the DC bias to the variable inductor, for instance, to a control winding of the variable inductor.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0068">In some cases, adjusting the inductance of the variable inductor may also allow one or more characteristics of the output waveform to be maintained, for instance, a relationship (e.g., a product) between a peak-to-peak current value and a measured time for waves or pulses of the output waveform. Some non-limiting examples of the measured time include a rising time, a falling time, and a timespan between a first and a second pre-defined current level. In other cases, one or more voltage specific characteristics of the output waveform may be maintained, for instance, a relationship between a peak-to-peak value and a measured time for voltage differential waves associated with the output waveform, where the voltage differential waves are based at least in part on first and second voltage measurements (e.g., first voltage measurement is associated with Pulse A, second voltage measurement is associated with Pulse B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). In this example, the measured time may be selected from a group consisting of a rising time, a falling time, and a timespan between a first and a second pre-defined voltage differential level.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates a variable inductor <b>400</b>-<i>a </i>having a double E (&#x201c;EE&#x201d;) structure. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrates an equivalent reluctance circuit <b>400</b>-<i>b </i>of the variable inductor <b>400</b>-<i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. In some cases, the variable inductor <b>400</b>-<i>a </i>may be similar or substantially similar to, and may be implemented as, the variable inductor <b>202</b> previously described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0070">In some cases, variable inductors (VIs) may be controlled by means of a DC current level (i.e., a DC bias). Usually, in a VI, a DC magnetic flux is injected into the structure in order to provide a bias level that allows for magnetic permeability modulation. In some cases, the AC magnetic flux amplitude is a degree or more smaller than the bias level. Under this assumption, it may be possible to analyze the VI <b>400</b>-<i>a </i>by applying the superposition principle to the equivalent reluctance circuit <b>400</b>-<i>b. </i>In some cases, the AC magnetic flux may be superposed to this DC level, thus making it possible that a variable inductance can be seen from the AC windings. Various VI structures can be implemented, though the double E structure, the triple E structure, and the quadruple U structure are the most common.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0071">As shown, the variable inductor <b>400</b>-<i>a </i>comprises a magnetic core <b>401</b>, where the magnetic core <b>401</b> comprises one or more arms, including an inductor arm <b>415</b> (also referred to as central arm <b>415</b>) and two control arms <b>405</b>-<i>a </i>and <b>405</b>-<i>b. </i>In some cases, an inductance winding <b>420</b> having one or more turns (represented as N<sub>ac</sub>) may be wound around the inductor arm <b>415</b>. The inductor arm <b>415</b> may comprise an air gap <b>425</b>, which may serve to limit the maximum amplitude of the AC magnetic flux density. In some cases, the inductance winding <b>420</b> may be configured to receive a pulsed waveform (e.g., a square waveform, an exponential waveform, such as exponential waveform <b>300</b>-<i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>) from a DC-pulsed section (e.g., DC-pulse section <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of a power supply unit.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0072">Further, a first control winding <b>410</b>-<i>a </i>having one or more turns (represented as N<sub>dc</sub>) may be wound around the first control arm <b>405</b>-<i>a </i>and a second control winding having one or more turns may be wound around the second control arm <b>405</b>-<i>b. </i>In some cases, the number of turns (N<sub>dc</sub>) wound around the first and the second control arms <b>405</b> may be the same to maintain symmetry in the structure.

Further, a second end of the second control winding <b>410</b>-<i>b </i>may be coupled to a first end of the DC current source <b>430</b>, while the second end of the DC current source may be coupled to the second end of the first control winding <b>410</b>-<i>a. </i>In some cases, the DC current source <b>430</b> may be configured to inject a DC current (I<sub>dc</sub>) into the control windings <b>410</b>, thus changing one or more of the DC flux density (e.g., driving the DC flux density towards the knee of the material B-H curve), the permeability (e.g., decreasing permeability), and the reluctance (e.g., increasing reluctance) in the VI <b>400</b>-<i>a. </i>In this way, the effective inductance (Lac) of the variable inductor <b>400</b>-<i>a </i>measured between terminals M<sub>1 </sub>and M<sub>2 </sub>may be controlled. In some cases, one of the terminals (e.g., M<sub>1</sub>) may be coupled to a DC-pulse section of the power supply unit, while the other of the terminals (e.g., M<sub>2</sub>) may be coupled to an output terminal (e.g., output terminal <b>130</b>-<i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of the power supply unit.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0073">For sake of simplicity, it is assumed that the main winding or inductance winding <b>420</b> only produces an AC magnetic flux (e.g., &#x3d5;<sub>AC</sub>) with no DC component, while the control or auxiliary windings <b>410</b> only handle a DC current. This DC current generates a DC magnetic flux component (e.g., &#x3d5;<sub>DC</sub>) which is used to bias the AC magnetic flux component flowing through the inductor arm. For instance, the inductance winding <b>420</b> generates an AC magnetic flux component (&#x3d5;<sub>AC</sub>) in the inductor arm <b>415</b> that flows through the inductor arm and splits into first and second AC magnetic flux components <b>421</b>-<i>a </i>and <b>421</b>-<i>b </i>that flow through the first and second control arms <b>405</b>, respectively. Since the number of turns <b>410</b> around the first and second control arms <b>405</b> are equal, the first and second AC magnetic flux components <b>421</b>-<i>a </i>and <b>421</b>-<i>b </i>are also equal in magnitude. As seen, the first and second AC magnetic flux components flow in opposite directions through the first and second control arms, respectively, and effectively cancel each other. The DC bias applied by the DC current source <b>430</b> generates a DC magnetic flux component (not shown) in each of the two control arms, where each of the DC magnetic flux components substantially circulate through the two controls arms <b>405</b> in the same direction. In this way, a DC magnetic flux component (e.g., &#x3d5;<sub>DC</sub>) that is the sum of the individual DC magnetic flux components flowing through each of the control arms <b>405</b> circulates within the outer perimeter of the magnetic core <b>401</b>, while an AC magnetic flux component (&#x3d5;<sub>AC</sub>) flows through the inductor arm <b>415</b>. This DC magnetic flux component biases the AC magnetic flux component and alters an inductance seen from the inductance winding <b>420</b>, for instance, an inductance L<sub>AC </sub>between the first end or terminal (M<sub>1</sub>) and a second end or terminal (M<sub>2</sub>) of the inductance winding <b>420</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0074">In some embodiments, the DC current source <b>430</b> comprises a controller or is in electronic communication with a controller (e.g., shown as controller <b>206</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).

referred to as quad U). The variable inductor <b>600</b>-<i>a </i>may be used as the variable inductor <b>202</b>, previously described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. As seen, the variable inductor <b>600</b>-<i>a </i>comprises two magnetic cores <b>601</b>-<i>a </i>and <b>601</b>-<i>b </i>separated by a spacer <b>635</b>. Each magnetic core <b>601</b> comprises two arms, including an inductor arm <b>605</b> (e.g., inductor arm <b>605</b>-<i>a, </i>inductor arm <b>605</b>-<i>b</i>) and a control arm (e.g., control arm <b>615</b>-<i>a, </i>control arm <b>615</b>-<i>b</i>). In the example shown, the spacer <b>635</b> is positioned between the control arms <b>615</b> of the two magnetic cores <b>601</b>. In some cases, an inductor winding <b>620</b> (e.g., inductor winding <b>620</b>-<i>a, </i>inductor <b>620</b>-<i>b</i>) having one or more turns, represented as N<sub>ac</sub>, may be wound around each of the inductor arms <b>605</b>. Further, a control winding <b>610</b> having one or more turns, represented as N<sub>dc</sub>, may be wound around the control arms <b>615</b> and the spacer <b>635</b>. In some cases, the control winding <b>610</b> may be coupled to a DC current source, where the DC current source is configured to inject or apply a DC current (I<sub>dc</sub>) to the control winding. The DC current source may be coupled to or in communication with a controller (shown as controller <b>206</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The controller may be configured to receive one or more current measurements and/or voltage measurements from one or more output terminals of a power supply unit, where the power supply unit produces a load-dependent output. In some examples, the variable inductor <b>600</b>-<i>a </i>may behave in a similar manner to one or more of the variable inductor <b>400</b>-<i>a </i>and variable inductor <b>500</b>-<i>a </i>previously described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>5</b>A</figref>, respectively. For instance, the control winding (also referred to as a DC bias winding) wound embracing both control arms <b>615</b> may generate a circulating DC magnetic flux <b>616</b> (&#x3a6;<sub>dc</sub>) inside each magnetic core <b>601</b>. Further, the inductor winding (also referred to as an AC winding) may generate an AC magnetic flux <b>617</b> (&#x3a6;<sub>ac</sub>) that circulates through each magnetic core <b>601</b>. The AC or inductor windings <b>620</b>-<i>a </i>and <b>620</b>-<i>b </i>may be connected such that the AC magnetic flux <b>617</b>-<i>a </i>in magnetic core <b>601</b>-<i>a </i>circulates in an opposite direction to the AC magnetic flux <b>617</b>-<i>b </i>in magnetic core <b>601</b>-<i>b </i>when the AC magnetic fluxes <b>617</b> go through the control or DC winding <b>610</b>. Such an arrangement may serve to prevent excessive AC voltage to be reflected across the control winding <b>610</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0094">In some aspects, a quad-U variable inductor structure may allow for a higher degree of symmetry from the point of view of the AC and DC magnetic flux paths, as compared to the double-E and triple-E structures. For instance, the DC magnetic flux may circulate through the entire structure of the quad-U VI, which may allow a designer to get a further reduction of the effective inductance for the same VI volume. In other words, a quad-U structure may allow for a larger inductance range for the same size and/or DC bias current range, as compared to the double-E and triple-E variable inductor structures.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0095">Similar to the variable inductors <b>400</b>-<i>a </i>and <b>500</b>-<i>a </i>described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>5</b>A</figref>, it is assumed that the inductor winding <b>620</b> only produces an AC magnetic flux <b>617</b>, with no DC component. Further, the control or auxiliary winding <b>610</b> handles a DC current (I<sub>dc</sub>), which generates the DC magnetic flux component <b>616</b> used to bias the AC magnetic flux <b>617</b>. While not shown, in some embodiments, an air gap may be placed in each magnetic core <b>601</b>, for instance in the inductor arms <b>605</b>-<i>a </i>and <b>605</b>-<i>b. </i>The air gap may serve to limit the maximum value of the AC magnetic flux, which may decrease magnetic losses (i.e., as compared to when no air gap is present) and minimize the likelihood of saturation due to the AC magnetic flux <b>617</b>. It should be noted that, while an air gap under a threshold (e.g., 0.12 mm, 0.15 mm, 0.20 mm, etc.) may serve to enhance the performance of the VI <b>600</b>-<i>a, </i>a large gap may have the negative effect of requiring more DC bias current to achieve the same DC magnetic flux, which not only increases the losses in the DC bias circuit, but also adversely impacts the efficiency of the VI structure. In some cases, the DC magnetic flux <b>616</b> circulating through the magnetic cores may be used to modulate the permeability of the magnetic material according to its B-H curve, for instance, from the linear region up to saturation. This change in permeability may effect a change of reluctance and/or a variation of the AC inductance of the VI <b>600</b>-<i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0110" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrates an equivalent reluctance circuit <b>600</b>-<i>b </i>for the quadruple U variable inductor <b>600</b>-<i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref><i>a. </i>As seen, the equivalent reluctance circuit <b>600</b>-<i>b </i>depicts equivalent reluctances <b>602</b>-<i>a </i>and <b>603</b>-<i>a </i>of a first one of the magnetic core (e.g., magnetic core <b>601</b>-<i>a</i>) and its respective airgap, and equivalent reluctances <b>602</b>-<i>b </i>and <b>603</b>-<i>b </i>of a second one of the magnetic core and its respective airgap. Further, DC voltage sources (F<sub>dc_1</sub>) <b>606</b>-<i>a </i>and (F<sub>dc_2</sub>) <b>606</b>-<i>b </i>represent the MMF created by the DC or control winding (e.g., control winding <b>610</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>) in each magnetic core (e.g., magnetic core <b>601</b>-<i>a, </i><b>601</b>-<i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>), while AC voltage sources (F<sub>ac_1</sub>) <b>604</b>-<i>a </i>and (F<sub>ac_2</sub>) <b>604</b>-<i>b </i>represent the MMF created by the inductor or AC windings (e.g., inductor winding <b>620</b>-<i>a, </i>inductor <b>620</b>-<i>b</i>) in each magnetic core. The MMF for each of the F<sub>ac </sub>and F<sub>dc </sub>voltage sources may be calculated as N<sub>ac</sub>I<sub>ac </sub>and N<sub>dc</sub>I<sub>dc</sub>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0097">In some cases, &#x3a6;<sub>dc </sub>and &#x3a6;<sub>ac </sub>represent the DC and AC magnetic fluxes, respectively, inside each of the magnetic cores. The AC magnetic flux component may be at least one order of magnitude smaller than the DC magnetic flux component, which may facilitate in reducing magnetic losses in the magnetic cores. Under this assumption, the AC magnetic flux components can be considered as a small-signal operation. Thus, it may be possible to analyze the behavior of the quad-U VI structure by superposing the DC and AC magnetic flux components. By calculating the DC operating point, information related to the AC winding inductance (e.g., effective inductance of the VI), AC magnetic flux density, and/or magnetic losses may also be obtained. In some examples, Equation (18) may be used to compute the AC inductance of the quad-U variable inductor:</p><p id="p-0112" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00013" num="00013"><math overflow="scroll">
