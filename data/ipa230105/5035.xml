Note, the following embodiments are not intended to limit the scope of the claimed invention, and limitation is not made to an invention that requires a combination of all features described in the embodiments. Two or more of the multiple features described in the embodiments may be combined as appropriate. Furthermore, the same reference numerals are given to the same or similar configurations, and redundant description thereof is omitted.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a configuration of a transaction system <b>1</b>, as one aspect of the present invention. The transaction system <b>1</b> is a system useful for promoting reuse of a battery, which is mounted on a vehicle that travels with an electric motor as a power source, for example, an electric vehicle or a hybrid vehicle, and which supplies electric power to the electric motor, as a reuse battery, and is used for transactions (buy or sell) of batteries. The transaction system <b>1</b> contributes to establishing a transaction of a battery between a first user (purchaser) who desires to reuse a battery mounted on a vehicle, that is, desires to purchase the battery, and a second user (owner) who owns the vehicle. Hereinafter, the battery mounted on the vehicle will be referred to as a &#x201c;reuse battery&#x201d;, in some cases.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the transaction system <b>1</b> includes a server <b>2</b>, a first terminal <b>3</b>, a second terminal <b>4</b>, and a third terminal <b>5</b>. In the transaction system <b>1</b>, the server <b>2</b>, the first terminal <b>3</b>, the second terminal <b>4</b>, and the third terminal <b>5</b> are communicably connected with each other through a network <b>6</b> such as the Internet. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a case where one first terminal <b>3</b> and one second terminal <b>4</b> constituting the transaction system <b>1</b> is illustrated, but there may be a plurality of first terminals <b>3</b> and a plurality of second terminals <b>4</b> constituting the transaction system <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The server <b>2</b> includes, for example, a computer including a CPU, a memory, and the like. In the transaction system <b>1</b>, the server <b>2</b> functions as an information processing server that processes information acquired from (the first user (purchaser) who uses) the first terminal <b>3</b> and (the second user (owner) who uses) the second terminal <b>4</b> and that provides the first terminal <b>3</b> and the second terminal <b>4</b> with information.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The first terminal <b>3</b> is a terminal used by the first user who desires to reuse the battery, and is, for example, a computer or a mobile terminal including a CPU, a memory, and the like. The first terminal <b>3</b> includes a display device and a communication device. In the present embodiment, the information to be provided for the first user who uses the first terminal <b>3</b> is provided for (transmitted to) the first terminal <b>3</b> from the server <b>2</b>. Here, the first user who desires to reuse the battery may be a business agency who will incorporate the battery into a secondary use product, or may be a purchaser who desires to purchase a secondary use product from such a business agency. Note that examples of the secondary use product include various products such as power generators, tillers, lawn mowers, snow blowers, and electric power storage machines.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The second terminal <b>4</b> is a terminal used by a second user who owns a vehicle that travels with an electric motor as a power source, and is, for example, a computer or a mobile terminal including a CPU, a memory, and the like. The second terminal <b>4</b> includes a display device and a communication device. In the present embodiment, the information to be provided for the second user who uses the second terminal <b>4</b> is provided (transmitted) to the second terminal <b>4</b> from the server <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The third terminal <b>5</b> is a terminal used by a business agency that will remove the battery from the vehicle that travels with the electric motor as the power source, and is, for example, a computer or a mobile terminal including a CPU, a memory, and the like. The third terminal <b>5</b> includes a display device and a communication device. Here, the business agency who uses the third terminal <b>5</b> is, for example, a vehicle sales dealer, a so-called dealer, provided with facilities (a factory or the like) for removing the battery from the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic block diagram illustrating a configuration of the server <b>2</b>. The server <b>2</b> includes a processing unit <b>21</b>, a storage unit <b>22</b>, and an interface (I/F) unit <b>23</b>. The processing unit <b>21</b> includes a processor represented by a CPU, and executes a program stored in the storage unit <b>22</b>. The storage unit <b>22</b> includes a storage device such as a RAM, a ROM, and a hard disk. The I/F unit <b>23</b> relays transmission and reception of information between an external device and the processing unit <b>21</b>. The I/F unit <b>23</b> includes a wired or wireless communication interface capable of communicating with the first terminal <b>3</b>, the second terminal <b>4</b>, and the third terminal <b>5</b> through the network <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a functional configuration diagram schematically illustrating functions of the processing unit <b>21</b> in the present embodiment. In the present embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the processing unit <b>21</b> includes an acquisition unit <b>211</b>, a determination unit <b>212</b>, a provision unit <b>213</b>, a decision unit <b>214</b>, and a notification unit <b>215</b>. Note that the functions (blocks) to be described below may be integrated or separated, and the functions to be described below may be implemented by different blocks. In addition, what is described as hardware may be achieved by software, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The acquisition unit <b>211</b> has a function of acquiring price information that includes a price to be paid for purchasing a reuse battery and that is presented by the first user, from the first terminal <b>3</b> used by the first user via the I/F unit <b>23</b>. Here, the price is basically an amount of the national currency, but may be an amount of virtual currency, the number of points, or the like.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In addition, the acquisition unit <b>211</b> acquires battery information about a degradation state of the battery mounted on the vehicle owned by the second user, from the vehicle owned by the second user via the I/F unit <b>23</b>. The degradation state of the battery is generally expressed by (current (degraded) full charge capacity (Ah)/initial full charge capacity (Ah))&#xd7;100(%), and is also referred to as States Of Health (SOH). Note that the battery information about the degradation state of the battery can be transmitted from the vehicle via a telematics control unit (TCU) mounted on the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The determination unit <b>212</b> determines whether the price included in the price information that has been acquired by the acquisition unit <b>211</b> is appropriate, based on the battery information that has been acquired by the acquisition unit <b>211</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the determination unit <b>212</b> refers to a database DB indicating a relationship between a degradation state of the battery mounted on the vehicle and an appropriate price range for the degradation state of the battery, specifically, collates the battery information (degradation state of the battery) that has been acquired by the acquisition unit <b>211</b> with the database DB so as to determine whether the price presented by the first user is appropriate. Referring to the database DB illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, &#x201c;SOH&#x201d; indicates a range of values of the degradation state of the battery mounted on the vehicle, and &#x201c;price&#x201d; indicates an appropriate range of the price for the range of the degradation state of the battery. However, the database DB illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an example, and is not limited to this. For example, an appropriate range of the price for each value of the degradation state of the battery mounted on the vehicle may be made into a database. In the present embodiment, the database DB is stored in the storage unit <b>22</b> beforehand.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The provision unit <b>213</b> has a function of providing the price information that has been acquired by the acquisition unit <b>211</b> for the second user who owns the vehicle, specifically, for the second terminal <b>4</b> used by the second user via the I/F unit <b>23</b>. Accordingly, (the display device of) the second terminal <b>4</b> displays the price that is to be paid for purchasing the reuse battery and that is presented by the first user. In the present embodiment, the provision unit <b>213</b> provides the second user with the price information, in a case where the determination unit <b>212</b> determines that the price included in the price information that has been acquired by the acquisition unit <b>211</b> is appropriate. On the other hand, in a case where the determination unit <b>212</b> determines that the price included in the price information that has been acquired by the acquisition unit <b>211</b> is not appropriate, the provision unit <b>213</b> does not provide the second user with the price information.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The decision unit <b>214</b> decides a business agency that will remove the battery from the vehicle, in a case where the second user who owns the vehicle approves selling of the battery at the price that is to be paid for purchasing the reuse battery and that is presented by the first user. For example, the decision unit <b>214</b> decides one business agency from a plurality of business agencies that are capable of removing the battery from the vehicle, in consideration of the place (location) of the first user and the place (location) of the second user (for example, a business agency closest to the place of the second user, a business agency closest to the place of the first user, a business agency close to both the place of the first user and the place of the second user, or the like). Note that it is sufficient if a plurality of business agencies that are capable of removing the battery from the vehicle are registered and managed in the server <b>2</b> beforehand.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition, the decision unit <b>214</b> decides a date and time when the battery is to be removed from the vehicle owned by the second user. For example, the decision unit <b>214</b> decides the date and time when the battery is to be removed from the vehicle owned by the second user, based on information that is related to the date and time when the battery can be removed from the vehicle and that is acquired from (the third terminal <b>5</b> installed in) the business agency via the acquisition unit <b>211</b>, and information that is related to the date and time when it is possible to go to the business agency that will remove the battery from the vehicle and that is acquired from (the second terminal <b>4</b> used by) the second user via the acquisition unit <b>211</b> (that is, the date and time when the vehicle can be disposed of).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The notification unit <b>215</b> has a function of notifying the second user who owns the vehicle, specifically, the second terminal <b>4</b> used by the second user of business agency information about the business agency that will remove the battery from the vehicle and that has been decided by the decision unit <b>214</b>, via the I/F unit <b>23</b>.

The terminal TL includes a processing unit PU, a storage unit SU, and an interface (I/F) unit IU. The processing unit PU includes a processor represented by a CPU, and executes a program stored in the storage unit SU. The storage unit SU includes a storage device such as a RAM, a ROM, and a hard disk. The I/F unit IU relays transmission and reception of information between an external device and the processing unit PU.

In a case where the price presented by the first user is not appropriate, it is conceivable that even if the price is provided for the second user who owns the vehicle, the possibility that the second user approves selling of the battery is extremely low. Therefore, in the present embodiment, the server <b>2</b> side determines whether the price presented by the first user is appropriate, and in a case where the price presented by the first user is not appropriate, the server <b>2</b> notifies the first user that reconsideration of the price will be necessary without providing the second user with the price presented by the first user. Accordingly, the amount of information transmitted and received between the server <b>2</b> and the second terminal <b>4</b> used by the second user can be reduced (that is, unnecessary processes are omitted), and at the same time, the first user is encouraged to reconsider the price so that the opportunity for purchasing the reusable battery of the vehicle can be increased (that is, the probability of establishing a transaction of the reuse battery between the first user and the second user can be increased).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In S<b>608</b>, the processing unit <b>21</b> (the provision unit <b>213</b>) provides the second terminal <b>4</b> used by the second user with the price information acquired in S<b>602</b>.
