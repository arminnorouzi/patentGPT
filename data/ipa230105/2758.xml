The designated reactions may then be observed or detected and subsequent analysis may help identify or reveal properties of chemicals involved in the reaction. For example, in some multiplex assays, an unknown analyte having an identifiable label (e.g., fluorescent label) may be exposed to thousands of known probes under controlled conditions. Each known probe may be deposited into a corresponding well of a microplate. Observing any chemical reactions that occur between the known probes and the unknown analyte within the wells may help identify or reveal properties of the analyte.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Other protocols that detect light emissions from an array of reaction sites include known DNA sequencing protocols, such as sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) or cyclic-array sequencing. In SBS, a plurality of fluorescently-labeled nucleotides are used to sequence nucleic acids of numerous clusters (or clonal populations) of amplified DNA that are located on the surface of a substrate. The surface may, for example, define a channel in a flow cell. The sequences of the nucleic acids in the different clusters are determined by running numerous cycles in which a fluorescently-labeled nucleotide is added to the cluster and then excited by a light source to provide light emissions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although the sequencing systems currently used are effective in identifying the nucleotides and determining a sequence of the nucleic acids, systems that are more cost-effective and/or that achieve an even smaller error rate are desired. For example, it is desirable to increase the density of reaction sites. Sequencing methodologies and corresponding systems, however, exploit a complex collection of technologies. Improvements in some of these technologies have been shown to provide substantial cost reductions. However, it is difficult to predict which, if any, is amenable to cost-reducing improvements. Given the dependencies between the technologies in the sequencing systems it is even more difficult to predict which can be modified without having an adverse impact on the overall performance of the methodology or system.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One challenge confronted by many protocols is detecting, with a suitable level of confidence, the designated reactions that generate light emissions. This challenge is even more difficult as the reaction sites become smaller and the density of reaction sites becomes greater. For example, reaction sites may have a diameter or width that is 750 nm or less, and adjacent reaction sites may be separated by 750 nm or less. One consequence of the reaction sites becoming smaller is that the amount of generated light emissions also becomes smaller and, consequently, more challenging to detect. Moreover, as the density of reaction sites becomes greater, it may be more difficult to distinguish which reaction sites provided the light emissions. In addition to the above, it is generally desirable to decrease the amount of time used for detecting the light emissions (also referred to as scan time or image time). As scan times decrease, fewer photons are detected, thereby rendering it even more challenging to reliably detect light emissions that are indicative of a designated reaction occurring.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, a need exists for apparatuses, systems, and methods that generate a sufficient amount of light for detecting designated reactions within an array of reaction sites.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Presented herein are structures substrates and methods for manufacturing structures substrates that improve the detectability of optical emissions provided by discrete reaction sites. For example, the structures substrates may increase an intensity of an excitation light experienced by biological substances at the discrete sites, may increase an intensity of the optical emissions from the biological substances, and/or may control a directionality of the optical emissions. Also presented herein are methods of detecting optical emissions from an array of discrete sites.

The optical emissions may be generated by, for example, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, bioluminescence, electroluminescence, radioluminescence, and the like.

matter described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/920,244, filed on Dec. 23, 2013, and entitled ENHANCING DNA CLUSTER FLUORSCENCE USING LOCALIZED SURFACE PLASMON RESONANCE, and in International Application No. PCT/US2014/072256, filed on Dec. 23, 2014 and entitled STRUCTURED SUBSTRATES FOR IMPROVING DETECTION OF LIGHT EMISSIONS AND METHODS RELATING TO THE SAME, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The subject matter of the present application may also be applicable with or include similar subject matter that is described in U.S. Patent Appl. Publ. Nos. 2014/0242334; 2014/0079923; and 2011/0059865 and U.S. Pat. No. 8,895,249. Each of these publications and the patent is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">One or more embodiments set forth herein are configured to directly or indirectly enhance light emissions from an array of reaction sites so that the light emissions may be detected by, for example, an imaging system or device. To this end, embodiments may at least one of increase an intensity of an excitation light experienced by a biological substance, increase an intensity of the light emissions generated by the biological substance, and/or control a directionality of the light emissions so that the light emissions may be detected. The increase in intensity and/or control of the directionality of the light emissions may be caused, in part, by one or more nanostructures located at the corresponding reaction site. The amount of increase may be measured relative to an amount of electromagnetic energy that exists at the reaction site without the nanostructure(s).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The array of reaction sites may be disposed along a structured substrate. The structured substrate may be, for example, a flow cell having a channel for directing reagents alongside the reaction sites. The light emissions may be detected by an imaging system that may include, for example, an objective lens that scans or sweeps alongside the structured substrate to detect the light emissions from the reaction sites. Exemplary systems capable of detecting light emissions from the structured substrates set forth herein are described in U.S. Appl. Publ. Nos. 2012/0270305 A1 and 2013/0261028 A1, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Alternatively, the structured substrate may be integrated with an imaging device, such as a solid-state imaging device (e.g., CMOS). In such embodiments, the imaging device may have one or more light sensors that are aligned with reaction sites to capture light emissions from the reaction sites. Such embodiments are described in U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/914,275 and International Application No. PCT/US14/69373, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">A technical effect provided by at least one of the embodiments may include an increased signal intensity from the emitters of the biological substance. The increase in signal intensity may reduce an error rate by increasing the likelihood that the signals will be detected. Another technical effect may include a decrease in signal to noise ratio that enables faster scan speeds and reduces overall time for conducting a protocol. For instance, with respect to sequencing-by-synthesis technology, faster scan speeds on sequencing instruments are desired, but faster scan speeds result in fewer photons being collected per cluster on the imaging camera. With fewer photons captured, the signal to noise ratio typically decreases and it becomes more difficult to confidently assign a base. Furthermore on some sequencing instruments, low NA optics result in signals that are inherently larger and dimmer, potentially yielding higher error rates. Embodiments set forth herein may increase the number of photons that are captured. Another technical effect for at least some embodiments includes a method of manufacturing a structured substrate that is more reliable than at least some known methods and more cost-effective than at least some known methods.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">As used herein, a &#x201c;biological substance&#x201d; or &#x201c;chemical substance&#x201d; includes biomolecules, samples-of-interest, analytes-of-interest, and other chemical compound(s). A biological substance or chemical substance may be used to detect, identify, or analyze other chemical compound(s), or function as intermediaries to study or analyze other chemical compound(s). In particular embodiments, the biological substance is a nucleic acid or, more specifically, a colony of nucleic acids having a common sequence. In particular embodiments, the biological or chemical substances include a biomolecule. As used herein, a &#x201c;biomolecule&#x201d; includes at least one of a biopolymer, nucleoside, nucleic acid, polynucleotide, oligonucleotide, protein, enzyme, polypeptide, antibody, antigen, ligand, receptor, polysaccharide, carbohydrate, polyphosphate, cell, tissue, organism, or fragment thereof or any other biologically active chemical compound(s) such as analogs or mimetics of the aforementioned species.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">As another example, a biological or chemical substance may include an enzyme or reagent used in a coupled reaction to detect the product of another reaction such as an enzyme or reagent used to detect pyrophosphate in a pyrosequencing reaction. Enzymes and reagents useful for pyrophosphate detection are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0244870 A1, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Biological or chemical substances may be naturally occurring or synthetic and located within a designated area or space. In some embodiments, the biological or chemical substances may be bound to a solid phase or gel material. Biomolecules, samples, and biological or chemical substances may also include a pharmaceutical composition. In some cases, biomolecules, samples, and biological or chemical substances of interest may be referred to as targets, probes, or analytes.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Embodiments may be particularly suitable for enhancing emissions from fluorescently-labeled nucleic acids. By way of example, embodiments may provide fluorescent enhancement of DNA clusters in sequencing by synthesis reactions involving dye-labeled nucleotides. Embodiments may increase a signal intensity from flurorescent labels during sequencing by synthesis. The increase in signal intensity may improve overall sequencing performance by reducing sequencing error arising from low intensity clusters and cluster dropouts during long sequencing runs.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Various embodiments utilize one or more nanostructures to amplify electromagnetic energy at a reaction site. For embodiments that utilize a plurality of nanostructures (e.g., two or more nanostructures), the plurality of nanostructures may be referred to as an ensemble amplifier. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;nanostructure&#x201d; and &#x201c;nanoparticle&#x201d; are used interchangeably to refer to a structure having a greatest dimension (e.g, height, width, diameter) in the range of about 1 nm to about 1000 nm, including any integer or non-integer value between 1 nm and 1000 nm. In typical embodiments, the nanoparticle is a metallic particle or a silicon particle. In some embodiments, the nanoparticle core is a spherical or nearly spherical particle of 20-200 nm in diameter. In some embodiments the range is about 1 nm to about 50 nm (for example about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50 nm).</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">Anisotropic nanostructures (e.g., non-spherical structures) may have a length and a width or, for some embodiments, a diameter. In some embodiments, the length of the anisotropic nanostructure is the greatest dimension of the nanostructure. In some embodiments, the length of an anisotropic nanoparticle is a dimension parallel to the plane of the aperture in which the nanoparticle was produced. In some embodiments, the length of an anisotropic nanoparticle is the dimension perpendicular to the plane of the aperture in which the nanoparticle was produced. In the case of anisotropic nanostructures, the nanostructure may have a width or diameter in the range of about 50 nm to about 750 nm. In other embodiments, the nanostructure has a width or diameter of about 350 nm or less. In other embodiments, the nanoparticle has a width or diameter of 250 nm or less and in some embodiments, a width or diameter of 100 nm or less. In some embodiments, the width or diameter is between 15 nm to 300 nm.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In some embodiments, the nanoparticle has a length of about 10-750 nm. In some embodiments, the nanostructures have a preselected shape and can be, for example a nanotube, a nanowire, nanosphere, or any shape comprising the above-described dimensions (e.g., triangular, square, rectangular, or polygonal shape in 2 dimensions, or cuboid, pyramidal, cylindrical, spherical, discoid, or hemispheric shapes in the 3 dimensions). Some examples of nanostructures include, for example, bowtie nanoantennae, nanospheres, nanopyramids, nanoshells, nanorods, nanowires, nanorings, nanoplugs, nanogratings and the like. Preformed dimers and trimers of nanostructures can also be loaded into wells and have the advantage of precisely controlling nanoparticle spacing.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The nanostructures can either be fabricated on a surface or pre-formed and then loaded into the reaction cavities, such as nanowells. Examples of such structures include plasmonic nanoplugs fabricated at the bottom of nanowells, bowtie and cavity antennas in nanowells, metal nanogratings on which nanowells could be formed, nanostructures reflowed in nanowells or a combination of some or all of the above. One example would be a metal nanoplug in a nanowell with nanostructures on the walls formed through an electron beam evaporation process. Ensemble amplifiers or constructs (dimers, n-mers) may also be positioned within the reaction cavities. Such methods allow for precise subnanometer control over nanostructure spacings and can be formed on a large scale using bottom up self-assembly.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The spacing between any two nanostructures on a surface can be any distance. In some embodiments, the spacing can be a multiple of a wavelength of incident light energy, such as a particular emission or excitation wavelength in fluorescence spectroscopy. The spacing can be, for example, 1 &#x3bb;, 2 &#x3bb;, 3 &#x3bb;, 4 &#x3bb; or another multiple of a chosen wavelength (&#x3bb;) of incident light energy. Thus, using as an example an emission wavelength (&#x3bb;) of 532 nm, the spacing between nanostructures can be about 532 nm (1 &#x3bb;), about 1064 nm (2 &#x3bb;), or another multiple of the emission wavelength. In some embodiments, the spacing can be a fraction of a wavelength of incident light energy, such as a particular emission or excitation wavelength in fluorescence spectroscopy. The spacing can be, for example, 1 &#x3bb;, &#xbd; &#x3bb;, &#x2153; &#x3bb;, &#xbc; &#x3bb; or another multiple of a chosen wavelength of incident light energy. Thus, using as an example an emission wavelength of (&#x3bb;) 532 nm, the spacing between nanostructures can be about 532 nm (1 &#x3bb;), 266 nm (&#xbd; &#x3bb;), 133 nm (&#x2153; &#x3bb;) or another fraction of the emission wavelength.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some embodiments, the nanostructures may be referred to as &#x201c;plasmonic nanostructure&#x201d; or &#x201c;nanoplasmonic structure.&#x201d; These terms may be used interchangeably and refer to any independent structure exhibiting plasmon resonance characteristic of the structure, including (but not limited to) both nanostructures, nanostructures and combinations or associations of nanostructures.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The term &#x201c;nanoantenna,&#x201d; as used herein, includes a nanostructure or a plurality of nanostructures (or ensemble amplifier) that acts to amplify electromagnetic energy, such as light energy. As used herein, a nanoantenna (or ensemble amplifier) does not necessarily exhibit plasmon resonance characteristics. In some embodiments, a nanoantenna does not substantially comprise a plasmon resonant material. Thus, in some embodiments, nanoantennas are presented which are made of a non-metal material but which exhibits amplification characteristics of electromagnetic energy. Nanostructures presented herein can be of any suitable shape and size so as to produce the desired energy amplification. Some exemplary shapes of nanoantennas include, for example, bowtie nanoantennae, nanospheres, nanopyramids, nanoshells, nanorods, nanowires, nanorings, nanoplugs, nanogratings and the like. It will be appreciated that any of a number of known methods can be suitable for fabrication and/or deposition of nanoantenna on a solid support. Methods for fabrication of nanoantenna are known in the art and include, for example, the methods described herein for nanoparticle fabrication and deposition.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The nanostructures can comprise any material suitable for use in the methods and compositions described herein, for example, any type of material exhibiting surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In certain preferred embodiments, the nanoparticle comprises a plasmon resonant material. Examples include, but are not limited to, metal nanostructures. For example, the nanostructures can comprise a metal such as one or more of Gold (Au), Silver (Ag), Tin (Sn) Rhodium (Rh), Ruthenium (Ru), Palladium (Pd), Osmium (Os), Iridium (Ir), Platinum (Pt), Titanium (Ti) and Aluminum (Al), Chromium (Cr), Copper (Cu), or any other suitable metal. The plasmon resonant material may comprise a metallic alloy. For example, the plasmon resonant material may comprise Zinc-Indium-Tin Oxide (ZITO) or Tantalum Oxide (e.g., TaO<sub>5</sub>). The nanostructures can be formed from a single material such as, for example a single metal. Additionally or alternatively, the nanostructures can be formed from a combination of two or more different materials, such as, for example, two or more metals. For example, the nanostructures can comprise a metal/metal mixture such as Sn/Au or Ag/Au. Alternatively or additionally, vertical layered nanostructures, such as multilayer structures of the metal-insulator-metal type may be applied. Examples include p-type doped silicon, n-type doped silicon, and gallium arsenide. In particular embodiments, the nanostructures may be formed from a polymer that is coated by a plasmon resonant material and/or a metallic material.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Formation of nanostructures on a solid support can be performed using any one of a number of methods known in the art. Nanostructures can be formed using bottom-up self-assembly of plasmonic nanostructures and nano-antennae on the sequencing substrate. For example, any one of a number of methods for deposition of layers of a material can be used, such as those described by Gaspar et al. (Scientific Reports, 2013, 3, 1469), which is incorporated herein by reference. Layer-fabricating processes that may be used to form the nanostructures include photolithography, etching (e.g., reactive-ion etching), sputtering, evaporation, casting (e.g., spin coating), chemical vapor deposition, electrodeposition, epitaxy, thermal oxidation, physical vapor deposition, and the like. In some embodiments, the nanostructures may be formed using a shadow technique. In some embodiments, the nanostructures may be formed using nanolithography, such as nanoimprint lithography (NIL).</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">In exemplary embodiments described herein, the nanostructures can be pre-formed and mixed in a colloid-like composition with a gel material, which is deposited on a surface. Alternatively or additionally, nanostructures can be first deposited on a surface followed by deposition of a gel material over the nanostructures. In other embodiments, a gel material can be deposited on a surface and nanostructures are deposited over the gel material.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some embodiments, the nanostructures are formed in a well (or concave feature) of a solid surface. A film of starting material such as Sn/Au can be deposited on a solid surface containing nanowells, followed by thermal annealing. In some embodiments, thermal annealing can be utilized to promote formation of nanostructures as the film coalesces into discrete particles. Nanoparticle size can be a function of the starting film thickness. A further polishing step following the thermal anneal can result in nanostructures only in the wells while leaving the interstitial regions substantially void of nanostructures. Nanostructures in interstitial regions can be removed through, for example, chemical and/or mechanical polishing. A distribution of nanoparticle sizes is observed in each nanowell enabling broad spectrum fluorescence enhancement.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some embodiments, a nanostructure such as a nanoring can be formed along the wall of wells (or concave features) on a surface. The nanostructures can be fabricated using any one of a number of methodologies known in the art. For example, Au can be deposited using sputtered deposition. In an embodiment, conformal deposition of a &#x2dc;65 nm Au layer may be followed by a reactive ion etch (RIE) process. The remaining Au layer was located along the walls of the nanowells, forming nanorings in each of the nanowells.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">The terms &#x201c;excitation light&#x201d; and &#x201c;light emissions&#x201d; mean electromagnetic energy and are used to differentiate the source of the electromagnetic energy. Excitation light is generally provided from a light source (e.g., laser) that is positioned a distance away from the reaction site. For example, for embodiments that include reaction cavities, the light source may be positioned outside of the reaction cavities. Light emissions, however, are typically generated by an emitter within or at the reaction sites. The emitter may be, for example, a fluorophore. Particular embodiments may be configured to amplify electromagnetic energy at any wavelength between 300 nm to 750 nm (e.g., 300 nm, 301 nm, 302 nm, 303 nm, 304 nm, 305 nm, 306 nm, 307 nm, 308 nm . . . 745 nm, 746 nm, 747 nm, 748 nm, 749 nm, and 750 nm). As used herein, the term &#x201c;wavelength&#x201d; shall not be limited to a single wavelength unless expressly stated to constitute &#x201c;a single wavelength&#x201d; or &#x201c;only one wavelength&#x201d;. Instead, the term &#x201c;wavelength&#x201d; shall encompass a narrow range of wavelengths located about a desired or target wavelength (e.g., 532 nm&#xb1;10 nm, 532 nm&#xb1;5 nm, 660 nm&#xb1;10 nm, 660 nm&#xb1;5 nm), unless explicitly recited otherwise.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">The nanostructures of each ensemble amplifier may be configured relative to one another to amplify the electromagnetic energy in a designated manner. For example, a distance that separates the nanostructures of a corresponding ensemble amplifier may be based on the electromagnetic energy that is desired to be amplified. The nanostructures of the ensemble amplifier may be configured for a particular wavelength (e.g., narrow band of wavelengths). For example, one or more embodiments may be configured to amplify electromagnetic energy having a wavelength of 532 nm. One or more embodiments may be configured to amplify electromagnetic energy having a wavelength of 660 nm. In some embodiments, the ensemble amplifiers may be capable of amplifying multiple wavelengths or broader ranges of wavelengths.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">One or more embodiments may include ensemble amplifiers that preferentially respond to certain polarizations of light. For example, a first ensemble amplifier may be configured to respond to a first polarization light, and a second ensemble amplifier may be configured to respond to a second polarization light. The preferential response may be based on, for example, a dipole moment of the corresponding ensemble amplifier.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">By way of example, when a first ensemble amplifier is illuminated by a first polarization light, the light emissions provided by the first ensemble amplifier may provide a maximum signal intensity for the first ensemble amplifier. However, when a second ensemble amplifier (which has a different configuration than the first ensemble amplifier) is illuminated by the first polarization light, the light emissions provided by the second ensemble amplifier may be, for example, about 40% or less the maximum signal intensity for the second ensemble amplifier. Likewise, when the second ensemble amplifier is illuminated by the second polarization light, the light emissions provided by the second ensemble amplifier may provide a maximum signal intensity for the second ensemble amplifier. However, when the first ensemble amplifier is illuminated by the second polarization light, the light emissions provided by the first ensemble amplifier may be, for example, about 40% or less the maximum signal intensity for the first ensemble amplifier.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In many cases, the first and second ensemble amplifiers may be illuminated simultaneously, concurrently, or during the same imaging sequence such that a single image detects light emissions from the first ensemble amplifiers and the second ensemble amplifiers. In such embodiments, the ensemble amplifiers that preferentially respond to the excitation light may provide a greater signal intensity than the ensemble amplifiers that do not preferentially respond to the excitation light. A subsequent may then be captured that uses a different excitation light.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross-section of a portion of a structured substrate <b>100</b> formed in accordance with an embodiment.

For instance, the electromagnetic energy may be the excitation light <b>108</b> that propagates from an exterior environment and into a reaction cavity <b>106</b>, wherein the excitation light is absorbed by an emitter (e.g., fluorophore) that is associated with a biological substance.

Steric exclusion can be particularly useful for large analytes, such as nucleic acids. More specifically, reaction cavities can expose a surface of the organic material (e.g., gel material) having an area that is equivalent to or smaller than a diameter of the excluded volume of target nucleic acids that are to be seeded on the substrate. The excluded volume for a target nucleic acid and its diameter can be determined, for example, from the length of the target nucleic acid.

The structured substrate can optionally be washed to remove target nucleic acids that do not seed the gel material as well as any other materials that are unwanted for subsequent processing or use of the structured substrate.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">Nonetheless, it will be understood that in other embodiments, the area of the exposed gel material may be substantially greater than the diameter of the excluded volume of the target nucleic acids that are transported to the amplification sites.

The method <b>200</b> includes providing, at <b>202</b>, a base layer (or working substrate) having a base side. The base layer may be only a single layer of material or include one or more sub-layers. The base side may have a planar surface that is configured to have another layer deposited directly thereon. However, it is contemplated that the base side may include non-planar features prior to being combined with other layers. In particular embodiments, the base layer includes a glass (SiO<sub>2</sub>) wafer, but other materials may be used.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">The method <b>200</b> may also include forming, at <b>204</b>, an array of nanostructures along the base side of the base layer. The forming, at <b>204</b>, may include multiple processing steps. For example, the forming, at <b>204</b>, may include providing (e.g., through deposition, growing, or another additive technique) a feature layer along the base side of the base layer. The forming, at <b>204</b>, may include shaping (e.g., through etching or another subtractive technique) a sub-layer of the base layer to form the nanostructures. The sub-layer may also be referred to as a feature layer as the nanostructures may be formed from the sub-layer. The feature layer may include a material that is capable of being shaped into individual features that may at least partially form a basis of the nanostructures. The material may include a pure material (e.g., gold) or an alloy of material. The feature layer may also include multiple sub-layers of material (e.g., gold and chrome) that are stacked alongside each other. Optionally, one or more of the materials is a plasmon resonant material.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In particular embodiments, the forming, at <b>204</b>, includes etching the feature layer to form nanobodies. The nanobodies may be arranged in sub-arrays or sets in which each sub-array (or set) may become an ensemble amplifier. In other embodiments, the nanobodies are distributed evenly or uniformly throughout the base layer, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref>. In such embodiments, some of the nanobodies will be embedded while others will be disposed within the reaction cavities.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In some embodiments, the nanobodies formed from the etching process may constitute, without further modification, nanostructures that are capable amplifying electromagnetic energy. In other embodiments, however, further processing steps may be necessary to form the nanostructures. For example, the feature layer may comprise a polymer (or other material that is not a plasmon resonant material) that may be shaped to form nanobodies for constructing the nanostructures. A thin layer or film may be subsequently added to exterior surfaces of the nanobodies to form the nanostructures. Yet still in other embodiments, the nanostructures may be locally deposited at select locations. The method <b>500</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) describes such a process.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The method <b>200</b> also includes forming, at <b>206</b>, a cavity layer along the base side of the base layer.

As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;along the base side&#x201d; or &#x201c;along the base layer&#x201d; includes the cavity layer being in direct contact with the base layer or includes the cavity layer being separated from the base layer by one or more intervening layers.

The spatially relative terms do not require that the structured substrate have a particular orientation with respect to gravity during use or operation. For example, the active side of the structured substrate may face in a direction that is opposite the gravitational force direction in some embodiments. Alternatively, the active side of the structured substrate may face in the same direction as the gravitational force direction in other embodiments. The uppermost surface, such as the side surface that liquid flows along during operation, may be referred to as the top surface regardless of the orientation of the structured substrate with respect to gravity.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The forming, at <b>206</b>, may include providing a cavity layer that is configured to have an array of reaction cavities.

Optionally, the cavity layer may be etched to remove portions of the cavity layer and expose the nanostructures within the corresponding reaction cavities.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In other embodiments, the reaction cavities may be shaped while the cavity layer is positioned above and coupled to the base layer. For example, NIL material may be deposited along the base side of the base layer after the nanostructures are formed and cover the nanostructures. The NIL material may be deposited using, for example, a spin coating technique or by depositing droplets along the base side. The NIL material may comprise a material that is capable of being imprinted using the NIL technique. For example, the NIL material may comprise a polymer. The NIL material may then be imprinted or stamped with a mold (also called template) having a pattern of features that form the reaction cavities in the NIL layer. In some embodiments, the mold is transparent to allow ultraviolet (UV) or visible light to propagate therethrough. In such embodiments, the NIL material may comprise a photocurable polymer that is cured by the UV or visible light while the mold is pressed into the NIL material. Accordingly, the NIL material may cure (e.g., harden) to form the reaction cavities. This process may be identical or similar to step-and-flash imprint lithography (SFIL). In other embodiments, the NIL material may be cured by application of thermal energy and/or pressure. The NIL techniques and like processes are described in Marc J.

The red excitation radiation passes from the red LED collector lens (L<b>7</b>) to the combiner dichroic (F<b>5</b>) after which the red excitation radiation follows the same path as the green excitation radiation to the surface of the flow cell (FC). As shown in the figure, focusing is actuated by moving the translating objective lens group (L<b>4</b>) up and down (i.e. along the z dimension). Emission from the flow cell (FC) surface passes back through the translating objective lens group (L<b>4</b>), and then through the stationary objective lens group (L<b>3</b>) to the excitation/emission dichroic (F<b>4</b>) which passes the emission radiation to the emission projection les group (L<b>1</b>) through to the emission filter and then to the CMOS image sensor (S<b>1</b>). A laser diode (LD) is also directed via a laser diode coupling lens group (L<b>5</b>) to the laser diode beam splitter (F<b>3</b>) which reflects the laser diode radiation through the excitation field stop (FS), the excitation projection lens group (L<b>2</b>), the excitation/emission dichroic (F<b>4</b>), the stationary objective lens group (L<b>3</b>) and the translating objective lens group (L<b>4</b>) to the flow cell (FC).</p><p id="p-0230" num="0229">As demonstrated by the exemplary embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>42</b></figref>, the imaging device <b>1000</b> can include a beam splitter and a detector, wherein the beam splitter is positioned to direct excitation radiation from an excitation radiation source to the objective lens and to direct emission radiation from the objective to the detector.

For example, any of a variety of radiation sources can be used instead of an LED. Particularly useful radiation sources are arc lamps, lasers, semiconductor light sources (SLSs), or laser diodes. LEDs can be purchased, for example, from Luminus (Billerica, Mass.). Similarly, a variety of detectors are useful including, but not limited to a charge-coupled device (CCD) sensor; photomultiplier tubes (PMT's); or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensor.

A single large heat sink provides a greater degree of heat dissipation than many configurations that use an individual heat sink for each radiation source. However, if desired individual radiation sources can be thermally coupled to individual heat sinks. An advantage of the arrangement of microfluorometers shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>43</b></figref> is the provision of a compact read head. Similar advantages can be derived for embodiments where the relative positions of the excitation source and detector in each microfluorometer are exchanged,</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">A microfluorometer, or read head having several microfluorometers, can be positioned above a flow cell (with respect to gravity's arrow) as exemplified for several embodiments set forth herein. However, it is also possible to position a microfluorometer, or a read head, underneath a flow cell. Accordingly a flow cell can be transparent on the top side, bottom side or both sides with respect to the wavelengths of excitation and emission radiation used. Indeed, in some embodiments it may be desirable to position microfluorometers on both sides of a flow cell or to position read heads on both sides of a flow cell. Other orientations with respect to gravity are also possible, including for example a side to side orientation between a flow cell and microfluorometer (or read head).</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">A microfluorometer or read head can be configured to detect the two opposing, inner surfaces of a flow cell from a single side of the flow cell. For example, the microfluorometer or read head can employ an optical compensator that is inserted and removed to detect alternative surfaces of the flow cell. Exemplary methods and apparatus for detecting opposing inner surfaces of a flow cell such as the use of optical compensators are described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,039,817, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A compensator is optional, for example, depending upon the NA and/or optical resolution of the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">As used herein, the term &#x201c;solid support&#x201d; refers to a rigid substrate that is insoluble in aqueous liquid. The substrate can be non-porous or porous. The substrate can optionally be capable of taking up a liquid (e.g. due to porosity) but will typically be sufficiently rigid that the substrate does not swell substantially when taking up the liquid and does not contract substantially when the liquid is removed by drying. A nonporous solid support is generally impermeable to liquids or gases. Solid supports can optionally be inert to a chemistry that is used to modify a gel. For example, a solid support can be inert to chemistry used to attach analytes, such as nucleic acids, to gels in a method set forth herein. Exemplary solid supports include, but are not limited to, glass and modified or functionalized glass, plastics (including acrylics, polystyrene and copolymers of styrene and other materials, polypropylene, polyethylene, polybutylene, polyurethanes, TeflonTM, cyclic olefins, polyimides etc.), nylon, ceramics, resins, Zeonor, silica or silica-based materials including silicon and modified silicon, carbon, metals, inorganic glasses, optical fiber bundles, and polymers.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">Particular embodiments of the methods and compositions presented herein utilize a solid support having a patterned or structured substrate. The patterned or structured substrate can comprise a patterned gel array, as described in U.S. Ser. No. 13/787,396, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference. In particular embodiments, a structured substrate can be made by patterning a solid support material with wells (e.g. microwells or nanowells), coating the patterned support with a gel material (e.g. PAZAM, SFA or chemically modified variants thereof, such as the azidolyzed version of SFA (azido-SFA)) and polishing the gel coated support, for example via chemical or mechanical polishing, thereby retaining gel in the wells but removing or inactivating substantially all of the gel from the interstitial regions on the surface of the structured substrate between the wells. Primer nucleic acids can be attached to gel material. A solution of target nucleic acids (e.g. a fragmented human genome) can then be contacted with the polished substrate such that individual target nucleic acids will seed individual wells via interactions with primers attached to the gel material; however, the target nucleic acids will not occupy the interstitial regions due to absence or inactivity of the gel material. Amplification of the target nucleic acids will be confined to the wells since absence or inactivity of gel in the interstitial regions prevents outward migration of the growing nucleic acid colony. The process is conveniently manufacturable, being scalable and utilizing conventional micro- or nano-fabrication methods.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">A solid support used in a structured substrate set forth herein can be made from any of a variety of materials set forth herein, for example, above in the definitions, below in the examples or immediately following. A particularly useful material is glass. Other suitable substrate materials may include polymeric materials, plastics, silicon, quartz (fused silica), borofloat glass, silica, silica-based materials, carbon, metals, an optical fiber or optical fiber bundles, sapphire, or plastic materials such as COCs and epoxies. The particular material can be selected based on properties desired for a particular use. For example, materials that are transparent to a desired wavelength of radiation are useful for analytical techniques that will utilize radiation of the desired wavelength, such as one or more of the techniques set forth herein. Conversely, it may be desirable to select a material that does not pass radiation of a certain wavelength (e.g. being opaque, absorptive, or reflective). This can be useful for formation of a mask to be used during manufacture of the structured substrate, such as a method set forth herein; or to be used for a chemical reaction or analytical detection carried out using the structured substrate, such as those set forth herein. Other properties of a material that can be exploited are inertness or reactivity to certain reagents used in a downstream process, such as those set forth herein; or ease of manipulation or low cost during a manufacturing process manufacture, such as those set forth herein. Further examples of materials that can be used in the structured substrates or methods of the present disclosure are described in U.S. Ser. No. 13/661,524 and US Pat. App. Pub.

Exemplary flow cells, methods for their manufacture and methods for their use are described in US Pat. App. Publ. Nos. 2010/0111768 A1 or 2012-0270305 A1; or WO 05/065814, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Flow cells provide a convenient format for housing an array that is produced by the methods of the present disclosure and that is subjected to a sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) or other technique that involves repeated delivery of reagents in cycles (e.g. synthesis techniques or detection techniques having repetitive or cyclic steps). Exemplary detection methods are set forth in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">In some embodiments a flow-cell or other vessel having multiple surfaces is used. Vessels having multiple surfaces can be used such that only a single surface has gel-containing concave features (e.g. wells). Alternatively two or more surfaces present in the vessel can have gel-containing concave features. One or more surfaces of a flow cell can be selectively detected. For example, opposing surfaces in the interior of a flow cell can be selectively addressed with focused radiation using methods known in the art such as confocal techniques. Useful confocal techniques and devices for selectively directing radiation to multiple surfaces of a vessel (e.g. a flow cell) are described, for example, in US Pat. App. Pub. No. 2009/0272914 A1 or U.S. Pat. No. 8,039,817, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">In many embodiments, the interstitial region can be substantially devoid of nanostructures by polishing the solid support, for example via chemical or mechanical polishing, thereby retaining nanostructures in the wells but removing or inactivating substantially all of the nanostructures from the interstitial regions on the surface of the structured substrate between the wells. Mechanical polishing can be carried out by applying abrasive forces to the surface of the solid support. Exemplary methods include abrasion with a slurry of beads, wiping with a sheet or cloth, scraping or the like. It will be understood that beads used for polishing or other uses set forth herein can be, but need not be, spherical. Rather beads can have irregular shapes, polygonal shapes, ovoid shapes, elongated shapes, cylindrical shapes etc. The surface of the beads can be smooth or rough. Any of a variety of particles can be useful as beads for the methods and compositions set forth herein. One example of polishing includes using a lintless (cleanroom grade) wipe coated with a 3 &#x3bc;m silica bead slurry (10% w/v in water) to remove interstitial nanostructures. A polishing wheel/grinder can also be used with this slurry. Mechanical polishing can also be achieved using a fluid jet or gas (e.g. air or inert gas such as Argon or Nitrogen) jet to remove gel from interstitial regions.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">As used herein, the term &#x201c;library,&#x201d; when used in reference to analytes, refers to a collection of analytes having different chemical compositions. Typically, the analytes in a library will be different species having a common feature or characteristic of a genera or class, but otherwise differing in some way. For example, a library can include nucleic acid species that differ in nucleotide sequence, but that are similar with respect to having a sugar-phosphate backbone.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0243">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; and &#x201c;nucleotide&#x201d; are intended to be consistent with their use in the art and to include naturally occurring species or functional analogs thereof. Particularly useful functional analogs of nucleic acids are capable of hybridizing to a nucleic acid in a sequence specific fashion or capable of being used as a template for replication of a particular nucleotide sequence. Naturally occurring nucleic acids generally have a backbone containing phosphodiester bonds. An analog structure can have an alternate backbone linkage including any of a variety of those known in the art. Naturally occurring nucleic acids generally have a deoxyribose sugar (e.g. found in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)) or a ribose sugar (e.g. found in ribonucleic acid (RNA)). A nucleic acid can contain nucleotides having any of a variety of analogs of these sugar moieties that are known in the art. A nucleic acid can include native or non-native nucleotides. In this regard, a native deoxyribonucleic acid can have one or more bases selected from the group consisting of adenine, thymine, cytosine or guanine and a ribonucleic acid can have one or more bases selected from the group consisting of uracil, adenine, cytosine or guanine. Useful non-native bases that can be included in a nucleic acid or nucleotide are known in the art. The terms &#x201c;probe&#x201d; or &#x201c;target,&#x201d; when used in reference to a nucleic acid, are intended as semantic identifiers for the nucleic acid in the context of a method or composition set forth herein and does not necessarily limit the structure or function of the nucleic acid beyond what is otherwise explicitly indicated. The terms &#x201c;probe&#x201d; and &#x201c;target&#x201d; can be similarly applied to other analytes such as proteins, small molecules, cells or the like.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;coat&#x201d; and &#x201c;coating&#x201d; and like terms, when used as a verb, are intended to mean providing a layer or covering on a surface. At least a portion of the surface can be provided with a layer or cover. In some cases the entire surface can be provided with a layer or cover. In alternative cases only a portion of the surface will be provided with a layer or covering. The term &#x201c;coat,&#x201d; when used to describe the relationship between a surface and a material, is intended to mean that the material is present as a layer or cover on the surface. The material can seal the surface, for example, preventing contact of liquid or gas with the surface. However, the material need not form a seal. For example, the material can be porous to liquid, gas, or one or more components carried in a liquid or gas. Exemplary materials that can coat a surface include, but are not limited to, a gel, polymer, organic polymer, liquid, metal, a second surface, plastic, silica, or gas.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">Structured substrates of the present disclosure that contain nucleic acid arrays can be used for any of a variety of purposes. A particularly desirable use for the nucleic acids is to serve as capture probes that hybridize to target nucleic acids having complementary sequences. The target nucleic acids once hybridized to the capture probes can be detected, for example, via a label recruited to the capture probe. Methods for detection of target nucleic acids via hybridization to capture probes are known in the art and include, for example, those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,582,420; 6,890,741; 6,913,884 or 6,355,431 or US Pat. App. Pub. Nos. 2005/0053980 A1; 2009/0186349 A1 or 2005/0181440 A1, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. For example, a label can be recruited to a capture probe by virtue of hybridization of the capture probe to a target probe that bears the label. In another example, a label can be recruited to a capture probe by hybridizing a target probe to the capture probe such that the capture probe can be extended by ligation to a labeled oligonucleotide (e.g. via ligase activity) or by addition of a labeled nucleotide (e.g. via polymerase activity).</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">A nucleic acid array can also be used in a sequencing procedure, such as a sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) technique. Briefly, SBS can be initiated by contacting the target nucleic acids with one or more labeled nucleotides, DNA polymerase, etc. Those features where a primer is extended using the target nucleic acid as template will incorporate a labeled nucleotide that can be detected. Optionally, the labeled nucleotides can further include a reversible termination property that terminates further primer extension once a nucleotide has been added to a primer. For example, a nucleotide analog having a reversible terminator moiety can be added to a primer such that subsequent extension cannot occur until a deblocking agent is delivered to remove the moiety. Thus, for embodiments that use reversible termination, a deblocking reagent can be delivered to the flow cell (before or after detection occurs). Washes can be carried out between the various delivery steps. The cycle can then be repeated n times to extend the primer by n nucleotides, thereby detecting a sequence of length n. Exemplary SBS procedures, fluidic systems and detection platforms that can be readily adapted for use with an array produced by the methods of the present disclosure are described, for example, in Bentley et al., <i>Nature </i>456:53-59 (2008), WO 04/018497; WO 91/06678; WO 07/123744; U.S. Pat.

No. 2008/0108082 A1, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0247">Other sequencing procedures that use cyclic reactions can be used, such as pyrosequencing. Pyrosequencing detects the release of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) as particular nucleotides are incorporated into a nascent nucleic acid strand (Ronaghi, et al., <i>Analytical Biochemistry </i>242(1), 84-9 (1996); Ronaghi, <i>Genome Res. </i>11(1), 3-11 (2001); Ronaghi et al. <i>Science </i>281(5375), 363 (1998); U.S. Pat.

In pyrosequencing, released PPi can be detected by being converted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by ATP sulfurylase, and the resulting ATP can be detected via luciferase-produced photons. Thus, the sequencing reaction can be monitored via a luminescence detection system. Excitation radiation sources used for fluorescence based detection systems are not necessary for pyrosequencing procedures.
