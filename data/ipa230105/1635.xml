a unit configured to reciprocate with respect to the shaping table and including a first supply portion and a second supply portion configured to supply powder, a first layer forming portion and a second layer forming portion configured to form a powder layer on the shaping table using the powder, and at least one head configured to discharge a liquid containing a binder to a shaping region of the three-dimensional shaped object on the powder layer; and a control unit configured to control the unit and the shaping table, in which the unit includes the first supply portion, the first layer forming portion, the head, the second layer forming portion, and the second supply portion in an order from a head side in a forward direction in a reciprocating direction of the unit, and the control unit performs control so as to, when moving the unit in the forward direction when shaping the three-dimensional shaped object, supply the powder from the first supply portion, form the powder layer on the shaping table using the powder by the first layer forming portion, discharge the liquid to the shaping region from the head, and move the shaping table in a direction separating from the unit after discharging the liquid to the shaping region is ended and before the second layer forming portion faces the shaping region, and when moving the unit in a backward direction in the reciprocating direction when shaping the three-dimensional shaped object, supply the powder from the second supply portion, form the powder layer on the shaping table using the powder by the second layer forming portion, discharge the liquid to the shaping region from the head, and move the shaping table in the direction separating from the unit after discharging the liquid to the shaping region is ended and before the first layer forming portion faces the shaping region.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to this aspect, since the first supply portion and the second supply portion, the first layer forming portion and the second layer forming portion, and the head are included in one unit, enlargement in a size of the device can be prevented. In addition, since the supply portions configured to supply the powder, the forming portions configured to form the powder layer, and heads are symmetrical in the reciprocating direction of the unit, a structure of the three-dimensional shaped object can be manufactured in the forward and backward directions, so that the three-dimensional shaped object can be manufactured at a high speed. Further, since the shaping table moves in the direction separating from the unit before the layer forming portion faces the shaping region in the forward and backward directions, contact between the layer forming portion and the structure of the three-dimensional shaped object during the manufacturing can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the three-dimensional shaped object manufacturing device according to a second aspect of the present disclosure according to the first aspect, the binder is a resin cured by applying energy, and the unit includes at least one energy applying portion for curing the binder.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to this aspect, it is possible to firmly bind the powder by using the resin cured by applying the energy.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the three-dimensional shaped object manufacturing device according to a third aspect of the present disclosure according to the second aspect, the head includes a first head provided on a first layer forming portion side in the reciprocating direction and a second head provided on a second layer forming portion side in the reciprocating direction, and the energy applying portion is provided between the first head and the second head in the reciprocating direction.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to this aspect, since the energy applying portion is provided in a symmetrical arrangement in the reciprocating direction of the unit, the energy can be applied in the forward and backward directions. Therefore, the three-dimensional shaped object can be manufactured at a high speed.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the three-dimensional shaped object manufacturing device according to a fourth aspect of the present disclosure according to the second aspect, the energy applying portion includes a first energy applying portion and a second energy applying portion.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to this aspect, since the energy applying portion includes the first energy applying portion and the second energy applying portion, for example, different types of energy can be applied. Therefore, it is possible to particularly effectively apply the energy to the structure of the three-dimensional shaped object when a plurality of binders having different curing properties are used.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the three-dimensional shaped object manufacturing device according to a fifth aspect of the present disclosure according to the first aspect, when an (n+1)th

(n+1)th powder layer in the direction separating from the unit when shaping a three-dimensional shaped object of the n-th layer.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to this aspect, when the (n+1)th powder layer is to be formed after the n-th powder layer is formed on the shaping table, the shaping table is moved by a layer thickness of the (n+1)th powder layer in the direction separating from the unit when shaping the three-dimensional shaped object of the n-th layer, so that it is not necessary to move the shaping table when forming the (n+1)th powder layer, and a movement control of the

aspect, when an (n+1)th powder layer is to be formed after an n-th powder layer is formed on the shaping table with n being a natural number, the control unit controls the shaping table to move by more than a layer thickness of the (n+1)th powder layer in the direction separating from the unit when shaping a three-dimensional shaped object of the n-th layer.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to this aspect, when the (n+1)th powder layer is to be formed after the n-th powder layer is formed on the shaping table, the shaping table is moved by a distance longer than the layer thickness of the (n+1)th powder layer in the direction separating from the unit when shaping the three-dimensional shaped object of the n-th layer, so that a distance between the structure and the layer forming portion in the shaping surface moving direction can be increased, and the contact between the layer forming portion and the structure of the three-dimensional shaped object during the manufacturing can be particularly effectively prevented.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the three-dimensional shaped object manufacturing device according to a seventh aspect of the present

the three-dimensional shaped object, rotate the second layer forming portion such that a shaping table side of the second layer forming portion faces a head side in the backward direction.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to this aspect, the first layer forming portion and the second layer forming portion can be easily configured with the rollers, and by rotating the roller such that the shaping table side of the roller faces the head side in the moving direction of the unit, the powder layer can be formed with high accuracy.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the three-dimensional shaped object manufacturing device according to an eighth aspect of the present disclosure according to the first aspect, an interval between the first layer forming portion and the head in the reciprocating direction and an interval between the second layer forming portion and the head in the reciprocating direction are adjustable.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to this aspect, since the interval between the first layer forming portion and the head in the reciprocating direction and the interval between the second layer forming portion and the head in the reciprocating direction are adjustable, the interval between the first layer forming portion and the head in the reciprocating direction and the interval between the second layer forming portion and the head in the
