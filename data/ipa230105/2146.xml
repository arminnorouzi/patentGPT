Current systems use a plastic sheet located between the pallet and a stack of packages of perishables and a plastic bag positioned over the stacked packages of perishables. Tape is used to seal the plastic bag to the plastic sheet. Prior to or after tape sealing the plastic bag and plastic sheet, desired quantities of one or more gasses may be injected into the plastic bag, creating a modified atmosphere, which benefits the enclosed perishables. The tape seal may result in bunching of the plastic bag and/or plastic sheet at the tape seal which forms air channels from the modified atmosphere interior through the taped seal. The air channels allow the injected gas of the modified atmosphere to escape into the outside atmosphere and/or the outside atmosphere to seep into the bag at an undesirable and uncontrolled rate. Gas escaping or entering the enclosed bag in an uncontrolled manner is undesirable because it leads to loss of freshness or total loss of the perishables. The use of tape is additionally undesirable because it requires labor to apply and remove, and further results in additional wasted material used to seal the plastic bag to the plastic sheet.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, there is a need to provide a more secure and reliable seal for the plastic bag and plastic sheet in order to provide a more consistent atmosphere in the pallet bag and reduce the number of pallets that have an out of specification atmosphere.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present technology relates to providing a secure and reliable seal for a plastic bag used to define a modified atmosphere for a pallet of perishables. For example, the plastic bag may be a TransFRESH modified atmosphere package. The disclosed technology reduces atmosphere failures and aids in providing a more consistent atmosphere in the pallet bag system thus reducing the number of pallets that have an out of specification atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect of the present disclosure a method for sealing containers of perishables on a pallet between a plastic sheet and a plastic bag is described. The plastic bag is positioned over the containers and the plastic sheet is positioned between the containers and the pallet with margins of the plastic sheet folded to overlap margins of the plastic bag in an overlap area. The method involves applying one or more heated sealing heads to the overlap area in order to transfer heat to the plastic sheet and the plastic bag in the overlap area to weld the plastic sheet to the plastic bag around an entire perimeter of the pallet. The one or more heated sealing head includes a plurality of heated bar assemblies.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In many embodiments, each heated bar assembly includes a heated bar and one or more actuators. Accordingly, applying the one or more heated sealing head involves positioning, with the one or more actuators, each heated bar to be in contact with the overlap area in order to transfer heat to the plastic sheet and the plastic bag in the overlap area to weld the plastic sheet to the plastic bag around the entire perimeter of the pallet.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In many embodiments, the plurality of heated bar assemblies includes a first set of two heated bar assemblies and a second set of two heated bar assemblies. Accordingly, applying the one or more heated sealing heads comprises forming a left seal and a right seal by welding the plastic sheet to the plastic bag on left and right sides of the pallet with the first set of heated bar assemblies and forming a front seal and a rear seal by welding the plastic sheet to the plastic bag on front and rear sides of the pallet with the second set of heated bar assemblies in order to form a seal around the entire perimeter of the pallet. The first set of heated bar assemblies are positioned at a height above the second set of heated bar assemblies.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The method further involves transferring, via a conveyor, the pallet to a pallet receiving surface. The first set of heated bar assemblies is positioned above the conveyor and the second set of heated bar assemblies is located below the conveyor. The method can further involve raising or lowering, via a conveyor lift, the pallet between a raised position for using the first set of heated bar assemblies to form a seal and a lowered position for using the second set of heated bar assemblies to form a seal. For example, the conveyor lift includes a scissor lift.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In many embodiments, the heated bar includes a flat rectangular outer surface or a curved shaped outer surface that contacts the overlap area to weld the plastic bag to the plastic sheet. The heated bar includes a grooved outer surface that contacts the overlap area to weld the plastic bag to the plastic sheet. The grooved outer surface creates a plurality of seal bands.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another aspect of the present disclosure a sealing head for sealing containers of perishables on a pallet between a plastic sheet and a plastic bag is described. The sealing head includes a plurality of heated bar assemblies to transfer heat to the plastic sheet and the plastic bag in an overlap area to weld the plastic sheet to the plastic bag around an entire perimeter of a pallet.

The heat rollers <b>208</b> may have a generally round perimeter around the outer surface of the heat roller <b>208</b>. The heat rollers <b>204</b> may be between 8&#x2033; and 12&#x2033; in diameter, but may be larger or smaller. In embodiments, the outer surfaces <b>302</b> may be substantially cylindrical for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>, the cylindrical outer surface <b>302</b> comprises walls that are parallel to the axis of rotation of the roller axle <b>204</b> that the heat roller <b>208</b> is coupled to.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In embodiments, the profile of the heat rollers <b>204</b> may be curved so that the outer surface <b>302</b> forms a curve toroid, also referred to as a donut shaped outer surface, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>. Curved toroid outer surfaces <b>302</b> have the advantage of concentrating pressure and heat toward the equatorial portion of the outer surface <b>302</b> of the heat rollers <b>208</b> in order to transfer heat over a vertical area to cause the plastic of the bag and sheet to seal together across a vertical width. The curved toroid outer surface <b>302</b> also allows the roller to conform to uneven and/or yielding underlying surfaces of perishable containers so that the contacting surface area of the heat roller <b>208</b> increases to include portions of the outer surface <b>302</b> above and below the equatorial portion when these uneven and/or yielding underlying surfaces are encountered. The seal band formed by the toroid profile roller may therefore have a non-uniform vertical width around the perimeter of the plastic bag/sheet.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition to the overall profile of the outer surfaces <b>302</b> of the heat rollers <b>208</b>, the outer surfaces <b>302</b> may have additional surface characteristics.

The grooves <b>304</b> may be rectangular trenches defining cylindrical surface bands <b>306</b> around the outer periphery of the outer surface <b>302</b>. In use, the cylindrical surface bands may each form a distinct seal band around the plastic bag/sheet, with un-sealed bands between the seal bands defined where the trenches travel over the plastic bag/sheet. Multiple seal bands have the advantage of redundancy if one of the seal bands fails.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In embodiments, the heat rollers <b>208</b> are made of a material with a high thermal conductively, for example a metal, in order to transfer heat to seal the plastic bag and the plastic sheet together. The heat roller may <b>208</b> be cast, machined, assembled from multiple pieces, or any combination of these or other manufacturing techniques. The heat roller <b>208</b> may be made for example of aluminum, steel, brass or copper.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">When sealing a plastic bag to a plastic sheet, the outer surface <b>302</b> of the heat roller <b>208</b> may directly contact the plastic bags or sheets that are being sealed. The portions of the outer surface <b>302</b> that contact the plastic material may have a smooth surface, such as a machined metal surface. In embodiments, the outer surface <b>302</b> that contacts the plastic material may have a textured or patterned surface. For example a patterned surface may have dimples with a diameter of less than 2 mm, or a pattern of crisscrossed grooves less than 2 mm deep. The patterned surface may give the heat roller traction so that the heat roller rolls along the plastic to be sealed as opposed to sliding without the heat roller <b>208</b> rolling.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In embodiments, the outer surface <b>302</b> of the heat rollers <b>208</b> may comprise a coating or outer layer of a polymer material. For example, the outer surface <b>302</b> may comprise a layer of Teflon sheet/tape on top of an underlying metal surface of the heat roller. For example, the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-C</figref>, <b>4</b>A-C, and <b>5</b>A-C may have a Teflon tape outer coating. In embodiments, the coating may be sprayed on, such as a paint. The outer layer may provide a smooth non-stick surface to prevent the softened plastic of the bag and/or sheet from sticking to the heat roller <b>208</b> and/or provide a degree of resilience/give to ensure that the heat roller <b>208</b> is continuously pressed against and contacting the underlying plastic bag or sheet while sealing.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, a heat roller <b>208</b> includes an axle sleeve <b>308</b> extending through the center of the heat roller <b>208</b>.

For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>D-<b>5</b>F</figref> show in an embodiment of a heat roller <b>208</b> including spokes <b>501</b>. The hollow portions, for example between the spokes <b>501</b>, may reduce the cost of materials and may make the heat roller have a lower moment of inertia so that the heat roller more readily freely rotates when acted upon by the outside force. Further, the voids reduce heat transfer from the perimeter to the hub of the heat roller so that input heat energy is not wasted by heating bodies other than the outer surface <b>302</b> of the heat roller.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In embodiments, the heat rollers <b>208</b> are coupled to the roller axle <b>204</b> with heat insulating bearings positioned within the axle sleeve <b>308</b> between the heat roller <b>208</b> and the roller axle <b>204</b>. In embodiments, the roller axles <b>204</b> are made of a material, with a low heat conductivity, for example Polyether ether ketone (PEEK). The heat insulating bearings and low thermal conductivity roller axle <b>204</b> create a more consistent control of the temperature of the outer surfaces <b>302</b> of the heat rollers <b>208</b> by preventing the transfer of heat to the other metal components of the sealing head <b>102</b> or arm <b>104</b> which would result in heat dissipating and being wasted to the environment, which may be a refrigerated environment, e.g. 0 degrees Celsius, where a lowered temperature is kept to preserve freshness of the perishables being loaded onto the pallet.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in the top views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>4</b>A and <b>5</b>A</figref> each heat roller <b>208</b> may define a plurality of cavities <b>310</b> to receive heating elements <b>210</b>.

The depth of the cavities <b>310</b> extends past the equatorial plane of the heat roller <b>208</b> so that the portions of the outer surface <b>302</b> above and below the equatorial portion receive heat from the heating elements <b>201</b>. The cavities <b>310</b> may be evenly spaced around the perimeter of the heat roller <b>208</b> to create a substantially uniform outer surface <b>302</b> temperature profile.

For example a patterned surface may have dimples with a diameter of less than 2 mm, or a pattern of crisscrossed grooves less than 2 mm deep.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In embodiments, the outer surface of the heat bars may comprise a coating or outer layer of a polymer material. For example, the outer surface may comprise a layer of Teflon sheet/tape on top of an underlying metal surface of the heat bar. In embodiments, the coating may be sprayed on, such as a paint. The outer layer may provide a smooth non-stick surface to prevent the softened plastic of the bag and/or sheet from sticking to the heat bar and/or provide a degree of resilience/give to ensure that the heat bar is pressed against and contacting the entire width of the underlying plastic bag or sheet while sealing.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Each heat bar may define a plurality of cavities to receive heating elements, as discussed above relating to the heat rollers. The cavities may be cylindrical with a bottom surface, as shown in the cross-sectional views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A, <b>11</b>B, and <b>11</b>C</figref>. The cavities may be evenly spaced along the length of the heat bar to create a substantially uniform outer surface temperature profile.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Methods of Use</heading><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Embodiments of the heat sealing apparatus <b>100</b> and <b>900</b> as disclosed above may be in a pallet bagging line. Bagging lines may include a plurality of stations/modules for example to load the pallet, place the plastic sheet, fold the plastic sheet, place the bag on the load, seal the plastic bag to the plastic sheet, and deliver a modified atmosphere into the bag. Example of stations/modules are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 4,821,489 to Macleod et al, U.S. Pat. No. 7,770,366 to Macleod et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,014,495 to Bolejack et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,046,302 to Bolejack et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,111,639 to Bolejack et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,286 to Bolejack et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,532,717 to Forgnone, and U.S. PgPub US2005/0183397A1 to Forgnone, each of which are incorporated in their entireties.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Each of the stations may be connected to a control system for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>12</b></figref> that is also connected to other sensors and actuators as described above. For example as shown, the controller <b>1201</b> may be coupled to a conveyor system <b>602</b>, position sensors <b>603</b>, an arm actuator system <b>604</b>, turntable actuators <b>605</b>, heating elements <b>606</b>, temperature sensors <b>607</b>, actuators <b>908</b>, vertical actuators <b>910</b> and/or other stations <b>608</b></p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Placing Sheet Under Pallet</heading><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Prior to or after a load of containers of perishables is placed on a pallet, a plastic sheet may be positioned on a pallet so that a plastic sheet is present between the load and the pallet. For example, a pallet bearing a plurality of containers of fresh perishables may be placed on a conveyor. A lifting device may squeeze and lift the load apart from the pallet and a plastic sheet may be automatically inserted onto the pallet in the gap created above the pallet and below the suspended load. The plastic sheet is larger than the pallet with margins extending beyond the edges of the pallet on all sides. The margins may be 6 inches or greater. The plastic sheet and the plastic bag may be made of polymers, specifically thermoplastics capable of being welded together, for example Low-density polyethylene.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">After the sheet is in place, and the containers of perishables are positioned atop the pallet and sheet and the resulting pallet unit is conveyed to the next station in the bagging line. For example the next station may be a bagging station or an optional sheet folding station.</p><heading id="h-0018" level="2">Sheet Folding Station</heading><p id="p-0079" num="0078">A folding station may be used to automatically position and fold the overhanging margins of the bottom sheet upwards, against the sides of the perishables containers atop the pallet. At the folding station, a folder system may sense the presence of a load bearing pallet, and activates a corner fold-forming system that folds the margins of the pallet sheet upwardly against the load at all four corners of the pallet. The system may then heat seal each corner fold, simultaneously or sequentially, in order for the plastic sheet to a rectangular open topped vessel. Alternatively, the folded corners may be held in place physically or by air as the bag is lowered over the load.</p><heading id="h-0019" level="2">Bagging Station</heading><p id="p-0080" num="0079">With the lower sheet in place, the pallet may be bagged. At a bagging station, a plastic bag may be applied from above the palletized unit. The bag may be stretched over, and then down the exterior surfaces of the stacked unit. Once the stretched film is released, the film, which forms a bag, may be effectively pulled tightly against the exterior surfaces of the pallet units. Tension of the stretched bag against the pallet unit surfaces may brace and stabilize the palletized unit.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The system may then hold the plastic sheet margins in a vertical position while the bag is descended to overlap and capture the sheet margins, or the plastic sheet margins may be folded and heat sealed in a vertical position as disclosed above.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The bag opening may be positioned above the plane of the pallet bottom surface, leaving a portion (e.g., two inches) of the vertically positioned bottom sheet exposed. The bag overlaps the remaining portions of the bottom sheet. The elasticity of the bag may hold the folded sheet margins in place under the bag. If the corners are not heat sealed, the system holding the sheet margins upwards may be withdrawn or cycled off once the bag is in place.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Alternatively, the system may be configured to stretch and place the bag over the palletized load, and the margins of the bottom sheet may then be folded or otherwise placed upwardly outside the margins of the bag/enclosure. In both cases, an overlap area of the bag and sheet is formed around the entire perimeter of the palletized load.</p><heading id="h-0020" level="2">Heat Sealing Station</heading><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Once bagged, the bagged pallet may then be conveyed to a heat sealing apparatus <b>100</b> or <b>900</b>, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D and <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>E</figref> disclosed above.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">For example, in embodiments the bagged pallet may be conveyed on the conveyor system to be centered on the turntable of the heat sealing apparatus or may be conveyer on the conveyor system onto the pallet receiving surface <b>911</b>. The heat sealing apparatus may be used to form a seal on the overlap between the plastic sheet and plastic bag around the entire perimeter of the palletized load in order to provide a seal for the modified atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">As disclosed above, the plastic bag and plastic sheet overlap to form an overlap area around the entire perimeter of the palletized load. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> shows a portion of a palletized load of a plurality of containers of perishables <b>701</b> on a pallet <b>700</b>.

From the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, the arm actuator <b>108</b> causes the arm <b>104</b> to rotate so that the sealing head <b>102</b> contacts the overlap of the plastic sheet and plastic bag over the loaded pallet <b>110</b>. Since the sealing head <b>102</b> is freely rotatably coupled to the arm <b>104</b> the sealing head <b>102</b> rotates so that both heat rollers <b>208</b> contact the palletized load <b>110</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>. From the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, the turntable <b>106</b> is rotated to cause the palletized load <b>110</b> to rotate relative to the sealing head <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>. The controller <b>601</b> controls the angular position and/or the pressure/force/torque of the arm <b>104</b> so that the sealing head <b>102</b> distance relative to the axis of rotation of the turntable <b>106</b> is adjusted in order to maintain contact with the palletized load <b>110</b>. The controller <b>601</b> may be connected to various sensors to determine the position of the sealing head <b>102</b>, the position of the palletized load <b>110</b>, the position and/or rotation of the heat rollers <b>208</b>, the position of the turntable <b>106</b>, and the position of the arm <b>104</b>.

The controller <b>601</b> may further be connected to sensors used to determine the force/pressure/torque on the heat rollers <b>208</b>, arm <b>104</b>, and/or arm actuator <b>108</b>, for example strain gauges. The controller <b>601</b> may control the rotation of the turntable <b>106</b> and the rotation of the arm <b>104</b> based on a preset routine based on the size and shape of the palletize load <b>110</b>.

The freely rotatable connection of the sealing head <b>102</b> to the arm <b>104</b>, the optional airbag, and the routine the controller <b>601</b> uses to actuate of the arm actuator system rotating the arm <b>104</b> toward the load cause the two heat rollers <b>208</b> to both maintain contact with the load <b>110</b> as the heat rollers <b>208</b> pass the corner as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>E and <b>8</b>F</figref>. Once the corner is passed by both heat rollers <b>208</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>G</figref>, the turntable <b>106</b> continues to rotate to cause both heat rollers <b>208</b> to roll along the second side of the load <b>110</b> to continue forming a seal band on the overlap area <b>704</b> of the plastic bag <b>703</b> and plastic sheet <b>702</b>.

Gas delivery nozzles for creating a modified atmosphere environment may be placed inside the bag, for example positioned under each corner of the bag. When activated, these nozzles deliver appropriate quantities of one or more gasses inside the bag to form a desired modified atmosphere. In embodiments, the bag is perforated with a gas injector, and one or more gasses are injected into the bag. The nature and quantity of these gasses may be based upon the height and weight of the palletized perishables, which the system may measure, and upon the nature of the perishables, and may be computed, by a computer or otherwise, for example from a look-up table that uses the weight, height and nature of perishable data to determine the nature and quantity of gases to inject.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">After being heat sealed, the modified atmosphere does not leave the bag through the airtight heat seal. This is advantageous compared to previous technologies which included taping the margins, because taped margins are prone to leaking. Accordingly, with heat sealed margins all permeability of the sealed bag is based on the selectable permeability of the bag and does not need to factor in leakage of the seal of the margins. Therefore, with a heat seal the permeability can be tailored to a specific perishable item. To tailor the permeability of the sealed bag, the type and weight of the perishables is be determined. By weighing each pallet, the respiration load of the perishable inside the enclosed bag can be determined. Based on this data, a system for punching or cutting calibrated holes in the pallet bag, forms one or more appropriate openings in the bag, and/or an appropriate hole such that a breathing membrane or label may be placed over such a hole. The size of hole and type of label varies with the type/variety and weight of the perishables item, and with the gas permeability of the bag. The breathing labels and/or calibrated holes help to maintain a desired controlled or modified atmosphere inside a bag, by balancing the desired components, e.g., carbon dioxide and oxygen, with the film permeability and perishable respiration load.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="2">Offload Station</heading><p id="p-0097" num="0096">After the palletized load is bag, sealed, and gasified with a modified atmosphere, the conveyor system may convey the palletized load to an offload station for delivery elsewhere.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">The various aspects, embodiments, implementations or features of the described embodiments can be used separately or in any combination.
