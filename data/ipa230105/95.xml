However, live lobster is an expensive, extremely-perishable, and labor-intensive luxury item that has not been suited to home cooking and can be difficult to cook for the average home chef.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some manufacturers fully cook lobsters (e.g., by steaming or sous-vide cooking) and then freeze or refrigerate and package the cooked lobsters, to provide a long shelf life and eliminate the requirement for consumers to cook the lobster at home. However, these fully-cooked lobsters are typically brined, often resulting in an overly salty or rubbery product. Or, due to sous-vide cooking methods, these lobsters are cooked at such a low temperature that the texture does not resemble that of a typical fresh-cooked lobster.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Alternatively, to improve the home cooking experience for consumers, some manufacturers sell whole lobster that has been blanched, i.e., partially cooked, prior to freezing and packaging. However, the blanching process cooks the juices out of the lobster and reduces its flavor, in like manner to boiling chicken.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Consumers can buy raw frozen lobster tails that the consumer thaws before cooking, but the thawing process causes loss of moisture and juices. Additionally, manufacturers use additives to keep these lobster tails plump, and these additives cause chemical reactions that tend to make sauces that these lobster tails are cooked in watery.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other manufacturers sell lobster with meat that has been fully or partially loosened from the shell using high-pressure air or water, prior to freezing and packaging, so that the meat easily separates from the shell after cooking. However, the high pressure used to extract the lobster meat tends to degrade the texture and quality of the meat.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Consumers expect that cooking lobster in a microwave would result in tough, rubbery, and inedible lobster, which is the result normally obtained when attempting to cook raw lobster in a microwave. There has previously been no way for a consumer to cook raw lobster at home, in a single step, in a way that results in a tender, juicy, delicious, ready-to-eat product, with its own sauce, in a matter of minutes.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the invention provide solutions to the foregoing problems and additional benefits, by providing a way for an ordinary consumer with a microwave to enjoy lobster tail at home and a processing and cooking method for fresh-frozen lobster that is quick, neat, easy, labor-reduced, waste-reduced, self-contained, and results in a perfectly-cooked, ready-to-eat lobster product that tastes the same as if cooked from live in a conventional manner.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, the present invention provides a minimally-processed microwaveable lobster product including a lobster tail, a fat-containing composition, and a microwaveable package.

Instead, embodiments of the invention use fresh-frozen lobster designed to be cooked in the microwave while still frozen, to avoid this problem. The lobster is cooked from frozen inside microwaveable packaging, along with a fat-containing composition. In some embodiments, various herbs, spices, seasonings, and flavorings are included in the fat-containing composition to form a sauce that combines the juices of the lobster with these other elements. The sauce is created while the lobster tail cooks inside the packaging. The flavors can be customized, and since the lobster is cooked together with the fat, the combination of lobster juice and sauce forms an integrated lobster-and-sauce product, with no loss of juices or flavor. The natural juices from the raw lobster are captured and infused into the sauce, and the sauce is created as the lobster cooks, rather than after the lobster cooks.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Embodiments of the invention provide a new type of minimally-processed product for the lobster industry for an entire new market, creating new demand, and increasing revenue for lobstermen and seafood companies, while decreasing transportation and storage costs. Embodiments of the invention eliminate the problem of attempting to provide live lobsters that often die during transport or at some other point before cooking. Additionally, live lobsters held in a tank lose weight over time, and embodiments of the invention avoid this problem by fresh-freezing lobster tails instead of storing live lobsters in a tank.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Conventional processing of lobster for preparation by the home consumer involves the use of considerable amounts of sodium. Although a certain amount of sodium is naturally present in shellfish, the presence of an excess amount of sodium in shellfish normally does not interfere with home cooking, such as when shellfish is boiled, baked, fried, grilled, or the like.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">However, when shellfish is cooked in a microwave oven, an abundance of sodium can be problematic. Microwave ovens cook food primarily by reversing the polarity of water molecules in food each millisecond, thereby creating friction that cooks the food as the water molecules essentially act as fuel sources. Although protein, fat, and starch molecules also absorb microwave energy to a lesser degree, salt molecules tend to break apart in the presence of water. When this occurs, sodium and chlorine ions create heat by colliding in the rapidly-oscillating electromagnetic field, leaving less microwave energy available to cook the center of the food. A result of this phenomenon can be seen with a refrigerated bowl of soup placed in a microwave for reheating. The soup near the outside of the bowl encounters the microwave energy first, heats rapidly, and appears to boil. However, the center of the soup is still cold, because the salt ions around the outside of the bowl absorb sufficient energy to produce localized boiling before the rest of the soup can even absorb sufficient energy to begin heating.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">When shellfish containing too much sodium is cooked in a microwave, the meat becomes mushy due to the breakdown of the protein structure caused by the abundance of sodium ions. For this reason, shellfish treated with sodium tripolyphosphates (STPPs), shellfish that has been brined, and shellfish that contains too much sodium for any other reason is not suitable for microwave cooking. Accordingly, conventional lobster products, which are mostly brined and treated with STPPs, are unsuitable for use in connection with microwave cooking.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is therefore desirable that no brining steps be included during the flash-freezing process, nor in any other part of the process of manufacturing a microwaveable frozen lobster tail product consistent with embodiments of the invention. This is because brine is a salt-based solution, and an abundance of salt ions interferes with microwave cooking.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">For similar reasons, lobster treated with STPPs or other sodium salts should also desirably not be used in any part of the process of manufacturing a microwaveable frozen lobster tail product consistent with embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">For similar reasons, any fat-containing composition used in a lobster product consistent with embodiments of the invention should desirably contain little or no salt. For example, if butter is used as a fat-containing composition, then the butter should desirably be unsalted butter, or composed primarily of unsalted butter, i.e., unsalted butter with only a small amount of salt added for taste, e.g., a concentration of 95% unsalted butter or higher.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">While normal processing of lobster includes brine and STPPs, minimal processing of lobster according to embodiments of the invention does not include steps of brining or the use of STPPs.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Avoiding the use of brine, STPPs, and/or fat-containing compositions that contain salt ions therefore promotes evenness of cooking when the lobster tail is cooked in the microwave.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Embodiments of the invention provide processes for manufacturing and cooking a lobster tail, as well as lobster-tail products manufactured and cooked according to such processes.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">With reference to the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and the views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, an exemplary method <b>100</b> for manufacturing a minimally-processed microwaveable frozen lobster tail product consistent with a first exemplary embodiment of the invention will now be described.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">First, at step <b>101</b>, a fresh lobster is caught. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, at step <b>102</b>, a lobster tail section <b>200</b> with the shell intact, weighing approximately 3.75 to 4 ounces (106 to 113 grams), is separated from the body of the lobster.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, at step <b>103</b>, a cut <b>201</b> is made in at least a portion of the shell of the lobster tail, to split the shell lengthwise. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows that a split is made only along the top surface of the lobster tail, one or more cuts lengthwise may be made along the top and/or bottom surfaces of the tail to split the shell. In alternative embodiments, the shell and its contents may be partially or entirely split in half lengthwise, or otherwise cut into strips or sections, or the shell could be pierced with holes or perforated. Splitting or cutting the shell makes the lobster tail easier to eat and also results in the lobster meat cooking in a sauce that will be created during the cooking process, as will be explained in further detail below, which imparts additional moisture into the meat.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, at an optional step <b>104</b>, after the shell has been split, the lobster meat <b>202</b> is pulled up through the cut <b>201</b> in the shell of the lobster tail, so that a portion of the meat <b>202</b> is exposed outside of the shell.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, at step <b>105</b>, a solid or semi-solid composition <b>203</b> containing a fat adapted to liquefy during cooking, such as 1 ounce (28 grams) of butter or compound composed of mostly butter, is placed above the lobster tail. In one embodiment, the fat-containing composition is disposed above or near an exposed portion of lobster meat, so that the liquid will trickle directly onto the meat as it liquefies during cooking. The fat-containing composition may further contain herbs, spices, seasonings, and other flavorings that will be infused into the lobster meat during cooking.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">At step <b>106</b>, the lobster tail and fat-containing composition are flash-frozen. Flash freezing (or &#x201c;blast freezing&#x201d;) freezes the lobster tail quickly by subjecting it to cryogenic temperatures, e.g., well below the 32&#xb0; F. (or 0&#xb0; C.) melting point of water, causing the water inside the lobster tail to freeze in a very short period without forming large crystals, thus avoiding damage to sensitive cell membranes.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">At step <b>107</b>, the frozen lobster tail and fat-containing composition are placed in a two-piece microwaveable thermoform pouch, such as the exemplary pouch <b>600</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. Pouch <b>600</b> is formed from two layers of resilient material that is strong enough to prevent being pierced by the lobster shell, and it is specifically noted that the lobster tail does not rest on any kind of rigid carrier or pallet within pouch <b>600</b>. Additionally, the top resilient layer of pouch <b>600</b> directly contacts the fat-containing composition, which remains above the lobster tail the lobster tail is cooked. In this manner, both the top and bottom resilient layers of pouch <b>600</b> make direct contact with the lobster tail, and there is no risk of interference caused by any additional rigid carrier or pallet layer during the cooking process. An additional cost savings is achieved by not having to use an additional rigid carrier layer or tray to hold the lobster tail within pouch <b>600</b>. At step <b>108</b>, the contents of the pouch are vacuum-packed, resulting in product <b>700</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, which is ready for (optional) additional packaging, and then labeling and transport to a retail supply chain.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The home consumer purchases a unit at retail that contains product <b>700</b> and brings it home. To cook the lobster tail, the consumer pierces product <b>700</b> with the tip of a knife (e.g., at the location of the fat-containing composition) for ventilation, then inserts product <b>700</b> into a standard microwave oven, shell-side down, and cooks it at a power of 800 watts for approximately 2 minutes and 30 seconds, at an internal temperature of 184&#xb0; F. (84.4&#xb0; C.). At higher wattages, small downward adjustments in cooking times are made. During the cooking process, the frozen lobster tail defrosts and gently poaches in the microwaveable pouch to fully cook, while the fat-containing composition liquefies and forms a sauce that combines with the lobster meat to create a tender and juicy ready-to-eat lobster tail. While many methods of cooking raw lobster tail, such as grilling, result in the cooked lobster tail sticking to the shell, an advantageous and convenient result of microwave-cooking a lobster tail is that the lobster meat separates easily from the shell, in a single piece.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a microwaveable frozen lobster tail product <b>800</b> consistent with a second exemplary embodiment of the invention. As shown, product <b>800</b> is similar to product <b>700</b>, except that product <b>800</b> employs a lobster tail <b>802</b> weighing approximately 2.25 to 3 ounces (64 to 85 grams) with its shell fully removed. A fat-containing composition <b>803</b> is disposed above the shelled lobster tail <b>802</b>, either before or after flash-freezing, and the lobster tail <b>802</b> and fat-containing composition <b>803</b> are vacuum-packed into a two-piece microwaveable pouch <b>801</b> adapted to vent during cooking. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a whole lobster tail in a package, a shelled lobster tail may be cut into two or more pieces prior to packaging in some embodiments. To cook the lobster tail, the home consumer inserts product <b>800</b> into a standard microwave oven, with the underside of the tail desirably facing up, and cooks it at a power of 800 watts for approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds, at an internal temperature of 184&#xb0; F. (84.4&#xb0; C.). At higher wattages, small downward adjustments in cooking times are made.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows a microwaveable frozen lobster tail product <b>900</b> consistent with a third exemplary embodiment of the invention. As shown, product <b>900</b> is similar to product <b>800</b>, except that product <b>900</b> employs two lobster tails <b>902</b> with their shells fully removed, packed together in a single two-piece microwaveable pouch <b>901</b>. A single portion of fat-containing composition <b>903</b> is disposed centrally above and located between the two lobster tails <b>902</b>, either before or after flash-freezing, and the lobster tails <b>902</b> and fat-containing composition <b>903</b> are vacuum-packed into the pouch <b>901</b>. This arrangement permits the use of a single portion of fat-containing composition with multiple lobster tails. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows lobster tails <b>902</b> with their shells fully removed, this arrangement can also be used with lobster tails that are still in their shells. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows only two lobster tails packaged together, it should be understood that more than two lobster tails could be packaged together, in alternative embodiments of the invention. However, it has been found that a total weight of lobster not exceeding 8 ounces (or 226 grams) in a single microwaveable package is desirable in order to consistently produce a high-quality product when cooked. Accordingly, in one embodiment, four 2-ounce (57 gram) lobster tails are desirably disposed in a single microwaveable package. In another embodiment, two 3-ounce (85 gram) lobster tails are desirably disposed in a single microwaveable package.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is desirable that a ratio of approximately 1 ounce (28 grams) of fat-containing composition be used either per 3-ounce (85-gram) lobster tail, or for every 3 ounces (85 grams) of lobster meat, and that the amount of fat-containing composition be increased or decreased appropriately to suit the amount of lobster meat used. The fat-containing composition is desirably placed on the flesh side of the lobster tail.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the fat-containing composition is added after the lobster tail is flash-frozen instead of the fat-containing composition being flash-frozen along with the lobster tail.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, a fat-containing liquid may be used, instead of a fat-containing solid or semi-solid adapted to liquefy during cooking. In this scenario, the lobster may absorb the liquid so as to marinate before being flash-frozen, whereby the infusion of fat into the lobster is similar to the process that takes place while marinating a piece of raw chicken or other meat.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, the packaging is vented and includes one or more seams adapted to vent at a predetermined temperature and/or pressure. Alternatively, the packaging may be fully sealed, and the consumer may be directed to pierce, slit, or otherwise vent the packaging prior to microwave cooking. In other embodiments, non-vented packaging is used, in which case bursting a seam is not likely to affect doneness. However, the user is directed to avoid a mess in this instance by placing the package on a plate or bowl during cooking.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">It is desirable that no water glaze be included during the flash-freezing process, nor in any other part of the process of manufacturing a microwaveable frozen lobster tail product consistent with embodiments of the invention. This is because water glaze tends to produce a waterlogged sauce and a lobster with a significant reduction in lobster flavor. Further, water glazing increases the price of lobster meat to the consumer, due to the addition of unnecessary water weight.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Variables that may affect microwave cooking time for the packaged lobster tail meat include, e.g., microwave oven wattage, preparation of the lobster tail (shell on/shelled; whole/cut into pieces; etc.), lobster tail size and weight, contents of the fat-containing composition, type of microwavable packaging and ventilation scheme employed, and the like.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The lobster tail product can be adapted by a manufacturer for specific applications. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, in a fourth exemplary embodiment, the lobster tail product is pre-combined with specific flavorings in the thermoform packaging to make a one-step microwaveable filling <b>1000</b> for a gourd <b>1001</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The tails of either soft-shell lobsters or hard-shell lobsters may be used, in different embodiments of the invention. Soft-shell lobster tails are relatively easier to use in conjunction with thermoform packaging, because the incidence and risk of piercing the packaging is reduced relative to hard-shell lobster tails, which have hard edges and may require repackaging after piercing. Additionally, the use of smaller lobster tails (e.g., up to 8 ounces (or 226 grams) for soft shells in summer, and up to 4.5 oz (or 113 grams) for hard shells in winter) is desirable because the shells are softer relative to larger lobster tails. Additionally, soft-shell lobsters are juicier due to a higher water content and tend to produce a more tender final product. It is also desirable that tails of the North American Lobster (<i>Homarus americanus</i>) be used in embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">A product consistent with embodiments of the invention has numerous advantages, including the following. There is a savings in labor, both in terms of eliminating the need to keep lobster alive and properly conditioned, and reducing kitchen preparation time and effort. The cooked lobster tail product has a restaurant-quality consistency and texture and a quality flavor. There is no need to dip the cooked lobster in sauce, because the lobster emerges from the cooking process already combined with the sauce. Lobster out of the shell and split tails in the shell can expand during cooking without the restrictions that would occur if the lobster were completely enclosed by the shell. The lobster meat plumps and is better able to absorb the accompanying fat and additional flavoring when cooking from frozen.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Embodiments of the invention are suitable for the home cook who wants to have perfectly-cooked lobster as part of a meal in a short amount of time, without the mess, investment in additional ingredients and tools, time and money associated with conventional lobster cooking, and further providing the benefit of marrying a sauce with the lobster, using the lobster's original juices. The product can be used by end consumers with little knowledge of how to properly cook lobster.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In alternative embodiments, previously-frozen lobster tails could be used instead of fresh-frozen or flash-frozen lobster tails, depending on the methods used to process those tails and the degree of quality intended for the end product. Price may be an issue for the end consumer, and a previously-frozen tail may end up being less expensive to use than a tail processed from fresh.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">It is also noted that lobsters lose weight when out of water. Over a 24-hour period, a 3-4% loss of weight can be observed, which results in less sauce after cooking using methods such as those exemplary methods described herein.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">It should further be noted that adding a fat-containing composition to a raw lobster tail before freezing is likely to produce a more flavor-infused tail meat, while adding such butter to an already-frozen tail is likely to reduce the infusion of flavor into the lobster meat relative to a fresh tail, whose juices will combine with the fat-containing composition to create an extremely flavorful sauce.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">It has been observed by the inventor hereof that, for lobster tails with shell on, using an 1100-watt continuous-cook microwave oven, the following cooking times are desirably used, in embodiments of the invention:</p><p id="p-0058" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="84pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Lobster tail weight</entry><entry>Cook Time</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>3 oz.
