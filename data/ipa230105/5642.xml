Through the use of a mosaic tape (i.e., a plastic tape having discontinuous metallic shapes on one or both sides of the plastic tape), alien crosstalk can be reduced such that the alien crosstalk specification parameter can be met. However, due to tool-set limitations of current mosaic tape manufacturing processes, such as die-cutting, only fixed-shaped-metallic patterns or variable-metallic patterns that have relatively short-period lengths can be fabricated. Further, when manufactured using conventional processes, gaps between metallic shapes of the mosaic tape are wider than what is generally desired in order to adequately reduce alien crosstalk. Also, the costs associated with conventional manufacturing of mosaic tape tend to be relatively expensive.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is a need in the art for a method and apparatus to improve the reduction in alien crosstalk and to improve the frequency response of cables having one or more twisted-pair signal wires.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to some embodiments, the present invention provides improved reduction of alien crosstalk by forming fixed metallic patterns according to a design or pattern of metallic shapes or strips (primarily with respect to the longitudinal length of the pattern) such that undesirable electromagnetic couplings are not generated between the mosaic tape and the twisted wire pairs that the mosaic tape is wrapped around. An undesirable coupling is shown in graph <b>101</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a coupling peak <b>106</b> in the power sum alien near end crosstalk (PSANEXT) performance spectrum <b>107</b> of a communication link, which is caused by the interaction of a prior art mosaic tape with the twisted wire pairs. The tested link fails to satisfy the alien crosstalk specification upper limit <b>105</b>, (the PSANEXT specification under the Category 6a of ANSI/TIA/EIA-568-C.3 Cabling Standard). Mosaic tapes having metallic shapes with periodic pattern lengths according to the present invention are designed such that the pair lay lengths of each of the wire pairs are taken into account in order to prevent such unwanted couplings in the alien crosstalk performance spectrum from occurring. These limitations can act to restrict the selection of mosaic pattern lengths, as well as to restrict the tolerances of the mosaic tape and/or limit the range and tolerance of pair lay lengths of the twisted pairs within the cable.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">One technique for reducing the magnitude of the potential coupling between the mosaic tape and the twisted pairs is to fabricate a non-fixed length and/or a non-fixed shape pattern within the mosaic tape, such as a random pattern or a pseudo-random pattern that appears random and/or non-coupling at the frequencies of interest. Frequencies of interest include, but are not limited to frequencies of cabling applications such as Cat 5e (up to 100 MHz); Cat 6 (up to 250 MHz); Cat 6a (up to 500 MHz); cable used in 40G Base-CR4 (up to 10 GHz); and cable used in 100G Base-CR10 (up to 10 GHz). These frequencies have wavelengths, &#x3bb;, in the range of a few centimeters to a many meters. To avoid couplings due to a short repeated pattern (wherein the repeated pattern or portions of the pattern are of a length that generates a coupling), if the mosaic pattern is to be repeated, the repeated pattern should be as long as possible. For example, in one embodiment the pattern should be longer than the wavelength of the coupling frequencies. In some embodiments of the present invention, repeated pattern lengths greater than approximately five meters (5 m) are used. However, if the mosaic elements are too long they can create electromagnetic compatibility problems, the worst case being a conductive element which is as long as its respective cable, in which case it acts like an un-terminated shield. The present invention fills a need in the art for a method and apparatus for better reduction of alien crosstalk and higher frequency capabilities, by fabricating mosaic tape with narrow gap spacing between metallic portions and with random or pseudo-random patterns having a long repeat length, or even no repetition of the pattern for the length of the cable. The narrow gap between metallic shapes is advantageous for several reasons. The use of narrow gaps allows for the use of a single-sided mosaic tape which lowers the cost of the tape and makes the tape thickness much thinner, resulting in an overall smaller cable diameter. Narrower gaps between metallic shapes also improve alien crosstalk performance. A laser ablation system, as described below, may be used in a method by which random or pseudo-random patterns of metallic shapes are fabricated. The method provides high flexibility of pattern shapes and repeat lengths.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the present invention provides a cable having reduced alien crosstalk and an apparatus, method, and system for manufacturing the cable with reduced alien crosstalk. The cable with reduced crosstalk may include a plurality of twisted pairs of insulated conductors, a laminate film having a fixed, random, and/or pseudo-random length patterned metallic layer wrapped around the plurality of twisted pairs, and an insulating cable jacket that has a central longitudinal axis that encloses the twisted pairs of insulated conductors, wherein the metallic layer on the mosaic tape provides electrical and magnetic attenuation between wire-pairs within the cable and wire-pairs within a second cable, thereby reducing alien crosstalk. In addition, improved placement and widths of gaps within the metallic layer can reduce couplings between the twisted wire pairs and the laminate film.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention provides for an office, school, hospital, government facility, transportation vehicle, and residential or manufacturing buildings with an installed cable &#x201c;plant&#x201d; of high-speed (e.g., up to 10 Gbps or more) interconnection cables, wherein the cable plant is or can be part of an integrated network of computer servers and clients.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref> a random distribution of randomized shapes <b>404</b> having non-linear (i.e., curved) ablated regions or paths is shown. The pattern ablated into the metallic layer of the film or tape is preferably chosen to reduce alien crosstalk. This film or tape can then be wrapped around the twisted-wire pairs within a cable such that the film or tape can cover the internal pairs once or multiple times in order to improve the coupling attenuation, thereby reducing the alien crosstalk that would result from interactions with nearby cables.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">For fixed-length metallic patterns of the mosaic tape, the effective wire-pair twist lay (1/[{1/pair lay}+{1/strand lay}] must be designed so as not to create undesired electromagnetic coupling between the tape and wire-pair. Undesired electromagnetic coupling occurs to a greater extent when integer or &#xbd; integer numbers of wire-pair twist periods are directly below a metallic shape. If this condition occurs over a number of successive metallic shapes, a periodic signal is imparted onto the successive metallic shapes which couples efficiently to neighboring cables (particularly to cables of similar construction). The frequency of this interaction between the tape and the wire-pair is associated with how close the effective wire-pair twist period is to the integer or &#xbd; integer related mosaic length. For example, if the wire-pair twist period is exactly equal to the metallic shape length the frequency is low. As the wire-pair twist period gets slightly larger or smaller than the mosaic shape length the frequency increases. The most sensitive frequencies are the ones that lie in the frequency range that the application requires (e.g., 10G Base-T requires a frequency range between 1 MHz and 500 MHz). Hence it is preferable for there to be no undesired couplings in the frequency range of interest. Therefore, a region of lengths about the integer or &#xbd; integer related mosaic length define the frequency range that must be avoided for a particular application (e.g., 10G Ethernet). These regions of lengths define &#x201c;keep-out&#x201d; zones for the effective wire-pair twist period. Hence fixed-length mosaic patterns can be designed in this way to prevent unwanted electromagnetic coupling from occurring in the frequency range of interest. A completely random shape distribution and/or pseudo random pattern can be employed which substantially eliminates the unwanted coupling from occurring.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a graph <b>501</b> of keep-out areas (to obtain effective pair lay lengths) when a mosaic tape is used with metallic shapes having a fixed length period L, where L is the length of the metallic shape plus the width of the gap between adjacent metallic shapes. Note that for FIG. 5, L=1.0 inches, but the graph can be scaled for other values of L. Avoiding the keep-out areas prevents or reduces unwanted electromagnetic coupling from occurring in the alien crosstalk frequency spectrum of interest. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a graph <b>501</b> that demonstrates an example of the relationship between the fixed pattern length (L) of the metallic shapes in the mosaic tape and the effective pair lay length (which is equal to the pair lay length combined with the strand lay length) within a cable. The relationship is shown or described, as &#x201c;keep-out&#x201d; zones (i.e., the gray boxes in the graph) where the effective pair lay length of each of the wire pairs within the cable should not reside or where the length (L) of the fixed length metallic shapes should be changed to accommodate the effective pair lay length set. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, if the fixed length of the metallic shapes is L then keep-out zone <b>584</b> dictates that the effective pair lay length should not be around <b>1</b>.<b>000</b> inch (i.e., it should be outside of the length assigned by the grey box <b>584</b>). An alternative way of utilizing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is as follows: for an effective pair lay length of 0.500 inch, keep-out zone <b>585</b> dictates that the fixed length of the metallic shapes should not be L. The length L of the metallic shapes combined with the gaps must either be increased or decreased to shift the box <b>585</b> to the right or left of the pair lay length of 0.5 inch. Note that the higher order terms of the integer components <b>582</b> (e.g. L/N where N is large) or the half integer components <b>581</b> (e.g., NL/2 where N is large and odd) do not result in a strong interaction between the twisted wire-pair and the mosaic metallic pattern due to the number of wire-pair twist periods interacting with one metallic shape. These higher order terms result in a much smaller contribution to alien crosstalk.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">For a metallic shape length of L=1.0 inches, a strand lay of 4.0 inches, and four twisted pairs having pair lays of 0.5 inches (pair <b>1</b>, effective pair lay of 0.444 inches), 0.65 inches (pair <b>2</b>, effective pair lay of 0.559 inches), 0.74 inches (pair <b>3</b>, effective pair lay of 0.6245 inches), and 0.86 inches (pair <b>4</b>, effective pair lay of 0.708 inches), it can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> that all of the effective pair lays avoid the keep out zones. As the low order keep-out zones <b>583</b>-<b>586</b> are missed, the mosaic tape/strand lay/pair lays combination performs adequately.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Following fabrication of the mosaic tape according to the present invention, mosaic tape <b>696</b> can be integrated into a communication cable construction <b>601</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> a barrier tape <b>693</b> is wrapped around the twisted pairs <b>695</b> and wire-pair separator <b>694</b>. The mosaic tape <b>696</b> is wrapped over this assembly and the jacket <b>692</b> surrounds the mosaic tape <b>696</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">One of the advantages of the present invention is that a laser ablation method to produce the mosaic tape can create relatively thin gaps or voids between conductive elements when compared to mechanical die cutting methods. A thin gap is preferred because it has improved electric field and magnetic field shielding characteristics. Consequently, mosaic tapes manufactured according to the present invention can have conductive elements on a single side of the tape, and such structure has the same performance, or nearly the same performance, as mosaic tapes manufactured with a die cutting method with conductive elements on both sides of the tape. Additionally, the mosaic tape according to the present invention can be manufactured at a substantially lower cost compared to other tapes.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Another technique for reducing unwanted couplings is to randomize the twist periods of the twisted wire-pairs within a cable. The resulting random relationships between a fixed (or random) pattern on the mosaic tape reduces couplings and removes the dependency of the twisted wire-pairs' twist period to the periodicity of the mosaic's metallic shapes.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Alternatively, or additionally, a mosaic tape having a fixed periodicity of metallic shapes may be wrapped around a cable core having a randomized strand lay (sometimes called cable lay). In this fashion, the twisted wire-pairs interact with the metallic shapes with a randomized interaction length, which reduces unwanted couplings.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">While particular embodiments and applications of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the precise construction and compositions disclosed herein and that various modifications, changes, and variations may be apparent from the foregoing descriptions without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
