The base assembly includes one or more base members or slabs. The tower assembly includes a vertical assembly, a bottom member attached to or affixed to one of the base members or slabs, and a top support or platform member. The cylindrical assembly may include a single vertical member or an inner vertical member and outer vertical member. The drive assembly includes a gear box disposed on a top support/platform member of the vertical assembly, a vertical drive shaft connected at its proximal end to the generator assembly and connected to the gear box at it distal end, and a horizontal drive shaft passing through the gear box and having a sail assembly disposed on its proximal end or downwind end and a counterbalance member disposed on its distal end or upwind end. In certain embodiments, the counterbalance member may be replaced by a small UWHAT windmill to increase torque on the drive shaft to supplement the torque added by the DWHAT sails. The drive assembly comprise an indirect drive assembly or a direct drive assembly.

The wind turbine is capable of making wind-derived power more economical, scalable, efficient, less noisy, and less obtrusive. The inventor believes that the novel, economical, efficient, unique wind turbine designs, which uses existing technologies, will yield approximately a 50% reduction in cost compared to conventional up-wind horizontal axis turbine (UWHAT) designs. The inventor believes that the novel, economical, efficient, unique designs will have increased scalability for local environmental or power needs.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The improved wind turbine apparatus of this disclosure is a down-wind horizontal axis turbine (DWHAT) apparatus. The DWHAT apparatus comprises a large-scale downwind sail assembly mounted on a top of a relatively thin tower assembly or relatively small derrick assembly. The sail assembly is mounted on a proximal end of a horizontal drive shaft. A counterbalance weight is mounted on a distal end of the horizontal drive shaft. In certain embodiments, the counterbalance member may be replaced by a small UWHAT windmill to increase torque on the drive shaft to supplement the torque added by the DWHAT sails.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The large-scale downwind sail assembly includes a sail hub having a plurality of sail swivel connectors. The sail assembly also includes a set of soft sail or a plurality of soft sails, similar to wind-surfing sails in construction, including a detachably hub connector for pivotally connecting to the sail swivel connectors. Wind contacting on the sails of the sail assembly causes the sail assembly to rotate, which in turn rotates the horizontal drive shaft. The sail assembly also includes a sail support or boom ring including sail mast connectors for supporting the sails of the sail assembly. The horizontal drive shaft is a relatively long horizontal drive shaft with the sail assembly disposed downwind. The sail assembly also includes supporting braces, standing rigging, and brackets.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The new DWHAT apparatuses or systems may be designed to be smaller, more compact, and more aesthetically pleasing than the larger, traditional standard UWHAT apparatuses. The new DWHAT apparatuses or systems are more scalable, having a small or minimal environmental footprint, produce reduced or lower noise compared to standard UWHAT apparatuses and are capable of attractive, artistic designs, and/or unobtrusive design and appearance.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The new DWHAT apparatuses or systems represent a significant design, economic, and aesthetic improvement over the traditional UWHAT apparatuses. All ancillary equipment including a generator assembly, secondary gear boxes, controller, etc. may all now be mounted at ground level, allowing for a much thinner tower or derrick with a single, vertical drive axle or shaft contained inside the tower. The new DWHAT apparatuses or systems have a more compact nacelle housing of a 90&#xb0; drive assembly relative to the tower or derrick support assembly, wherein the nacelle housing houses the energy-generating components including a shaft, a generator, and gearing to which the rotor and sails of the turbine are attached.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The new DWHAT apparatuses or systems reduce or eliminate a number of issued associated standard UWHAT apparatuses or systems. Standard UWHAT apparatus designs are expensive, obtrusive, hard to maintain, and prone to icing. Standard UWHAT apparatus designs include a large diameter tower supporting large turbine blades, which are dangerous and hard to manufacture and include elevated generator and ancillary equipment causing considerable tower shadowing and maintenance issues. The new DWHAT also solves several obstacles of previous DWHAT apparatuses including detrimental vibrational effects.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The new DWHAT apparatuses include a horizontal axial or drive shaft extending out a length that is equal to nD<sub>o </sub>from a top of a tower support or a top of a central derrick support, wherein D<sub>o </sub>is an outer diameter of the tower or central derrick tower and n is a number between 6 and 12. In certain embodiments, n is a number between 7 and 11. In other embodiments, n is a number between 8 and 10. A tower shadow is negligible after about 8D<sub>0 </sub>distance from the tower, wherein D<sub>o </sub>again is the tower diameter. The new DWHAT apparatuses also include an active yaw control that rotates the tower shadow towards a leeward area of rotation.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The new DWHAT apparatus are designed to have a minimum power output of about 1.2 MW per tower. As a design of the DWHAT apparatus matures and based on local environmental factors, the DWHAT apparatus may produce up to 1.5 MW or higher. Increased sail area and sail numbers and appropriate gearing will also allow increased power generation.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The new DWHAT apparatus may use existing wind-surfing sail designs, wherein the wind-surfing sail design may be optimized for single direction sail designs.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The vertical or internal drive shaft is disposed within the interior of the tower member and centered and supported within the interior by bearings disposed within the tower member and distributed along the length of the vertical drive shaft. The horizontal rotational motion of the horizontal drive shaft due to the sails rotating the sail hub assembly attached to the proximal end of the horizontal drive shaft and is converted, by the 90 degree gear assembly, into the vertical rotation of the vertical drive shaft down the tower member to the lower Power Take Off (PTO) attached to the generator assembly located at the base of the tower member.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The DWHAT apparatus uses a variable number (e.g., optimized for 12 sails using a 10&#x2032; diameter hub or optimized for 6 sails using a 5&#x2032; hub) of individual sail apparatuses including a mast including a sail fitting member, a boom, a leeward member, a plurality of sail battens, a head member, a foot member, and a sail. The sail sets are similar to wind-surfing sail assemblies. Horizontal axle is attached to a central rotating hub with sails attached to hub. A flexible, shock-mounted linkage is at each mast step. Existing wind-surfing sails would work well in the short term for this application. Since wind-surfing sails are an existing wing-sail design, their use would dramatically reduce initial the sail design engineering and material costs. Customized sail sets with custom boom and mast steps will be developed to increase efficiency and endurance of design.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The horizontal axle or drive shaft and the sail hub assembly driven by the sail set may rotate at between about 2 hz and about 8 hz, between about 2 hz and about 6 hz, between about 2 hz and about 4 hz, or between about 2 hz and about 3 hz, producing a blade tip speed ratio between about 3 and about 6.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The Sail Hub Assembly</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The sails are to be stepped-mounted on a circular central sail hub having a radius r<sub>sh </sub>between about 5&#x2032; and about 15&#x2032;, between about 5&#x2032; and about 12&#x2032;, or between about 5&#x2032; and about 10&#x2032; and any subrange therebetween, where the ranges include the endpoint valves. A boom ring having a boom radius r<sub>br </sub>between about 2 and about 5 times the radius r<sub>sh</sub>, between about 2 and about 4 times the radius r<sub>sh</sub>, or between about 2 and about 3 times of the radius r<sub>sh</sub>, or any subrange therebetween including endpoints. Equivalently, the boom radius r<sub>br </sub>has a value between about 10&#x2032; and about 75&#x2032;, between about 10&#x2032; and about 60&#x2032;, which is attached to the hub by supporting stanchions and standing rigging on the upwind side and a bracing structure on the downwind side. The hub and the boom will support the sail at the mast and at the boom head. The assembly will include sheeting drive assemblies adapted to control sheeting/trim of the sails. The sheeting drive assemblies pulls the boom ends to change the sail sheeting or trim to minimize hub rotation or to maximize hub rotation or to adjust hub rotation to any desired rotation rate.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The boom attachment points are located about &#xbc; to &#xbd; of the mast height for mast and boom attachment and for boom sheet in-out location. The sails are stepped into the lower radius hub with locking collar and flexible shock mount joint to accommodate a bending moment and allow mast/boom rotation for sheeting in and out.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The number of sails mounted on the hub is dependent upon nominal wind conditions at installed site/location.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Each standalone wing sail assembly is comprised of a mast, a mast step, a curve-sided boom on leeward side of sail, a straight side boom on windward side of sail, and a curved sail with integral battens that pull the sail taut by tension from the boom end.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The sails are arranged in a uniform angular distance fashion or configuration around the central hub with the mast step attached to the hub on a shock mount of fitting, which may be a rotary quick connection system or a rotary non-quick connection system. The connection systems also include an integral universal pivot joint/shock joint.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="2">Boom Ring</heading><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The sails are retained at the lower third or midsection of the mast, just below the boom attachment and at the end of the boom, by a supporting boom ring. The boom ring is also attached to the central hub by supporting struts and radial standing rigging.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Embodiments of DWHAT apparatus include (a) a tower member having a length between about 30 ft and about 40 ft with the vertical drive shaft mounted by bearings inside the tower member. The drive assembly is mounted at the top of tower member and the generator assembly is situated at a bottom of the tower assembly and may be mounted on a 21-ft. trailer for portability staked down for stability.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0068">a 2-tier power tower assembly comprising lower and upper sections is another possible configuration.        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0069">a 30-40 ft lower section, a tri or quad leg tower structure with appropriate foundation.

Lower end of mast is fitted inside the center ring tube to react lateral loads and overturning moment. Rotational energy from the sail and hub is transferred through a 90&#xb0; GB down through the center tube down to the platform with the generator assy. Central tube stalk is raised within the pyramid platform to elevate the DWHAT.</li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0069" num="0071">The horizontal axis (driven by sail-hub assembly) drives a 90&#xb0; GB (est 5:1 gear step-up), which turns the primary drive axle down the inside of the tower pipe. The end of the drive axle at the lower end of the tower pipe is the PTO for the DC generator or other generator set. Maybe DC gen to battery with an inverter or a squirrel cage AC generator. The tower is 25-35 feet tall (hot dipped galvanized, polymer) supported by modest foundation with supporting side braces, stanchions, or side-standing stays. Tower is topped with the downwind sail-rotor assembly, horizontal axis of rotation, with a counterbalanced weight on the windward (upwind) end of the rotation axis. The sail forces will induce torque that drives the GB with 5-1 gear ratio step-up. The horizontal axial rotation translated to vertical axial rotation by the GB, then drives the central axial inside the tower pipe, which is linked to the generator at the lower-end PTO. An additional GB may be required at this PTO, or a direct drive to the generator set may be used. In certain embodiments, the counterbalance member may be replaced by a small UWHAT windmill to increase torque on the drive shaft to supplement the torque added by the DWHAT sails.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0072">A different number of sails may be used to configure the sail hub wheel for different conditions. Different size sails may be used for variable wind, environmental conditions, and locations.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0073">Relative wind velocities may be amplified by the interaction of each sail assembly upon the sail following it. There may be a cumulative additive effect of increased relative sail rotational velocity as the incident wind velocity is funneled in front of one sail and behind the next.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0074">Low wing sail/hub assembly weight and low sail moment of inertia makes for agile sail movement/function given wind directional changes, as well as rapid rotational speed changes. Rotating counterbalance on upwind side of the horizontal shaft generates rotational inertia to compensate for wind gusts and wind slackening. In certain embodiments, the counterbalance member may be replaced by a small UWHAT windmill to increase torque on the drive shaft to supplement the torque added by the DWHAT sails.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0075">The larger sail area per sail assembly design, relatively thin main tower pipe, along with shock-mounted hub/sail mast connection and active yaw control, alleviates tower shadowing and related vibration effect.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0076">Active yaw control will allow the sail assembly to be rotated off the wind to the angle of greatest wind conversion efficiency. Each sail boom may be sheeted in or out automatically to change the angle of attack for each sail assembly to allow optimization of sail set condition. Sail boom assemblies may all be sheeted in to increase efficiency or sheeted out to protect for overwind conditions. The mast section above the boom is flexible enough to bend a few degrees and allow gusts or overwind conditions to spill out of the top of the sail.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0077">All booms may be sheeted out to provide overwind protection and a brake may be applied. This full sheet out is the default fail safe condition that will allow rotation to stop.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0078">Alternatively, active yaw control may also protect the entire tower/sail installation from over-wind condition. In case of high wind or just need to slow hub rotation, all sail set booms will sheet in and then actively yaw (nacelle rotates) the sail assembly up into the wind until the point the sails are back-winded. This will effectively bring the rotational forces enacted on the sails down to a minimum, relative to the sail area.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0079">Only the horizontal axle or shaft, counterbalance, gear box, sail hub assembly with standing rigging and sail sets are elevated on the primary tower/driven axle or shaft, levered ring, base ring-sail step, outer ring support, outer ring boom ring, and torque ring plate. In certain embodiments, the counterbalance member may be replaced by a small UWHAT windmill to increase torque on the drive shaft to supplement the torque added by the DWHAT sails.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0080">The DWHAT apparatuses have a substantially lower installed cost and has significantly lower noise and environmental impacts.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0081">Aesthetically, the DWHAT apparatus designs will not generate anxiety (like current turbines) but may arouse curiosity. Additionally, a hub-mounted windsurfing-type sail apparatus could also be adapted to an upwind configuration.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0082">DC Power is gathered from numerous towers and stored in DC batteries at a local power substation or transformed for either DC to AC inversion or power conditioning.

With appropriate gearing, the DWHAT may have a very low cut-in speed and a very high cut-out speed.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0084">For safety purposes, the DWHAT apparatuses include at least 3 ways to stop horizontal rotation: (a) sheeting out, (b) actively yaw the entire hub/sail assembly to head up into the wind until sails are back-winded, (c) a braking system, or (d) any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0085">The present novel DWHAT apparatus design has at least the following benefits: (a) unique blade design utilizing turbulent air flow, optimized over a large sail area, where the cumulative effect of the sails working together will increase efficiency, (b) unique tower design utilizes between 4-16 sails sets, (c) configurable to different wind and climate conditions, (d) scalable for different energy requirement conditions, (e) highly efficient unit design will have ultra-low wind, gear and power losses, (f) approaching an ideal wind turbine efficiency design known as the Benz limit.
