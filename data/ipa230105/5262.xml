Existing augmented reality applications include, for example, games that overlay a user's environment, or information services that can obtain information for objects in a field of view. It would be helpful if such information could be tailored to be relevant to the user.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Accordingly, systems and methods are described for presenting supplemental content in augmented reality. Augmented reality is a modified version of reality that can include enhanced information overlaid over views of the real world. In general, augmented reality environments can be accessed using dedicated devices such as smart glasses or a headset. Augmented reality environments can also be accessed using an application on a multi-use portable device, such as a smartphone or tablet. The augmented reality environment may use a camera to obtain a picture of a real-world view and use a computer or a processor to analyze the picture and detect objects in the picture which may be identified as having some relevance to the viewer or user and providing information about or interactive options relating to the object or objects.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In an example, an augmented reality user may use an augmented reality device such as smart glasses, a headset, mobile phone, or a smartphone to view a scene. The augmented reality device (e.g., the smart glasses or smartphone) may capture a picture or video image of the scene and search for objects in the image. In some scenarios, a user may specifically focus on a particular object in the scene by, for example, pointing the augmented reality device in a direction of the object. A media guidance application may analyze one or more objects in the image to determine whether any of the objects have a connection to the user. For any object determined to have a connection to the user, the media guidance application may identify supplemental content that is related to the object for the user. In some scenarios, to identify a connection between a user and an object, the media guidance application may search a user profile, user history, a user's social media, or another source of information about the user. The supplemental content that is identified by the media guidance application may be, for example, a message related to the object that may be obtained from a social network or social media, media content related to the object, such as a video clip, television program, movie, image, book, or other media content.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an example, a method for presenting supplemental content in augmented reality may be provided by identifying an object within a field of view of an augmented reality device of a user. The field of view may be any environment the user wishes to use. For example, the field of view may be a location where the user is present. For example, the field of view may be a room in which the user is present, or a street scene where a user is walking, or a place the user is seeking, but may not be present in. The field of view could also be an image, such as a billboard, picture, magazine advertisement, etc. The augmented reality device may capture an image of such field of view. The image may be a video or still picture that captures the field of view. A media guidance application may process the image to detect an object in the image. The media guidance application may detect on the object a reference that may be related to a participant in an event. For example, the media guidance application may detect that there is a sports team logo in an image, such as on a billboard, vehicle, apparel, or another location in the image, that may be connected to a member of the sports team and the sports team may have a game or another upcoming event scheduled.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The media guidance application may search a profile of the user to find a connection between the user and the participant. For example, the media guidance application may search a social network for a message by the user that relates to the participant. In an example, a user may have posted on Twitter about a participant of a sports team or about the team or about the sport. If the media guidance application can identify a social media message by the user relating to the participant or team, the media guidance application may overlay, using the augmented reality device, a message about the participant. For example, the media guidance application could overlay a user's social media post about a sports player over an object related to the player in the image as seen in the augmented reality environment.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The message overlay in the augmented reality environment could be the content of the social media message by the user relating to the participant so that the message can be combined in the augmented reality image with the reference detected on the object. In some scenarios, the message may be the same as was used in the social media post. In other scenarios, the message may be shortened or abbreviated or otherwise based on the social media post message. In some examples, the location of the overlaid message may be on or near the object location in the field of view of the augmented reality device.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another example, a method for presenting supplemental content in augmented reality is provided in which an augmented reality device of a user may be positioned over an object within a field of view of the augmented reality device. For example, a user may look at a particular field of view with smart glasses to position the view over an object. In another example, the user may place a portable device having augmented reality functionality over an object within a field of view. For example, the user may point a smartphone camera generally in a direction of an object. The user could also zoom in on the object using the smartphone camera.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A media guidance application may identify the object in the field of view of the augmented reality device of the user. For example, the media guidance application may detect some object that is the focus of a camera of the smartphone. In some examples, the object may be in the middle of the screen. In another example, the object may be an object that is stored in a user profile as being associated in some way with the user.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The media guidance application may capture an image of the object. The image may be captured in the augmented reality device by, for example, taking a photograph or screenshot. The image may also be captured using camera circuitry and store pixels representing the object. The media guidance application may then search a database to identify content that matches at least a portion of the image of the object. For example, the media guidance application may use image search tools to search one or more image databases to find a match of a portion of the object image.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Searching a database to identify suitable content may also include searching a database that includes entries that associate images with content. Such a database may be predefined to include entries that are related to a user and which include interesting supplemental content that may arise from time to time. Setting up such a database can improve search results and reduce the time to identify suitable supplemental content for a user. Such a database could be searched in addition to searching a general media database which may have more content items, but which are not defined with associated images. The database may have stored a plurality of entries that associate images with content. The images may be analyzed by control circuitry of a media guidance application to detect distinct items in the captured image of the object. The distinct items may be, for example, logos, faces, brand names, or other objects and items. The distinct items may be matched with associated content, and an entry associating the distinct items and the content may be stored in the database. The entries may be searched for the items or objects and a matching entry may be identified that substantially corresponds to one of the distinct items. When the media guidance application makes such a match, content in the entry that is associated with the distinct item, which is part of the captured image of the object and thus is also related to the object image, may be retrieved by the media guidance application and supplied to the augmented reality environment for the user.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">If content matching the object image, or a portion of the image, is found in a media database, the media guidance application may retrieve metadata for the matching content. The metadata may be analyzed and used to detect information or a reference related to a participant in an event. For example, the media guidance application may find a matching sports team logo image and the associated metadata may include a sports team player name or names. The media guidance application may then search a list of messages previously transmitted by the user to a social network to identify a message that includes content matching the participant. For example, the media guidance application may search a user's social media posts for messages related to a player on a sports team having a matching logo.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The media guidance application may analyze the field of view in the augmented reality device to find placement or location of the objects and references. In particular, the media guidance application may identify a location on the object of the reference related to the participant. In the sports team logo example, the media guidance application may identify the region of the object in the field view having the logo. The media guidance application may determine which region of the object in the field of view includes the portion of the image that matches the matching content. In another example, a media guidance application may identify a player's name on a jersey or billboard and determine the region of the object in the field of view including the name.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The identified location may then be used by the media guidance application to position a message in the augmented reality device. For example, the media guidance application may cause the augmented reality device to overlay a message in the field of view for the user in the object location. The content of the message may be combined with the reference that was detected on the object. In an example, a user may have previously posted to a social network about a player on a sports team, and such social media message may be superimposed in the augmented reality field of view over the reference object.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an illustrative example, the image in the field of view may be sports related. An example of content, objects or items in the view may be a sports logo. A search for related supplemental content may include detecting the sports logo and determining the name of the sports team associated with the sports logo, e.g., by way of searching for an entry in a database for an associated team name and logo, or by using metadata for the logo.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another example, an event may be a sporting event. If the media guidance application determines that the event is a sporting event, the media guidance application may identify competitors participating in the sporting event. The competitors may be identified by searching a media database for information or metadata about the event. The media guidance application may also determine a team that is featured in the sporting event in the same manner. The competitor information may be used to determine a second team that is participating in the sporting event. For example, the competitor information may include metadata for each player that includes team information. If a second team is identified, the media guidance application may select a message to include in the augmented reality view that is related to the first team, any of the competitors, or the second team.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another example, an event may have an associated time. For example, a sporting event may be scheduled at a particular time or in a particular order following another event. The time for the event may be identified by the media guidance application. A message that is selected by the media guidance application to include in the augmented reality view may be one that was transmitted to the user's social network within a threshold of time that is relevant or suitable for the event time. For example, a message about a sports team that is a year old may not be relevant for a game scheduled in the near future. Instead, a more recent message about the sports team may be selected by the media guidance application.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">After a message has been combined with a reference in an object in a field of view for an augmented reality device, the user may wish to capture an image of the view. The media guidance application may store a picture that represents the view through the augmented reality device of the given message combined with the reference detected on the object for the user. The picture may be presented to the user in a display generated by the media guidance application along with an option for the user to transmit the picture to a social network.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another illustrative example, a user may view with an augmented reality device another person wearing clothing that has a connection to a sports team. For example, the second person's clothing may include a graphic logo or another representation of a sports team. If such an image were in the augmented reality field of view and thus captured by the media guidance application, a resulting combination message and object view generated by the media guidance application for the user could also be transmitted to the second person. For example, the media guidance application could cause the message combined with the image to be sent to the second user's computer or smartphone, or an augmented reality device.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It should be noted that the systems, methods, apparatuses, and/or aspects described above may be applied to, or used in accordance with, other systems, methods, apparatuses, and/or aspects described in this disclosure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The above and other objects and advantages of the disclosure will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters refer to like parts throughout, and in which:</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an illustrative example of a user of an augmented reality device in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an illustrative example of an augmented reality display in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an illustrative example of a user's social media history in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>7</b></figref> show illustrative examples of an augmented reality display in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>9</b></figref> show other illustrative examples of display screens generated by a media guidance application in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a block diagram of an illustrative user equipment device in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a block diagram of an illustrative media system in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process for adding a message to an object in an augmented reality view in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a flowchart of another illustrative process for adding a message to an object in an augmented reality view in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process for generating a social media image for a user in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a flowchart of an illustrative process for selecting a message to add to an object in an augmented reality view in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Accordingly, systems and methods are described herein for enhancing a user's augmented reality experience. In particular, systems and methods are presented herein for adding a message, such as a message from a user's social network, to an object in a field of view in an augmented reality device.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Augmented reality devices, such as an augmented reality headset or smart glasses, or a portable device with an augmented reality application, such as a mobile phone, smartphone or tablet, may be used to present an augmented reality view. The view may be presented with the augmented reality device or application so that the user can see a particular view with additional information about the view. For example, an augmented reality environment at a makeup counter may show a user with various types of applied makeup. In another example, augmented reality can be used at home to show how furniture may fit in a room. In another example, augmented reality devices can be used while grocery shopping to do price and nutritional comparisons. While these uses are very helpful to the user, the user may wish to also have information tailored for them to be added in the augmented reality.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">One way this can be accomplished is by using a media guidance application to analyze a view in the augmented reality environment to detect an object in the view. The object can be analyzed to determine a reference in the object that may have an associated participant or event. A media guidance application may search a user's social network to identify content that relates to the object, participant or event. For example, the media guidance application may search for a post by the user on social media that names or depicts the object, participant or event. If such a message is identified by the media guidance application, the media guidance application may add that message, or some version of the message, to the augmented reality view of the object. For example, the media guidance application may generate an overlay of the message to be displayed over the image in the augmented reality environment, in particular over or near the related object. This can be helpful for a user because the message is one that was originally provided by the user in another context and is now being added to the user's augmented reality view.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> which depicts a street scene <b>100</b> including a user <b>110</b> who is out for a walk on the street wearing an augmented reality headset <b>120</b> so that they can see their environment with additional information supplied by the augmented reality device. In an example, a user may walk around with an augmented reality device to see directions or map information while walking; the augmented reality device <b>120</b> may also capture images from the user's current environment. For example, the augmented reality device <b>120</b> may capture a person <b>150</b> on the sidewalk who is wearing a T-shirt with a New England Patriots logo.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">An augmented reality device may also be a smartphone which may capture a street view such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> in view <b>200</b>, which includes a person <b>210</b> wearing a T-shirt with a New England Patriots logo. Either of the augmented reality environments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> may be suitable for a user to access the enhanced augmented reality features described herein. The views seen in the augmented reality environments may be captured, as, for example, images, by a media guidance application using camera circuitry in the augmented reality device. The user may focus on a particular aspect of the view, which may inform the media guidance application of an item of interest in the view. Alternatively, the media guidance application may parse the image to identify objects using object recognition techniques. The media guidance application may also call on outside databases and information, as well as user information, to provide helpful information to include in the augmented reality view.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the media guidance application may, for example, search a user's social network to find information about the user that may be interesting to see in an augmented reality environment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a user may have a record <b>300</b> of comments or posts on a social network that includes date information and messages, e.g., <b>302</b> and <b>310</b>, and <b>305</b> and <b>315</b>, respectively. As can be seen by the record <b>300</b>, the user may have some interest in football. A media guidance application may parse such comments and determine that interest. In addition, the media guidance application may search a sports schedule or sports media database for metadata that may specify the sporting event referenced, for example, at messages <b>305</b> and <b>315</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Using the social network information about the user from the record <b>300</b>, a media guidance application may find a message that is related to a reference or object in the view captured by the augmented reality device, e.g., the view <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). For example, the media guidance application may identify the person <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) and their T-shirt logo and detect that the logo is related to the New England Patriots and football. The media guidance application may parse the user's social media record <b>300</b> and detect messages about football. Such messages could be included in the augmented reality view. For example, message <b>305</b> may be added to the augmented reality view <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts an augmented reality view <b>400</b> that a user may see using an augmented reality device. In the view <b>400</b>, a media guidance application has captured an object in the view <b>400</b>: pedestrian <b>405</b> wearing a T-shirt with a New England Patriots logo. The media guidance application may search the user's social media network information to find suitable messages to include in the view. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a message <b>410</b> has been added to the view <b>400</b> that was taken from the user's social media record (e.g., message <b>305</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>)). The message selected to be included in the augmented reality view <b>400</b> can be based on various factors, for example, time, relevance, user interest, or another basis. The message <b>410</b> selected for view <b>400</b> may be deemed relevant due, for example, to timeliness. Since the message <b>410</b> is the most recent in time message that the user has posted (see, e.g., record <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), the media guidance application may determine that it is suitable to include in the view <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In another example, a message may be selected to be added to an augmented reality view by the media guidance application based on the social network record and additional information. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an augmented reality view <b>500</b> may include a person <b>505</b> wearing a T-shirt with a New England Patriots logo. The user may focus on the T-shirt, or the media guidance application may capture the logo as an interesting object in the image. The media guidance application may search for suitable content to include in the augmented reality view <b>500</b>. In a search of the user's social network record (e.g., record <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), the media guidance application may detect an interest in football. Further, the media guidance application may select the most recent post, e.g., message <b>305</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), and determine whether there are any associated events for the object that are related to the message. For example, the media guidance application may search a media database or a sports database to identify a sporting event related to the sport or team that is around the time of the post. Thus, for the message <b>305</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), the media guidance application may search for football events around the date of the message. In addition, the media guidance application may search for football events for the team associated with the logo or reference object from the augmented reality view. A search of a sports database may show games for the New England Patriots after November 21, e.g., the Dolphins vs. Patriots game on Nov. 26, 2017 as shown in message <b>510</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another example, the media guidance application may obtain information about a reference object in an augmented reality view and select a message that provides a link to access content related to the reference object that may also be based on a user's history, e.g., a preference profile or social network. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an augmented reality view <b>600</b> may include a person <b>605</b> wearing a T-shirt with a logo for the New England Patriots football team. A media guidance application may detect the logo as a reference object in an image of the view <b>600</b> and search for a suitable message to overlay in the view <b>600</b> that is relevant to the object. The media guidance application may identify the logo, using image analysis tools, as being for the New England Patriots. The media guidance application may search a sports database for metadata about the team. The media guidance application may also search the user's history, e.g., social network record <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), for messages that may be relevant to the team or some metadata identified in the search of the sports database. The media guidance application may determine that the team&#x2014;the New England Patriots&#x2014;was a participant in the Super Bowl referenced in message <b>315</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Thus, the media guidance application may select a clip related to the team playing in the Super Bowl to offer in a link that is overlaid in the view <b>600</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In another example, the media guidance application may select a reference object identified in an augmented reality view for sharing. The reference object may be shared on social media for the user, or shared with another person. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, an augmented reality view <b>700</b> may include a person <b>705</b> wearing a New England Patriots T-shirt and the media guidance application may detect the T-shirt as a reference object in the view. The detection of the T-shirt and its logo may be based on image analysis and recognition. The logo may be, for example, stored in a user preference profile based on a user's viewing history or social network history. The media guidance application may capture the reference object, e.g., the T-shirt and logo, and provide a message <b>720</b> in the augmented reality view <b>700</b> including the reference object and a comment. The comment &#x201c;Can't wait for turkey coma and football,&#x201d; may be obtained by the media guidance application using, for example, the user's social network history. For example, the comment may be based on a recent post <b>305</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) that is deemed by the media guidance application to be timely as well as related to the sport associated with the logo. The message <b>720</b> may also include a selectable option <b>730</b> for the user to post the image to a social network, or send it to a recipient, or other manner of sharing the image. In some examples, the recipient may be identified in the message <b>720</b> and option <b>730</b> as the person <b>705</b> who may be identified by facial/image recognition techniques by the media guidance application, which may have access to a user's contacts and image history.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Although the examples described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>7</b></figref> have involved only sporting events, other types of image objects could also be used in the same manner. For example, faces, brand names, flags, television shows, landmarks, or other objects may be identified using image recognition techniques, and searches of databases for metadata associated with the images may be performed to find events related to such items. For example, a billboard advertisement showing Lady Gaga could be recognized and a database search for her name could include information about her appearance in the 2017 Super Bowl halftime show, which could also be added in the augmented reality views and be related to a user's comment <b>315</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) about watching the Super Bowl. In another example, the billboard showing Lady Gaga could result in a message about her upcoming concert.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The amount of content available to users in any given content delivery system can be substantial. Consequently, many users desire a form of media guidance through an interface that allows users to efficiently navigate content selections and easily identify content that they may desire. An application that provides such guidance is referred to herein as an interactive media guidance application or, sometimes, a media guidance application or a guidance application.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Interactive media guidance applications may take various forms depending on the content for which they provide guidance. One typical type of media guidance application is an interactive television program guide. Interactive television program guides (sometimes referred to as electronic program guides) are well-known guidance applications that, among other things, allow users to navigate among and locate many types of content or media assets. Interactive media guidance applications may generate graphical user interface screens that enable a user to navigate among, locate and select content. As referred to herein, the terms &#x201c;media asset&#x201d; and &#x201c;content&#x201d; should be understood to mean an electronically consumable user asset, such as television programming, as well as pay-per-view programs, on-demand programs (as in video-on-demand (VOD) systems), Internet content (e.g., streaming content, downloadable content, Webcasts, etc.), video clips, audio, content information, pictures, rotating images, documents, playlists, websites, articles, books, electronic books, blogs, chat sessions, social media, applications, games, and/or any other media or multimedia and/or combination of the same. Guidance applications also allow users to navigate among and locate content. As referred to herein, the term &#x201c;multimedia&#x201d; should be understood to mean content that utilizes at least two different content forms described above, for example, text, audio, images, video, or interactivity content forms. Content may be recorded, played, displayed or accessed by user equipment devices, but can also be part of a live performance.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The media guidance application and/or any instructions for performing any of the embodiments discussed herein may be encoded on computer readable media. Computer readable media includes any media capable of storing data. The computer readable media may be transitory, including, but not limited to, propagating electrical or electromagnetic signals, or may be non-transitory including, but not limited to, volatile and non-volatile computer memory or storage devices such as a hard disk, floppy disk, USB drive, DVD, CD, media cards, register memory, processor caches, Random Access Memory (&#x201c;RAM&#x201d;), etc.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">With the advent of the Internet, mobile computing, and high-speed wireless networks, users are accessing media on user equipment devices on which they traditionally did not. As referred to herein, the phrase &#x201c;user equipment device,&#x201d; &#x201c;user equipment,&#x201d; &#x201c;user device,&#x201d; &#x201c;electronic device,&#x201d; &#x201c;electronic equipment,&#x201d; &#x201c;media equipment device,&#x201d; or &#x201c;media device&#x201d; should be understood to mean any device for accessing the content described above, such as a television, a Smart TV, a set-top box, an integrated receiver decoder (IRD) for handling satellite television, a digital storage device, a digital media receiver (DMR), a digital media adapter (DMA), a streaming media device, a DVD player, a DVD recorder, a connected DVD, a local media server, a BLU-RAY player, a BLU-RAY recorder, a personal computer (PC), a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a WebTV box, a personal computer television (PC/TV), a PC media server, a PC media center, a hand-held computer, a stationary telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a mobile telephone, a portable video player, a portable music player, a portable gaming machine, a smartphone, or any other television equipment, computing equipment, or wireless device, and/or combination of the same. In some embodiments, the user equipment device may have a front facing screen and a rear facing screen, multiple front screens, or multiple angled screens. In some embodiments, the user equipment device may have a front facing camera and/or a rear facing camera. On these user equipment devices, users may be able to navigate among and locate the same content available through a television. Consequently, media guidance may be available on these devices, as well. The guidance provided may be for content available only through a television, for content available only through one or more of other types of user equipment devices, or for content available both through a television and one or more of the other types of user equipment devices. The media guidance applications may be provided as on-line applications (e.g., provided on a web-site), or as stand-alone applications or clients on user equipment devices. Various devices and platforms that may implement media guidance applications are described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">One of the functions of the media guidance application is to provide media guidance data to users. As referred to herein, the phrase &#x201c;media guidance data&#x201d; or &#x201c;guidance data&#x201d; should be understood to mean any data related to content or data used in operating the guidance application. For example, the guidance data may include program information, guidance application settings, user preferences, user profile information, media listings, media-related information (e.g., broadcast times, broadcast channels, titles, descriptions, ratings information (e.g., parental control ratings, critic's ratings, etc.), genre or category information, actor information, logo data for broadcasters' or providers' logos, etc.), media format (e.g., standard definition, high definition, 3D, etc.), on-demand information, blogs, websites, and any other type of guidance data that is helpful for a user to navigate among and locate desired content selections.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>9</b></figref> show illustrative display screens that may be used to provide media guidance data. The display screens shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>9</b></figref> may be implemented on any suitable user equipment device or platform. While the displays of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>9</b></figref> are illustrated as full screen displays, they may also be fully or partially overlaid over content being displayed. A user may indicate a desire to access content information by selecting a selectable option provided in a display screen (e.g., a menu option, a listings option, an icon, a hyperlink, etc.) or pressing a dedicated button (e.g., a GUIDE button) on a remote control or other user input interface or device. In response to the user's indication, the media guidance application may provide a display screen with media guidance data organized in one of several ways, such as by time and channel in a grid, by time, by channel, by source, by content type, by category (e.g., movies, sports, news, children, or other categories of programming), or other predefined, user-defined, or other organization criteria.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows illustrative grid of a program listings display <b>800</b> arranged by time and channel that also enables access to different types of content in a single display. Display <b>800</b> may include grid <b>802</b> with: (1) a column of channel/content type identifiers <b>804</b>, where each channel/content type identifier (which is a cell in the column) identifies a different channel or content type available; and (2) a row of time identifiers <b>806</b>, where each time identifier (which is a cell in the row) identifies a time block of programming. Grid <b>802</b> also includes cells of program listings, such as program listing <b>808</b>, where each listing provides the title of the program provided on the listing's associated channel and time. With a user input device, a user can select program listings by moving highlight region <b>810</b>. Information relating to the program listing selected by highlight region <b>810</b> may be provided in program information region <b>812</b>. Region <b>812</b> may include, for example, the program title, the program description, the time the program is provided (if applicable), the channel the program is on (if applicable), the program's rating, and other desired information.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition to providing access to linear programming (e.g., content that is scheduled to be transmitted to a plurality of user equipment devices at a predetermined time and is provided according to a schedule), the media guidance application also provides access to non-linear programming (e.g., content accessible to a user equipment device at any time and is not provided according to a schedule). Non-linear programming may include content from different content sources including on-demand content (e.g., VOD), Internet content (e.g., streaming media, downloadable media, etc.), locally stored content (e.g., content stored on any user equipment device described above or other storage device), or other time-independent content. On-demand content may include movies or any other content provided by a particular content provider (e.g., HBO On Demand providing &#x201c;The Sopranos&#x201d; and &#x201c;Curb Your Enthusiasm&#x201d;). HBO ON DEMAND is a service mark owned by Time Warner Company L. P. et al. and THE SOPRANOS and CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM are trademarks owned by the Home Box Office, Inc. Internet content may include web events, such as a chat session or Webcast, or content available on-demand as streaming content or downloadable content through an Internet web site or other Internet access (e.g. FTP).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Grid <b>802</b> may provide media guidance data for non-linear programming including on-demand listing <b>814</b>, recorded content listing <b>816</b>, and Internet content listing <b>818</b>. A display combining media guidance data for content from different types of content sources is sometimes referred to as a &#x201c;mixed-media&#x201d; display. Various permutations of the types of media guidance data that may be displayed that are different than display <b>800</b> may be based on user selection or guidance application definition (e.g., a display of only recorded and broadcast listings, only on-demand and broadcast listings, etc.). As illustrated, listings <b>814</b>, <b>816</b>, and <b>818</b> are shown as spanning the entire time block displayed in grid <b>802</b> to indicate that selection of these listings may provide access to a display dedicated to on-demand listings, recorded listings, or Internet listings, respectively. In some embodiments, listings for these content types may be included directly in grid <b>802</b>.

A personalized media guidance application allows a user to customize displays and features to create a personalized &#x201c;experience&#x201d; with the media guidance application. This personalized experience may be created by allowing a user to input these customizations and/or by the media guidance application monitoring user activity to determine various user preferences. Users may access their personalized guidance application by logging in or otherwise identifying themselves to the guidance application. Customization of the media guidance application may be made in accordance with a user profile. The customizations may include varying presentation schemes (e.g., color scheme of displays, font size of text, etc.), aspects of content listings displayed (e.g., only HDTV or only 3D programming, user-specified broadcast channels based on favorite channel selections, re-ordering the display of channels, recommended content, etc.), desired recording features (e.g., recording or series recordings for particular users, recording quality, etc.), parental control settings, customized presentation of Internet content (e.g., presentation of social media content, e-mail, electronically delivered articles, etc.) and other desired customizations.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">The media guidance application may allow a user to provide user profile information or may automatically compile user profile information. The media guidance application may, for example, monitor the content the user accesses and/or other interactions the user may have with the guidance application. Additionally, the media guidance application may obtain all or part of other user profiles that are related to a particular user (e.g., from other web sites on the Internet the user accesses, such as www.Tivo.com, from other media guidance applications the user accesses, from other interactive applications the user accesses, from another user equipment device of the user, etc.), and/or obtain information about the user from other sources that the media guidance application may access. As a result, a user can be provided with a unified guidance application experience across the user's different user equipment devices. This type of user experience is described in greater detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.

In some embodiments, processing circuitry may be distributed across multiple separate processors or processing units, for example, multiple of the same type of processing units (e.g., two Intel Core i7 processors) or multiple different processors (e.g., an Intel Core i5 processor and an Intel Core i7 processor). In some embodiments, control circuitry <b>1004</b> executes instructions for a media guidance application stored in memory (e.g., storage <b>1008</b>). Specifically, control circuitry <b>1004</b> may be instructed by the media guidance application to perform the functions discussed above and below. For example, the media guidance application may provide instructions to control circuitry <b>1004</b> to generate the media guidance displays.

As referred to herein, the phrase &#x201c;electronic storage device&#x201d; or &#x201c;storage device&#x201d; should be understood to mean any device for storing electronic data, computer software, or firmware, such as random-access memory, read-only memory, hard drives, optical drives, digital video disc (DVD) recorders, compact disc (CD) recorders, BLU-RAY disc (BD) recorders, BLU-RAY 3D disc recorders, digital video recorders (DVR, sometimes called a personal video recorder, or PVR), solid state devices, quantum storage devices, gaming consoles, gaming media, or any other suitable fixed or removable storage devices, and/or any combination of the same. Storage <b>1008</b> may be used to store various types of content described herein as well as media guidance data described above. Nonvolatile memory may also be used (e.g., to launch a boot-up routine and other instructions). Cloud-based storage, described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, may be used to supplement storage <b>1008</b> or instead of storage <b>1008</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Control circuitry <b>1004</b> may include video generating circuitry and tuning circuitry, such as one or more analog tuners, one or more MPEG-2 decoders or other digital decoding circuitry, high-definition tuners, or any other suitable tuning or video circuits or combinations of such circuits. Encoding circuitry (e.g., for converting over-the-air, analog, or digital signals to MPEG signals for storage) may also be provided. Control circuitry <b>1004</b> may also include scaler circuitry for upconverting and downconverting content into the preferred output format of the user equipment <b>1000</b>. Circuitry <b>1004</b> may also include digital-to-analog converter circuitry and analog-to-digital converter circuitry for converting between digital and analog signals. The tuning and encoding circuitry may be used by the user equipment device to receive and to display, to play, or to record content.

The circuitry described herein, including for example, the tuning, video generating, encoding, decoding, encrypting, decrypting, scaler, and analog/digital circuitry, may be implemented using software running on one or more general purpose or specialized processors. Multiple tuners may be provided to handle simultaneous tuning functions (e.g., watch and record functions, picture-in-picture (PIP) functions, multiple-tuner recording, etc.). If storage <b>1008</b> is provided as a separate device from user equipment <b>1000</b>, the tuning and encoding circuitry (including multiple tuners) may be associated with storage <b>1008</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">A user may send instructions to control circuitry <b>1004</b> using user input interface <b>1010</b>. User input interface <b>1010</b> may be any suitable user interface, such as a remote control, mouse, trackball, keypad, keyboard, touch screen, touchpad, stylus input, joystick, voice recognition interface, or other user input interfaces. Display <b>1012</b> may be provided as a stand-alone device or integrated with other elements of user equipment device <b>1000</b>. For example, display <b>1012</b> may be a touchscreen or touch-sensitive display. In such circumstances, user input interface <b>1010</b> may be integrated with or combined with display <b>1012</b>. Display <b>1012</b> may be one or more of a monitor, a television, a liquid crystal display (LCD) for a mobile device, amorphous silicon display, low temperature poly silicon display, electronic ink display, electrophoretic display, active matrix display, electro-wetting display, electrofluidic display, cathode ray tube display, light-emitting diode display, electroluminescent display, plasma display panel, high-performance addressing display, thin-film transistor display, organic light-emitting diode display, surface-conduction electron-emitter display (SED), laser television, carbon nanotubes, quantum dot display, interferometric modulator display, or any other suitable equipment for displaying visual images. In some embodiments, display <b>1012</b> may be HDTV-capable. In some embodiments, display <b>1012</b> may be a 3D display, and the interactive media guidance application and any suitable content may be displayed in 3D. A video card or graphics card may generate the output to the display <b>1012</b>. The video card may offer various functions such as accelerated rendering of 3D scenes and 2D graphics, MPEG-2/MPEG-4 decoding, TV output, or the ability to connect multiple monitors. The video card may be any processing circuitry described above in relation to control circuitry <b>1004</b>. The video card may be integrated with the control circuitry <b>1004</b>. Speakers <b>1014</b> may be provided as integrated with other elements of user equipment device <b>1000</b> or may be stand-alone units. The audio component of videos and other content displayed on display <b>1012</b> may be played through speakers <b>1014</b>. In some embodiments, the audio may be distributed to a receiver (not shown), which processes and outputs the audio via speakers <b>1014</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The guidance application may be implemented using any suitable architecture. For example, it may be a stand-alone application wholly-implemented on user equipment device <b>1000</b>. In such an approach, instructions of the application are stored locally (e.g., in storage <b>1008</b>), and data for use by the application is downloaded on a periodic basis (e.g., from an out-of-band feed, from an Internet resource, or using another suitable approach). Control circuitry <b>1004</b> may retrieve instructions of the application from storage <b>1008</b> and process the instructions to generate any of the displays discussed herein. Based on the processed instructions, control circuitry <b>1004</b> may determine what action to perform when input is received from input interface <b>1010</b>. For example, movement of a cursor on a display up/down may be indicated by the processed instructions when input interface <b>1010</b> indicates that an up/down button was selected.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the media guidance application is a client-server based application. Data for use by a thick or thin client implemented on user equipment device <b>1000</b> is retrieved on-demand by issuing requests to a server remote to the user equipment device <b>1000</b>. In one example of a client-server based guidance application, control circuitry <b>1004</b> runs a web browser that interprets web pages provided by a remote server. For example, the remote server may store the instructions for the application in a storage device. The remote server may process the stored instructions using circuitry (e.g., control circuitry <b>1004</b>) and generate the displays discussed above and below. The client device may receive the displays generated by the remote server and may display the content of the displays locally on equipment device <b>1000</b>. This way, the processing of the instructions is performed remotely by the server while the resulting displays are provided locally on equipment device <b>1000</b>. Equipment device <b>1000</b> may receive inputs from the user via input interface <b>1010</b> and transmit those inputs to the remote server for processing and generating the corresponding displays. For example, equipment device <b>1000</b> may transmit a communication to the remote server indicating that an up/down button was selected via input interface <b>1010</b>. The remote server may process instructions in accordance with that input and generate a display of the application corresponding to the input (e.g., a display that moves a cursor up/down). The generated display is then transmitted to equipment device <b>1000</b> for presentation to the user.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, the media guidance application is downloaded and interpreted or otherwise run by an interpreter or virtual machine (run by control circuitry <b>1004</b>). In some embodiments, the guidance application may be encoded in the ETV Binary Interchange Format (EBIF), received by control circuitry <b>1004</b> as part of a suitable feed, and interpreted by a user agent running on control circuitry <b>1004</b>. For example, the guidance application may be an EBIF application. In some embodiments, the guidance application may be defined by a series of JAVA-based files that are received and run by a local virtual machine or other suitable middleware executed by control circuitry <b>1004</b>. In some of such embodiments (e.g., those employing MPEG-2 or other digital media encoding schemes), the guidance application may be, for example, encoded and transmitted in an MPEG-2 object carousel with the MPEG audio and video packets of a program.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">User equipment device <b>1000</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> can be implemented in system <b>1100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> as user television equipment <b>1102</b>, user computer equipment <b>1104</b>, wireless user communications device <b>1106</b>, or any other type of user equipment suitable for accessing content, such as a non-portable gaming machine. For simplicity, these devices may be referred to herein collectively as user equipment or user equipment devices, and may be substantially similar to user equipment devices described above. User equipment devices, on which a media guidance application may be implemented, may function as a standalone device or may be part of a network of devices. Various network configurations of devices may be implemented and are discussed in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A user equipment device utilizing at least some of the system features described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> may not be classified solely as user television equipment <b>1102</b>, user computer equipment <b>1104</b>, or a wireless user communications device <b>1106</b>. For example, user television equipment <b>1102</b> may, like some user computer equipment <b>1104</b>, be Internet-enabled allowing for access to Internet content, while user computer equipment <b>1104</b> may, like some television equipment <b>1102</b>, include a tuner allowing for access to television programming. The media guidance application may have the same layout on various different types of user equipment or may be tailored to the display capabilities of the user equipment. For example, on user computer equipment <b>1104</b>, the guidance application may be provided as a web site accessed by a web browser. In another example, the guidance application may be scaled down for wireless user communications devices <b>1106</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In system <b>1100</b>, there is typically more than one of each type of user equipment device but only one of each is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> to avoid overcomplicating the drawing. In addition, each user may utilize more than one type of user equipment device and also more than one of each type of user equipment device.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, a user equipment device (e.g., user television equipment <b>1102</b>, user computer equipment <b>1104</b>, wireless user communications device <b>1106</b>) may be referred to as a &#x201c;second screen device.&#x201d; For example, a second screen device may supplement content presented on a first user equipment device. The content presented on the second screen device may be any suitable content that supplements the content presented on the first device. In some embodiments, the second screen device provides an interface for adjusting settings and display preferences of the first device. In some embodiments, the second screen device is configured for interacting with other second screen devices or for interacting with a social network. The second screen device can be located in the same room as the first device, a different room from the first device but in the same house or building, or in a different building from the first device.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The user may also set various settings to maintain consistent media guidance application settings across in-home devices and remote devices. Settings include those described herein, as well as channel and program favorites, programming preferences that the guidance application utilizes to make programming recommendations, display preferences, and other desirable guidance settings. For example, if a user sets a channel as a favorite on, for example, the web site www.Tivo.com on their personal computer at their office, the same channel would appear as a favorite on the user's in-home devices (e.g., user television equipment and user computer equipment) as well as the user's mobile devices, if desired. Therefore, changes made on one user equipment device can change the guidance experience on another user equipment device, regardless of whether they are the same or a different type of user equipment device. In addition, the changes made may be based on settings input by a user, as well as user activity monitored by the guidance application.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The user equipment devices may be coupled to communications network <b>1114</b>. Namely, user television equipment <b>1102</b>, user computer equipment <b>1104</b>, and wireless user communications device <b>1106</b> are coupled to communications network <b>1114</b> via communications paths <b>1108</b>, <b>1110</b>, and <b>1112</b>, respectively.

For example, the subscription data may identify to which sources or services a given user subscribes and/or to which sources or services the given user has previously subscribed but later terminated access (e.g., whether the user subscribes to premium channels, whether the user has added a premium level of services, whether the user has increased Internet speed). In some embodiments, the viewer data and/or the subscription data may identify patterns of a given user for a period of more than one year. The media guidance data may include a model (e.g., a survivor model) used for generating a score that indicates a likelihood a given user will terminate access to a service/source. For example, the media guidance application may process the viewer data with the subscription data using the model to generate a value or score that indicates a likelihood of whether the given user will terminate access to a particular service or source. In particular, a higher score may indicate a higher level of confidence that the user will terminate access to a particular service or source. Based on the score, the media guidance application may generate promotions that entice the user to keep the particular service or source indicated by the score as one to which the user will likely terminate access.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Media guidance applications may be, for example, stand-alone applications implemented on user equipment devices. For example, the media guidance application may be implemented as software or a set of executable instructions which may be stored in storage <b>1008</b>, and executed by control circuitry <b>1004</b> of a user equipment device <b>1000</b>. In some embodiments, media guidance applications may be client-server applications where only a client application resides on the user equipment device, and server application resides on a remote server. For example, media guidance applications may be implemented partially as a client application on control circuitry <b>1004</b> of user equipment device <b>1000</b> and partially on a remote server as a server application (e.g., media guidance data source <b>1118</b>) running on control circuitry of the remote server. When executed by control circuitry of the remote server (such as media guidance data source <b>1118</b>), the media guidance application may instruct the control circuitry to generate the guidance application displays and transmit the generated displays to the user equipment devices. The server application may instruct the control circuitry of the media guidance data source <b>1118</b> to transmit data for storage on the user equipment. The client application may instruct control circuitry of the receiving user equipment to generate the guidance application displays.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Content and/or media guidance data delivered to user equipment devices <b>1102</b>, <b>1104</b>, and <b>1106</b> may be over-the-top (OTT) content. OTT content delivery allows Internet-enabled user devices, including any user equipment device described above, to receive content that is transferred over the Internet, including any content described above, in addition to content received over cable or satellite connections. OTT content is delivered via an Internet connection provided by an Internet service provider (ISP), but a third party distributes the content. The ISP may not be responsible for the viewing abilities, copyrights, or redistribution of the content, and may only transfer IP packets provided by the OTT content provider. Examples of OTT content providers include YOUTUBE, NETFLIX, and HULU, which provide audio and video via IP packets. Youtube is a trademark owned by Google Inc., Netflix is a trademark owned by Netflix Inc., and Hulu is a trademark owned by Hulu, LLC. OTT content providers may additionally or alternatively provide media guidance data described above. In addition to content and/or media guidance data, providers of OTT content can distribute media guidance applications (e.g., web-based applications or cloud-based applications), or the content can be displayed by media guidance applications stored on the user equipment device.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Media guidance system <b>1100</b> is intended to illustrate a number of approaches, or network configurations, by which user equipment devices and sources of content and guidance data may communicate with each other for the purpose of accessing content and providing media guidance. The embodiments described herein may be applied in any one or a subset of these approaches, or in a system employing other approaches for delivering content and providing media guidance. The following four approaches provide specific illustrations of the generalized example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">In one approach, user equipment devices may communicate with each other within a home network. User equipment devices can communicate with each other directly via short-range point-to-point communication schemes described above, via indirect paths through a hub or other similar device provided on a home network, or via communications network <b>1114</b>. Each of the multiple individuals in a single home may operate different user equipment devices on the home network. As a result, it may be desirable for various media guidance information or settings to be communicated between the different user equipment devices. For example, it may be desirable for users to maintain consistent media guidance application settings on different user equipment devices within a home network, as described in greater detail in Ellis et al., U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005/0251827, filed Jul. 11, 2005. Different types of user equipment devices in a home network may also communicate with each other to transmit content. For example, a user may transmit content from user computer equipment to a portable video player or portable music player.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In a second approach, users may have multiple types of user equipment by which they access content and obtain media guidance. For example, some users may have home networks that are accessed by in-home and mobile devices. Users may control in-home devices via a media guidance application implemented on a remote device. For example, users may access an online media guidance application on a website via a personal computer at their office, or a mobile device such as a PDA or web-enabled mobile telephone. The user may set various settings (e.g., recordings, reminders, or other settings) on the online guidance application to control the user's in-home equipment. The online guide may control the user's equipment directly, or by communicating with a media guidance application on the user's in-home equipment. Various systems and methods for user equipment devices communicating, where the user equipment devices are in locations remote from each other, is discussed in, for example, Ellis et al., U.S. Pat. No. 8,046,801, issued Oct. 25, 2011, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In a third approach, users of user equipment devices inside and outside a home can use their media guidance application to communicate directly with content source <b>1116</b> to access content. Specifically, within a home, users of user television equipment <b>1102</b> and user computer equipment <b>1104</b> may access the media guidance application to navigate among and locate desirable content. Users may also access the media guidance application outside of the home using wireless user communications devices <b>1106</b> to navigate among and locate desirable content.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In a fourth approach, user equipment devices may operate in a cloud computing environment to access cloud services. In a cloud computing environment, various types of computing services for content sharing, storage or distribution (e.g., video sharing sites or social networking sites) are provided by a collection of network-accessible computing and storage resources, referred to as &#x201c;the cloud.&#x201d; For example, the cloud can include a collection of server computing devices, which may be located centrally or at distributed locations, that provide cloud-based services to various types of users and devices connected via a network such as the Internet via communications network <b>1114</b>. These cloud resources may include one or more content sources <b>1116</b> and one or more media guidance data sources <b>1118</b>. In addition or in the alternative, the remote computing sites may include other user equipment devices, such as user television equipment <b>1102</b>, user computer equipment <b>1104</b>, and wireless user communications device <b>1106</b>. For example, the other user equipment devices may provide access to a stored copy of a video or a streamed video. In such embodiments, user equipment devices may operate in a peer-to-peer manner without communicating with a central server.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The cloud provides access to services, such as content storage, content sharing, or social networking services, among other examples, as well as access to any content described above, for user equipment devices. Services can be provided in the cloud through cloud computing service providers, or through other providers of online services. For example, the cloud-based services can include a content storage service, a content sharing site, a social networking site, or other services via which user-sourced content is distributed for viewing by others on connected devices. These cloud-based services may allow a user equipment device to store content to the cloud and to receive content from the cloud rather than storing content locally and accessing locally-stored content.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">A user may use various content capture devices, such as camcorders, digital cameras with video mode, audio recorders, mobile phones, and handheld computing devices, to record content. The user can upload content to a content storage service on the cloud either directly, for example, from user computer equipment <b>1104</b> or wireless user communications device <b>1106</b> having content capture feature. Alternatively, the user can first transfer the content to a user equipment device, such as user computer equipment <b>1104</b>. The user equipment device storing the content uploads the content to the cloud using a data transmission service on communications network <b>1114</b>. In some embodiments, the user equipment device itself is a cloud resource, and other user equipment devices can access the content directly from the user equipment device on which the user stored the content.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Cloud resources may be accessed by a user equipment device using, for example, a web browser, a media guidance application, a desktop application, a mobile application, and/or any combination of access applications of the same. The user equipment device may be a cloud client that relies on cloud computing for application delivery, or the user equipment device may have some functionality without access to cloud resources. For example, some applications running on the user equipment device may be cloud applications, e.g., applications delivered as a service over the Internet, while other applications may be stored and run on the user equipment device. In some embodiments, a user device may receive content from multiple cloud resources simultaneously. For example, a user device can stream audio from one cloud resource while downloading content from a second cloud resource. Or a user device can download content from multiple cloud resources for more efficient downloading. In some embodiments, user equipment devices can use cloud resources for processing operations such as the processing operations performed by processing circuitry described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">As referred herein, the term &#x201c;in response to&#x201d; refers to initiated as a result of.

It should be noted that process <b>1200</b> or any step thereof could be performed on, or provided by, any of the devices shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>11</b></figref>. For example, process <b>1200</b> may be executed by control circuitry <b>1004</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) as instructed by a media guidance application implemented on a user device (e.g., user equipment devices <b>1102</b>, <b>1104</b>, and/or <b>1106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>)) to present added information in an augmented reality environment. In addition, one or more steps of process <b>1200</b> may be incorporated into or combined with one or more steps of any other process or embodiment described herein.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> depicts an illustrative process <b>1200</b> for providing information in an augmented reality view. At step <b>1210</b>, control circuitry <b>1004</b> for a media guidance application may identify an object within a field of view of an augmented reality device. For example, a user using an augmented reality device may have a certain field of view (e.g., views <b>200</b>, <b>400</b>, <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> or <b>700</b>) including various objects. The media guidance application may capture an image in the view using camera circuitry. The media guidance application may also determine whether the user is focusing in the view on a particular object or direction.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">At step <b>1220</b>, control circuitry <b>1004</b> for a media guidance application may process an image of the object. The media guidance application may use camera circuitry to capture and process the image with control circuitry <b>1004</b> to detect, on the object, a reference related to a participant in an event. The media guidance application may use image analysis tools to analyze the image using control circuitry <b>1004</b> to identify the object. The media guidance application may then search a media or other database to obtain additional information about the object to determine the reference, participant and event associated with the object.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">At step <b>1230</b>, control circuitry <b>1004</b> for a media guidance application may search a profile of the user to find content that may be relevant to the object. In particular, control circuitry <b>1004</b> for a media guidance application may search the user profile to identify a message about the participant that was previously transmitted to a social network by the user. Thus, the media guidance application may use participant or event information associated with the object to find a message from the user's social network that is relevant to the object in the augmented reality view. For example, the media guidance application may search the user's social network record <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) to identify a message that is related to a participant in the object. Building on the examples provided earlier, the media guidance application may detect a sports team logo in an augmented reality device display and determine a participant&#x2014;e.g., the team, or players on the team associated with the logo, the sport, or other stakeholder metadata for the logo. The media guidance application may then search the user's history to find related content, e.g., social network comments, media associated with the user history, etc.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">At step <b>1240</b> the control circuitry <b>1004</b> for a media guidance application may overlay in a display on the augmented reality device a message identified in the user's history. For example, the media guidance application may use a comment from a user's social network history that is related to the object reference to overlay in the augmented reality view. The control circuitry <b>1004</b> for a media guidance application may cause the overlay to be generated at an approximate location of the object, or other suitable location so that the user can see the connection between the message and the object. The message overlay may be a combination of the content of a message from a user's social network history and the reference object. Thus, in an example, a social network message about football may be displayed in an augmented reality view as an overlay of the sports logo reference object in the augmented reality view.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">It is contemplated that the steps or descriptions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> may be used with any other embodiment of this disclosure. In addition, the steps and descriptions described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> may be done in alternative orders or in parallel to further the purposes of this disclosure. For example, each of these steps may be performed in any order or in parallel or substantially simultaneously to reduce lag or increase the speed of the system or method. Any of these steps may also be skipped or omitted from the process. Furthermore, it should be noted that any of the devices or equipment discussed in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>11</b></figref> could be used to perform one or more of the steps in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a flowchart of illustrative steps of a process <b>1300</b> for adding information to an augmented reality view in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure. It should be noted that process <b>1300</b> or any step thereof could be performed on, or provided by, any of the devices shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>11</b></figref>. For example, process <b>1300</b> may be executed by control circuitry <b>1004</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) as instructed by a media guidance application implemented on a user device (e.g., user equipment devices <b>1102</b>, <b>1104</b>, and/or <b>1106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>)) to present added information in an augmented reality environment. In addition, one or more steps of process <b>1300</b> may be incorporated into or combined with one or more steps of any other process or embodiment described herein.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is an illustrative flowchart depicting a process <b>1300</b> that may be followed to provide information in an augmented reality view that includes a message with a reference object in the view. At step <b>1310</b> control circuitry <b>1004</b> for a media guidance application may be used to position an augmented reality device of a first user over an object within a field of view of the augmented reality device. The media guidance application may focus a view of a display in an augmented reality device over an object in the view. For example, in the view <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the media guidance application may focus on one or more objects in the view <b>200</b>. For example, the media guidance application may focus on an advertisement in a billboard, a nearby store, or one of the persons in the view <b>200</b>, such as the person <b>210</b>. Focusing on the object in the view may be achieved by, for example, detecting a direction or orientation of the augmented reality device, a user history of object interest, a user's calendar to determine temporal foci, or another basis. In another example, the object focus may be based on a user's action within the augmented reality environment.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">At step <b>1315</b>, the control circuitry <b>1004</b> for the media guidance application may identify the object within the field of view of the augmented reality device of the first user. The object may be identified by the control circuitry <b>1004</b> by narrowing in the field of view focus from step <b>1310</b>. The object may be identified using object recognition tools and techniques.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">When the object has been identified, the control circuitry <b>1004</b> for the media guidance application, at step <b>1320</b>, may capture an image of the object. The image may be captured by the control circuitry <b>1004</b> for the media guidance application using camera circuitry and using a photograph or video image capture that can include capturing the image using pixels or another image component.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">At step <b>1325</b>, the control circuitry <b>1004</b> for the media guidance application may search a database to identify content that matches at least a portion of the image of the object. The database search may be performed by the media guidance application using an image search tool or technique to determine content and context for the object image. The image search tool may provide metadata about the object image. Such metadata may be searched by the media guidance application in a database to find content matching the object image. For example, an image of person <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may be captured at step <b>1320</b>, and the image will be analyzed using an image search technique to detect, for example, that the image is of a person, that the person <b>210</b> may be recognized as being one that is known by the user based on facial or image recognition tools and a comparison of the user's contacts; in addition, the image search may detect that the person <b>210</b> is wearing shoes that are ones that have been purchased by the user, (based on a user's online shopping history), that the person <b>210</b> is wearing a T-shirt with a New England Patriots logo, (which may be known to the media guidance application as being for a team that is the user's favorite, or nemesis), or other details about the image.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">At step <b>1330</b>, in response to identifying content that matches at least the portion of the image of the object, the control circuitry <b>1004</b> for the media guidance application will retrieve metadata associated with the content to detect, on the object, a reference related to a participant in an event. Thus, at step <b>1330</b>, the media guidance application will use information about identifying matching content for the image obtained at step <b>1325</b> to retrieve metadata about the matching content. For example, if the media guidance application detects that a person <b>210</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) is known to the user, e.g., using facial recognition tools, the media guidance application may retrieve metadata about the person or contact. In another example, if the media guidance application identifies that the object image is a New England Patriots logo, the media guidance application will retrieve metadata about the New England Patriots, for example, event and participant information. Such metadata and information could be obtained from a sports database or another suitable database. In another example, the media guidance application could identify that the object image includes apparel that is similar to something the user has previously purchased or liked on social media. In this example, the media guidance application may retrieve metadata relating to a store sale, spokespersons, pop-up shops, retail drops, or other event or participant related to the content.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">At step <b>1335</b>, the control circuitry <b>1004</b> for the media guidance application may search a list of messages previously transmitted by the first user to a social network to identify a given message that includes content matching the participant. In order to perform step <b>1335</b>, the media guidance application may access a user's social network to search messages, such as comments, tags, links, or other content that is posted by the user, or that is posted by another contact and associated with or tagged for the user, e.g., as shown in record <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The social media messages may be searched to find content that relates to the participant identified at step <b>1330</b>. In an example, in response to detecting a New England Patriots logo on a T-shirt, the media guidance application may retrieve metadata for the New England Patriots team and search the user's social network for messages about the team. In this example, the media guidance application may detect message <b>310</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) as being related to the New England Patriots, who played in the Super Bowl in February 2017. In another example, the media guidance application may detect another message <b>302</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) as being related to the New England Patriots because the team will be playing a match soon after the message posting date.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">At step <b>1340</b>, the control circuitry <b>1004</b> for the media guidance application may identify a location on the object of the reference related to the participant by determining which region of the object in the field of view includes the portion of the image that matches the identified content. To perform step <b>1340</b>, the media guidance application may compare the context of the augmented reality view with the object image information to determine the location of the object within the view.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The control circuitry <b>1004</b> for the media guidance application may then, at step <b>1350</b>, combine, using the augmented reality device, at a position relative to the identified location, the content of the given message with the reference detected on the object. Thus, the social media message identified at step <b>1340</b> may be added to the view in the augmented reality device at a location near the object at step <b>1350</b> to provide a view such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">It is contemplated that the steps or descriptions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> may be used with any other embodiment of this disclosure.

For example, process <b>1500</b> may be executed by control circuitry <b>1004</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) as instructed by a media guidance application implemented on a user device (e.g., user equipment devices <b>1102</b>, <b>1104</b>, and/or <b>1106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>)) to select a message to add to an augmented reality environment. In addition, one or more steps of process <b>1500</b> may be incorporated into or combined with one or more steps of any other process or embodiment described herein.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> depicts a process <b>1500</b> for selecting a message to combine with an image in an augmented reality environment. Process <b>1500</b> may be used to select a message, for example, the message at step <b>1335</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>), to add to an augmented reality view, or to select a message to add to a portion of an augmented reality view that has an object having some relation to a message in a user's social network. In an example, a media guidance application may search a user's social network history, user profile, Internet cache history, or other history to identify a message or comment that the user has left and match it to an object in the augmented reality view. Adding a social network message to a matched object in an augmented reality view may be interesting or relevant to a user because it is a comment or thought that the user has had in the past, and is one that the user has felt to be compelling enough to share with the user's social network. In order to expedite matching a message and images in an augmented reality environment, in some examples, a media guidance application may build a database for a particular user, or a set of users, of images and image objects that may be associated with metadata and links that can help facilitate searching for supplemental content to add to an augmented reality environment as well as messages from a user's social network that may be related to the images and image objects.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">At step <b>1510</b>, control circuitry <b>1004</b> for the media guidance application may receive an image of an object captured within a view of an augmented reality device. The image may be received from the augmented reality device using camera circuitry. In an example, the image may be a view such as the augmented reality views from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> or <b>4</b>-<b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">At step <b>1520</b>, control circuitry <b>1004</b> for the media guidance application may take the received image and store the image in a database in association with a plurality of entries that associate images with content. For example, images may be stored in a relational database that includes links and metadata for images. The image may be analyzed and deconstructed into components or elements, and links and metadata for each of the components or elements of the image may also be stored in the database. For example, a media guidance application may store an image taken from an augmented reality device and parse the image for objects that can be identified using image recognition or image processing tools to detect and then define the elements in the image.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">At step <b>1530</b>, control circuitry <b>1004</b> for the media guidance application may detect a plurality of distinct items in the image of the object. The distinct items may be detected using image processing tools that can narrow in on elements in the image and match them with images in an image database. In some examples, the image processing may include comparing pixels in the image to identify boundaries for objects that can be matched with objects in an image database.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">At step <b>1540</b>, the media guidance application may identify one of a plurality of entries that includes a given image that substantially corresponds to a given one of the distinct items. To perform step <b>1540</b>, the media guidance application may search a media database, an image database or another database to find an entry for an image that is substantially the same as some element or component of the received image. The searching may be performed using image processing and recognition tools so that the image elements can be compared with images in the database. The database may have metadata and links for image items in the database. For example, an image database may have associated source information, description data, titles, keywords or other metadata associated with the image to facilitate retrieving the content.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">At step <b>1550</b>, the media guidance application may retrieve content that is associated with the given image that is matched from the database at step <b>1540</b>. The content may be obtained by, for example, accessing metadata for the image and using link information to retrieve the content.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">Metadata for the content may be analyzed at step <b>1560</b> by control circuitry <b>1004</b> for the media guidance application to determine whether the content is associated with an entity. For example, the media guidance application may determine whether content is connected to a group, organization, team or another entity. The entity information may be useful to obtain a message to include with the content that is relevant to the entity. For example, if the media guidance application has retrieved an image including a New England Patriots logo, matching images may be associated with content for football games, player news, team articles, team merchandise, NFL statistics, or other content. The media guidance application may detect that the content is associated with an entity&#x2014;e.g., the New England Patriots, football, the NFL, or another entity. If the media guidance application determines that the content is associated with an entity at step <b>1560</b>, the media guidance application may search for a message in the user's social network that is associated with the entity at step <b>1565</b>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">At step <b>1565</b>, control circuitry <b>1004</b> for the media guidance application may select a message based on the entity. The message may be selected by the media guidance application from a user's social network history, such as record <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), or another user history or user profile.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">If however, the media guidance application does not detect an entity associated with the content, the media guidance application may continue process <b>1500</b> at step <b>1570</b> to determine whether the content is associated with a time. For example, the media guidance application may find an events schedule for a matching image. For example, an image may be for a celebrity who may have a concert schedule, or be part of a movie having a particular release schedule and showtimes at a theater, or be an NFL logo for a team having a certain game schedule, etc. The event information and associated time can be used as a basis for finding a suitable message from a user's social network to include in the augmented reality environment. In some scenarios, step <b>1570</b> may also be performed if the media guidance application cannot find a suitable message based on the entity at step <b>1565</b>.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">If a time-based element is determined at step <b>1570</b>, the media guidance application may select a message from a user's social network record, e.g., record <b>300</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) to find a message related to the time.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">If no time-based element is found at step <b>1570</b> by the media guidance application, the control circuitry <b>1004</b> for the media guidance application may, at step <b>1580</b>, not select a message using a time element. In such a scenario, the media guidance application may select a message from a social network using another basis, such as keyword matching based on metadata for the matching image, or some combination of techniques described herein.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">It is contemplated that the steps or descriptions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> may be used with any other embodiment of this disclosure.
