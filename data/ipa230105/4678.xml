The example system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a rack <b>102</b>, such as a standard 19 inch rack for mounting multiple electronic equipment modules.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The example rack <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a number of computing systems <b>100</b>, a biometric scanner <b>110</b>, a power supply <b>114</b>, a switch <b>116</b>, and a management module <b>118</b>. The computing systems <b>100</b> include software and hardware capable of computing functions, and may be embodied as a server, workstation, storage array, and the like. The biometric scanner <b>110</b> may be implemented as hardware used to capture a biometric signature (such as a finger print, vocal pattern, retinal scan and the like) for verification of identity. The biometric scanner may also operate as a locking mechanism that approves or denies access to one or more components of the computing systems <b>100</b> by matching the biometric signature against authorized signatures stored in a database. The power supply <b>114</b> converts mains AC power to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of the rack <b>102</b>. The switch <b>116</b> may be a network switch that connects components within the rack <b>102</b> to a computer network. The management module <b>118</b> provides system-management functions and is used for configuring and managing the installed components of the rack <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Each of the computing systems <b>100</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a number of components. Examples of components <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>may include CPUs, fans, DIMM slots, a power supply, and the like.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Computing system <b>100</b><i>a </i>is depicted in further detail as an example of one of the computing systems <b>100</b>. The example computing system <b>100</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a number of components <b>106</b><i>a</i>-<b>106</b><i>c</i>, a service processor <b>104</b>, a central processing unit (&#x2018;CPU&#x2019;) <b>120</b>, and main computer memory in the form of RAM (&#x2018;Random Access Memory&#x2019;) <b>108</b>. Stored in RAM <b>108</b> is an agent <b>112</b> and the service processor <b>104</b> is executing an access control module <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The computing system (<b>100</b><i>a</i>) is configured for component access control in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure. The term &#x2018;access control&#x2019; refers to controlling whether a user is authorized to access a component and the type of access the user is authorized (e.g., a duration of access). Access control at the component level allows only authorized users access to a subset of (one or more) components within a computing system while prohibiting those users access to other components of the computing system. That is, access control at the component level provides fine grained security of components within computing systems. Examples of users that may be allowed access to a component within the computing system <b>100</b><i>a </i>are service personnel, system administrators, and the like.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Each of the components of the computing system <b>100</b><i>a </i>may be secured in a variety of manners. The term &#x2018;secured&#x2019; here may refer to physical or virtual (software-based) access as the context requires. For example, hardware components within the computing system <b>100</b><i>a </i>may be physically secured by a cover or lid that locks in place, and physically separated from other components within the computing system <b>100</b><i>a </i>by physical partitions. In another example, software or firmware components may be secured from access by logical locks or passwords.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Access to each of the secured components of the computing system may be allowed through the use of a lock that requires a key, passcode, biometric signature, or the like. For example, a requestor, such as a user, may request access to a component of a computing system by scanning their fingerprint, or other biometric signature, at a biometric scanner, such as the biometric scanner <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The lock or biometric scanner may unlock the cover or lid securing the component for which access is requested, based on a determination of whether the requestor is authorized to physically access the secured component.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A computing system configured according to embodiments of the present disclosure for access control at the component level may include a lock or biometric scanner for each respective component included within the computing system. In such a computing system, the locks or biometric scanners may be positioned local to each respective component of the computing system, grouped together in an array that is positioned local to the computing system, or located remotely from the computing system entirely. A computing system configured for access control at the component level may include only a single lock or biometric scanner for the computing system. In such a computing system, the request for access may be made through the use of the single biometric scanner, and access may be granted only to the components for which the requestor is authorized, while the other components will remain secured.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Access control may also be applied to a rack <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> at the computing system level, where each of the computing systems <b>100</b> is secured from access. In such an example, the requestor may request access, through utilizing a biometric scanner <b>110</b> local to the rack <b>102</b>, to a particular computing system within the rack, and may only access the computing system for which the requestor is authorized.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The example service processor <b>104</b> of the computing system <b>100</b><i>a </i>may execute a module of computing program instructions comprising an access control module <b>105</b> according to embodiments of the present disclosure. That is, the service processor may implement an access control module <b>105</b>. The example access control module <b>105</b> may be configured to receive permissions specifying authorization of physical access to one or more secured components of a computing system by one or more requestors. The access control module <b>105</b> may receive such permissions from a system-wide management module (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that provides an interface for system administrators or other users to manage various aspects of computing systems <b>100</b> as well as computing systems of other racks in, for example, a data center. Such permissions may specify both role based and time based controls over which components are authorized for access.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Role based controls, for example, may specify which components within the computing system a requestor is allowed to access based on the role or type of requestor, such as an administrator, a type of service personnel, and the like. In such an example, the permissions may specify that an administrator-level requestor has access to many components, while a requestor, whose role is a technical service personnel, is allowed access only to the component to be serviced. In another example of role based controls, permissions may specify which components within the computing system a requestor is allowed to access based on a type of service required in the computing system. In such an example, the permissions may specify that a requestor whose role is service personnel to carry out a particular service on the computing system is allowed access only to the components required for the service. The permissions for each requestor may be in the form of a temporary account created for use by the service personnel upon determining a service to be carried out and may be deleted after the service is completed.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Time based controls may specify a time window for which a requestor is allowed access to one or more components, such as a length of time in which access is allowed, a start and end time during a specified date, and the like. The time window for which a requestor is allowed access may be based on the type of service required, the role or type of requestor that is requesting access, and the like. For example, while system administrators may be allowed access to any component and at any point during the day, service personnel carrying out a service on a computing system's CPU may only be allowed access to the CPU, and only for a specified length of time. In such an example, the specified length of time may be determined based on an expected time of service, an admin selected time, a time selected for optimization of the computing system, and the like. In an example embodiment of the present disclosure, the permissions could specify two different requestors that each are authorized access to different components within the same computing system with overlapping time windows.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The example access control module <b>105</b> of the services processor <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may receive, from a requestor, a request to physically access one of the secured components of the computing system <b>100</b><i>a</i>. The access control module <b>105</b> may then determine, based on the received permissions described above, whether the requestor is authorized to physically access the secured component. Responsive to determining that the requestor is authorized to physically access the secured component, the access control module <b>105</b> of the service processor <b>104</b> may then grant the requestor physical access to the secured component while prohibiting the requestor from physically accessing other secured components of the computing system. Prohibiting the requestor from physically accessing other secured components of the computing system may be carried out by only unlocking the component for which the requestor requested access to and is authorized to access, and keeping the remaining components locked and therefore inaccessible to the requestor.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The service processor <b>104</b> may track all access actions and service actions in a log, which may be stored local to the service processor, local to the computing system, or remote from the computing system. Such a log may compare expected events versus performed events. Readers of skill in the art will recognize that such a log will aid in auditing of the computing system.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The service processor <b>104</b> may issue alerts when unauthorized access or events occurs, and lock some or all system components once an unauthorized access event occurs. For example, the service processor may temporarily block or remove all permissions for some or all components of a computing system when an unauthorized access or event occurs, such as for a specified time, until an admin or other approved account restores the system permissions, or the like. The service processor <b>104</b> may also generate temporary credentials to access a physical or logical component, exposes a section on a web interface for credentials management and actions customization, expose a secure API, to automate credentials generation, and communicate with BIOS/UEFI (Basic Input/Output Service or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) to coordinate the authorization of certain actions.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The arrangement of servers and other devices making up the exemplary system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are for explanation, not for limitation. Data processing systems useful according to various embodiments of the present disclosure may include additional servers, routers, other devices, and peer-to-peer architectures, not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, as will occur to those of skill in the art.
