level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">It has been reported that TransMembrane 4 Superfamily Member 4 (TM4SF4) is a type of tetraspanin protein, and other proteins of this class, TM4SF1 and TM4SF5, are up-regulated in expression in many tumors and are involved in epithelial-mesenchymal metastasis and cell migration, and a number of studies associated with cancer cells have been conducted. It has been reported that TM4SF4 is involved in apoptosis and differentiation and invasion capacity of cells in cancer cells. However, there is nothing known about the characteristics of cancer stem cells, and no studies thereof have been conducted. Recently, researchers of the present invention have reported that the TM4SF4 protein promotes cancer stem cell growth, self-renewal ability, and metastasis/invasion in human lung cancer cells. In addition, the researchers have suggested that TM4SF4 promotes the activation of IGF1R&#x3b2;/AKT/NF&#x3ba;B or JAK2(or FAK)/STAT3 as an important signaling system in cancer occurrence, and enhances the characteristics of cancer stem cells by secretion of cytokines that are promoted thereby to make tumors more malignant (Choi S I et al., Oncotarget. 2014; 5 (20):9823-9837, Choi S I et al., Oncotarget. 2017; 8 (60):101284-101297).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Antibodies have been used as therapeutic agents due to high binding specificity to target antigens and stability in the human body. In particular, antibodies with anti-cancer functions are improved to humanized antibodies, single-chain antibodies, double antibodies, and drug-fusion antibodies based on the development of antibody engineering technology to greatly improve the cancer treatment efficacy and have been utilized. However, due to the diversity of cancer characteristics and the induction of resistance to treatment by expression of new antigens, limitations are being pointed out in the types of antigens that are used for targeting cancer cells in the related art, and research continues to search for novel cancer-specific antigens and to derive antibodies against the antigens.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In particular, in the case of cancer that shows resistance to target drugs or radiation therapy which have been used in existing cancer treatments and recurs, it has been reported that the characteristics of cancer stem cells are importantly applied, and as a result, discovery of antigens and securing of specific antibodies that may be used for targeting cancer stem cells are being magnified in importance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Under this technical background, the present inventors have made many efforts to develop novel antibodies targeting cancer stem cells, and as a result, developed novel anti-TM4SF4 antibodies that binds to TM4SF4 with high affinity, and found that the novel antibodies not only significantly inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells including cancer stem cells, but also had excellent anticancer effects, and then completed the present invention.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof that specifically binds to TransMembrane 4 Superfamily Member 4 (TM4SF4).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another object of the present invention is to provide a nucleic acid molecule coding the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, an expression vector comprising the nucleic acid molecule, a host cell comprising the expression vector, and a method for producing an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof comprising culturing the host cell.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a composition for detecting TM4SF4 comprising the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, a detection kit comprising the same, and a method for detecting a TM4SF4 antigen using the same.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Still another object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition for preventing or treating cancer comprising the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof;

From the fact that a heavy chain IgG-HC and a light chain IgG-LC of each antibody are identified at positions of 55 kDa and 26 kDa, respectively, it can be confirmed that the novel antibodies are IgG-type antibodies and unreduced IgG is identified as a band IgG located above 170 kDa, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) is a control for comparing protein amounts.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an antigen responsivity by novel antibodies of the present invention by performing ELISA against a TM4SF4<sub>(126-140)</sub>-BSA antigen.

All the five antibodies showed a high responsivity to a peptide antigen (A to E).

In addition, the term &#x201c;antibody&#x201d; may include a bivalent or bispecific molecule (e.g., a bispecific antibody), a diabody, a triabody or a tetrabody.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the present invention, the term &#x201c;monoclonal antibody&#x201d; refers to an antibody molecule of a single molecular composition obtained from substantially the same antibody group, and such a monoclonal antibody exhibits single-binding specificity and affinity against a specific epitope. In the present invention, the term &#x201c;full-length antibody&#x201d; is a structure having two full-length light chains and two full-length heavy chains, and each light chain is linked to the heavy chain by a disulfide bond. A heavy chain constant region has gamma (&#x3b3;), mu (&#x3bc;), alpha (&#x3b1;), delta (&#x3b4;), and epsilon (&#x3b5;) types, and subclasses of gamma 1 (&#x3b3;1), gamma 2 (&#x3b3;2), gamma 3 (&#x3b3;3), gamma 4 (&#x3b3;4), alpha 1 (&#x3b1;1) and alpha 2 (&#x3b1;2). A light chain variable region has kappa (&#x3ba;) and lambda (&#x3bb;) types. IgG is a subtype, and includes IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the present invention, the terms &#x201c;fragment&#x201d;, &#x201c;antibody fragment&#x201d; and &#x201c;antigen-binding fragment&#x201d; are used interchangeably as referring to any fragment of the antibody of the present invention that retains an antigen-binding function of the antibody. Exemplary antigen-binding fragments include Fab, Fab&#x2032;, F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2</sub>, Fv, dAb, Fd, a complementarity determining region (CDR) fragment, a single-chain antibody (scFv), a bivalent single-chain antibody, a single-chain phage antibody, a diabody, a triabody, a tetrabody, a polypeptide containing one or more fragments of immunoglobulin sufficient to bind to a specific antigen to the polypeptide, and the like, but are not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The Fab has a structure having variable regions of the light and heavy chains, a constant region of the light chain, and a first constant region of the heavy chain (CH1 domain), and has one antigen-binding site. The antigen-binding fragment or antibody fragment of the antibody molecule refers to a fragment that has an antigen-binding function, and Fab&#x2032; has a hinge region including one or more cysteine residues at a C-terminus of the heavy chain CH1 domain, which is different from Fab. The F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>antibody is produced when the cysteine residues in the hinge region of Fab&#x2032; form a disulfide bond. The Fv refers to the smallest antibody fragment having only a heavy chain variable region and a light chain variable region. The double-chain Fv (two-chain Fv) has a heavy chain variable region and a light chain variable region linked by a non-covalent bond, the single-chain Fv may generally form a dimer-like structure such as double-chain Fv because the variable region of the heavy chain and the variable region of the single chain are covalently linked by a peptide linker or directly linked at the C-terminus. Although not limited thereto, these antibody fragments may be obtained using proteolytic enzymes [for example, the entire antibody is restriction-cleaved with papain to obtain Fab, and cleaved with pepsin to obtain an F(ab&#x2032;)<sub>2 </sub>fragment], or may be produced through genetic recombination technology.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the present invention, the term &#x201c;epitope&#x201d; refers to a specific site on an antigen to which immunoglobulin, and an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof are specifically recognized and bound.

In addition, in the present invention, the term &#x201c;light chain&#x201d; includes both a full-length light chain and a fragment thereof including a variable region domain VL including an amino acid sequence having a sufficient variable region sequence to impart specificity to the antigen and a constant region domain CL.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the present invention, the antibody may include all mouse antibodies produced from a mouse and variants obtained by substituting, adding and/or deleting a part of an amino acid sequence of a parent antibody in order to improve the affinity and immunity of the antibody therefrom. The variants are not limited thereto, but examples thereof may include chimeric antibodies, humanized antibodies, affinity optimized antibodies, and the like. The variant generically refers to an antibody in which the same CDR as the parent antibody is included or a part of the parent antibody CDR amino acid sequence is mutated (substituted, added or deleted) under a condition of targeting the same epitope. Such variants may be appropriately adjusted by those skilled in the art in order to improve the affinity and immunity of the antibody within a range in which the binding ability to the same epitope is maintained.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">That is, the antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof of the present invention may include not only a sequence of the anti-TM4SF4 antibody described herein, but also biological equivalents thereof within a range that may specifically recognize TM4SF4. For example, additional changes may be made to the amino acid sequence of the antibody to further improve the binding affinity and/or other biological properties of the antibody. Such modifications include, for example, deletion, insertion and/or substitution of amino acid sequence residues of the antibody. These amino acid variants are made based on the relative similarity of amino acid side-chain substituents, such as hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, charges, sizes and the like. By analysis of the size, shape and type of the amino acid side-chain substituent, it can be seen that arginine, lysine and histidine are all positively charged residues; alanine, glycine and serine have similar sizes; and phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine have similar shapes. Accordingly, based on these considerations, arginine, lysine and histidine; alanine, glycine and serine; and phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine may be biologically functional equivalents.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the present invention, the term &#x201c;chimeric antibody&#x201d; is an antibody obtained by recombining a variable region of a mouse antibody and a constant region of a human antibody, and an antibody with a greatly improved immune response compared to the mouse antibody.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the present invention, the term &#x201c;humanized antibody&#x201d; refers to an antibody in which a protein sequence of an antibody derived from a non-human species is modified to be similar to an antibody variant naturally produced in the human. For example, the humanized antibody may be prepared by recombining a mouse-derived CDR with a human antibody-derived FR to produce a humanized variable region, and then recombining the produced humanized variable region with a constant region of a preferred human antibody. However, if only CDR grafting is performed, the affinity of the humanized antibody is lowered. Therefore, several important FR amino acid residues that are considered to affect a three-dimensional structure of the CDR are affined with those of the mouse antibody to be increased to the same level as the original affinity of the mouse antibody.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the present invention, the term &#x201c;affinity-optimized antibody&#x201d; refers to a variant in which a part of the CDR sequence of a specific antibody is substituted, added, or deleted, and refers to an antibody with improved binding affinity against the antigen while binding to the same antigen epitope as the specific antibody. Specifically, the affinity-optimized antibody of the present invention refers to a variant antibody that binds to the same epitope as (a) an antibody including a heavy chain variable region having CDR-H1 including an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3, CDR-H2 including an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4, and CDR-H3 including an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5; and a light chain variable region having CDR-L1 including an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6, CDR-L2 including an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 7, and CDR-L3 including an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 8; or (b) an antibody including a heavy chain variable region having CDR-H1 including an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 9, CDR-H2 including an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 10, and CDR-H3 including an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 11; and a light chain variable region having CDR-L1 including an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12, CDR-L2 including an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 13, and CDR-L3 including an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 14 of the present invention.

For the Western blot experiment, each cell was collected, 50 &#x3bc;l of a protein lysis solution was added at a time, reacted at 4&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes, and then a pellet and a supernatant were separated with a 4&#xb0; C. centrifuge at 13000 RPM.

In addition, it was observed that among signaling mechanisms involved in cancer malignization, an IGF1R&#x3b2; signaling mechanism was involved. It was found that the malignization of cancer stem cells was regulated through the IGF1R&#x3b2; signal.
