Because each atom has its own characteristic spectral, it can identify substances and determine their chemical composition according to the spectrum. Emission spectrum or absorption spectrum can be used when doing spectral analysis. The advantage of this method is very sensitive and rapid. Spectrometers are usually used for spectral analysis of substances to be detected. However, most spectral analysis instruments have complex structures, which is not conducive to carrying.

The optical crystal <b>11</b> is used to receive the detection light partially reflected by the object to be tested <b>30</b> and convert the partially reflected detection light into interference light. In this embodiment, the optical crystal <b>11</b> is made of an ordinary glass material, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the optical crystal <b>11</b> defines a plurality of slits <b>111</b>; each silt <b>111</b> is filled with optical transparent adhesive <b>113</b>.

Compared with a traditional design of balancing the optical crystal <b>11</b>, the design concept of balancing the optical crystal <b>11</b> with the lens <b>12</b> and the adhesive <b>18</b> can reduce a loss of the adhesive <b>18</b>, prolong the service life of the adhesive <b>18</b>, and better fix the optical crystal <b>11</b>.
