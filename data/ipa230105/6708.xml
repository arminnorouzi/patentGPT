A person skilled in the pertinent art will recognize that other configurations and arrangements can be used without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. It will be apparent to a person skilled in the pertinent art that the present disclosure can also be employed in a variety of other applications.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is noted that references in the specification to &#x201c;one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an example embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;some embodiments,&#x201d; etc., indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but every embodiment may not necessarily include the particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it would be within the knowledge of a person skilled in the pertinent art to effect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In general, terminology may be understood at least in part from usage in context. For example, the term &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; as used herein, depending at least in part upon context, may be used to describe any feature, structure, or characteristic in a singular sense or may be used to describe combinations of features, structures or characteristics in a plural sense. Similarly, terms, such as &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; or &#x201c;the,&#x201d; again, may be understood to convey a singular usage or to convey a plural usage, depending at least in part upon context. In addition, the term &#x201c;based on&#x201d; may be understood as not necessarily intended to convey an exclusive set of factors and may, instead, allow for existence of additional factors not necessarily expressly described, again, depending at least in part on context.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Various aspects of wireless communication systems will now be described with reference to various apparatus and methods. These apparatus and methods will be described in the following detailed description and illustrated in the accompanying drawings by various blocks, modules, units, components, circuits, steps, operations, processes, algorithms, etc. (collectively referred to as &#x201c;elements&#x201d;). These elements may be implemented using electronic hardware, firmware, computer software, or any combination thereof. Whether such elements are implemented as hardware, firmware, or software depends upon the particular application and design constraints imposed on the overall system.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The techniques described herein may be used for various wireless communication networks, such as code division multiple access (CDMA) system, time division multiple access (TDMA) system, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) system, orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system, single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) system, and other networks. The terms &#x201c;network&#x201d; and &#x201c;system&#x201d; are often used interchangeably. A CDMA network may implement a radio access technology (RAT), such as Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA), CDMA 2000, etc. A TDMA network may implement a RAT, such as Global System for Mobile communication (GSM). An OFDMA network may implement a RAT, such as Long-Term Evolution (LTE) or New Radio (NR). The techniques described herein may be used for the wireless networks and RATs mentioned above, as well as other wireless networks and RATs.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Transmitter IQ calibration can be performed in a variety of ways. An external equipment or an on-chip IQ-calibrated receiver is required for transmitter IQ calibration in some approaches. Likewise, an external signal generator or an on-chip signal generator is required for receiver IQ calibration in some approaches.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Some embodiments of the present disclosure rely on an on-chip un-calibrated transmitter auxiliary receiver (TAR) to calibrate the transmitter IQ mismatch during normal uplink traffic for a 5G NR sub-6 or LTE transceiver. It can also be used for the receiver IQ mismatch calibration during normal uplink traffic if the receiver is frequency tuned and functions as a TAR.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Some embodiments of the present disclosure may directly compute compensation coefficients and may thereby provide a highly efficient search approach to avoid an exhaustive search.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Some embodiments of the present disclosure may use hardware that can also serve another purpose, such as a TAR, for an extra purpose. Moreover, some embodiments may employ a closed-form mathematical solution that makes direct computation feasible. This approach may save calibration time. Calibration time reduction may be valuable for cellular transceivers or other transceivers that cover multiple frequency bands/channels and therefore rely on many calibrations.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Some embodiments of the present disclosure can be implemented in a radio frequency (RF) transceiver integrated circuit (IC) inside a cellphone, smart phone, or other user equipment. Some embodiments may be particularly useful for emerging fifth generation (5G) technology as the higher data throughput, and newly deployed frequency bands may benefit from tighter RF calibration tolerances and thus longer calibration time with other calibration schemes. A more time-efficient and more economical calibration scheme is a welcome feature for saving costs and improving performance for the cellphone manufacturers.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Some embodiments of the present disclosure utilize an RF delay-line or equivalent circuit (any equivalent circuit can be referred to as an RF delay line herein) to calibrate in-phase and quadrature (also referred to as IQ) mismatch, which is also known as residual-sideband (RSB), for either a transmitter or receiver.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A quadrature mixer in an RF transmitter or receiver can have IQ mismatches due to, for example, the gain and/or phase mismatches between the two paths, namely between the I path and the Q path.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a mathematical model for transmitter IQ mismatch. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a mathematical model for receiver IQ mismatch.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The mathematic models for the end-to-end system demonstrate that if the transmitter output is connected with the receiver input, the same carrier frequency is applied, and the output of the receiver baseband is observed, the transmitter IQ mismatch and the receiver mismatch would be superposed on one another. Thus, superposition may prevent one from calibrating either the transmitter or the receiver. One can calibrate either the transmitter or the receiver first with additional equipment followed by the calibration of the other of the transmitter or the receiver.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Some embodiments, on the other hand, may use an RF delay-line, phase shifter, or other equivalent circuits. The RF delay line or phase shifter may have a deterministic but unknown value (for example, it is not necessary for the designer or user to know the precise value of the RF delay line or phase shifter). The use of the RF delay line or phase shifter can separate the transmitter IQ mismatch from the receiver mismatch if the baseband outputs are collected for both cases: a first case when the phase shifter is bypassed and a second place when the phase shifter in place. Either case can be first in time, and consequently, first and second here are just to distinguish the two cases.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">By first extracting the combined IQ mismatches for the two cases and then solving suitable equations, the IQ mismatch coefficients can be extracted for both the transmitter and the receiver simultaneously and without the need for additional external equipment.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an end-to-end system model, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.

These are illustrated as parallel processes because either path may be followed first or second. The applying a transmit signal with a delay line at <b>420</b> or applying a transmit signal without a delay line at <b>430</b> can also be considered as controlling the transmitter to send a first transmit signal to the receiver with a delay between an output of the transmitter and an input of the receiver and controlling the transmitter to send a second transmit signal to the receiver without the delay between the output of the transmitter and the input of the receiver.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, after the transmission signal has been applied with a delay line at <b>420</b>, receive signals can be collected from the delayed path at <b>422</b>, and e<sup>j&#x3b8; </sup>and &#x3b5;<sub>T</sub>e<sup>j&#x3b8;</sup>+&#x3b5;<sub>R</sub>e<sup>&#x2212;j&#x3b8;</sup> can be extracted at <b>424</b>.

For example, if a coded pulse train is applied on one path, an identical coded pulse train may be applied to the other path.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, when the same process is repeated with the newly applied compensation coefficients in place, the result may be obtaining changes to the compensation coefficients of the system transceiver based on the sending the third transmit signal and the sending the fourth transmit signal. These changes may provide an incremental improvement to the newly applied compensation coefficients. While the process may be repeated many times, in practice one or two repetitions of the process may provide suitable compensation coefficients.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Some embodiments of the present disclosure may provide various benefits and/or advantages. The approach may provide time savings. A two-step data collection can be used to obtain both the transmitter compensation coefficients and the receiver ones simultaneously. Additionally, no pre-calibrated participant may be required. The approach may also provide cost savings. Neither external equipment nor an on-chip signal generator is required, but instead, only an RF delay-line, phase shifter, or equivalent circuit can be used. Furthermore, the components the RF delay-line, phase shifter, or equivalent circuit may not have demanding specifications with high precision known values or the like.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">There may be other ways to provide calibration. For example, instead of the delay path, a non-linear loopback path may be sued. This approach may have the advantage that the receiver path may not require prior calibration. On the other hand, this approach may rely on non-linear terms generated by transmitter-receiver (T-R) loopback, which can also come from nonlinearity from transmitter or receiver and which can mask the wanted error signal and thus degrade calibration accuracy. As another example, receiver IQ mismatch can be calibrated using an on-chip tone generator. This approach may be accurate if a smart search algorithm for the coefficients is implanted and may be fast if a direct computation is applied. On the other hand, this approach may require more accurate and consequently expensive hardware and may only be used for receiver calibration.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a system for transceiver calibration, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.
