A &#x201c;computer system,&#x201d; as used herein, may include or be implemented as a specific purpose computer system for carrying out the functionalities described in this paper. In general, a computer system will include a processor, memory, non-volatile storage, and an interface. A typical computer system will usually include at least a processor, memory, and a device (e.g., a bus) coupling the memory to the processor. The processor can be, for example, a general-purpose central processing unit (CPU), such as a microprocessor, or a special-purpose processor, such as a microcontroller.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Memory of a computer system includes, by way of example but not limitation, random access memory (RAM), such as dynamic RAM (DRAM) and static RAM (SRAM). The memory can be local, remote, or distributed. Non-volatile storage is often a magnetic floppy or hard disk, a magnetic-optical disk, an optical disk, a read-only memory (ROM), such as a CD-ROM, EPROM, or EEPROM, a magnetic or optical card, or another form of storage for large amounts of data. During execution of software, some of this data is often written, by a direct memory access process, into memory by way of a bus coupled to non-volatile storage. Non-volatile storage can be local, remote, or distributed, but is optional because systems can be created with all applicable data available in memory.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Software in a computer system is typically stored in non-volatile storage. Indeed, for large programs, it may not even be possible to store the entire program in memory. For software to run, if necessary, it is moved to a computer-readable location appropriate for processing, and for illustrative purposes in this paper, that location is referred to as memory. Even when software is moved to memory for execution, a processor will typically make use of hardware registers to store values associated with the software, and a local cache that, ideally, serves to speed up execution. As used herein, a software program is assumed to be stored at an applicable known or convenient location (from non-volatile storage to hardware registers) when the software program is referred to as &#x201c;implemented in a computer-readable storage medium.&#x201d; A processor is considered &#x201c;configured to execute a program&#x201d; when at least one value associated with the program is stored in a register readable by the processor.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one example of operation, a computer system can be controlled by operating system software, which is a software program that includes a file management system, such as a disk operating system. One example of operating system software with associated file management system software is the family of operating systems known as Windows from Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, Wash., and their associated file management systems. Another example of operating system software with its associated file management system software is the Linux operating system and its associated file management system. The file management system is typically stored in the non-volatile storage and causes the processor to execute the various acts required by the operating system to input and output data and to store data in the memory, including storing files on the non-volatile storage.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The bus of a computer system can couple a processor to an interface. Interfaces facilitate the coupling of devices and computer systems. Interfaces can be for input and/or output (I/O) devices, modems, or networks. I/O devices can include, by way of example but not limitation, a keyboard, a mouse or other pointing device, disk drives, printers, a scanner, and other I/O devices, including a display device. Display devices can include, by way of example but not limitation, a cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display (LCD), or some other applicable known or convenient display device. Modems can include, by way of example but not limitation, an analog modem, an IDSN modem, a cable modem, and other modems. Network interfaces can include, by way of example but not limitation, a token ring interface, a satellite transmission interface (e.g. &#x201c;direct PC&#x201d;), or other network interface for coupling a first computer system to a second computer system. An interface can be considered part of a device or computer system.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Computer systems can be compatible with or implemented as part of or through a cloud-based computing system. As used in this paper, a cloud-based computing system is a system that provides virtualized computing resources, software and/or information to client devices. The computing resources, software and/or information can be virtualized by maintaining centralized services and resources that the edge devices can access over a communication interface, such as a network. &#x201c;Cloud&#x201d; may be a marketing term and for the purposes of this paper can include any of the networks described herein. The cloud-based computing system can involve a subscription for services or use a utility pricing model. Users can access the protocols of the cloud-based computing system through a web browser or other container application located on their client device.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">A computer system can be implemented as an engine, as part of an engine, or through multiple engines. As used in this paper, an engine includes at least two components: 1) a dedicated or shared processor or a portion thereof; 2) hardware, firmware, and/or software modules executed by the processor. A portion of one or more processors can include some portion of hardware less than all of the hardware comprising any given one or more processors, such as a subset of registers, the portion of the processor dedicated to one or more threads of a multi-threaded processor, a time slice during which the processor is wholly or partially dedicated to carrying out part of the engine's functionality, or the like. As such, a first engine and a second engine can have one or more dedicated processors, or a first engine and a second engine can share one or more processors with one another or other engines. Depending upon implementation-specific or other considerations, an engine can be centralized, or its functionality distributed. An engine can include hardware, firmware, or software embodied in a computer-readable medium for execution by the processor. The processor transforms data into new data using implemented data structures and methods, such as is described with reference to the figures in this paper.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The engines described in this paper, or the engines through which the systems and devices described in this paper can be implemented, can be cloud-based engines. As used in this paper, a cloud-based engine is an engine that can run applications and/or functionalities using a cloud-based computing system. All or portions of the applications and/or functionalities can be distributed across multiple computing devices and need not be restricted to only one computing device. In some embodiments, the cloud-based engines can execute functionalities and/or modules that end users access through a web browser or container application without having the functionalities and/or modules installed locally on the end-users' computing devices.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used in this paper, datastores are intended to include repositories having any applicable organization of data, including tables, comma-separated values (CSV) files, traditional databases (e.g., SQL), or other applicable known or convenient organizational formats. Datastores can be implemented, for example, as software embodied in a physical computer-readable medium on a general- or specific-purpose machine, in firmware, in hardware, in a combination thereof, or in an applicable known or convenient device or system. Datastore-associated components, such as database interfaces, can be considered &#x201c;part of&#x201d; a datastore, part of some other system component, or a combination thereof, though the physical location and other characteristics of datastore-associated components is not critical for an understanding of the techniques described in this paper.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Datastores can include data structures. As used in this paper, a data structure is associated with a way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently within a given context. Data structures are generally based on the ability of a computer to fetch and store data at any place in its memory, specified by an address, a bit string that can be itself stored in memory and manipulated by the program. Thus, some data structures are based on computing the addresses of data items with arithmetic operations; while other data structures are based on storing addresses of data items within the structure itself. Many data structures use both principles, sometimes combined in non-trivial ways. The implementation of a data structure usually entails writing a set of procedures that create and manipulate instances of that structure. The datastores, described in this paper, can be cloud-based datastores. A cloud based datastore is a datastore that is compatible with cloud-based computing systems and engines.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Assuming a CRM includes a network, the network can be an applicable communications network, such as the Internet or an infrastructure network. The term &#x201c;Internet&#x201d; as used in this paper refers to a network of networks that use certain protocols, such as the TCP/IP protocol, and possibly other protocols, such as the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) for hypertext markup language (HTML) documents that make up the World Wide Web (&#x201c;the web&#x201d;). More generally, a network can include, for example, a wide area network (WAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), campus area network (CAN), or local area network (LAN), but the network could at least theoretically be of an applicable size or characterized in some other fashion (e.g., personal area network (PAN) or home area network (HAN), to name a couple of alternatives). Networks can include enterprise private networks and virtual private networks (collectively, private networks). As the name suggests, private networks are under the control of a single entity. Private networks can include a head office and optional regional offices (collectively, offices). Many offices enable remote users to connect to the private network offices via some other network, such as the Internet.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The patient wearable devices <b>104</b> are intended to represent devices that include sensors or trackable components used to facilitate a determination regarding patient environmental, physiological (including body position, temperature, pulse, or the like), and/or other data associated with the patent to which the devices are affixed. The patient wearable devices may or may not include multiple functionally similar devices, one of which can be worn while the other(s) are (re)charged. In a specific implementation, the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> include a sensor suite, such as a three-axis accelerometer and an orientation sensor, and a datastore of detected stimuli. It could also include a gyroscope and a magnetometer, which can improve the sensor up to a six-axis sensor (with either a gyroscope or magnetometer) or nine-axis sensor (with both). Without a magnetometer and/or gyroscope, it may be desirable to use a technique called dead reckoning to determine patient orientation, and a dead reckoning engine could be implemented on the paired patient devices <b>106</b> in such an embodiment. The patient wearable devices <b>104</b> can also include a radio frequency (RF) transceiver. In an implementation that includes an RF transceiver, the datastore of detected stimuli can be relatively small (and may or may not comprise only volatile storage), particularly if the datastore contents are transmitted with sufficient speed to free up space within the datastore; the datastore can also overwrite old data to free up space on the device. In some implementations, such as where the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> include something similar to a smart watch, the datastore can be relatively large, which can enable the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> to send data from the datastore in batches, preprocess the data to reduce transmission size, determine whether data parameters exceed an alert threshold prior to sending the data via an RF transmitter (which can include e.g., deleting redundant, erroneous, or otherwise ultralow priority data and/or maintaining historic data deemed time-insensitive or low priority for uploading later when the device is operationally connected to a docking station), or take other actions that reduce resource consumption (e.g., of battery, wireless bandwidth, or other resources). In an implementation that includes an RF transceiver, a subset (which can include all) of the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> can include a configurable pairing module that is used to pair one or more of the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> to some other device, such as a caregiver mobile device, docking station communications device, or some other paired endpoint device.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It may be noted that the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> can include an RF transmitter or RF transponder, though the term &#x201c;RF transceiver&#x201d; is intended to include devices that act as RF transponders unless explicitly indicated to be an RF transponder and, of course, an RF transceiver includes an RF transmitter (in addition to an RF receiver). In an implementation that includes an RF transponder, one or more of the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> can include an RFID tag that includes an RF transponder that is triggered by an electromagnetic interrogation pulse from an RFID reader device. RFID tags can be used for the purpose of inventory; a pairing module is more likely to be utilized by patient wearable devices <b>104</b> when uniquely associated with a patient, though this is not an explicit requirement.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Instead or in addition, sensors capable of determining patient position using electromagnetic waves (e.g., visible, infrared, or ultraviolet light), acoustic waves, or other stimuli, are deployed near a patient to improve physiological state precision and/or accuracy. Such technologies can assist in interpreting sensor data regarding patient position, analyze facial features to determine emotional state, detect motion, listen for sounds (e.g., breathing, verbalizations, or the like), or perform remote temperature measurements, to name a few examples.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a specific implementation, the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> are purposefully built or configured Internet of Things (IoT) devices, or collections of IoT devices. In being purposely built IoT devices, the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> are built to have specific operational parameters. For example, a patient wearable devices <b>104</b> may be configured to provide data from a three dimensional accelerometer and orientation sensor. In being purposely configured IoT devices, the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> can be configured to operate according to specific operational parameters in accordance with input from a human or artificial agent. For example, patient wearable devices <b>104</b> can include a protocol to curate detected stimuli in accordance with a data reduction algorithm. As another example, an agent can specify an IoT device should retain raw data until docked.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The paired patient devices <b>106</b> are intended to represent devices capable of receiving measured or estimated patient environmental, physiological (including body position, temperature, pulse, or the like), and/or other data either directly from the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> or indirectly through a network coupled to both the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> and the paired patient devices <b>106</b>. The environmental, physiological, or other data can be referred to as data included in patient state data, which represents measurement data of a patient or the environment around the patient, all of which can be characterized as data associated with a patient. Unless context dictates otherwise, historical patient state is considered part of current patient state at least in part because state transitions of complex systems, such as the human body, can be diagnostically relevant when assessing current patient state. (In addition to data representative of historical patient state, patient state data can include predicted, target, or other non-historical patient state, but unless context dictates otherwise patient state is intended to represent current patient state.) The paired patient devices <b>106</b> are referred to as &#x201c;paired&#x201d; because, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the paired patient devices <b>106</b> are paired with at least one of the patient wearable devices <b>104</b>. Advantageously, pairing enables the utilization of user-friendly, ubiquitous, secure communications technology that should require little or no training for relevant parties. It may be noted that communications technologies other than pairing can be used to transmit data from the patient wearable devices <b>104</b>, either directly or indirectly, to end user devices.

In a specific implementation, the paired patient devices <b>106</b> are configured upon startup, e.g., by having them scan a QR code to request a unique certificate that allows the device to be trusted within a facility or portion thereof.

However, there are implementations in which more than one such device is used. For example, a room may have a single patient device docking station but two beds. In such a scenario, rather than having multiple patient-dedicated docking stations, you could have a single docking station with two paired endpoint devices, one per bed. Continuing this scenario, you could have multiple agnostic patient wearable devices that you pair with the applicable end point device when deploying for a specific patient.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The devices docking station <b>108</b> is intended to represent one or more devices that provides a simplified way of &#x201c;plugging-in&#x201d; or docking a mobile device. In this context, docking means putting the devices docking station <b>108</b> into an applicable configuration vis-&#xe0;-vis the patient wearable devices <b>104</b>, such as by connecting, nesting, housing, holding, or otherwise coupling at least one of the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> to the devices docking station <b>108</b>. Because a wide range of dockable devices&#x2014;from mobile telephones to wireless mice&#x2014;have different connectors, power signaling, and uses, the devices docking station <b>108</b> may be specifically designed for the patient wearable devices <b>104</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a specific implementation, the devices docking station <b>108</b> is configured to recharge the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> when docked.

In an implementation in which an on-device datastore includes detected stimuli (or processed data) from when a first of the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> is deployed (e.g., worn by a patient), data from the datastore may or may not also be downloaded from the first patient wearable device when it is operationally connected to the devices docking station <b>108</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a specific implementation, the devices docking station <b>108</b> is configured to recharge the paired patient devices <b>106</b> when docked.

To the extent the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> and the paired patient devices <b>106</b> are different, the devices docking station <b>108</b> may be specifically designed to dock the devices using different docking technologies.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Mobile devices can dock and undock hot, cold or standby, depending on the capabilities of the system. In a cold dock or undock, a mobile device is shut down before docking/undocking. In a hot dock or undock, a mobile device remains running when docked/undocked. Standby docking or undocking, an intermediate style used in some designs, allows a mobile device to be docked/undocked while powered on, but requires that it be placed into a sleep mode prior to docking/undocking. In a specific implementation, the devices docking station <b>108</b> allows a docked one of the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> to become a substitute for a desktop computer. In an alternative, the devices docking station <b>108</b> allows a docked one of the paired patient devices <b>106</b> to become a substitute for a desktop computer.

Of course, the patient mobility monitor need not explicitly be at the bedside of a patient (e.g., it could be at a nurse station operationally connected to the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> via a wireless network, such as a mesh network).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The smart patient care cart or fixture <b>110</b> is intended to represent a mobile unit or fixture that includes devices useful to patient care providers. For example, the smart patient care cart or fixture <b>110</b> includes UV disinfection technology; devices can be placed within a chamber that receives UV radiation powered by a battery connected to the smart patient care cart or fixture <b>110</b> or via an electrical outlet when the smart patient care cart or fixture <b>110</b> is stationary. If the smart patient care cart or fixture <b>110</b> is a fixture, the necessity of a battery is diminished, but in some care facility implementations, it is desirable to ensure the device is mobile, increasing the importance of the battery. Other applicable disinfection methodologies beyond UV can be employed, such as ethylene oxide (EO) sterilization or electron beam sterilization. As another example, the smart patient care cart or fixture <b>110</b> includes a computer coupled to a network for sending and receiving data regarding inventory on the smart patient care cart or fixture <b>110</b>, such as items that should be stocked on the smart patient care cart or fixture <b>110</b> (and an indication whether they are), items that have been deployed from the smart patient care cart or fixture <b>110</b>, results of proximity detection of devices tagged with RFID, indications regarding which devices to deploy depending upon patient state, or the like.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a specific implementation, the smart patient care cart <b>110</b> can include slings with RFID tags attached as a patch or embedded during manufacturing, which can be lost and are relatively expensive. By tagging the slings and maintaining a log of deployment at the smart patient care cart <b>110</b>, the deployment, proximity detection, and recovery of slings is improved such that the slings are lost less frequently. Also, there are also hundreds of different types of slings, not all of which are appropriate for a specific patient, intended patient readjustment (or lift), or other applicable situation. If appropriately configured, the smart patient care cart <b>110</b> can even provide instructions to a patient care provider regarding which sling to deploy for a patient depending upon patient state.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The nurse station <b>112</b> is intended to represent a unit at which devices on a floor, wing, building, or other designated space can be monitored. In a hospital or other health care facility, a workstation is often used by a nurse for something other than patient positioning. As used in this paper, the nurse station <b>112</b> is intended to represent only the engines and datastores that utilize the technologies described herein. For example, in a specific implementation, the nurse station <b>112</b> includes an output device (e.g., a dashboard and potentially a speaker) for providing patient position information and an input device (e.g., a button) for summoning lift technicians that is distinct and separate from devices used by a nurse in a conventional nursing station. Where a distinction is desired, the conventional nurse workstation can be referred to as a &#x201c;master nurse workstation&#x201d; and the nurse station <b>112</b> as a &#x201c;nurse station.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a specific implementation, the output device of the nurse station <b>112</b> displays a graphic of patient position in real time and provide alerts depending upon patient state. Factors considered in displaying the graphic and providing alerts include patient body shape, positions to avoid (including, e.g., a clear warning about disallowed positions), risk assessment modelling (e.g., Scott Triggers or non-proprietary assessment tools), indications where to place one or more of the patient wearable devices <b>104</b>, battery level alerts for the patient wearable devices <b>104</b>, countdown to next repositioning, a next (target) position, a summary of how long in each position (typically including medical terms for each position), timeline of positions, and how wiggly a patient is over time. The output device of the nurse station <b>112</b> may or may not also display information sufficient to identify and track a lift technician, including transit time or time with patient, and to obtain lift technician notes (including special notes if applicable) and data from the patient wearable devices <b>104</b>, paired patient devices <b>106</b>, the patient devices docking station <b>108</b>, and/or the smart patient care cart <b>110</b>, though some or all of such information may instead be made available through the lift tracker station <b>114</b> and not the nurse station <b>112</b>, depending upon implementation-, configuration-, and/or preference-specific factors.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a specific implementation, the input device of the nurse station <b>112</b> includes a touch screen (or other applicable technology, such as a keyboard and/or mouse) through which equipment can be requested from vendors and lift technicians summoned; lift technicians can respond with recommended equipment suggestions and be automatically notified when the equipment arrives. Lift technicians can also be auto-directed, depending upon implementation-, configuration-, and/or preference-specific factors, making it unnecessary for a patient care provider or human agent thereof to explicitly make a request in at least some circumstances after the rules for auto-direct are instantiation (which can include initial instantiation).</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a specific implementation, the nurse station <b>112</b> enables a human or artificial agent to monitor multiple patients. The number of patients monitored at the nurse station <b>112</b> depends upon implementation-, configuration-, and preference-specific factors, but can represent a wing, a floor, multiple wings or floors, an entire facility, or some subset of areas within a facility with patients. As such, the nurse station can be characterized as a &#x201c;wing,&#x201d; &#x201c;floor,&#x201d; &#x201c;facility,&#x201d; or more generally a &#x201c;unit&#x201d; patient mobility monitor.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The lift tracker station <b>114</b> is intended to represent a unit at which lift technology information, devices, and people are monitored.

In addition, lift technicians can enter notes (including special notes if applicable) via a mobile device.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The agnostic aggregation station <b>116</b> is intended to represent a unit at which aggregated data about patients, with personally identifying information (PII) and any other information that is deemed to be toxic when freely shared across institutions, has been removed. Such data is referred to herein as &#x201c;toxic&#x201d; data. Toxic data may or may not include facility and/or caregiver data and, to the extent there are multiple different agnostic aggregation stations, some data may be considered toxic for one (e.g., patient, facility, or caregiver information about a facility not under an agent's purview) but not for another (e.g., patient, facility, or caregiver information about a facility or facilities under an agent's purview). The agnostic aggregation station <b>116</b> can have access to some or all of the information available to the nurse station <b>112</b>, minus the toxic data. This data can be used to monitor the success of facilities in providing patient mobility, cost-effective use of resources, and for other purposes that are benefited by the sharing of patient mobility and other (agnostic) patient-related data, facility data, and caregiver data.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an example of operation, a first patient wearable device of the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> is paired with a first paired patient device of the paired patient devices <b>106</b> using configurable pairing technology. The first patient wearable device is then affixed to a patient in a location suitable for providing accurate estimates of patient position, such as on the upper chest (or the back for uncooperative patients). In an alternative, multiple patient wearable devices of the patient wearable devices <b>104</b>, including the first patient wearable device, are affixed to a patient in different locations. The technology for affixing these devices to a patient is described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this example of operation, the first patient wearable device collects raw patient position data via a three axis accelerometer and an orientation sensor. Depending upon implementation-, configuration, and/or preference-specific factors, the raw patient position data can be curated to reduce the amount of data that is transmitted. For example, if no change of position is detected, the first patient wearable device may not send the data. Due to the quality of storage devices available, the historical raw data may be maintained until the first patient wearable device is docked, at which point the data can be transmitted to ensure all historical data is made available. If storage capacity is limited, the first patient wearable device can either transmit all raw patient position data or delete some of it.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this example of operation, the first patient wearable device wirelessly transmits patient position data (which may include all or a subset of the raw patient position data) to the first paired patient device using an RF transceiver and secure communications to the first paired patient device. In a typical implementation, the first paired patient device would be located at a bedside table of the patient, on an IV pole, within the same room, at the entrance to the room, or at some other location that enables the use of low-power transmission. As such, the first patient wearable device can be characterized as a short-range device (SRD). An SRD, described by ECC Recommendation 70-03, which is incorporated by reference, is a radio-frequency transmitter device used in telecommunication for the transmission of information, which has low capability of causing harmful interference to other radio equipment. Short-range devices are low-power transmitters typically limited to 25-100 mW effective radiated power (ERP) or less, depending on the frequency band, which limits their useful range to few hundred meters, and do not require a license from their users. Short-range wireless technologies include Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, near-field communication (NFC), ultra-wideband (UWB) and IEEE 802.15.4, which is incorporated by reference. Because the first paired patient device is located near the first patient wearable device in this example, the transmission can be via a low-power transmission protocol, which increases battery life of and decreases the heat generated by the first patient wearable device.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this example of operation, the first paired patient device provides the patient position data to the patient datastore <b>202</b>. The patient datastore <b>202</b> can initially include patient data that would normally be maintained at a patient care facility, though access to some data may be restricted. For the purposes of this paper, the patient datastore <b>202</b> is intended to represent all available patient data, with the understanding it is possible some useful information could conceivably be made unavailable due to privacy or other concerns. As such, the patient datastore <b>202</b> can be referred to as including &#x201c;available patient data&#x201d; while a patient datastore with unavailable data can be referred to as including &#x201c;unavailable patient data,&#x201d; even if the two different datastores could be stored, e.g., in the same database. The patient datastore <b>202</b> may include data that is available to a nurse, to a lift technician, or to another party, to the exclusion of at least one other party; to the extent such data is available to at least one party acting pursuant to techniques described in this paper, the data is considered available data and, as such, included in the patient datastore <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this example of operation, the first paired patient device and a second patient wearable device of the patient wearable devices <b>104</b> are docked at the patient devices docking station <b>108</b>. The first paired patient device can be operable as a computer while docked or removed for use when a patient care provider or human agent thereof wishes to pick it up. The second patient wearable device is docked for the primary purpose of ensuring it is charged when it comes time to replace the first patient wearable device with the second patient wearable device (at which time the first patient wearable device would be docked for charging). Alternatively, a second patient wearable device could be included in the smart patient care cart <b>110</b> and replaced when a patient care provider or human agent thereof visits the patient.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this example of operation, a patient care provider or human or artificial agent thereof (referred to collectively as a nurse) has access to the patient datastore <b>202</b> through the nurse station <b>112</b>.

The engine responsible for updating the patient state datastore <b>210</b> can be included in the nurse station <b>112</b>, the lift tracker station <b>114</b>, or distributed (or redundant) across both. The patient state datastore <b>210</b> includes a timeline of positions as derived from patient position data detected by at least the first patient wearable device and provided through the first paired patient device, as well as a future timeline of target positions. Importantly, other information is made available in association with patient state, including high risk factors for specific patients in real time, such as low mobility but apparently getting out of bed, exhibiting pre-fall warning signs. Other information associated with patient risk and positioning issues include attitude (e.g., stubbornness), sex or gender (e.g., male), age (e.g. over 60 years of age), medication effects, including side effects (e.g., dizziness), length of stay, DVT, previous falls, environmental conditions (e.g., IV pole that could trip a patient), or the like.

It may be noted that a garment or other item is more likely to cause erroneous patient position readings than if the wearable is affixed directly to the patient.

The diagram <b>500</b> includes a patient's leg <b>502</b>, a cast on the patient's leg <b>504</b>, a wearable device mount <b>506</b>, and a patient wearable device <b>508</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">As was described previously, a wearable device mount is typically adhered to the upper chest of a patient. In some instances, such as if you have an uncooperative patient, you may adhere the wearable device mount to a location that is difficult to reach, such as middle back. In yet other instances, the device may be attached to some other location, which is represented by the illustration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Specifically, the patient's leg <b>502</b> has a relatively rigid device attached thereto in the form of the cast on the patient's leg <b>504</b>. Because the device is relatively rigid, it is a suitable place to affix the wearable device mount <b>506</b> and, therefore, the patient wearable device <b>508</b>. Also, this is likely the portion of the body for which monitoring may be desired, taking some of the emphasis off of pressure ulcer prevention in favor of injured body part monitoring.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In an alternative, the wearable device mount <b>506</b> is fabricated into a device, such as a prosthetic. It would become unnecessary to attach the wearable device mount in such an alternative, but the wearable devices can be affixed to the mount in much the same manner as with a mount that is affixed using an adhesive, strap, or other temporary attachment technology.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref> are diagrams of examples of a wearable patient device mount. The diagram <b>600</b> includes an adhesive backing <b>602</b> and a wearable device mounting frame <b>604</b>. In a specific implementation, the adhesive backing <b>620</b> includes a sheet that is removed prior to adhering the wearable device mount to a patient. The sheet (not shown) can prevent the adhesive from losing its adhesive properties by covering it and protecting it from dust or other contamination. The wearable device mounting frame <b>604</b> is designed for use with an apple watch, which includes a form factor and ridges that enable the apple watch to be snapped into the wearable device mounting frame <b>604</b>. Alternatives include adjustments to the wearable device mounting frame <b>604</b> to receive a form factor other than that of an apple watch.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The diagram <b>700</b> is similar to the diagram <b>600</b> but includes an oversized knob <b>702</b> that facilitates manipulation of a mounted wearable device by a person wearing gloves, which is typical of nursing staff.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The diagram <b>800</b> is similar to the diagram <b>700</b> but includes a snap-and-twist device <b>802</b> that enables a wearable device to be more securely seated in the mount.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> are diagrams <b>900</b> and <b>1000</b> of examples of a bedside patient mobility monitor. The diagram <b>900</b> includes a base <b>902</b>, a smartphone <b>906</b>, a screen bezel <b>908</b>, and a wearable patient devices compartment door <b>924</b>. In a specific implementation, the smartphone <b>906</b> represents a paired patient device and the other components represent a device docking station. See, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, paired patient devices <b>106</b> and devices docking station <b>108</b>.

As was mentioned previously, the patient mobility monitor need not explicitly be at &#x201c;bedside&#x201d; and could instead be located at a nurse station.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this example, the base <b>902</b> is configured for placement on a surface. In alternatives, the base <b>902</b> is instead attached to an IV pole. The base <b>902</b> is optional in the sense the components could be held together in some fashion without attaching them to a base. The smartphone <b>906</b> is intended to represent one of many possible network connected devices suitable for use as a paired patient device. The screen bezel <b>908</b> is intended to represent one of many possible form factors for displaying a screen of a network connected device or a screen to which the network connected device is coupled (so as to enable monitoring by a person who can see the screen). Because, in this example, the screen is that of the smartphone <b>906</b>, the screen bezel basically provides an opening or transparent cover through which the smartphone screen can be viewed and, in an implementation in which the screen is a touchscreen, used as an input device. The wearable patient devices compartment door <b>924</b> is intended to represent a door to a compartment in which wearable patient devices are docked. In a specific implementation the compartment is a concavity formed within the screen bezel. In an alternative, the compartment is a flat surface of the screen bezel and the wearable patient devices compartment door <b>924</b> is concave enabling wearable devices to fit within the compartment. In any case, the compartment is defined by a concavity within the screen bezel, if any, and the wearable patient devices compartment door <b>924</b> when closed.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">The diagram <b>1000</b> includes a base <b>1002</b>, a smartphone <b>1006</b>, a screen bezel <b>1008</b>, and a wearable patient devices compartment door <b>1024</b>.
