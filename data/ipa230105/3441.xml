These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to practice these embodiments without undue experimentation. It should be understood, however, that the embodiments and examples described herein are given by way of illustration only, and not by way of limitation. Various substitutions, modifications, additions, and rearrangements may be made that remain potential applications of the disclosed techniques. Therefore, the description that follows is not to be taken as limiting on the scope of the appended claims. In particular, an element associated with a particular embodiment should not be limited to association with that particular embodiment but should be assumed to be capable of association with any embodiment discussed herein.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Changing the temperature of a beverage for personal consumption is commonly practiced. For example, herbs may be mixed with heated water to make tea. However, immediately after the tea is removed from the heating source, the tea's temperature begins to change to match the atmospheric temperature. The rate at which the beverage's temperature changes may differ for each environment; nonetheless the beverage's temperature will invariably change. Thus, the beverage's initial temperature (i.e., first sip) will not be the same as the beverage's final temperature (i.e., last sip), unless the person quickly consumes the entire beverage, which can be dangerous and not ideal.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Conversely, beverages may be kept in refrigeration systems until they are removed for personal consumption. Again, once the beverage is removed from the cooling source, the beverage's temperature begins to change to match the atmospheric temperature.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Maintaining a preferred drinking temperature becomes problematic if the surrounding atmospheric temperature does not match the temperature of the beverage. A person would need to quickly consume the entire beverage to enjoy the drink at the preferred temperature. Quickly consuming a beverage can be dangerous, especially if the beverage is large (e.g., greater than 30 ounces) or contains alcohol.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The embodiments described herein describes the apparatus and method of maintaining a beverage's temperature during any rate of personal consumption. The rate of consuming a beverage may vary from person to person; however, the rate at which the beverage's temperature changes will be minimal. The embodiments described herein allows a person to consume a beverage at any desirable rate while the beverage maintains a temperature of between 32 degrees to 45 degrees Fahrenheit (i.e. 0 degrees Celsius to 7.22 degrees Celsius).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is perspective view of a beverage cooling unit.
