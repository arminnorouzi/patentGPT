Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, a conventional optical fiber connector <b>1</b> includes a casing body <b>11</b>, a head sleeve <b>12</b> disposed in the casing body <b>11</b>, two core heads <b>13</b> mounted between the casing body <b>11</b> and the head sleeve <b>12</b> and arranged vertically spaced apart from each other, a tail sleeve <b>14</b> connected removably to a rear end of the casing body <b>11</b>, a handling lever <b>15</b> disposed on the casing body <b>11</b> and extending rearwardly, and two engaging members <b>16</b> extending from the casing body <b>11</b> upwardly. When it is desired to connect the optical fiber connector <b>1</b> to an adaptor or a socket (not shown), the casing body <b>11</b> is inserted into the adapter or the socket, and at least one of the engaging members <b>16</b> is engaged into a slot formed in the adaptor or the socket, such that the core heads are connected with another two core heads (not shown) inserted into the adaptor or the socket, respectively. By use of various pairing modes of the core heads <b>13</b>, a change in polarity of connection can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When adjusting the polarity of the conventional optical fiber connector <b>1</b>, it is required to remove the optical fiber connector <b>1</b> from the adaptor or the socket. Then, the optical fiber connector <b>1</b> is inverted and is inserted into the adaptor or the socket again. However, engagement between the engaging members <b>16</b> and the slots formed in the adaptor or the socket results in difficulty of removal of the optical fiber connector <b>1</b> from the adaptor or the socket, which in turn results in wearing of the engaging members <b>16</b> and the adaptor or the socket and even breakage of the engaging members <b>16</b>. Further, in a case where a plurality of the conventional optical fiber connectors <b>1</b> with different polarities are arranged side-by-side, it is difficult to arrange the optical fiber connectors <b>1</b> neatly since some of the handling levers <b>15</b> are located above the casing bodies <b>11</b>, while the remaining handling levers <b>15</b> are located below the casing bodies <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The polarity of the optical fiber connector <b>1</b> can also be adjusted by first removing the tail sleeve <b>14</b> from the casing body <b>11</b>. Next, the head sleeve <b>12</b> is detached from the casing body <b>11</b> and the core heads <b>13</b> are removed from the casing body <b>11</b> to exchange positions of the core heads <b>13</b>.

Each of the lateral wall portions <b>313</b> of the casing sleeve <b>31</b> has a front inclined surface <b>314</b> inclined rearwardly and outwardly along the front-rear direction (A), and has an engaging slot <b>315</b> formed therethrough along the left-right direction (B). One of the protruding portions <b>312</b> is formed with a positioning slot <b>316</b> extending rearwardly along the front-rear direction (A). The positioning slot <b>316</b> is aligned with the sliding slot <b>216</b> along the up-down direction (C).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The receiving seat <b>32</b> includes a seat portion <b>321</b> connected to a rear end of the casing sleeve <b>31</b>, two boss portions <b>322</b> (only one is visible) protruding respectively from the seat portion <b>321</b> and away from each other along the left-right direction (B), two tenon portions <b>323</b> (only one is visible) protruding away from each other from the seat portion <b>321</b> along the left-right direction (B), two engaging portions <b>324</b> protruding from the seat portion <b>321</b> away from each other along the up-down direction (C) and disposed behind the tenon portions <b>323</b>, and a polarity adjusting portion <b>325</b> protruding from the seat portion <b>321</b> along the up-down direction (C), extending through the positioning slot <b>316</b> of the casing sleeve <b>31</b> and the slot unit of the ferrule <b>2</b> along the up-down direction (C) and having a portion exposed outwardly of the ferrule <b>2</b>. Each of the lateral wall portions <b>313</b> is movable along the front-rear direction (A) to contact a respective one of the boss portions <b>322</b> to constitute a protrusion unit <b>34</b>. The two protrusion units <b>34</b> of the insert body <b>3</b> protrude away from each other along the left-right direction (B) and respectively and detachably engage the limiting slots <b>215</b> of the connecting wall portions <b>213</b>. Each of the limiting slots <b>215</b> has a dimension along the front-rear direction (A) greater than a length of a corresponding one of the protrusion units <b>34</b> along the front-rear direction (A), so that the insert body <b>3</b> is movable relative to the ferrule <b>2</b> along the front-rear direction (A). The tenon portions <b>323</b> engage respectively and detachably the engaging slots <b>315</b> of the lateral wall portions <b>313</b> to position the seat portion <b>321</b> relative to the casing sleeve <b>31</b>, so that the seat portion <b>321</b> is positioned relative to the lateral wall portions <b>313</b> and located behind the casing sleeve <b>31</b>. The polarity-representing marks <b>33</b> are disposed on one of the lateral wall portions <b>313</b>, and are exposed in a corresponding one of the limiting slots <b>215</b>. The polarity-representing marks <b>33</b> can be directly printed engraved on outer surfaces of the lateral wall portions <b>313</b>, or can be implemented by stickers adhered on one of the lateral wall portions <b>313</b> in a form of text or patterns. In this embodiment, the polarity-representing marks <b>33</b> are respectively presented by symbols of &#x201c;+&#x201d; and &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; to indicate the polarities of the core heads <b>5</b>, and a user can realize the polarity of the fiber optic connector according to the polarity-representing marks <b>33</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The tail sleeve <b>4</b> is formed with two engaging openings <b>41</b> (only one is visible) that extend along the up-down direction (C) and that engage respectively and detachably the engaging portions <b>324</b>. Thus, the tail sleeve <b>4</b> is positioned relative to the insert body <b>3</b>. It should be noted that the fiber optic connector of the this embodiment further includes a connecting sleeve <b>6</b> sleeved on the rear end of the insert body <b>3</b> and interconnecting the receiving seat <b>32</b> and the tail sleeve <b>4</b>. In this way, wires extending through the fiber optic connector can be arranged neatly in the tail sleeve <b>4</b> and the insert body <b>3</b>. The core heads <b>5</b> extends removably through the inserted opening <b>214</b> and are inserted fixedly into the front wall portion <b>311</b> of the casing sleeve <b>31</b>. In this embodiment, the heights of the core heads <b>5</b> along the up-down direction (C) are the same as those of the symbols &#x201c;+&#x201d; and &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; presenting the polarity-representing marks <b>33</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In this embodiment, the engaging members <b>23</b> are adapted to be connected to a socket or an adaptor. To adjust the polarity of the fiber optic connector, the lateral frame portions <b>212</b> are moved away from each other along the left-right direction (B) by a tool or a hand of a user such that the protrusion units <b>34</b> are disengaged respectively from the limiting slots <b>215</b>, thereby allowing the insert body <b>3</b> to be removed from the ferrule <b>2</b>. Then, the insert body <b>3</b> is inverted and is inserted into the ferrule <b>2</b> again. The structure of the front inclined surfaces <b>314</b> of the lateral wall portions <b>313</b> pushes the lateral frame portions <b>212</b> away from each other to facilitate insertion of the insert body <b>3</b> into the ferrule <b>2</b> during assembly of the insert body <b>3</b> to the ferrule <b>2</b>. As soon as the front inclined surfaces <b>314</b> are moved completely into the limiting slots <b>215</b>, the lateral frame portions <b>212</b> move toward each other to confine the insert body <b>3</b> therebetween and the protrusion units <b>34</b> are received in and engage the limiting slots <b>215</b>, respectively. Thus, the insert body <b>3</b> is positioned relative to the ferrule <b>2</b>, and the adjustment of the polarity of the fiber optic connector is finished such that the position of the operating handle <b>22</b> would not be changed. At this time, the boss portions <b>322</b> are disposed respectively at rear ends of the limiting slots <b>215</b>. The polarity adjusting portion <b>325</b> can be pushed to move forwardly relative to the ferrule <b>2</b> along the corresponding sliding slot <b>216</b> until the lateral wall portions <b>313</b> come into contact with walls of the lateral frame portions <b>212</b> defining front ends of the limiting slots <b>215</b>. In this way, the insert body <b>3</b> is moved forwardly relative to the ferrule <b>2</b>, so that the core heads <b>5</b> extend outwardly of the inserted opening <b>214</b> to facilitate connection with other elements. It should be particularly noted that, since the polarity adjusting portion <b>325</b> extends outwardly of one of the sliding slots <b>216</b>, polarity of the fiber optic connector can be identified by observing that the polarity adjusting portion <b>325</b> protrudes upwardly or downwardly.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In summary, when adjusting the polarity of the fiber optic connector of the present disclosure, it is not required to remove the engaging members <b>23</b> from the socket or the adapter connected thereto, and removal of the wires from the fiber optic connector is also not required. Thus, it is more convenient to adjust polarity of the fiber optic connector of the present disclosure as compared to the conventional optical fiber connectors described in the background. Further, it is not necessary to invert the operating handle <b>22</b> during polarity adjustment, and a relatively neat arrangement of the optical fiber connector can be achieved. Therefore, the object of the present disclosure can be indeed achieved.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the description above, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details have been set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments.
