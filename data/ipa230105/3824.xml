Connected objects are mostly equipped with a (rechargeable) battery or a cell. The autonomy of the objects is therefore a real hindrance on the expansion of these objects.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In particular, geo-tags are widely used to locate and track objects while they are respectively moving. These tags are fixed to the object or placed in the object and periodically transmit geographical positions, making it possible to locate and track the object while it is moving.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When a parcel is dispatched and it is desired to monitor its movement, a geo-tag is placed inside the parcel. During this journey, the parcel may need to be transported in a larger receptacle, such as a container, a pallet or a trailer of a truck, which is itself equipped with a geo-tag.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">During transportation, the various tags transmit their respective location information, for example their GPS positions, to a traceability server.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, for each geo-tag, sending location data to the server requires a phase of connection to the network and a phase of obtaining location data (for example GPS coordinates). These two phases consume a great deal of electrical energy.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The electricity consumption linked to the communication of data to the server, for example the location data, is for its part very low in comparison with the abovementioned phases.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The problem outlined above is exacerbated by another problem linked to the fact that receptacles, such as metal containers, often act as a Faraday cage, and the tags located in the receptacle attempt in vain to transmit their respective locations and thereby risk rapidly draining their battery levels.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">One aim to be achieved is therefore that of reducing the consumption linked to the two abovementioned phases and of reducing the negative effects linked to Faraday cages.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention aims to improve the situation.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The invention</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">To this end, according to one functional aspect, the invention relates to a method for managing the transmission of the location of a first geo-tag able to communicate with a second geo-tag, the tags being classified into a plurality of respective categories, the first tag being associated with a first category, the method comprising the following steps in the first tag:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0015">a. detecting proximity between the first tag (BAL<b>1</b>) and the second geo-tag (BAL<b>2</b>);</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0016">b. obtaining the category associated with the second tag (BAL<b>2</b>);</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0017">c. transmitting, to the second tag (BAL<b>2</b>), a request to transfer the management of the transmission of the location of the first tag, if the obtained category belongs to a second tag category.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0016" num="0018">In contrast to the prior art, in which each geo-tag manages the transmission of its location on its own, the invention proposes, as soon as proximity is detected between a first tag of a first category and a geo-tag of a second category, to transfer the management of the transmission of the location of the first tag to the second tag. According to the invention, the second tag transmits the identifier of the first tag and its own location. The invention is based on the fact that the receiver, due to the proximity between the geo-tags of the two different categories, assimilates the location of the first tag to the location of the second tag.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0019">By virtue of the invention, once the management has been transferred, the first tag modifies its state so as to consume less electrical energy. For example, the first tag changes to a standby state. In this way, only the second geo-tag, which the first tag has entrusted with managing its location, consumes electrical energy, in particular in the phase of connection to the network and in the phase of obtaining location data. The saving on electrical energy is greater the higher the number of first geo-tags under consideration in the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0020">The invention also provides another advantage due to the fact that the first tag delegates the management of the transmission of the location to a tag of a particular category, for example a tag associated with a receptacle that is not subject to the Faraday cage problem for the transmission of location data; indeed, the second tag associated with the receptacle, such as a container, may be placed outside the receptacle and therefore be less subject to data transmission problems.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0021">According to a first particular mode of implementation of the invention, the categories are ranked; in this configuration, the transmission step is performed based on the hierarchical levels of said categories. This first mode offers a simple solution for deciding whether or not to transfer management. For example, the transmission step takes place if the category associated with the second tag is higher than the hierarchical level of the first tag.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0022">According to another, second particular mode of implementation of the invention, which may be implemented as an alternative or in addition to the previous mode, the transfer is preceded by reception of an acknowledgement message from the second tag. This second mode ensures that the transfer is effective before deciding to modify the electrical state of the first tag; a modification of the electrical state consisting for example in entering a mode that consumes little electricity, for example a standby mode.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0023">According to another, third particular mode of implementation of the invention, which may be implemented as an alternative or in addition to the previous ones, the transfer is stopped as soon as the first tag is out of range of the second tag. This third mode ensures that the second tag stops managing the transmission of the location of the first tag; and more particularly that the second tag stops transmitting the identifier of the first tag.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0024">According to one hardware aspect, the invention relates to a management entity for managing the transmission of the location of a first geo-tag able to communicate with a second geo-tag, the tags being classified into a plurality of respective categories, the first tag being associated with a first category, the entity comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0025">a. a detection module for detecting proximity between the first tag and a second geo-tag;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0026">b. an obtainment module for obtaining the category associated with the second tag;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0027">c. a transmission module able to transmit, to the second tag, a request to transfer the management of the transmission of the location of the first tag, if the obtained category belongs to a second tag category.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0023" num="0028">According to another hardware aspect, the invention relates to a geo-tag comprising a management entity as defined above.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0029">According to another hardware aspect, the invention relates to a computer program able to be implemented on a management entity as defined above, the program comprising code instructions, which, when it is executed by a processor, performs the steps of the method that are defined above.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0030">Finally, the invention relates to a data medium storing at least one series of program code instructions for executing the method defined above.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0031">The data medium may be any entity or device capable of storing the program. For example, the medium may comprise a storage means, such as a ROM, for example a CD-ROM or a microelectronic circuit ROM, or else a magnetic recording means such as a hard disk. Moreover, the information medium may be a transmissible medium such as an electrical or optical signal, which may be routed via an electrical or optical cable, by radio or by other means. The program according to the invention may in particular be downloaded from an Internet network. As an alternative, the information medium may be an integrated circuit in which the program is incorporated, the circuit being designed to execute or to be used in the execution of the method in question.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0032">Finally, it should be pointed out here that, in the present text, the term &#x201c;module&#x201d; or &#x201c;entity&#x201d; may correspond equally to a software component and to a hardware component or a set of hardware and software components, a software component itself corresponding to one or more computer programs or subroutines or, more generally, to any element of a program able to implement a function or a set of functions as described for the modules in question.

In our example, these tags are associated with objects; they may for example be attached to the object or located inside the object. An object is for example a parcel, a suitcase, a container, etc. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates one example of a possible configuration in which the tag BAL<b>1</b> is in a container and the tag BAL<b>2</b> is affixed to the container on the outside.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0041">A tag makes it possible to obtain the position of the tag over time, and implicitly of the object with which it is associated. A tag has the role of transmitting, inter alia, an item of data representative of a location when it is being transported during a journey TRJ.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0042">The tags are able to communicate with a server SRV that receives the locations. The location of the tag makes it possible to locate the object with which it is associated.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0043">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a tag BALn (n=1,2) has a hardware architecture of a conventional computer. It comprises in particular a processor CPUn, a random access memory RAMn (not shown in the figure), and a read-only memory MEMn, such as a Flash, ROM, etc. memory.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0044">The tag BALn is able to transmit data to other tags, either directly or indirectly. Indirect communication could be implemented through a gateway (or router).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0045">Direct communication could be a short-range link RES. A short-range network refers here to a network having limited coverage in terms of distance. In this context, a first tag BAL<b>1</b> may transmit data beyond a given distance, by way of the short-range network, to at least one other tag BAL<b>2</b>. The short-range link is for example an RFID (radiofrequency identification) network, a Bluetooth network, or any other equivalent network. To this end, a tag is equipped with a data transmitter COMn and with a data receiver CPTn able to receive data, or more precisely signals, via this short-range network.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0046">The use of a short-range network has the advantage of identifying geo-tags that are close to one another, communication between two geo-tags being sufficient to establish proximity.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0047">The invention is not limited to short-range networks, but extends to all types of network, such as a Wi-Fi network or the like. The proximity between tags is therefore relative in that it depends on the communication network used.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0048">The tags BAL<b>1</b>/BAL<b>2</b> are also able to transmit data to a remote traceability server SRV via a network having a longer range; such a network is for example a wide area network WAN (not shown in the figures).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0049">The tags BAL<b>1</b>-BAL<b>2</b> are, in our example, also equipped with respective batteries BAT<b>1</b>-BAT<b>3</b> in order to be supplied with electric power. It will be recalled here that the invention is not limited to tags supplied with power by a battery, but extends to all tags, regardless of the electric power source used.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0050">A tag also comprises a location module LOC whose role is that of obtaining an item of location data representative of the location of the tag, and implicitly of the object with which it is associated. In our example, the location module is a geolocation module (GPS) (GPS for global positioning system). The item of location data may also be a postal address, etc.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0051">The tags belong to different categories. In our example, a first category concerns tags used to locate an object such as a parcel; a second category concerns tags used to locate receptacles such as containers possibly containing a plurality of objects or parcels.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0052">According to one particular embodiment, a tag is controlled by the entity ENTn, the index &#x201c;n&#x201d; (n=1 or 2) denoting the tag BAL<b>1</b> or BAL<b>2</b> stored in the memory MEMn. The computer program ENTn comprises instructions for implementing the steps of the management method that will be described below when the program is executed by the processor CPUn.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0053">The entity ENT<b>1</b> has the role of performing the following steps:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0054">detecting proximity between the first tag BAL<b>1</b> and a second geo-tag BAL<b>2</b>,</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0055">the tag then determines the category of the second tag;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0056">if the second tag is associated with a second category, this being the case in our example, the first tag BAL<b>1</b> transmits a command to transfer (or delegate) the transmission of the location to the second tag BAL<b>2</b>. In the opposite case, the method stops and the first tag does not modify its operation.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0049" num="0057">In our example, the command transmitted by the first tag comprises an item of data ID<b>1</b> identifying the first tag.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0058">In our example, once the delegation request has been transmitted, the entity ENT<b>1</b> requests a change of electrical state of the first tag so that it consumes less or no further battery. More particularly, in our example, the tag enters a standby state.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0059">The location of the entity ENT<b>1</b>, just like the entity ENT<b>2</b>, in the system SYS is unimportant. It may be located in a geo-tag or an external device such as a server. In our example, the entities ENT<b>1</b> and ENT<b>2</b> are located in the first tag BAL<b>1</b> and the second tag BAL<b>2</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> schematically illustrates the message exchanges according to one embodiment of the method of the invention. Four lines are shown in this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, specifically three lines representing the two tags BAL<b>1</b>-BAL<b>2</b> and one line SRV representing the server; the exchanged messages are illustrated by way of arrows having an origin associated with one line and an end associated with another line.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0061">Upon initialization, the code instructions of the computer program are for example loaded into a memory before being executed by the processor CPU. The processor CPU of the processing unit in particular implements the following steps:</p><p id="p-0054" num="0062">In a first step ET<b>1</b>, the tags BAL<b>1</b>-BAL<b>2</b> transmit advertising messages including their identifiers ID<b>1</b>-ID<b>2</b>. The second tag furthermore transmits an item of data representative of its category, specifically the second category CAT<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0063">According to one variant, only the tags belonging to the second category transmit an item of data representative of their categories. According to another variant, all of the tags transmit their respective categories.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0064">In a second step ET<b>2</b>, the first tag BAL<b>1</b> is located within the radius of coverage of the second tag BAL<b>2</b> and to this end receives an advertising message from the second tag BAL<b>2</b>. The type of message differs depending on the technology used for the communication. For example, if the UPnP protocol is used, the message may be an Alive SSDP or M-Search message depending on whether or not the tag is a control point; this type of message advertises the presence of the tag that transmits this message. In our example, the advertising message includes an item of data representative of a tag category.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0065">In a third step ET<b>3</b>, after having received the advertising message, the first tag BAL<b>1</b> verifies, in the received message, the category of the second tag BAL<b>2</b>. In our example, the category is a second category distinct from the first category. The second category targets a tag that may be associated with a container-type receptacle.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0066">In a fourth step ET<b>4</b>, the first tag BAL<b>1</b> transmits a message to the second tag BAL<b>2</b>, the message requesting that the second tag BAL<b>2</b> take responsibility for managing the location of the first tag. More particularly, the targeted request is a request to transfer the management of the transmission of the location of the first tag BAL<b>1</b> to the second tag BAL<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0067">In an optional fifth step ET<b>5</b>, the second tag BAL<b>2</b> transmits an acknowledgement message ACK to the first tag BAL<b>1</b> This acknowledgement message effectively transfers the management of the transmission of the location by the second tag BAL<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0068">This acknowledgement message ACK is received in a sixth step ET<b>6</b>. After reception, the first tag BAL<b>1</b> no longer manages the transmission of its location. In our example, the first tag BAL<b>1</b> switches to a standby state in order to reduce its electricity consumption and thus increase the electricity autonomy of its battery.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0069">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, a first tag BAL<b>1</b> may be located in proximity to two tags of a second category. In order to avoid the first tag delegating the management of the transmission of its location to two tags of a second category BAL<b>21</b>/BAL<b>22</b>, a plurality of solutions are conceivable, these being illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0070">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a first solution consists, for the tags of a second category, in transmitting respective battery levels N<b>21</b>/N<b>22</b> to the first tag BAL<b>1</b> In this case, the first tag BAL<b>1</b> may select a tag of a second category based on the battery level N<b>21</b>/N<b>22</b>. In order not to penalize a tag of a second category, the first tag selects the tag of a second category that has the highest battery level.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0071">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a second solution may consist, for tags of a second category receiving two delegation requests, in themselves selecting the tag of a second category that will be selected. More precisely, the steps are as follows:</p><p id="p-0064" num="0072">The first step ET<b>1</b> described above remains unchanged.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0073">In a second step, the first tag BAL<b>1</b> is within the radius of coverage of the tags of a second category BAL<b>21</b> and BAL<b>22</b> and may to this end receive advertising messages from the two tags BAL<b>21</b> and BAL<b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0074">In a third step, after having received the advertising message, the first tag BAL<b>1</b> verifies, in the received message, the categories received from the two tags. In our example, the tags are tags of a second category.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0075">In a fourth step, the first tag BAL<b>1</b> transmits messages to the two tags of a second category BAL<b>21</b> and BAL<b>22</b>, the message requesting that the tags BAL<b>21</b> and BAL<b>22</b> take responsibility for managing the location of the first tag BAL<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0076">In a fifth step, the tags determine the higher battery level out of the two battery levels.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0077">In our example, the battery level of the tag BAL<b>22</b> is higher; the tag BAL<b>22</b> therefore takes responsibility for managing the transmission of the location of the tag BAL<b>1</b> instead of the tag BAL<b>1</b> In this example, the tag BAL<b>21</b> therefore does not generate the transmission of the location for the first tag BAL<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0078">In one step, the tag BAL<b>22</b> transmits an acknowledgement message ACK. At this stage, the first tag may enter a standby state.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0079">It will be considered that, subsequently, the tag BAL<b>22</b> moves and is located out of range of the first tag BAL<b>1</b>. It will also be assumed that the first tag is within the radius of coverage of the second tag BAL<b>21</b>; In this case, the second tag BAL<b>21</b> takes over and manages the transmission of the location of the first tag BAL<b>1</b>.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
