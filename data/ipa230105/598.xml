Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a surgical tool set for implant, and more particularly, to a surgical tool set for implant for implanting a fixture in a jawbone so that the fixture may have a preset position and alignment direction.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Generally, implant is composed of a fixture implanted in an alveolar bone, an abutment inserted and fixed in the fixture, and a prosthesis bonded to cover an upper part of abutment.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A fixture, which is implanted in an alveolar bone, plays the role of tooth root, a prosthesis is made in a tooth-like shape to become the visible part of artificial tooth, and an abutment fixes a prosthesis to a fixture so that loads on the prosthesis are transmitted to the fixture and the alveolar bone.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A final prosthesis should have a size and structure naturally engaging with the residual teeth of a patient in both functional and aesthetic aspects. To this aim, a patient's alveolar bone model is used, and proper prosthetic treatment is needed for each patient. Herein, the model includes a fixture. In addition, such proper prosthetic treatment may be digitally implemented based on a digital model for a patient's alveolar bone in which a fixture is already disposed or not yet. In addition, a prefab abutment may be modified to fit into the shapes of soft gums and teeth. Thus, similar to an interface between a fixture and an alveolar bone, there may be an abutment-fixture interface in which an abutment should be positioned unilaterally for a fixture. When an abutment is fabricated to be positioned in a desired rotational relation for one or all the alveolar bones including a fixture and a neighboring tooth, it may be ensured that a practitioner couples the abutment to the fixture or a specific part of alveolar bone in an exact rotational direction or in an exact alignment position.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A digital model to be used in an actual procedure may be implemented by a <b>3</b>D simulation surgery program that simulates a patient's oral structure, a fixture and an abutment, which are applied to a surgery spot in mouth, and an alignment of tools to be used for the procedure. To align an abutment in a desired position, a fixture needs to be aligned in a specific position or direction in an alveolar bone. For that, a surgery program sets coordinates for a simulated oral structure and a surgery spot and may determine a coordinate in which a fixture and a tool (e.g., sleeve) are located in the surgery spot. A surgery program may construct a library of location coordinates of fixtures and tools and may provide a practitioner with a virtual model showing a location coordinate and/or alignment position and direction between fixtures and tools in a surgery spot.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A practitioner may receive an abutment and an artificial tooth as a single integrated unit or as separate components to be assembled in a patient's mouth. A practitioner who wants to use an abutment and an artificial tooth for a patient needs to recognize initial and final alignment positions according to implantation of a fixture and the rotational orientation of the abutment for the fixture beforehand in order to obtain an alignment intended by an implant manufacturer. For that, through the surgery program, the practitioner should not only identify an initial position of a fixture to be implanted and a final position of an implanted fixture but also recognize an arrangement relation of surgical tools to be used for implantation. However, the existing surgical tools do not provide any function to identify an alignment position or direction of a fixture or a relative arrangement relation between multiple tools. Accordingly, in case the practitioner places a fixture by means of an existing surgical tool, considerable difficulty may occur in exactly aligning the fixture in a specific position according to a relative positional relation between the fixture and the tool, which is set by the surgery program.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A technical object of the present disclosure is to provide a surgical tool set for implant for implanting a fixture in a jawbone so that the fixture may have a preset position and alignment direction.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The objects of the present invention are not limited to the above-mentioned objects, and other objects not mentioned can be clearly understood by those skilled in the art from the following description.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the present disclosure, there is provided a surgical tool set for implant having an implantation driver for implanting a fixture. the implantation driver comprising: a first supporting portion disposed radially in an engagement portion that transmits implantation torque to the fixture; and at least one second supporting portion that is disposed radially in the engagement portion so as to be spacedly apart from the first supporting portion and is arranged asymmetrically with respect to a center point located on a central axis of the implantation driver.

Herein, titanium is normally used as a material of the fixture <b>30</b>, but other types of metal materials may be used as long as no rejection occurs in human body.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The fixture <b>30</b> may include a first area section <b>32</b>, which corresponds to a cortical bone during the implantation of bone tissue, a second area section <b>34</b>, which corresponds to a cancellous bone during the implantation, a third area section <b>36</b> that is disposed by being tapered under the second area section <b>34</b>, a cutting portion <b>44</b> intersecting the second area section <b>34</b> and the third area section <b>36</b>, and a receiving portion <b>46</b> in which a screw (refer to <b>90</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>E</figref>) is coupled to the bottom of a fixture engagement structure <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The first area section <b>32</b> is a part that is mostly inserted into cortical bone, when the fixture <b>30</b> is inserted. Although the first area section <b>32</b> is an upper part of the fixture <b>30</b>, a part of the lower part of the first area section <b>32</b> may be implanted in a cancellous bone. The first area section <b>32</b> may have a plurality of first thread portions <b>38</b> that have a first ridge portion <b>38</b><i>a</i>, which is machined in a spiral shape on an outer circumferential surface, and a first bottom portion <b>38</b><i>b</i>, which is formed with a smaller radius of central axis (radius tending in a radial direction from the central axis of the fixture <b>30</b>). The first ridge portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>and the first bottom portion <b>38</b><i>b </i>are alternately arranged along the central axis direction of the fixture <b>30</b>. The plurality of first thread portions <b>38</b> may be arranged by being spaced at a predetermined angle, for example, an equal angle along the rotating direction of central axis on the outer circumferential surface. The first ridge portion <b>38</b><i>a </i>may be machined to have a radius that begins to increase gradually at a predetermined point in the outer circumference direction. Accordingly, stress on the upper part of a cortical bone may be reduced, and a fixing force at the cortical bone near a cancellous bone may be secured.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The second area section <b>34</b> may be located by being wholly combined with the bottom of the first area section <b>32</b> but is not limited thereto, and another structure may be located between the first and second area sections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. The second area section <b>34</b> is a portion that is mostly inserted into the cancellous bone, but the upper part of the second area section <b>34</b> may be partially implanted in the cortical bone. The second area section <b>34</b> includes a second thread portion <b>40</b>, which has a second ridge portion <b>40</b><i>a </i>machined in a spiral shape on the outer circumferential surface and a second bottom portion <b>40</b><i>b </i>formed with a smaller radius of the central axis, and the second ridge portion <b>40</b><i>a </i>and the second bottom portion <b>40</b><i>b </i>may be alternately arranged along the central axis direction of the fixture <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">The second thread portion <b>40</b> may be successively connected to the first thread portion <b>38</b>. Accordingly, without a drastic increase in implantation torque, the fixture <b>30</b> may be smoothly inserted into bone tissue. In addition, the second ridge portion <b>40</b><i>a </i>may be machined to have a smaller central axis radius than the first ridge portion <b>38</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the second ridge portion <b>40</b><i>a </i>may encourage smooth implantation in a cortical bone.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The third area section <b>36</b> is located under the second area section <b>34</b>, thereby becoming the lowest part of the fixture <b>30</b>. The third area section <b>36</b> may be an entry part that is inserted into a bone tissue first to form a female thread inside the bone tissue. The third area section <b>36</b> may have a third thread portion <b>42</b>, which has a third ridge portion <b>42</b><i>a </i>machined in a spiral shape on the outer circumferential surface and a third bottom portion <b>42</b><i>b </i>formed with a smaller radius of the central axis. The third thread portion <b>42</b> may be machined to have a slope that converges towards the end, and the third ridge portion <b>42</b><i>a </i>and the third bottom portion <b>42</b><i>b </i>may be arranged alternately along the direction of central axis.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The cutting portion <b>44</b> may be provided at an equal interval along the outer circumferential surface, intersecting the second thread portion <b>40</b> and the third thread portion <b>42</b>. The cutting portion <b>44</b> may have an up-sloping shape, winding in a spiral. As the cutting portion <b>44</b> traverses the second thread portion <b>40</b>, insertion from the third area section <b>36</b> to the second area section <b>34</b> becomes easy.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The receiving portion <b>46</b> may be formed alone in the fixture <b>30</b> corresponding to the first and second area sections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>, and the hole of the second area section <b>34</b> may be machined to have a female thread for engaging with the screw <b>90</b>. The receiving portion <b>46</b> may be machined to have a hole corresponding to the first area section <b>32</b>, of which the diameter increases gradually towards the upper end. The hole of the first area section <b>32</b> may be formed to have an inner diameter that is larger than the diameter of first and second engagement structure alignment portions <b>68</b> and <b>72</b> of the fixture engagement structure <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The fixture <b>30</b> may include a first fixture alignment portion <b>48</b>, a second fixture alignment portion <b>50</b>, and a spacing portion <b>52</b> located between the fixture alignment portions <b>48</b> and <b>52</b>, along the inner circumference direction of the receiving portion <b>46</b> of the first and second area sections <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>, which is coupled to the fixture engagement structure <b>60</b>.

The first fixture alignment portion <b>48</b> may be machined to have a groove shape in a radial direction, that is, in the direction of radius tending outwards from a central axis of the fixture <b>30</b>. In this case, the spacing portion <b>52</b> may be formed in a protruding shape. As another example, when the first supporting portion <b>112</b> of the implantation driver <b>100</b> of the fixture engagement structure <b>60</b> or the first engagement structure alignment portion <b>68</b> of the fixture engagement structure <b>60</b> is formed as a groove in a radial direction, the first fixture alignment portion <b>48</b> may be machined to have a protruding shape.

Specifically, the inner circumference of the second fixture alignment portion <b>50</b> along the inner circumference direction may be extended within a range of asymmetry with respect to the center point of the fixture <b>30</b>. In case the inner circumference of the second fixture alignment portion <b>50</b> is extended to a range in which the inner circumference becomes symmetric with respect to the center point, the number of the first fixture alignment portions <b>48</b> may be reduced excessively.

Specifically, an outer circumference of the second engagement structure alignment portion <b>72</b> along the outer circumference direction D may be extended within a range that is asymmetric with respect to the center point. When the outer circumference of the second engagement structure alignment portion <b>72</b> is extended to a range that is symmetric with respect to the center point, the number of the first engagement structure alignment portions <b>68</b> may be excessively reduced. Thus, while the fixture engagement structure <b>60</b> rotates in the fixture <b>30</b>, the first engagement structure alignment portion <b>68</b> may be inserted deep into the second fixture alignment portion <b>50</b> of the fixture <b>30</b>, thereby causing difficulty in additional rotation for expected position alignment.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In addition, similarly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the second engagement structure alignment portion <b>72</b> may be arranged asymmetrically with every first engagement structure alignment portion <b>68</b> with respect to the center point.
