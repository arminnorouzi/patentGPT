Such tools may operate with a hydraulic pump actuated by a battery powered electric motor. Battery powered hydraulic power tools are employed in numerous applications to provide an operator with a desired flexibility and mechanical force. For example, tools may need substantial force to crimp large power connectors onto large conductors, e.g., #8 conductors and larger. As another example, tools may need substantial force to cut large conductors, e.g., #8 conductors and larger.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are certain environments where activation of portable, battery powered tools, including portable, battery powered hydraulic power tools, is best performed remotely to provide additional operator safety. For example, when working with high current electric lines, activating a portable, battery powered tool remotely permits an operator to avoid exposure to such high currents.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure provides hand-held, battery-powered tools having a remote monitoring and remote control systems.

The hydraulic drive conduit system <b>28</b> is connected between the pump <b>16</b> and the rear end of the ram <b>32</b>. Hydraulic fluid pumped by the pump <b>16</b> through the hydraulic drive conduit system <b>28</b> and against the rear end of the ram <b>32</b> causes the ram <b>32</b> to move forward toward a distal end of the working head <b>14</b>.

The handle <b>40</b> includes one or more operator controls, such as trigger switches <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>, that can be activated by an operator by, for example, pressing the trigger switches. The operator controls, e.g., trigger switches <b>44</b> and <b>46</b>, are operably coupled to the controller <b>24</b>, as will be described below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the battery <b>20</b> is removably connected to the bottom of the handle <b>40</b>.

In another embodiment, the battery <b>20</b> may be affixed to the tool <b>10</b> so that it is not removable. The battery <b>20</b> is preferably a rechargeable battery, such as a lithium ion battery, that can output a voltage of at least 16 volts, and preferably in the range of between about 16 VDC and about 24 VDC. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the battery <b>20</b> can output a voltage of about 18 VDC.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The motor <b>18</b> is coupled to the battery <b>20</b> and the controller <b>24</b>, and its operation is controlled by the controller <b>24</b>, which will be described in more detail below. Generally, the motor <b>18</b> is adapted to operate at a nominal voltage corresponding to the voltage of the battery <b>20</b>, i.e., between about 16 volts and about 24 volts. For example, if the battery <b>20</b> is adapted to output a voltage of about 18 volts, then the motor <b>18</b> would be adapted to operate at a voltage of about 18 volts. Under a no-load condition, such a motor <b>18</b> can operate at about 19,500 rpm with a current of about 2.7 amps. At maximum efficiency, the motor <b>18</b> can operate at about 17,040 rpm with a current of about 18.7 amps, a torque of about 153 mN-m (1560 g-cm), and an output of about 273 W. An example of such an 18-volt motor <b>18</b> may be a RS-775WC-8514 motor, manufactured by Mabuchi Motor Co., Ltd. of Chiba-ken, Japan. However, as noted above, any suitable type of motor adapted to operate above a 16 V nominal voltage could be used. For example, the motor may be a RS-775VC-8015 motor, also manufactured by Mabuchi Motor Co., Ltd., which has a nominal operating voltage of about 16.8 volts. As another example, the motor may be a motor adapted to operate at a 24 V nominal voltage. The output shaft of the motor <b>18</b> is connected to the pump <b>16</b> by a gear reduction or gearbox <b>48</b>. Any suitable type of gear reduction assembly could be provided.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the tool <b>10</b> may include a poppet valve <b>50</b> connected to the hydraulic drive conduit system <b>28</b>. The poppet valve <b>50</b> is adapted to open when the conduit system <b>28</b> reaches a predetermined pressure, such as between about 8000 and about 11,000 psi. When the poppet valve opens, hydraulic fluid being pumped by the pump <b>16</b> can exit the conduit system <b>28</b> and return to the fluid reservoir <b>22</b>. The poppet valve <b>50</b> can be adapted to generate an audible sound when it opens. This audible sound can signal to the operator that the tool <b>10</b> has reached its maximum predetermined hydraulic pressure and, thus, the action of the working head <b>14</b>, e.g., crimping action, is ready to be triggered.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the controller <b>24</b> is adapted to sense a current drop of electricity to the motor <b>18</b>. When the poppet valve <b>50</b> opens, resistance to rotation of the motor <b>18</b> is reduced such that the motor draws less current. The controller <b>24</b> senses this current drop via the current sensor <b>120</b> (seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), and automatically deactivates the motor <b>18</b> for a predetermined period of time. In a preferred embodiment, the predetermined period of time is between about 2 seconds and about 3 seconds. However, any suitable predetermined period of time could be set. In an alternate embodiment, the controller <b>24</b> could be adapted to deactivate the motor <b>18</b> until a reset button or reset-like procedure is performed by the operator. With this type of system, an operator can sense via a tactile sense, that the motor <b>18</b> and pump <b>16</b> have stopped and would not need to rely on an audible signal being heard or a visual signal from an LED indicator light positioned on the tool <b>10</b>. More detailed information of this exemplary embodiment of the tool <b>10</b> and its operation can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 7,165,439 entitled &#x201c;Battery Powered Hydraulic Tool&#x201d; which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a circuit diagram of a power supply module <b>150</b> is shown. As noted, the tool <b>10</b> can work with a battery of at least 16 VDC, which energizes both the power supply module <b>150</b> and the motor <b>18</b>. The power supply module <b>150</b> supplies power for the components of the controller <b>24</b>, such as the microcontroller, the flash memory, the RTCC, and the Sensors and the Modules, described below, by reducing the battery voltage to a voltage suitable to power the components of the controller <b>24</b>. As an example, the power supply module <b>150</b> regulates the battery voltage, e.g., 18 VDC, to about 3.3V using a low dropout (LDO) voltage regulator U<b>8</b>. An example of a suitable voltage regulator is the TPS70933 LDO voltage regulator, manufactured by Texas Instruments. The LDO voltage regulator U<b>8</b> is enabled by an operator activating an operator control, e.g., pressing trigger switch <b>44</b> or <b>46</b>, causing the microcontroller <b>100</b> to take control of the power supplied to the tool <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The enable pin of the LDO voltage regulator U<b>8</b> enables the voltage regulator. The enable pin is normally pulled to ground using a 10K resistor R<b>3</b> which disables the LDO voltage regulator U<b>8</b> causing the microcontroller <b>100</b> to go into a power down state, as described below. When a trigger switch <b>44</b> or <b>46</b> is closed, the enable pin of the LDO voltage regulator U<b>8</b> is driven to a high voltage through the R<b>1</b>-R<b>3</b> voltage divider network. A high voltage on the voltage regulator U<b>8</b> enable pin (EN) enables the LDO voltage regulator U<b>8</b>, which then powers the microcontroller <b>100</b> via the VCC power and turns the microcontroller ON. Once the microcontroller <b>100</b> is ON, the microcontroller takes control of the power supply module by enabling the PWR_CTRL_MAIN line, thus maintaining a high voltage on the enable pin of the LDO voltage regulator U<b>8</b> even when the trigger switch <b>44</b> or <b>46</b> is not closed. If the tool <b>10</b> is kept idle for more than a particular predefined time, preferably a time in the range of 3-180 minutes, the microcontroller <b>100</b> disables the PWR_CTRL_MAIN line, thus removing the high voltage on the enable pin of the voltage regulator U<b>8</b> so that the LDO voltage regulator U<b>8</b> turns OFF until the trigger switch <b>44</b> or <b>46</b> is closed again, and power to the components of the controller <b>24</b> is removed.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, when the LDO voltage regulator U<b>8</b> is enabled and the components of the controller <b>24</b> are powered using VCC power, a further or continued pressing of the trigger switch <b>44</b> or <b>46</b> will then cause the microcontroller <b>100</b> to actuate the motor <b>18</b> thus turning the motor <b>18</b> ON. More specifically, the trigger switch <b>44</b> or <b>46</b> provides battery <b>20</b> voltage to the R<b>4</b>-R<b>13</b> resistor network which causes a high voltage at the base of n-channel MOSFET M<b>10</b>, which turns the MOSFET M<b>10</b> ON, and causes the OPERATOR_CTRL to be low which triggers the microcontroller <b>100</b> to turn ON the motor <b>18</b>. An example of a suitable MOSFET is the DMN601WK series MOSFET manufactured by Diodes, Inc. Once MOSFET M<b>10</b> turns ON, the OPERATOR_CTRL line is pulled to ground (Low Signal), through the MOSFET M<b>10</b>. On release of trigger switch <b>44</b> or <b>46</b>, the MOSFET turns OFF and the OPERATOR_CTRL line is pulled back to high through resistor R<b>11</b>. The OPERATOR_CTRL line is connected to microcontroller interrupt (seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) so that the low signal causes the microcontroller <b>100</b> to turn the motor <b>18</b> on.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an exemplary block diagram of the controller <b>24</b> of the present disclosure is shown.
