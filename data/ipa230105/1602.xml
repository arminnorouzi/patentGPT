Handheld power tools and cutting chains for abrasion cutting of minerals, such as rock, concrete or the like, are known in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 8,960,178 B2 discloses an exemplary cutting chain consisting of drive links and side links alternatingly arranged along the length of the chain. The drive links are configured to be driven by a rim-type sprocket, whereas a subset of the side links are provided with abrasion cutting teeth.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Due to the highly abrasive environment of concrete cutting, the cutting equipment is exposed to substantial wear, and regularly needs to be replaced.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is an object of the present invention to solve, or at least mitigate, parts or all of the above mentioned problems. To this end, there is provided a rim-type abrasion cutter drive sprocket for driving an abrasion cutting chain of an abrasion cutter, the rim-type sprocket being configured to be rotated about a rotation axis for driving the cutting chain, and comprising a set of sprocket teeth, the sprocket teeth extending radially away from said rotation axis and defining drive link gaps between them for receiving and drivingly engaging with drive links of the cutting chain, and a pair of rim edges which are concentric with the rotation axis and extend about the rotation axis on either side of the drive link gaps, the rim edges being configured to radially support side links of the cutting chain, wherein the rim edges have a non-circular envelope, as seen along the rotation axis. Thereby, a driving force may be transferred also from the rim edges to the side links, which reduces the stretching of the cutting chain at the interfaces between drive links and side links. This enables obtaining an increased lifetime of the sprocket as well as the cutting chain. There is also provided an abrasion cutter provided with a rim-type drive sprocket as defined herein. Typically, the abrasion cutter is powered by a motor, such as a combustion engine, in driving engagement with the rim-type drive sprocket to move the abrasion cutting chain. The abrasion cutter may be handheld, i.e. it may be a handheld power tool. Alternatively, the abrasion cutter may be mounted on a cutting rig for autonomous or remote-controlled operation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to embodiments, each of said rim edges may have a rim edge radius which varies along the circumference of the respective rim edge between a smallest rim edge radius and a largest rim edge radius, wherein a ratio between the smallest rim edge radius and the largest rim edge radius is between 0.82 and 0.96. According to further embodiments, a ratio between the smallest rim edge radius and the largest rim edge radius may be between 0.85 and 0.93.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to embodiments, each of said rim edges may have a rim edge radius which varies along the circumference of the respective rim edge, wherein each respective rim edge has a first, relatively smaller, radius at the sprocket teeth, and a second, relatively larger, radius at the drive link gaps. Relatively larger and relatively smaller should be construed as being in relation to each other, i.e. relatively larger is larger than relatively smaller.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to embodiments, said non-circular envelope may be substantially polygonal. A polygon comprises straight sides interconnected by corners. The corners of the substantially polygonal envelope may be chamfered or rounded, to minimize wear on the cutting chain.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to embodiments, the substantially polygonal envelope may have the shape of a regular polygon. Again, the corners of the regular polygon-shaped envelope may be chamfered or rounded, to minimize wear on the cutting chain. The regular polygon may have a number of sides which matches the number of sprocket teeth of said set of sprocket teeth.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to embodiments, corners of the substantially polygonal envelope may be in register with the drive link gaps, as seen along the rotation axis. With such a configuration, according to tests, the service life of the sprocket is about twice that of a conventional abrasion cutter drive sprocket having circular rim edges.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to embodiments, radial ends of the sprocket teeth may be substantially aligned with mid-points of respective sides of the polygonal envelope. The rotation axis defines a circular-cylindrical coordinate system, defining an axial direction, a radial direction, and a tangential or angular direction, which directions are referred to herein. The radial ends of the sprocket teeth may be radially aligned with said mid-points, tangentially aligned with said mid-points, or both. The sprocket teeth may thereby be tangentially distributed in anti-phase with the corners of the substantially polygonal envelope.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to embodiments, the substantially polygonal envelope is hexagonal, heptagonal, or octagonal.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to embodiments, the sprocket may be provided with internal splines configured to engage with mating external splines of a drive shaft. Thereby, the sprocket may be allowed to float axially on the shaft, which reduces wear of the sprocket as well as the cutting chain. The internal splines of the sprocket may be configured as axially extending grooves in an otherwise circular-cylindrical socket.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to embodiments, the sprocket may be integrally formed in a single piece. By way of example, the sprocket may be sintered or moulded in a single piece, or welded from two or more components into a single piece. Typically, the sprocket may be made of metal, such as steel.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a second aspect, parts or all of the above mentioned problems are solved, or at least mitigated, by a kit comprising a drive sprocket as defined hereinabove, and an abrasion cutting chain provided with abrasion cutting teeth configured to cut minerals such as concrete or rock, and/or metals such as cast iron or the like, by abrasive action. Due to their abrasive cutting action, the cutting teeth typically do not have any sharp cutting edges configured to shave off chips, as opposed to e.g. a cutting chain adapted for cutting wood, and therefore also do not need sharpening. The abrasion cutting teeth may, for example, be configured as sintered or moulded steel bodies with embedded abrasive particles having a Mohs hardness exceeding 9, such as silicon carbide, tungsten carbide, or diamond particles. The abrasion cutting teeth may be attached to side links of the cutting chain. The cutting chain may comprise a plurality of side links, each provided with a straight riding edge configured to ride on an outer periphery of a guide bar.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to embodiments, the kit may further comprise a guide bar for guiding the cutting chain, the guide bar comprising coolant channels for delivering a coolant flow to a guide groove configured to receive and guide drive teeth of the cutting chain.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to an embodiment, there is also provided an abrasion cutter comprising a rim-type drive sprocket or kit as defined above.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to a third aspect, parts or all of the above mentioned problems are solved, or at least mitigated, by a method of driving an abrasion cutting chain of an abrasion cutter, the method comprising rotating a sprocket about a rotation axis; transferring rotary power from sprocket teeth to drive links of the cutting chain; and transferring rotary power from at least one sprocket rim, offset from the sprocket teeth along the rotation axis, to side links of the cutting chain, by interference between the at least one sprocket rim and the side links. Thanks to the interference engagement between the sprocket rim and the side links, more power can be transferred than via only a mere friction engagement between the two. This reduces the load and wear on the interfaces between the side links and the drive links of chain.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to embodiments, said interference may transfer rotary power from substantially straight drive edges of the rim to substantially straight riding edges of the side links, as seen along the axis of rotation.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to embodiments, the drive edges and riding edges may engage with each other along a straight engagement line which extends in opposite tangential directions from a point of the engagement line which is closest to the rotation axis.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is noted that embodiments of the invention may be embodied by all possible combinations of features recited in the claims. Further, it will be appreciated that the various embodiments described for the devices according to the first and second aspects are all combinable with the method as defined in accordance with the third aspect, and vice versa.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The above, as well as additional objects, features and advantages of the present invention, will be better understood through the following illustrative and non-limiting detailed description of preferred embodiments of the present invention, with reference to the appended drawings, where the same reference numerals will be used for similar elements, wherein:</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view in perspective of a handheld abrasion cutter;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side view of a rim-type drive sprocket, a drive shaft, a proximal end of a guide bar, and an abrasion cutting chain;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side view of the abrasion cutting chain of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of the drive sprocket and drive shaft of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a section view of the drive sprocket of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> in mesh with a set of drive teeth of the cutting chain of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the section being taken in a plane comprising the drive teeth; and</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method of driving the abrasion cutting chain of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0029" num="0028">All the figures are schematic, not necessarily to scale, and generally only show parts which are necessary in order to elucidate the embodiments, whereas other parts may be omitted.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a handheld abrasion cutter, i.e. a handheld power cutter <b>10</b> configured to cut metal, mineral such as rock or concrete, or the like by abrasive action.

An abrasion cutting chain <b>16</b> is guided along the guide bar <b>14</b>. The cutting chain <b>16</b> is configured as an endless loop which is moved along the periphery of the guide bar <b>14</b> by the motor of the power unit <b>12</b>. A front handle <b>18</b> and a rear <b>20</b> handle permit holding the power cutter <b>10</b> with two hands, and the rear handle <b>20</b> is provided with a trigger <b>22</b> for operating the motor (not illustrated).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the cutting chain <b>16</b>, a drive sprocket <b>24</b> of rim type, and a proximal end <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the guide bar <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in greater detail. The cutting chain <b>16</b> comprises drive links <b>26</b> interconnected by side links <b>28</b>. The side links <b>28</b>, which may alternatively be referred to as tie straps, are arranged in pairs, each pair of side links <b>28</b> sandwiching two consecutive drive links <b>26</b> between them. A subset of the side links <b>28</b> are provided with abrasion cutting teeth <b>30</b> comprising embedded diamond particles (not illustrated), and are thereby well suited for cutting concrete, rock, or the like, by abrasive action. The subset of side links <b>28</b> provided with cutting teeth <b>30</b> may also be referred to as cutting links <b>32</b>. The motor of the power unit <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) is drivingly connected to a drive shaft <b>34</b>, which drivingly engages with the drive sprocket <b>24</b> to rotate the drive sprocket <b>24</b> about a rotation axis A, concentric with the drive shaft <b>34</b> and drive sprocket <b>24</b>, and perpendicular to the general plane of extension of the drive sprocket <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Each side link <b>28</b> has a straight riding edge <b>36</b> configured to ride on an outer periphery <b>38</b> of the guide bar <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The drive links <b>26</b> are provided with respective drive teeth <b>40</b>, which are guided in a guide groove <b>42</b> in the periphery <b>38</b> of the guide bar <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>); in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the bottom of the guide groove <b>42</b> is indicated by a dotted line. The guide bar <b>14</b>, the proximal end <b>14</b><i>a </i>of which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, comprises a coolant channel arrangement <b>35</b> for delivering a flow of coolant such as water from the power unit <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) to the guide groove <b>42</b>. The drive teeth <b>40</b> penetrate into the drive sprocket <b>24</b> to engage with sprocket teeth (not illustrated) in a manner which will be elucidated further below, whereas the side links <b>28</b> are radially supported by outer rim edges <b>44</b> of the drive sprocket <b>24</b>. The drive sprocket <b>24</b> is integrally moulded in one piece of steel. Its rim edges <b>44</b> define an envelope, as seen along the rotation axis A, the shape of a regular polygon, and more specifically, of a heptagon. The heptagon has seven sides <b>45</b> of equal length, wherein adjacent sides meet each other at corners <b>47</b> of equal angles.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a few segments of the cutting chain <b>16</b> in greater detail. Each drive link <b>26</b> is, at each longitudinal end as seen along the longitudinal direction L of the cutting chain, pivotally connected to a pair of side links <b>28</b> via rivets <b>46</b>. The side links <b>28</b> are located on opposite sides of the plane of the drive link <b>26</b> such that in the view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, only one side link <b>28</b> of each such pair is visible. The drive links <b>26</b> are provided with bumpers <b>27</b>, which protect the cutting teeth <b>30</b> from excessive impact. The pitch of the cutting chain <b>16</b> is defined as half the distance D between the leading rivet pivot axes P of two consecutive drive links <b>26</b>; a typical pitch may be, for example, between 8.0 mm and 11.5 mm. Common pitches are &#x215c;-inch and 0,444-inch pitches.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates the sprocket <b>24</b> and an axial end of the drive shaft <b>34</b> in greater detail. The drive shaft <b>34</b> may, in turn, be configured as a sleeve enclosing a smaller drive dog <b>48</b>. The drive shaft <b>34</b> is provided with external splines <b>50</b>, mating with internal splines <b>52</b> of the drive sprocket <b>24</b>. The drive sprocket <b>24</b> comprises drive link gaps <b>54</b> defining, along the radial periphery of the drive sprocket <b>24</b>, slots <b>55</b>, which are adapted to receive the drive teeth <b>40</b> of the drive links <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The slots <b>55</b> are located at the polygon corners <b>47</b> of the drive sprocket's <b>24</b> polygonal envelope, and are separated by sprocket teeth <b>56</b>, which are located at the centres of the respective sides <b>45</b> of the polygonal envelope. The axial sides of the of the drive sprocket <b>24</b> are axially offset from the drive links <b>26</b>, and define opposing rims <b>58</b><i>a</i>, <b>58</b><i>b</i>. The radially outermost, polygonal, envelope of the rims <b>58</b><i>a</i>, <b>58</b><i>b </i>of the rim-type drive sprocket <b>24</b> form a pair of rim edges <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b</i>, which are configured to radially support the side links <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of the cutting chain <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, each rim edge <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b </i>extends at a varying radial distance from the rotation axis A, i.e. it has a rim edge radius which varies along the circumference of the respective rim edge <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b</i>. The radius of each rim edge <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b </i>varies between a smallest rim edge radius R<b>1</b>, at the tangential positions of the sprocket teeth <b>56</b>, and a largest rim edge radius R<b>2</b>, at the tangential positions of the drive link gaps <b>54</b>. For the illustrated sprocket <b>24</b>, the ratio between the smallest rim edge radius R<b>1</b> and the largest rim edge radius R<b>2</b> is about 0.9.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates the sprocket <b>24</b> and the drive links <b>26</b> of the cutting chain <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) in a section taken along the plane of the drive links <b>26</b>, perpendicular to the rotation axis A. Each drive link <b>26</b> comprises a leading rivet bore <b>60</b><i>a </i>and a trailing rivet bore <b>60</b><i>b</i>, each of which is connected to a pair of parallel tie straps <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) by rivets <b>46</b>. The rotation axis A of the sprocket <b>24</b> defines a cylindrical coordinate system of the drive sprocket <b>24</b>, with a radial direction R facing perpendicularly away from the rotation axis A, and an angular or tangential direction T corresponding to the movement direction of any point rotating about the axis A. The drive link gaps <b>54</b> are shaped to mate with the drive links <b>26</b>, with some added tangential play towards the bottom of the gaps <b>54</b>, to provide a high mechanical strength of the drive sprocket <b>24</b>, while at the same time allowing some degree of pivoting of the drive links about the rivets (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) within the respective drive link gaps <b>54</b>. The pitch of the sprocket <b>24</b> is carefully matched to the pitch of the cutting chain (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), such that all drive links <b>26</b> will, when passing the drive sprocket <b>24</b>, engage with and be driven by a respective sprocket tooth <b>56</b> of the drive sprocket <b>24</b>. The sprocket teeth <b>56</b> extend radially all the way out to the rim edges <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), i.e. in the illustrated embodiment, all the way out to the respective sides <b>45</b> of the polygonal envelope. This means that the sprocket teeth <b>56</b> do not extend beyond the rim edges <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b</i>, and thus the sprocket teeth <b>56</b> extend radially away from said rotation axis A at most until the rim edges <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b</i>. This provides an advantage regarding manufacturing, where for example moulding is simplified.

In the example described in detail above, the straight side edges defined by the polygonal envelope of the rim edges <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b </i>transfer the rotary power to the straight riding edges <b>36</b> of the side links <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The invention has mainly been described above with reference to a few embodiments. However, as is readily appreciated by a person skilled in the art, other embodiments than the ones disclosed above are equally possible within the scope of the invention, as defined by the appended patent claims. For example, it is not necessary that the rim edges be polygonal. Also other shapes which are non-circular, such as sawtooth or star shapes, may be suitable for transferring rotary power to the side links of the cutting chain. It may be preferable that the cutting chain, in such configurations, be provided with mating drive structures at the riding edges <b>36</b> of the side links <b>28</b>. This means that the rim edges <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b </i>and the riding edges <b>36</b> have complementary shapes that are adapted to mate with each other such that the riding edges <b>36</b> can engage the rim edges <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b</i>. In this way, the cutting chain <b>16</b> is propelled both by means of transferred rotary power from sprocket teeth <b>56</b> to drive links <b>26</b> of the cutting chain <b>16</b>, and by transferred rotary power from the rim edges <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b </i>to the riding edges <b>36</b>. At least one sprocket rim <b>58</b><i>a</i>, <b>58</b><i>b</i>, offset from the sprocket teeth <b>56</b> along the rotation axis A is thus adapted to transfer rotary power to side links <b>28</b> of the cutting chain <b>16</b> by interference between the at least one sprocket rim <b>58</b><i>a</i>, <b>58</b><i>b </i>and the side links <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The complementary shapes are of such form that at least 50% of the riding edges <b>36</b> are adapted to be in contact with the rim edges <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b</i>, preferably at least 75%, and most preferably at least 90%.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">According to some aspects, in order to enable this power transfer, drive teeth <b>40</b> of the drive links <b>26</b> should not engage the drive link gaps <b>54</b> to such an extent that the riding edges <b>36</b> do not completely engage the rim edges <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b</i>. For example, if the drive teeth <b>40</b> ride on the bottom of the drive link gaps <b>54</b>, the riding edges <b>36</b> may not be enabled to reach the rim edges <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b </i>to the desired extent.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">By having the driving force transferred not only from the sprocket teeth <b>56</b> to the drive links <b>26</b>, but also also from the rim edges <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b </i>to the riding edges <b>36</b> of the side links, the stretching of the cutting chain at the interfaces between drive links and side links is reduced. This enables obtaining an increased lifetime of the sprocket as well as the cutting chain.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is also pointed out that abrasion cutting is also suitable for cutting other materials, such as plastics, and the teachings herein are in no way limited to the cutting of a particular type of material.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the claims, the word &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; does not exclude other elements or steps, and the indefinite article &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; does not exclude a plurality.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
