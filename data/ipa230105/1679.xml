These elastic adhesive films can enhance the elasticity of fabrics. Some elastic adhesive films have thermally fuse properties and can glue fabrics to other fabrics, thereby reduce the amount of stitching required and become easy to process.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The existing elastic adhesive films are usually thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) thermally fuse films. These elastic adhesive films are usually impermeable, even though individual films have microporous for air permeability, microporous of the elastic adhesive films are often blocked and the air permeability will be lost, which affects the air permeability of corresponding clothing and luggage. Especially for elastic underwear, which is widely used in elastic film, it will affect the comfort of the wearer. The higher the thermally fuse temperature, the more severe of blockage, and if the thermally fuse temperature is too low, the adhesion between the elastic adhesive film and the fabric will be affected.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The traditional needle and thread stitching technology is used in the garment industry. From appearance, the clothes have stitch marks, which will affect the comfort of the wearer. Currently on the market, most of the thermally fuse adhesive films for garments do not particularly emphasize on chemical resistance. If they are to be used on under garment, user's use of skin care products needs to be taken into consideration to avoid that the ingredients of skin care products will affect the chemical resistance and reduce the peel strength.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the disadvantages of the prior art, the main object of the present invention is to provide a thermoplastic film, by changing the structure of the thermoplastic film, the outer layer of the thermoplastic film is resistance to chemical immersion, and the inner layer of thermoplastic film may be laminated to the fabric to increase the peel strength of the thermoplastic film.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to the above objects, the present invention provides a method for manufacturing a thermoplastic film, which includes: providing a first thermally fuse adhesive, a second thermally fuse adhesive, and a third thermally fuse adhesive, in which the melting point and Shore hardness of the two thermally fuse adhesive are different from those of the other;
