The light-emitting key device <b>1</b> includes at least the backlight module <b>10</b>, at least one keycap <b>1</b>A, at least one lifting mechanism <b>1</b>B, a membrane switch layer <b>1</b>C and a bottom plate <b>1</b>D, wherein the lifting mechanism <b>1</b>B is disposed between the keycap <b>1</b>A and the bottom plate <b>1</b>D and pivotally connects the keycap <b>1</b>A with the bottom plate <b>1</b>D to driving the keycap <b>1</b>A to move up and down relative to the bottom plate <b>1</b>D. The membrane switch layer <b>1</b>C and the backlight module <b>10</b> could be disposed on two opposite sides of the bottom plate <b>1</b>D.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the present embodiment, one keycap <b>1</b>A and one lifting mechanism <b>1</b>B constitute one key. The backlight module <b>10</b> could emit light toward the keycap <b>1</b>A of the key, and the light is emitted from periphery of the keycap <b>1</b>A and/or from light-transmissive area (for example, a character area or a symbol area) of the keycap <b>1</b>A. When the keycap <b>1</b>A is pressed to be triggered, a processor (not illustrated) electrically connected with the backlight module <b>10</b> could control the electronic component <b>130</b> corresponding to the keycap <b>1</b>A to emit light. In an embodiment, each key corresponds to at least one electronic component <b>130</b> (not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>) of the backlight module <b>10</b>. As a result, light emitted from each key of the light-emitting key device <b>1</b> could be more uniformly and/or more bright.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In another embodiment, the backlight module <b>10</b> of the light-emitting key device <b>1</b> could be replaced by any one of the backlight modules <b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, and <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In addition, in each of the aforementioned circuit structures or backlight modules, the reflective layer and the light-shielding layer in combination with the light-transmissive insulation layer (for example, component <b>110</b> or <b>12</b><i>a</i>) have a variety of relative arrangements. For example, (1). The reflective layer and the light-shielding layer could be disposed on the same side of the light-transmissive insulation layer, for example, both on the first insulation surface or the second insulation surface of the light-transmissive insulation layer; or (2). the reflective layer and the light-shielding layer could be disposed on two opposite sides of the light-transmissive insulation layer, for example, the reflective layer and the light-shielding layer are disposed on the first insulation surface and the second insulation surface of the light-transmissive insulation layer, or disposed on the second insulation surface and the first insulation surface of the light-transmissive insulation layer.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">While the invention has been described in terms of what is presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention needs not be limited to the disclosed embodiment.
