patent application claims the benefit and priority of Chinese Patent Application No. 202010280575.9, entitled &#x201c;Method for preparation of attapulgite-based pH-responsive antibacterial material&#x201d; filed on Apr. 10, 2020, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety as part of the present application.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a method for preparing an attapulgite-based pH-responsive antibacterial material, which is mainly used to replace antibiotics in the process of livestock and poultry breeding, and belongs to the technical field of nano-mineral functional materials and animal feed additives.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">On Jul. 9, 2019, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued Announcement No. 194, which announced the withdrawal plan and related management policies of medicated feed additives, and clearly proposed a &#x201c;comprehensive ban on antibiotics&#x201d; on Jul. 1, 2020. Therefore, it urgently needs to develop the safe and efficient feed antibiotic substitutes for healthy animal breeding.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Among of many antibiotic substitutes, natural antibacterial agents such as plant extracts exhibit the unlimited potential for the substitution of antibiotics, which are also one of the most common functional additive products for feed antibiotic substitute applications in the EU (Northern Animal Husbandry, 2019, 09, 17). Plant extracts are mainly intended to directly inhibit and kill pathogenic bacteria, in which aldehydes such as cinnamaldehyde are a commonly used feed additive with a good antibacterial effect after being added into the feed (Chinese Journal of Animal Nutrition, 2019, 1-8). However, aldehydes need to be stabilized due to the disadvantages of easy oxidization, strong volatility, and a certain pungent odor.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Attapulgite is a natural hydrated magnesium aluminum silicate clay mineral with one-dimensional nanorod-like morphology and zeolite-like pores of 0.37&#xd7;0.64 nm. It has been reported that organic molecules could be resided in the pores of attapulgite under the mechanochemical action. However, the aldehydes residing in the attapulgite pores still present a pungent odor. In order to further solve the shortcomings of natural aldehyde-based antibacterial agents, the present disclosure is to prepare a pH-responsive antibacterial material by adopting the principle of forming Schiff bases between amino groups of chitosan and aldehydes on the basis of aldehydes residing in the attapulgite pores.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The object of the present disclosure is to provide a method for preparing an attapulgite-based pH-responsive antibacterial material. On the one hand, the method makes it possible to solve the disadvantages of natural aldehyde-based antibacterial agents of easy oxidization, strong volatility and pungent odor. On the other hand, the method makes it possible to solve the sustained release of natural aldehyde-based antibacterial agents in animal gutswith pH-responsiveness of chitosan, which could be directly used as animal feed for safe animal breeding.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">1.

After resurrecting the strains, the strains were transferred to nutrient agar media again, and incubated in a constant temperature incubator at 37&#xb0; C. After 3 h, the bacteria were subcultured to enter the logarithmic phase. A single colony of the standard strain entering the logarithmic phase was selected to prepare a bacterial suspension, the turbidity of the bacterial suspension was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard turbidity, and the bacterial suspension was diluted with PBS in a ratio of 1:10 to achieve a bacterial count of 10<sup>7 </sup>CFU/mL, 10<sup>6 </sup>CFU/mL, 10<sup>5 </sup>CFU/mL, and 10<sup>4 </sup>CFU/mL, respectively.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">(2) Preparation of agar plates with different concentrations of unknown samples: The samples treated at different pH values were evenly dispersed into the nutrient agar media, <i>E. coli </i>groups were divided into 2.5 mg/mL, 1.5 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, and 0.5 mg/mL groups; <i>S. aureus </i>groups were divided into 2.5 mg/mL, 1.5 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, and 0.5 mg/mL groups.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">(3) Plating: 1 &#x3bc;L each of the above-mentioned bacterial suspensions (with a bacterial content of about 1&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>CFU/mL) was pipetted and plated in agar plates containing unknown samples; the samples were plated in three different positions in each plate, and the test was repeated twice. All the plates were transferred to a constant temperature incubator for culture, and the growth of the bacteria was observed after culturing at 37&#xb0; C. for 24 h.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Table 1 shows the results of the MIC assay of the samples obtained in Examples 1 to 6 treated at different pH values against <i>E. coli </i>and <i>S. aureus</i>. The results showed that the samples obtained in Examples 1 to 6 of the present disclosure have MICs of 0.5 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL against <i>E. coli </i>and <i>S. aureus</i>, respectively, and exhibit strong antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Compared with the MICs of samples treated at different pH values, it can be seen that the samples prepared by the present disclosure show weak antibacterial activity under acidic conditions and strong antibacterial activity under neutral conditions, respectively.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">To sum up, in the present disclosure the mechanochemical method is used to reside aldehydes in the attapulgite pores, and then a chitosan solution is sprayed onto an attapulgite powder, so that the aldehydes react with chitosan to form Schiff bases. The present disclosure makes it possible to overcome the shortcomings of easy volatility and strong pungent odor of natural aldehyde-based antibacterial agents, improve the palatability of animals when they are used in safe animal breeding, thereby increasing the utilization efficiency of natural aldehyde-based antibacterial agents. The present disclosure makes it possible to improve the utilization efficiency of natural aldehyde-based antibacterial agents. In the present disclosure, chitosan is used to confer pH responsiveness on antibacterial materials: amino groups of the chitosan are protonated and antibacterial substances are not released under acidic conditions, while the hydrolysis of Schiff base leads to continuous release of antibacterial substances under neutral and weakly alkaline conditions. Therefore, the antibacterial agent could be directly used as animal feed for safe animal breeding.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram of thermogravimetric analysis curves of the attapulgite and antibacterial material obtained in Example 2 of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram of Fourier Transform Infrared spectra of the antibacterial material obtained in Example 2 of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The method for preparing an attapulgite-based pH-responsive antibacterial material according to the present disclosure and antibacterial activity of the attapulgite-based pH-responsive antibacterial material will be described in detail below with reference to specific examples.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 1</heading><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Under stirring, 30% (w/w) citral to the mass of attapulgite was sprayed onto an attapulgite powder, constantly stirred for 30 min, and ground in a ball mill for 30 min (in a grinding ball-to-powder mass ratio of 1:10).
