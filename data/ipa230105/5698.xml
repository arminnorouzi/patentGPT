disclosure relate to an aperture body, a flood column comprising the aperture body, and a charged particle tool comprising the flood column.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">When manufacturing semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) chips, undesired pattern defects, as a consequence of, for example, optical effects and incidental particles, inevitably occur on a substrate (i.e. wafer) or a mask during the fabrication processes, thereby reducing the yield. Monitoring the extent of the undesired pattern defects is therefore an important process in the manufacture of IC chips. More generally, the inspection and/or measurement of a surface of a substrate, or other object/material, is an import process during and/or after its manufacture.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Pattern inspection tools with a charged particle beam have been used to inspect objects, for example to detect pattern defects. These tools typically use electron microscopy techniques, such as a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In a SEM, a primary electron beam of electrons at a relatively high energy is targeted with a final deceleration step in order to land on a sample at a relatively low landing energy. The beam of electrons is focused as a probing spot on the sample. The interactions between the material structure at the probing spot and the landing electrons from the beam of electrons cause electrons to be emitted from the surface, such as secondary electrons, backscattered electrons or Auger electrons. The generated secondary electrons may be emitted from the material structure of the sample. By scanning the primary electron beam as the probing spot over the sample surface, secondary electrons can be emitted across the surface of the sample. By collecting these emitted secondary electrons from the sample surface, a pattern inspection tool may obtain an image representing characteristics of the material structure of the surface of the sample.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Dedicated flood columns may be used in conjunction with an SEM to flood a large area of the surface of a substrate or other sample with charged particles in a relatively short time. Flood columns are thus useful tools to pre-charge a wafer surface and set the charging conditions for subsequent inspection with an SEM. A dedicated flood column can enhance the voltage contrast defect signal, thereby increasing the defect detection sensitivity and/or throughput of an SEM. During charged particle flooding, the flood column is used to provide a relatively large amount of charged particles to quickly charge a predefined area. Afterwards, the primary electron source of an e-beam inspection system is applied to scan an area within the pre-charged area to achieve imaging of the area.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to an aperture body, such as an aperture body for use in a flood column.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, there is provided an aperture body for passing a portion of a charged particle beam propagating along a beam path comprising an axis, the aperture body comprising: an up-beam facing surface;

The following description refers to the accompanying drawings in which the same numbers in different drawings represent the same or similar elements unless otherwise represented. The implementations set forth in the following description of exemplary embodiments do not represent all implementations consistent with the described technology. Instead, they are merely examples of apparatuses and methods consistent with aspects related to the technology as recited in the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The enhanced computing power of electronic devices, which reduces the physical size of the devices, can be accomplished by significantly increasing the packing density of circuit components such as transistors, capacitors, diodes, etc. on an IC chip. This has been enabled by increased resolution enabling yet smaller structures to be made. For example, an IC chip of a smart phone, which is the size of a thumbnail and available in, or earlier than, 2019, may include over 2 billion transistors, the size of each transistor being less than 1/1000th of a human hair. Thus, it is not surprising that semiconductor IC manufacturing is a complex and time-consuming process, with hundreds of individual steps. Errors in even one step have the potential to dramatically affect the functioning of the final product. Just one &#x201c;killer defect&#x201d; can cause device failure. The goal of the manufacturing process is to improve the overall yield of the process. For example, to obtain a 75% yield for a 50-step process (where a step can indicate the number of layers formed on a wafer), each individual step must have a yield greater than 99.4%. If an individual step has a yield of 95%, the overall process yield would be as low as 7%.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">While high process yield is desirable in an IC chip manufacturing facility, maintaining a high substrate (i.e. wafer) throughput, defined as the number of substrates processed per hour, is also essential. High process yield and high substrate throughput can be impacted by the presence of a defect. This is especially if operator intervention is required for reviewing the defects. Thus, high throughput detection and identification of micro and nano-scale defects by inspection tools (such as a Scanning Electron Microscope (&#x2018;SEM&#x2019;)) is essential for maintaining high yield and low cost.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">A SEM comprises a scanning device and a detector apparatus. The scanning device comprises an illumination system that comprises an electron source, for generating primary electrons, and a projection system for scanning a sample, such as a substrate, with one or more focused beams of primary electrons. The primary electrons interact with the sample and generate secondary electrons. A detection system captures the secondary electrons from the sample as the sample is scanned so that the SEM can create an image of the scanned area of the sample. For high throughput inspection, some of the inspection apparatuses use multiple focused beams, i.e. a multi-beam, of primary electrons. The component beams of the multi-beam may be referred to as sub-beams or beamlets. A multi-beam can scan different parts of a sample simultaneously. A multi-beam inspection apparatus can therefore inspect a sample at a much higher speed than a single-beam inspection apparatus.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The figures are schematic. Relative dimensions of components in drawings are therefore exaggerated for clarity. Within the following description of drawings the same or like reference numbers refer to the same or like components or entities, and only the differences with respect to the individual embodiments are described. While the description and drawings are directed to an electron-optical apparatus, it is appreciated that the embodiments are not used to limit the present disclosure to specific charged particles.

The cross section of the thermal conditioning channel <b>432</b> may vary along the length of the thermal conditioning channel (unlike shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), thus allowing the thermal conditioning channel <b>432</b> with angular cross section to be shaped as two or more concentric helices while remaining relatively closely packed.

The thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may provide a supply of cooling fluid to the aperture body <b>500</b> and a return flow of the fluid from the aperture body <b>500</b>. The fluid may be water.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may be shaped so that its surface area is enlarged, that is increased for example relative to its cross-sectional area. For example, in a cross-section of the channel the length of the perimeter of the channel e.g. in the cross-section, may be increased relative to its cross-sectional area, e.g. in the plane of the cross-section. In an arrangement the conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may have a cross-sectional shape that has two reflective axes. Preferably the axes are of unequal length, for example in cross-section the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may be substantially elliptical, ovoid, or rectangular. In an arrangement the cross-sectional area varies along its length, e.g. ribbed, although preferably implemented such that any induced turbulence in the flow is minimized.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In plan view, the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may be a loop that only partially encircles the aperture within the aperture body. The channel may be described as having a substantial horseshoe shape within the aperture body <b>500</b>. That is to say, at least a portion of the conditioning channel may have a radially inner most surface at least partly around the axis that preferably is equidistant to a beam path facing surface of the aperture. The thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may therefore not completely encircle the axis <b>304</b>. When the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>does not completely encircle the axis <b>304</b>, the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may be in a plane that is orthogonal to the axis <b>304</b>. In another example, the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may encircle the axis one or more multiple times. However, for such an arrangement sufficient volume is required, for example for the fluid conditioning channel to have sufficient diameter for a smooth flow of the fluid and/or limiting the pressure required for the fluid to flow through the fluid conditioning channel.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The loop of the thermal conditioning channel may be considered to have an open end at which the conditioning fluid is introduced and removed from the aperture body. At the open end of the horseshoe shaped thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b</i>, the supply and return thermal conditioning channels <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b</i>, may be located in close proximity to each other. For example, the supply and return thermal conditioning channels <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may be separated by a wall within the aperture body <b>500</b> that is, for example, about 2 mm thick. Due to the close proximity of the supply and return thermal conditioning channels <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b</i>, the thermal cooling within the aperture body <b>500</b> may be substantially uniform about the axis <b>304</b>.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The cross-sectional area through the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may be substantially constant along the length of the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b</i>. The cross-sectional shape of the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may vary with the cross-sectional area being maintained substantially constant. (Thus, the shortest cross-sectional perimeter may vary along the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b</i>.)</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Advantageously, maintaining a substantially constant cross-sectional area through the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may help to reduce the turbulence in the fluid flow. In the second example, the cross-sectional area through the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may be larger than that for the first example. Advantageously, this may reduce the pressure within the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b. </i></p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">The thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may be close to, and substantially underneath, the up-beam facing surface <b>510</b> of the aperture body <b>500</b>. When a high power charged particle beam <b>302</b> is used, the power dissipation from the charged particle beam <b>302</b> on the up-beam facing surface <b>510</b> may be substantial. In the second example, the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>is located close to the up-beam facing surface <b>510</b> and thereby close where the aperture body <b>500</b> is being heated.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The aperture body <b>500</b> according to the second example may have a number of advantages over the aperture body <b>400</b> of the first example. For example, the thermal cooling of the aperture body <b>500</b> may be more effective due to a larger cross-section of thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>and the close proximity of the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>to the up-beam facing surface <b>510</b>. The proportion of backscattered charged particles that are captured within the aperture body <b>500</b> may also be larger with the second example. The reason why is because, in the second example, the up-beam facing surface <b>510</b> may be flat and substantially perpendicular to the axis <b>304</b>. From such a surface the angle of backscatter deflection of the charged particles complies with a probability distribution, The maximum of the probability distribution indicates the main or the most likely deflection direction of the charged particles; that is the highest intensity of backscatter charged particles from the surface. The main deflection direction of charged particles from this arrangement of up-beam facing surface <b>510</b> may be at an angle of 45&#xb0; relative to the axis <b>304</b>. Another advantage of the aperture body <b>500</b> according to the second example may be that it may be easier to make than that of the first example. In particular, the shape of the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may be easier to manufacture for example in having a loop which partially encircles the axis <b>304</b>. The aperture body according to the second example may be made by 3d printing technologies.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The aperture body <b>500</b> according to the second example may be used with other features of a charged particle apparatus in a similar manner to that already described for the aperture body <b>400</b> according to the first example.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In particular, when the aperture body <b>500</b> according to the second example is included in the flood column <b>300</b>, the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may also provide the thermal conditioning fluid to the interface <b>350</b> between the flood column <b>300</b> and the primary column of the charged particle tool <b>40</b>. In an arrangement a portion of the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>is located within the interface <b>350</b>. Thermal conditioning of this interface <b>350</b> may reduce the risk of a heat load in the flood column <b>300</b> affecting operation of the primary column. To further reduce this risk, the cooling channel may provide the cooling fluid to the interface <b>350</b> before circulating the thermal conditioning fluid around the aperture body <b>500</b>. The portion of the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>may be located upstream, in the flow of the thermal conditioning fluid, of the portion of the thermal conditioning channel <b>506</b><i>a</i>, <b>506</b><i>b </i>in the aperture body <b>400</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The aperture body <b>500</b> of the second example may be an integrally formed, i.e. the aperture portion <b>504</b>, the tubular portion <b>511</b> and the up-beam plate <b>509</b> may be integrally formed with each other, optionally in a monolithic element. The aperture portion <b>504</b>, the tubular portion <b>511</b> and the up-beam plate <b>509</b> may be formed from a single material. This may improve heat conduction within the aperture body <b>500</b>, as well as reduce the risk of thermal conditioning fluid leaking from the aperture body <b>500</b>. This may be especially useful when the aperture body <b>500</b> is used in a vacuum or low-pressure environment, such as within the flood column <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">The aperture body <b>500</b> may be made from a conductive material.

The blanking electrode <b>330</b> may deflect the charged particle beam <b>302</b> so as to continually move the charged particle beam <b>302</b>. This reduces the focus or localization of the applied or introduced heat load, caused by exposure of the aperture body <b>500</b> to the charged particle beam <b>302</b> during blanking, on any one area of the aperture body <b>500</b>. The point of incidence of the charged particle beam <b>302</b> with the aperture body <b>500</b> may move over the up-beam facing surface <b>510</b>, desirably around the opening <b>502</b> defined by the aperture portion <b>504</b> of the aperture body <b>500</b>.

That is the motion of the charged particle beam over the up-beam facing surface <b>510</b> spreads the applied heat load around opening <b>502</b>. Thus the heat flow density (or heat flux) over the up-facing surface is substantially uniform. During blanking, the lateral extent of the charged particle beam <b>302</b> may be controlled, for example by the condenser lens <b>320</b> or other lens element, so as to match or be substantially equal to the lateral extent of the up-beam facing surface <b>510</b> between the opening <b>502</b> and a radially outward end of the up-beam facing surface <b>510</b>. In other words, the lateral extent of the charged particle beam <b>302</b> during blanking may be controlled so as to be maximized while remaining fully on the up-beam facing surface <b>510</b>. This may further reduce the localization of the applied heat load, as the charged particle beam <b>302</b> may be spread over a larger area. That is the heat load is spread over a larger area; the heat flux is even more distributed around the opening.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Embodiments are particularly appropriate for operation with a high energy flooding beam in which there may be substantial power dissipation in the aperture body <b>400</b>, <b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">Embodiments include the electron source <b>301</b> of the flood column operating at a high voltage, for example more than 20 keV preferably more than 30 keV, 40 keV or 50 keV. The electrons from the electron source <b>301</b> have a high landing energy for example relative to a sample <b>208</b> for example on the sample holder <b>207</b>. Preferably the electron source <b>301</b> of the flood column operates at the same, or at least substantially the same operating voltage as the electron source <b>201</b> of the primary column.

Having the sources <b>201</b>, <b>301</b> of both flood column and the primary column at substantially the same operating voltage is desirable. This is because the sample <b>208</b>, and thus preferably the substrate support and desirably the moveable stage <b>209</b> are set at the same operating voltage for inspection and/or measurement and flooding. That is they may be biased to the source of the primary column during inspection and the source of the flood column during flooding. The relative potential between the primary source the stage is set at high voltage. Flood columns, such as those that are commercially available, have an operating voltage substantially less than the high voltage of the inspection tool <b>200</b>. Such a stage cannot be maintained at high voltage during flooding, since the stages are biased relative to an operating source, whether of the flood column or the primary column. The biasing of the stage should therefore change to suit the source next to operate. For a commercially available flood column, the source can be set to a potential to near ground potential.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The stage may be moved between a flooding position and an inspection/measurement position. It takes time to move the moveable stage <b>209</b> between a flooding position when the sample is in the beam path of the flood column, and an inspection position when the sample is in the beam path of the primary column. Yet the time taken to adjust the stage potential between inspection and flooding settings for a typical commercial flood column and high voltage inspection tool, may take longer than the movement between the flooding and inspection positions. The change in voltage can take as long as minutes. Therefore, there is a significant throughput improvement in having a flood column having a source at least a similar operating voltage to the source of the primary column; this is even for an inspection or measurement tool with a separate flood column having its own flooding position apart from an inspection position. Another benefit is that in reducing the time between flooding and inspection and/or measurement, the flooding effect remains and the risk of it disappearing before inspection/measurement is reduced if not prevented.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">An assessment tool according to some embodiments of the present disclosure may be a tool which makes a qualitative assessment of a sample (e.g. pass/fail), one which makes a quantitative measurement (e.g. the size of a feature) of a sample or one which generates an image of map of a sample.
