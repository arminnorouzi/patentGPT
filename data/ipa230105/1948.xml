More particularly, the present invention relates to a tactile information supply device capable of converting the information received from outside into tactile signals and providing route guidance and a notification.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, electronic devices have evolved in a direction toward smaller, slimmer, and easier-to-carry ones while performing the same or more various functions. These small electronic devices are usually stored and carried in the user's pocket or the like, but they are worn on the wrist or worn on the head portion or arm of the human body.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A wearable device for a human body or various structures generally includes a body for performing functions inherent to an electronic device, and a strap for being drawn out in a predetermined length from the body and fixed to a human body or a structure. These wearable devices may be used independently or may be used depending on other electronic devices. When used depending on an electronic device, a communication method using a short-range communication module can be adopted, and the use of the wearable electronic device can save the cumbersome and frequent use of other electronic devices. Therefore, the use of such wearable electronic devices is becoming increasingly widespread.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Meanwhile, a navigation system is a device that provides directional guidance by displaying information on the current location and information toward the destination (for example, a straight line distance, a direction, etc.) using information received from a satellite or a base station. A navigation device for a vehicle generally includes an manipulation section for inputting instructions to the navigation system, a GPS receiver for detecting the position, a position detection section including a plurality of sensor devices such as a movement sensor and a gyro sensor, a control section for analyzing the geographical information from the current location to the destination in response to the instructions that are input through the manipulation section, and a display section for displaying information related to the route guidance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional navigation devices or apps providing route guidance as described above provide the information depending only on visual and auditory sense. Therefore, it is problematic that it is difficult to efficiently provide information while the user is in a conversation or have difficulty in turning his/her gaze. Furthermore, it is problematic that the risk of an accident increases when a user turns his or her gaze to view the route guidance displayed on the navigation device during driving.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Meanwhile, when using a mobile terminal such as a smartphone or a smart watch, the user generally obtains most of the information through the display of the terminal. Therefore, it is problematic that it is not easy for the user to view the screen of the display in situations such as when the user is exercising, moving, or in a crowded public transportation vehicle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, there is a need for a wearable electronic device and tactile information supply device capable of effectively transmitting external notification

Here, the danger signal, warning signal, and the like can be provided as tactile information through a strong vibration or high pulse of the operation units <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>j. </i></p><p id="p-0126" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b> and <b>21</b></figref> illustrate examples in which a tactile information supply device <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention is in coordination with another terminal.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0140">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, a terminal such as a smartphone and a tactile information supply device <b>100</b> operate in coordination with each other to provide sender information as tactile information. Here, the sender information may be understood to include a series of information about a person who has transmitted a telephone call, message, or the like to the terminal.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0141">Referring to (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, each of the operation units <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>d </i>can operate corresponding to each of the predetermined senders. For example, the operation unit <b>110</b><i>a </i>may correspond to the mother, the operation unit <b>110</b><i>b </i>to a friend, the operation unit <b>110</b><i>c </i>to a company boss, and the operation unit <b>110</b><i>d </i>to the lover. When a message or a telephone call comes from a friend, the controller <b>130</b> may operate (or vibrate) the operation unit <b>110</b><i>b </i>based on predetermined information. It is also possible to determine whether a call has been received or a message has been received based on the operation intensity, operation pulse or the like of the operation units <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>d. </i></p><p id="p-0129" num="0142">Referring to (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, the operation units <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>d </i>may operate only for predetermined senders. For example, if the smartphone is set in silent mode and only the communication received from the lover is set to be notified, the operation units <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>d </i>may be configured such that the operation units <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>c </i>do not to operate when the communication comes from the mother, a company boss, friends, etc. but the operation unit <b>110</b><i>d </i>operate only when the communication comes from the lover. Accordingly, it is advantageous that the terminal and the tactile information supply device <b>100</b> can be implemented for couples.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0143">Meanwhile, by expanding the spam blocking function, the operation units <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>d </i>may be configured to operate only when communication comes from phone numbers stored in the phonebook of a smartphone, and to not operate otherwise. In addition, it is possible to configure the operation units <b>110</b>-<b>110</b><i>d </i>to operate only for the important numbers and groups. As mentioned above, there is an advantage of being able to distinguish only important communications from a large number of communications. Through this, it is expected that a company will be able to smoothly proceed with meetings and help employees stay more focused at work, and that people will be able to take a rest at home without being distracted by anonymous calls.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0144">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, a terminal such as a smartphone and a tactile information supply device <b>100</b> may operate in coordination with each other to provide app information as tactile information. Here, the app information may be understood to include a series of information such as push notifications, calls, alarms, and the like of applications.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0145">Each of the operation units <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>d </i>can operate corresponding to each of the predetermined applications. For example, the operation unit <b>110</b><i>a </i>may correspond to an alarm app, the operator <b>110</b><i>b </i>to social network service (SNS) apps, the operator <b>110</b><i>c </i>to a messenger app, and the operator <b>110</b><i>d </i>to an email app. The controller <b>130</b> can operate (or vibrate) the operator <b>110</b><i>c </i>based on the predetermined information when notifications about friends added, contents uploaded, etc. come from the SNS app.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0146">As described above, the user can obtain tactile information about the senders, apps, and the like from the positions of the operation units <b>110</b><i>a</i>-<b>110</b><i>d </i>that operate. Particularly, it is not easy for the user to view the screen of the display in situations such as when the user is exercising, moving, or in a crowded public transportation vehicle. In such circumstances, however, the user can obtain information in the form of tactile senses from the tactile information supply device <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0147">In addition to the above examples, the tactile information supply device <b>100</b> of the present invention may be applied to provide real-time tactile information for mobile devices, touchscreen devices, console game devices, online games etc. in the information technology (IT) field, applied to driver assistance information feedback systems such as lane departure warning systems, front crash prevention systems, and overspeed protection systems, etc. in the car industry, applied to pulsimeters, measurement of the pressure distribution in human teeth, surgical robots, etc. in the medical field, and applied to tactile Braille books in the assistive device field to transfer tactile sensations effectively.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0148">While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to embodiments thereof, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the following claims.
