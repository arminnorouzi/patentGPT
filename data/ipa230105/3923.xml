However, due to limitations of conventional camera technology, conventional small cameras used in such devices tend to capture images at lower resolutions and/or with lower image quality than can be achieved with larger, higher quality cameras. Achieving higher resolution with small package size cameras generally requires use of a photosensor with small pixel size and a good, compact imaging lens system. Advances in technology have achieved reduction of the pixel size in photosensors. However, as photosensors become more compact and powerful, demand for compact imaging lens systems with improved imaging quality performance has increased. In addition, there are increasing expectations for small form factor cameras to be equipped with higher pixel count and/or larger pixel size image sensors (one or both of which may require larger image sensors) while still maintaining a module height that is compact enough to fit into portable electronic devices. Thus, a challenge from an optical system design point of view is to provide an imaging lens system that is capable of capturing high brightness, high resolution images under the physical constraints imposed by small form factor cameras.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments of an optical prism with interlock for folded lens systems are described. A folded lens system may, for example, be used in small form factor cameras in mobile multipurpose devices such as smartphones and tablet or pad devices. A folded lens system may include a prism and a lens stack including one or more refractive lens elements. The prism redirects light from a first optical axis to a second optical axis to thus provide a &#x201c;folded&#x201d; optical axis for the lens system. Using the prism to fold the optical axis may, for example, reduce the Z-height of the lens system, and thus may reduce the Z-height of a camera that includes the lens system.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, the folded lens system may include, from an object side to an image side, a prism and a lens stack including one or more refractive lenses. A reflective surface of the prism provides a folded optical axis for the lens system by bending the optical axis (e.g., by 90 degrees) to reduce the Z-height of the lens system. In some embodiments, at least a portion of the reflective surface is coated with a reflective material that reflects light in the prism to fold the optical axis. In some embodiments, a mirror on the reflective surface reflects light in the prism to fold the optical axis. In some embodiments, the reflective surface reflects light in the prism to fold the optical axis due to total internal reflection (TIR). In some embodiments, the prism may have refractive power. In some embodiments, one or both of the object and image side surfaces of the prism may be formed with an optical surface (e.g., a convex surface or concave surface) so that the prism refracts light in addition to folding the optical axis. In other words, the prism may have an integrated lens. Integrating a lens in the prism may help to reduce Z-height of the lens system, and also reduces the number of independent lens elements in the folded lens system. For example, in some embodiments, the prism may serve as the objective lens for the lens system, thus not requiring a separate objective lens on the object side of the prism. In some embodiments, a portion of the object side surface of the prism may be coated with an opaque material that provides an aperture stop at that surface.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The image side of the prism includes an interlock structure (e.g., a sloped, notched, or curved surface). In some embodiments, the image side of the prism is formed with a flange that includes the interlock structure (e.g., a sloped, curved, or notched surface on the flange). In some embodiments, the top and/or bottom of the flange may be truncated to reduce Z axis height. In some embodiments, the top of the flange may be truncated so that the flange does not extend above the plane of the object side. In some embodiments, the bottom of the flange may be truncated so that the flange does not extend below the edge where the image side meets the reflective side. A first lens on the image side of the prism has a complementary structure configured to precisely couple to the interlock structure of the prism. In some embodiments, for precision, the interlock structures may be formed at the same time and using the same technique as the optical surfaces of the prism and the lens. The interlock structures may provide high accuracy when assembling the lens system by precisely aligning the object side optical surface of the first lens with the image side optical surface of the prism so that the optical axis is centered in the first lens. The interlocking structure may also make lens system assembly much easier than conventional assembly methods that would require more complex alignment procedures.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The prism and lenses may be composed of any of a variety of optical materials, e.g. optical plastic, polymer, or glass, and may be injection molded or otherwise manufactured. In some embodiments, the prism may be formed of a material with an Abbe number that is higher than that of the refractive lenses.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, a second prism may be located at the image side of the lens stack to fold the optical axis on to a third axis. In some embodiments, the second prism may also include an interlock structure for coupling to a last lens element in the lens stack. In some embodiments, one or both of the object and image side surfaces of the second prism may be formed with an optical surface (e.g., a convex surface or concave surface) so that the second prism refracts light in addition to folding the optical axis.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates geometry of an optical prism with interlock, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates an example optical prism with interlock, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates an optical coating that provides an aperture at the object side surface of an example prism, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates a lens interlocked with a prism as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram showing details of an example prism with an interlock structure, according to some embodiments</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram showing details of an example lens element with a corresponding interlock structure to that of the prism of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrate interlocking a lens element with a prism, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates an example camera that includes an optical prism with interlock as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A through <b>5</b>B</figref>, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an alternative method in which complementary optical surfaces of the prism and first lens element act as the interlocking mechanism, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an example lens system that includes two prisms, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows several non-limiting examples of interlock structures, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flowchart of a method for capturing images using embodiments of a lens system as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A through <b>9</b></figref>, according to some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> illustrates an example computer system that may be used in embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0023" num="0022">This specification includes references to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment.&#x201d; The appearances of the phrases &#x201c;in one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;in an embodiment&#x201d; do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment.
