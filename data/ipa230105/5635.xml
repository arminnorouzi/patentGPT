Definitions</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0039">The following terms or phrases used in the present disclosure have the meanings outlined below:</p><p id="p-0034" num="0040">The term &#x201c;graphene&#x201d; is defined as a one-atom-thick sheet of sp<sup>2 </sup>bonded carbon atoms that are densely packed in a honeycomb crystal lattice.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0041">The term &#x201c;nanotube&#x201d; refers to a tubular-shaped, molecular structure generally having an average diameter in the inclusive range of 1-60 nm and an average length in the inclusive range of 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 250 mm.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0042">The term &#x201c;carbon nanotube&#x201d; or any version thereof refers to a tubular-shaped, molecular structure composed primarily of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice (a graphene sheet) which closes upon itself to form the walls of a seamless cylindrical tube. These tubular sheets can either occur alone (single-walled) or as many nested layers (multi-walled) to form the cylindrical structure.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0043">The term &#x201c;ionizing radiation&#x201d; refers to particles or electromagnetic waves energetic enough to detach electrons from atoms or molecules, thus ionizing them. Examples of ionizing particles include alpha particles, beta particles, neutrons, gamma-ray, hard x-ray, and cosmic rays.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0044">The term &#x201c;non-ionizing radiation&#x201d; refers to lower-energy radiation, such as visible light, infrared, microwaves, and radio waves. The ability of an electromagnetic wave (photons) to ionize an atom or molecule depends on its frequency. Radiation on the short-wavelength end of the electromagnetic spectrum&#x2014;x-rays, and gamma rays&#x2014;is ionizing.

For example, if the carbon nanotubes were exposed to humid air, they will have absorbed H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>2 </sub>and perhaps atomic hydrogen (protium). They may also have various hydrocarbon molecules adsorbed on their surfaces. To rid the carbon nanotubes of unwanted hydrogen, a thermal &#x201c;bake-out&#x201d; was performed during which a vacuum was drawn through a large diameter tube. The &#x201c;bake-out&#x201d; time/temperature history of the experiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (approximately 200&#xb0; C. for 8 hours under a vacuum on the order of 1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>torr.)</p><p id="p-0074" num="0085">During the bake-out unwanted hydrogen isotopes were drawn out of the carbon nanotubes and surrounding metal surfaces into the UHV system. The bake out also removed any residual helium gas that may have been in the system from the helium leak testing used to render the system vacuum tight at ultra high vacuums. The ampoule was allowed to cool to room temperature after the bake-out, and the pressure decreased to a value of on the order of 10<sup>8 </sup>torr. After the ampoule with carbon nanotubes was baked-out, the 12.7 mm diameter copper tube that was used to evacuate the ampoule was clamped shut, sealing the carbon nanotubes from the UHV system.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0086">Gas-Fill</p><p id="p-0076" num="0087">Subsequent to clamping the Cu tube, the ampoule was filled with ultrahigh purity (UHP) deuterium gas to a pressure of approximately 175 psia. The D<sub>2 </sub>was supplied by Voltaix Inc. (North Branch, N.J.) and was certified to be 99.999% pure with respect to non-hydrogen gases and to have less that 1 ppm He. An evacuation/back-fill procedure was used to insure that the gas lines were purged of air prior to filling the ampoule with gas.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0088">Hydrogen Charge</p><p id="p-0078" num="0089">After the ampoule was filled with the desired hydrogen isotope (deuterium), there still could have been unwanted hydrogen in various forms absorbed and/or adsorbed to the carbon nanotubes. To essentially &#x201c;mix&#x201d; remaining hydrogen with deuterium, a &#x201c;thermal charging&#x201d; heat treatment was used. In this example, the ampoule was heated to a temperature of approximately 175&#xb0; C. for 3 hours. The increase in temperature caused the pressure of the deuterium gas to increase to approximately 220 psia. During the thermal charging heat treatment, a greater percentage of deuterium molecules were dissociated and more single deuterium atoms were present in the gas and presumably on and/or in the carbon nanotubes. This could have promoted absorption of the deuterons into inter-wall cavities of multi-walled carbon nanotubes.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0090">Low Temperature Aging</p><p id="p-0080" num="0091">It is known that lowering of the temperature of carbon nanotube-hydrogen mixtures promotes the storage of the gas by the carbon nanotubes. In this experiment, the ampoule was placed in an insulated container, and the exterior of the ampoule was packed with dry-ice. Subsequently the temperature of the carbon nanotubes and gas dropped to approximately &#x2212;90&#xb0; C. This temperature was held for 288 hours and is referred to as &#x201c;low temperature aging.&#x201d; Low temperature aging was performed to promote the segregation of hydrogen to grain boundaries. In this experiment aging was intended to segregate deuterons to inter-wall spaces and defects in the graphene structured tube walls (e.g., Stone-Wales defects).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0092">Gas Analyses</p><p id="p-0082" num="0093">After the &#x201c;thermal history&#x201d; the ampoule was allowed to return to ambient temperature and the gas sample tube (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) was attached to the &#x201c;leak valve&#x201d; on the UHV system to analyze the gas for the presence of <sup>4</sup>He and <sup>3</sup>He. The leak valve (Varian Inc.) allowed precise control of the introduction of gas to the vacuum system.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0094">The tool used to analyze gas samples from the ampoule was a Stanford Research Systems RGA-IOO quadrupole mass spectrometer (SRS, Palo Alto, Calif.) which can effectively measure partial pressures of gases with an accuracy of approximately +10% over a range of 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>to 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>to 10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>torr and thus giving a detection limit on the order of 1 ppm. The performance of this &#x201c;residual gas analyzer&#x201d; (RGA) was verified by an independent lab (Rao and Dong, <i>J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A </i>15(3), May/June 1997). RGAs of this variety measure mass-to-charge ratio (m/Q). Most atoms and molecules were single-charged by the RGA ionizer, and hence the RGA data is simply &#x201c;mass&#x201d; detection. The use of this instrument to measure a dilute concentration of <sup>4</sup>He atoms in a predominately D<sub>2 </sub>gas presents the problem of discerning between two species that are nominally of &#x201c;mass 4&#x201d;. A special procedure was developed to effectively remove hydrogen isotopes (and other reactive gases) so that a definitive measurement of He could be made.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0095">To eliminate the presence of D2 gas in the UHV chamber, the gas sample was pumped using the titanium sublimation pump (TSP) with the gate valves to the Ion-pump and Turbo-pump closed. The TSP pumps reactive gases very efficiently (H<sup>2 </sup>at 1,200 L/min. as shown in Table 1). However, noble gases such as <sup>4</sup>He are not pumped at all. Thus, the basic strategy was to introduce the sample gas, pump on the sample gas with the TSP until the &#x201c;mass 4&#x2019; signal stabilizes. The stabilized &#x201c;mass 4&#x201d; signal was essentially the partial pressure of <sup>4</sup>He in the gas sample (assuming it is a small contributor to the total pressure). The ion-pump (Varian&#xae; triode) was very efficient in pumping noble gases and was used to verify the <sup>4</sup>He signal by eliminating it, and also to check that the base pressure was in the 10<sup>&#x2212;10 </sup>torr range.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Pumping characteristics of the vacuum </entry></row><row><entry>pumps on the UHV system</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="5"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="21pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Pump </entry><entry>Pressure </entry><entry>Gas </entry><entry>Pump</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Type</entry><entry>(torr)</entry><entry>removed</entry><entry>Efficiency</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Mechanical</entry><entry>10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup></entry><entry>all</entry><entry>&#x2002;400 </entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>liters/min</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Turbo</entry><entry>10<sup>&#x2212;8</sup></entry><entry>all</entry><entry>&#x2002;150 </entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>liters/min</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Ti </entry><entry>10<sup>&#x2212;10</sup></entry><entry>reactive</entry><entry>1200</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Sublimation</entry><entry/><entry/><entry>liters/min</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>Triode Ion</entry><entry>10<sup>&#x2212;10</sup></entry><entry>noble and </entry><entry>&#x2002;220 </entry></row><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>others</entry><entry>liters/min</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0086" num="0096">In these experiments, the gas from the ampoule was analyzed twice with slightly different procedures&#x2014;The basic procedure is given in Table 2.

Within the resolution of the experiment <sup>3</sup>He and T were not observed suggesting that the following reaction was dominate: D+D&#x2192;<sup>4</sup>He+23.8 MeV.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 2. Measurement of Optical Radiation from Transmutation of Deuterium to Helium</heading><p id="p-0095" num="0105">The purpose of this experiment was to look for evidence of the expected energy to be given off by a slow nuclear decay of deuterium to <sup>4</sup>He. The mass difference between 2 deuterium nucleuses and one Helium nucleus can be related to energy through Einstein's energy equation E=mc<sup>2</sup>. The expected energy is 23.9 MeV. If the energy is radiated by non-ionizing photons of lev then one would expect to see a flash of nearly 24 million photons each time a slow deuterium decay to <sup>4</sup>He happened. As described below, flashes of light from a sample of carbon nanotubes when exposed to deuterium gas at a pressure 55 psi was observed and measured.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0106">Procedure:</p><p id="p-0097" num="0107">Pressure Cell with Plexiglas Window</p><p id="p-0098" num="0108">A pressure cell was made out of a block of 6064 Aluminum measuring 2.6&#xd7;2.6&#xd7;1.2 inches, and a plate of Plexiglas measuring 2.6&#xd7;2.6&#xd7;0.5 inches. Six equally spaced &#xbc;-20 bolt were drilled and taped at a diameter of 2 in. to hold the Plexiglas against an O-ring seal to the Al block. An O-ring grove was machined into the center of the Aluminum block with an ID of 1 in. The groove was then polished to ensure that there would be no leaking of deuterium through the O-ring seal. At a diameter of &#xbd; inch hole was drilled into the center of the block to a depth of 0.800 in. to contact the sample, viewable through the Plexiglas, with the deuterium gas.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0109">One of the sides of the aluminum block was drilled with a &#x201c;through hole&#x201d; that intersected the center hole of the block. This through hole was positioned so that it would not interfere with the threaded bolt holes for holding the Plexiglas to the Aluminum block. Both sides of the through hole was then taped for a &#xbc; NPT. On one side a high pressure Swagelok valve was mounted and on the other a Honeywell pressure transducer. Additionally a &#x215b; inch NPT was drilled and taped for a Swagelok pressure gauge, so the pressure in the cell could be measured and observed.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0110">Once all of the components were mounted the cell was moved to a glove box filled with dry nitrogen where upon the sample of carbon nanotubes was inserted into the &#xbd; hole center topside. The Plexiglas was then bolted to the block with six &#xbc; 20 bolts. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0111">D<sub>2 </sub>Fueling Station &#x26; Vacuum Bake Out Procedure</p><p id="p-0102" num="0112">The fueling station was comprised of three basic components: (1) the cell, (2) the vacuum pump and (3) a bottle of deuterium with high pressure regulator. These three components were plumbed together with in a T style assembly of &#xbc; stainless steel pipe sections, three valves, and vacuum tight Swagelok connectors. In addition to this, a valve was mounted to the atmosphere close to the vacuum pump. The cell gas manifold was mounted at an elevation so the gas cell could be placed on a hotplate. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0113">A check was made to ensure that the valve on the lecture bottle was closed. The valves through the regulator, to the cell, to the vacuum pump were all opened, and the valve to the atmosphere was closed. The vacuum pump was turned on and a vacuum was pulled on the gas manifold, the cell and the regulator to remove all atmospheric gases. The cell was then heated to a temperature of 80&#xb0; C., for a low temperature bake out for 2 hrs.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0114">The cell was then allowed to cool to a room temperature of 25&#xb0; C. before being back filled with deuterium. Once the cell had cooled, the valve to the vacuum pump was closed while the valve from the cell to the regulator was left open. The regulator was then closed prior to the opening of the lecture bottle valve. Once the lecture bottle was open, the cell with deuterium was slowly backfilled to a pressure of 55 psi.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0115">The valve mounted to the cell was then closed, trapping the deuterium gas in the cell. The lecture bottle valve was closed as well as the regulator. Next, the valves to the vacuum pump and the atmosphere were slowly opened. Once the pressure equalized, the Swagelok connector connecting the cell to the gas manifold was unscrewed. Now, there was a self enclosed pressure vessel filled with only deuterium gas and a sample of carbon nanotubes, that was observable through the Plexiglas.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0116">Carbon Nanotube Preparation</p><p id="p-0107" num="0117">The carbon nanotubes used in this experiment were 4 mm long multiwalled carbon nanotubes from NanoTechLabs, Yankensville, N.C., a supplier of ultra long multi-walled carbon nanotubes.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0118">100 mg of the carbon nanotubes were acid etched in 100 ml of Neat Nitric acid for 1 hr at 80&#xb0; C. to remove amorphous carbon and other contaminates or catalyst particles. The acid was then removed through vacuum filtration. The carbon nanotubes were then washed three times in deionized water to remove acid residue.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0119">A thin layer of carbon nanotubes weighing 1 mg was formed over a cylindrical sample holder 0.100 inch in diameter and &#xbc; in long and placed in an nitrogen furnace for 2 hrs at 400&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0120">The sample was removed directly into a nitrogen glove box where it was then loaded into the gas cell.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0121">Measurement, Detection &#x26; Data Logging Station</p><p id="p-0112" num="0122">Flashes of light were detected and recorded. The basic set up for this data collection station had the same basic components of a typical radiation detection experimental set up. A high voltage (1,000 Volts) photo multiplier tube was used to detect flashes of light from the window side of the cell. The multi-channel analyzer consisted of a pre-amplifier, a sample and hold circuit, an analog to digital converter, and a laptop computer with LabVIEW&#xae;.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0123">The pre-amplifier was capacitively coupled to the photo multiplier to produce a low voltage output signal reflecting the change in current through the photo multiplier tube. This low voltage signal was then input to a sample and hold circuit that would save the value of the highest voltage from the voltage pulse.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0124">This data was then converted to a digital signal and sent to the computer. LabVIEW&#xae; would then record the data and tabulate in a histogram. Once this action was completed LabVIEW&#xae; would send the sample and hold circuit a signal to look for the next voltage pulse. This data collection latency period was on the order of 1 millisecond. A data channel was also used to record the pressure of the cell and a channel to control and record the temperature of the cell.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0125">The Experiment</p><p id="p-0116" num="0126">This experiment was performed by placing both the pressure cell and the photo multiplier tube in a completely dark steel box with a sealable hinged lid&#x2014;Holes were drilled through the box and conducting feed-throughs were mounted for the high voltage photo multiplier, signal wires, temperature control, and the pressure transducer signal wires. The window side of the deuterium pressure cell containing the sample of carbon nanotubes was placed toward the photo multiplier window with a space of about 1 cm. When a flash of light even occurred an electron cascade within the photomultiplier tube would generate a voltage spike.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0127">Between each data run the background was measured and recorded. This was performed by turning the cell so that the solid aluminum back side of the cell faced the window, and the Plexiglas window was facing away from the detector. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0128">A total of 18 data runs were performed. As one can see from the following table, all of the experimental runs show a larger number of counts than background ranging from 2c/hr to as high as 200c/hr above background (c/hr=counts per hour). During the last <b>6</b> runs, the temperature of the samples were under active control. During longer duration runs, a temperature dependence was shown. At higher temperatures, the cell produced more fusion events per hour than at lower temperatures. It was also clearly shown that the histogram distribution of flash intensity was clearly different from background. The experimental run is nearly equal to background at high intensity, however the low intensity flashes are far more numerous than background. Not only are the total number of events larger for the cell facing the detector but that the histogram has a different shape than when the cell is facing away from the detector.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0129">The temperature dependence may make sense due to the fact that that there will be a larger population of relativistic electrons in the graphene structure of the carbon nanotubes than at lower temperatures. The work of other have shown that graphene structures contain relativistic electrons. When a particle is moving at relativistic velocities it gains mass in proportion to the Laurence contraction. It is expected that massive electrons will drop the radius of the hydrogen Bohr orbit, thus allowing nuclear binding forces to cause a slow decay of two deuterium nuclei into helium. Deuterium, having the same charge as hydrogen has essentially the same Bohr orbit.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"
