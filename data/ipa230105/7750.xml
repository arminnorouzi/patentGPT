correction of an image produced using a failed, failing, or otherwise defective light-emitting diode (LED), such as a microLED (&#x3bc;LED). Embodiments disclosed herein are useful in lighting or image-display systems that include LED pixel arrays. In this context, the term &#x201c;pixel&#x201d; means that the LEDs are spaced in a regular grid such that they appear as pixels.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Microscopic LED (&#x3bc;LED) arrays are an emerging technology. &#x3bc;LEDs are useful in lighting and display industries. The &#x3bc;LED arrays can benefit from circuits and systems supporting arrays of thousands to millions of microscopic LEDs (&#x3bc;LEDs). The &#x3bc;LEDs can actively emit light with individual LED control. That is, each &#x3bc;LED can include a dedicated driver circuit. As compared to backlight LED technologies, &#x3bc;LEDs can have higher brightness and a higher level of energy efficiency. These advantages can make &#x3bc;LEDs attractive for a variety of applications. The applications can include television display, automotive lighting, streetlighting, mobile phone display, or the like. To display an image, the electrical current levels of individual &#x3bc;LEDs in an array can be adjusted according to a specific image specification, light intensity, or color profile.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A &#x3bc;LED lighting system can be difficult to manufacture, with large numbers of &#x3bc;LEDs on an LED die and electrically coupled for power and control. Placing these &#x3bc;LEDs in tightly pitched arrays is challenging, with a great potential for &#x3bc;LED failure due to misplacement or various interconnection issues. These issues can be worse in large &#x3bc;LED arrays that already face power and data management problems. Individual light intensity of thousands of emitting &#x3bc;LEDs can be controlled, such as at sufficient refresh rates and fine-grained color and image control, to provide the desired image. Systems that provide for real time or near real time identification and correction of pixel faults in large matrix pixel arrays of microLEDs are needed.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, a &#x3bc;LED array system includes an image post processor configured to translate received image data to pulse width modulation (PWM) and/or analog current control data (that is, the received image data is translated to at least one parameter selected from parameters including PWM and analog current control).

An intensity of light generated from a &#x3bc;LED can reliably be associated with an electrical current. In general, the greater the output current of the &#x3bc;LED, the greater the intensity of the light generated by the &#x3bc;LED. Thus, the intensity of the light generated can be predicted by the output current. Thus, by monitoring the output current of the &#x3bc;LED, the intensity of the &#x3bc;LED can be reliably predicted. The output current <b>117</b> of one or more of the &#x3bc;LEDs from the &#x3bc;LED array <b>116</b> can be monitored, such as by the control circuitry <b>105</b>, and provided to the return frame buffer <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The return frame buffer <b>120</b> can store electrical characteristics associated with &#x3bc;LEDs (e.g., by position (row, column) in the &#x3bc;LED array <b>116</b>).

An expected output current of one or more of the &#x3bc;LEDs of the &#x3bc;LED array <b>116</b> can be compared to the actual output current <b>117</b> from the return frame buffer <b>120</b>. A difference between an expected output current and actual input current that is greater than a specified threshold can indicate that the &#x3bc;LED is not operating as expected. The threshold can be a specified number of standard deviations from an average current, a specified percentage (e.g., 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, a greater or lesser percentage, or some percentage therebetween) of the expected or actual output current, or the like.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The image post process circuitry <b>102</b> can then alter image data <b>101</b> regarding a next image in response to determining the expected output current is more than a threshold from the actual output current. The alteration to the image data <b>101</b> can help compensate for the light intensity difference corresponding to the difference between the actual and expected output currents (e.g., |actual output current&#x2212;expected input current|). The alteration can include, for example, (i) increasing a PWM on period, analog pixel current, or duty cycle of the &#x3bc;LED that was monitored to increase an average output current value and a perceived light intensity; (ii) increasing a PWM on period, analog pixel current, or duty cycle of one or more &#x3bc;LEDs (of a same color) that neighbor (are directly adjacent or within one hop to the &#x3bc;LED being monitored); (iii) increasing a drive current to the &#x3bc;LED being monitored or one or more neighbor &#x3bc;LEDs of the &#x3bc;LED being monitored, or the like. The increase in PWM on time, duty cycle, analog pixel current, or the like, can increase an intensity of a same color, such as to add the color expected to be produced by the &#x3bc;LED into the image. The increase in PWM on time, duty cycle, analog pixel current, or the like, can increase color around the &#x3bc;LED being monitored such as to hide an aberration produced by the &#x3bc;LED.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The return frame buffer <b>120</b> can be used to read out pixel activation and other electrical information related to light intensity. Compare circuitry <b>130</b> can be used to detect differences between desired pixel activity as set in the input frame buffer <b>104</b> and actual pixel activity as read in the return frame buffer <b>120</b>. For example, a mismatch in pixel activity can be used by the image post processing circuitry <b>102</b> to provide for error correction. As will be appreciated, dedicated hardware components, firmware, FPGA sub-systems, or software systems can optionally be used in whole or in part for implementation of the foregoing described components.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Error correction mechanisms can include but are not limited to excluding failed pixels from use in future frames (e.g., by setting a PWM on time, analog pixel current, or intensity value to zero), substituting redundant pixels (by turning on a redundant pixel that was not used previously and is proximate the &#x3bc;LED being monitored), or using adjacent or surrounding pixels to suitably modify or otherwise heal the image data. In some embodiments, post processing can be done on a per-color basis, with the image post process circuitry <b>102</b> acting to correct an RGB pixel triplet, or alternatively, adjusting a single color in a pixel.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Such a system can be useful when fine-grained fault detection and correction control of a large number of full color &#x3bc;LEDs pixels is desired. Failed color pixels can be detected and self-healing, image post-processing, or other algorithmic techniques used to correct or adjust neighboring pixels in substantially real time or near real time to reduce or mitigate negative effects.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates one embodiment of a row and column select in a lighting matrix system <b>200</b>. A read data in module <b>202</b> is used to provide information to a pixel array <b>116</b> that allows row select <b>210</b> and column select <b>212</b> of individual pixels in the array <b>116</b>. Each representative pixel <b>220</b>, <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, and <b>226</b> includes a microLED and associated pixel driver, typically implemented in a semiconductor die (sometimes called a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) backplane). For example, if pixel <b>220</b> fails, the associated pixel driver can read an abnormal current provided by the &#x3bc;LED. The pixel driver can signal failure mode by modifying the bitstream. In one embodiment, array output selection can be run in synchronization with input row selection to allow for synchronous return of image data, suitably modified to indicate failure or failure modes. For example, in one embodiment, a parity bit can be flipped to indicate failure. This bitstream can be sent to a read data out module <b>204</b>, for transfer to a compare module such as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates one embodiment of a lighting system <b>300</b> that includes a matrix <b>320</b> of M pixels with PWM control. PWM control is merely an example control scheme and hybrid and analog pixel current drive schemes can be used in place of the PWM control.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the PWM driving scheme, each LED color is switched on in sequence. Using the PWM driving scheme, each LED color is driven with the same magnitude current. The visible color is controlled by changing the PWM duty cycle of each LED color. That is, one LED color can be driven longer than another LED color to change the mixed color. As human vision is unable to perceive changes in color faster than about 80 Hertz (Hz), the light appears to have one single color.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, a first LED color can be driven with a current for a certain amount of time, then the second LED color can be driven with the same current for a certain time, and then the third LED color can be driven with the current for a certain amount of time. The perceived color, as previously discussed, can be controlled by changing the duty cycle of each color. For example, if there are red, green, and blue LEDs and a specific color is desired, the red LED can be driven for a portion of the cycle, the green LED can be driven for a different portion of the cycle, and the blue LED can be driven for yet another portion of the cycle to realize the color. Using PWM, instead of driving the red LED at a lower current, it is driven at the same current for a shorter time. This example demonstrates the downside of PWM with the LEDs poorly utilized leading to inefficiencies.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Using a hybrid driving scheme, the combined benefits of analog and PWM driving schemes are provided. The hybrid driving scheme divides the input current between two LED colors while treating the set of two colors as a virtual LED to overlay PWM time slicing.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Operationally, the hybrid driving scheme is described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,517,156 and utilizes an analog current division circuit to drive two colors of the LED array simultaneously and then overlays PWM time slicing with the third color of the LED array.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The following description summarizes the timing sequence of the operation of the hybrid driving scheme for a 3-channel LED driving. The specific sequence of virtual colors is merely an example. In implementations of the hybrid driving scheme, the color duplets may be arranged or rearranged in a way to reduce or minimize the complexity of the overlaying PWM logic implementation. During a first sub-interval T<b>1</b>, the color duplet of Red-Green may be powered. During a second, immediately subsequent sub-interval T<b>2</b>, the color duplet of Green-Blue may be powered. During the next immediately subsequent sub-interval T<b>3</b>, the color duplet of Red-Blue may be powered. The sum of sub-intervals T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b> and T<b>3</b> combine to substantially cover a switching period T.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an analog driving scheme, a driving current, rather than a PWM duty cycle, is adjusted to alter a color presented. Each LED is always on, but the driving current (analog pixel current) is changed to alter the color emitted by the LED. Using different mixes of different driving currents can alter the color perceived by a human eye.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The system <b>300</b> can include functionality such as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.

This may include, but is not limited to, precise spatial patterning of emitted light from pixel blocks or individual pixels. Depending on the application, emitted light may be spectrally distinct, adaptive over time, and/or environmentally responsive. The light emitting pixel arrays may provide pre-programmed light distribution in various intensity, spatial, or temporal patterns. The emitted light may be based at least in part on received sensor data and may be used for optical wireless communications. Associated optics may be distinct at a pixel, pixel block, or device level. An example light emitting pixel array may include a device having a commonly controlled central block of high intensity pixels with an associated common optic, whereas edge pixels may have individual optics. Common applications supported by light emitting pixel arrays include video lighting, automotive headlights, architectural and area illumination, street lighting, and informational displays.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Light emitting matrix pixel arrays may be used to selectively and adaptively illuminate buildings or areas for improved visual display or to reduce lighting costs. In addition, light emitting pixel arrays may be used to project media facades for decorative motion or video effects. In conjunction with tracking sensors and/or cameras, selective illumination of areas around pedestrians may be possible. Spectrally distinct pixels may be used to adjust the color temperature of lighting, as well as support wavelength specific horticultural illumination.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition to those applications described above, street lighting is another application that may benefit from use of light emitting pixel arrays. A single type of light emitting array may be used to mimic various street light types, allowing, for example, switching between a Type I linear streetlight and a Type IV semicircular streetlight by appropriate activation or deactivation of selected pixels. In addition, street lighting costs may be lowered by adjusting light beam intensity or distribution according to environmental conditions or time of use. For example, light intensity and area of distribution may be reduced when pedestrians are not present. If pixels of the light emitting pixel array are spectrally distinct, the color temperature of the light may be adjusted according to respective daylight, twilight, or night conditions.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Light emitting arrays are also well suited for supporting applications requiring direct or projected displays. For example, warning, emergency, or informational signs may all be displayed or projected using light emitting arrays. This allows, for example, color changing or flashing exit signs to be projected. If a light emitting array is composed of a large number of pixels, textual or numerical information may be presented. Directional arrows or similar indicators may also be provided.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Vehicle headlamps are a light emitting array application that requires large pixel numbers and a high data refresh rate. Automotive headlights that actively illuminate only selected sections of a roadway can used to reduce problems associated with glare or dazzling of oncoming drivers. Using infrared cameras as sensors, light emitting pixel arrays activate only those pixels needed to illuminate the roadway, while deactivating pixels that may dazzle pedestrians or drivers of oncoming vehicles. In addition, off-road pedestrians, animals, or signs may be selectively illuminated to improve driver environmental awareness. If pixels of the light emitting pixel array are spectrally distinct, the color temperature of the light may be adjusted according to respective daylight, twilight, or night conditions.
