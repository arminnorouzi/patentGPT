In particular, this invention relates to methods of breeding with spotted watermelon, <i>Citrullus lanatus</i>, lines and varieties. This invention further relates to markers able to determine the percentage of spotted allele present in spotted watermelon lines and varieties. In addition, this invention relates to new and distinctive lines and varieties of watermelon with a spotted phenotype.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">All cultivated forms of watermelon belong to the polymorphic species <i>Citrullus lanatus</i>. As a crop, watermelons are grown commercially wherever environmental conditions permit the production of an economically viable yield. Cultivated watermelons grow as annual plants with large, broad leaves. The leaves may be lobed or simple and are typically orbicular to triangular-ovate in shape. The flowers are monoecious, producing both male and female flowers. The flesh color of cultivated watermelons is red, yellow, or white with ovate to oblong strongly compressed seeds that may be brown or white in color. The characterization of the mature fruit can vary widely among varieties of watermelon. Fruits may be round to oblong or elliptical with rind colors varying from dark green to yellow and rind patterning varying widely.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many changes that occurred with the domestication of the watermelon relate to fruit morphology, with a specialization in fruit shape, size, and flavor. Cultivated watermelons can vary from 5 to 45 pounds, depending on the variety or line. In the United States, watermelon is grown in at least 44 states, but the principal watermelon growing states are Georgia, Florida, Texas, and California. Asia is the largest producer of watermelon, with 83.4% of the world production in 2011. Fresh watermelons are consumed in many forms, generally fresh, sliced, or as an ingredient in prepared foods. Over 80% of watermelons grown in the United States are triploid seedless varieties, preferred for their ease of consumption, increased yield, and premium market value over diploid seeded varieties.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><i>Citrullus lanatus </i>is a member of the family Cucurbitaceae, which contains about 90 genera and 700 to 760 species. The family includes melons, pumpkins, squashes, gourds, cucumber, loofah, and many weeds. The genus <i>Citrullus</i>, to which the watermelon belongs, consists of about four species, including <i>C. colocynthis, C. rehmii</i>, and <i>C. ecirrhosus</i>, all of which may be crossed with each other successfully. The watermelon is believed to be native to southern Africa and has been cultivated there for about 4000 years.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Regular, seeded watermelon is diploid and has eleven pairs of chromosomes (2n=2x=22). There also exist tetraploid varieties, which have 44 chromosomes in their somatic cells (2n=4x=44). Popular &#x201c;seedless&#x201d; varieties are triploid, meaning they have 33 chromosomes in their somatic cells (3x=33) and are derived from a cross between male diploid and female tetraploid parents. Triploid plants are unable to produce viable gametes; therefore, when triploid plants are grown in the presence of diploid plants, the triploid plants produce seedless fruit. These seedless varieties may sometimes produce fruit with small, edible white ovules, similar to those in immature cucumbers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Watermelon is an important and valuable field crop with an array of observable and detectable traits of importance both to watermelon consumers and watermelon growers. Traits of importance include taste, texture, size, rind patterns, and shapes. Watermelon consumers desire watermelons that have excellent taste and sweetness. In addition, the texture and firmness of flesh is critical to the consumer experience of eating watermelons. Watermelon fruit may have a wide range of sizes, dozens of possible rind patterns, and an array of shapes from round to cylindrical. Consumers in different markets tend to prefer watermelons with particular sizes, rind patterns, and fruit shapes. Growers also focus on watermelon varieties that have high yields, disease resistances, and can produce fruit that have sufficiently good color and good appearance, as well as be free of defects such as hollow-heart, internal growth, or &#x201c;seeds&#x201d; in the seedless triploid hybrids.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One of the wide variety of colorations and patterns available in watermelon is a spotted pattern. The previously available watermelon that produced fruit with a spotted rind was primarily the heirloom variety &#x2018;Moon and Stars&#x2019;. While this variety has an attractive appearance, it is lacking in commercially desirable characteristics. For example, the fruit flesh of &#x2018;Moon and Stars&#x2019; is less saturated in color and less firm in consistency than desirable, and has a fibrous, stringy flesh texture. Further, the spotting of &#x2018;Moon and Stars&#x2019; only represents one possible spotting type. In addition, the ability to breed new spotted varieties has been limited, because the &#x2018;Moon and Stars&#x2019; heirloom variety is only available as a diploid. Specifically, in order to breed 66% and 100% spotted triploid hybrids, it is necessary to have a spotted tetraploid, which has not previously been available. There exists a need for spotted watermelon lines of different ploidies for use in breeding, and in order to produce varieties with a diverse array of spotted patterns and with commercially desirable characteristics. There also exists a need for markers suitable for use in breeding lines with spotted phenotypes.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to meet these needs, the present invention is directed to methods of producing high yielding and uniform spotted watermelon lines, and methods of using these lines to produce hybrid varieties with commercially desirable characteristics. Specifically, methods of making homozygous-spotted diploid watermelon lines (HSDL) for use in breeding and methods of making homozygous-spotted tetraploid watermelon lines (HSDL) for use in breeding are described. Further, methods of producing 33%, 66%, or 100% spotted triploid hybrid watermelon plants, as well as methods of producing 50% or 100% spotted diploid hybrid watermelon plants, are described. In addition, this invention is directed to markers able to determine the percentage of spotted allele present in spotted watermelon lines and varieties.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one aspect, the present invention is directed to methods of producing a homozygous-spotted diploid watermelon line (HSDL), including: (a) crossing a first diploid watermelon plant with a spotted trait with a second diploid watermelon plant without the spotted trait to produce progeny watermelon seed, wherein the presence of the spotted trait is determined by visually phenotyping for the spotted trait or by genotyping to identify a presence of a marker linked to a spotted allele, wherein the spotted allele is located between position 134886 and position 86340 on Chromosome 4 of a &#x2018;Charleston Gray&#x2019; genome; (b) crossing a watermelon plant grown from the progeny watermelon seed with itself or a second watermelon plant to produce additional progeny watermelon seed; (c) planting the additional progeny watermelon seed of step (b) to produce additional watermelon plants; (d) selecting watermelon plants with the spotted trait from the additional watermelon plants of step (c); (e) repeating the crossing of step (b), the planting of step (c), and the selecting of step (d) for an additional 3-10 generations to produce a homozygous-spotted diploid watermelon line (HSDL), wherein the HSDL is 100% spotted.

Desired spotted phenotypes include fruit rinds with at least one yellow spot of a diameter of at least 0.2 cm, preferably multiple yellow spots scattered over a non-yellow background color. The background color may include any known watermelon color and rind pattern, including but not limited to dark green, medium green, peacock, gray, dark mottled stripe, and tiger stripe. Desired flesh characteristics include dark red, intense red, or vivid red color. Further, desired flesh characteristics include medium to firm flesh firmness. In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention is directed toward triploid watermelon plants that produce fruit with yellow-spotted rinds, a vivid red flesh color, and medium to firm flesh firmness.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0076">These desired rind and flesh characteristics can be accomplished by crossing two watermelon plants such that the progeny watermelon plants exhibit rind and flesh characteristics of both parent plants. In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention is directed towards diploid watermelon plants that can be used to breed triploid, seedless, watermelon plants with spotted rinds and red flesh color. The diploid parent is used as the male parent, and the tetraploid parent is used as the female parent when breeding a triploid. In a preferred embodiment, the diploid watermelon plants used for breeding have spotted rinds, medium-firm flesh, fine (little fiber) flesh coarseness, and red flesh. In a further exemplary embodiment, the present invention is directed towards tetraploid watermelon plants that can be used to breed triploid, seedless, watermelon plants with spotted rinds and red flesh color. The tetraploid parent is used as the female parent, and the diploid parent is used as the male parent when breeding a triploid. In a preferred embodiment, the tetraploid watermelon plants used for breeding have spotted rinds, medium-firm flesh, fine (little fiber) flesh coarseness, and red flesh.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0077">The present invention is directed towards diploid, triploid, and tetraploid varieties of watermelon exhibiting spotted patterning. This spotted patterning can be accomplished by crossing two watermelon plants such that the progeny watermelon plants exhibit patterning of both parent plants. In an exemplary embodiment, the present invention is directed towards triploid seedless watermelon plants. Triploid plants are produced by the cross of a diploid male and tetraploid female. Genes exhibited by triploid plants can be thought of as contributed by the parents in &#x201c;doses.&#x201d; By way of example, if a diploid (2&#xd7;) spotted plant A is crossed with a tetraploid (4&#xd7;) plant B, the result of the cross would be triploid (3&#xd7;) plant C, wherein plant C receives one set of genes from A and two sets of genes from B. It can be said that, in this exemplary cross, that plant C has one &#x201c;dose&#x201d; of genes from plant A and two &#x201c;doses&#x201d; of genes from plant B. By this model, genes can be transferred to progeny in a dose-dependent manner. In a further exemplary embodiment, the present invention is directed toward diploid hybrid watermelon plants. Diploid plants are produced by the cross of a diploid male and diploid female. By way of example, if a diploid (2&#xd7;) spotted plant A is crossed with a diploid (2&#xd7;) plant B, the result of the cross would be diploid (2&#xd7;) plant C, wherein plant C receives one set of genes from A and one set of genes from B. It can be said that, in this exemplary cross, that plant C has one &#x201c;dose&#x201d; of genes from plant A and one &#x201c;dose&#x201d; of genes from plant B.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0078">The dosage effect of the alleles underlying the spotted trait is additive. Therefore, a 33% (i.e., one-dose) spotted triploid hybrid watermelon plant, which has the spotted trait from its diploid male parent (one dose) and a non-spotted trait from its tetraploid female parent (two doses), has an appearance that is intermediate between non-spotted and fully spotted. It is, in essence, 66% non-spotted and 33% spotted, with an intermediate level of spotting. This intermediate level of spotting is highly valued as an attractive and desired level of spotting (i.e., the fruit is spotted, but not too spotted).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0079">Watermelon hybrid &#x2018;E26S.00171&#x2019; is an exemplary 33% spotted triploid hybrid. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>I</figref>, the spotting is present on the plant as well as the fruit. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C-<b>1</b>D</figref> show spotting on the leaves. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref> shows a spot on the immature female flower. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>H</figref> shows a spot on the immature fruit. In some embodiments, the fruit may show spots when immature (i.e., at young stages). In some embodiments, the fruit may show spots when more mature (i.e., when immature, spots are not shown on the fruit). Further, the immature fruit has a lighter green background rind pattern (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>H</figref>) as compared to the mature rind pattern (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>I</figref> shows a whole plant with spotting throughout. The spots on watermelon hybrid &#x2018;E26S.00171&#x2019; are yellow. The majority of the spots are less than 2 cm in diameter, and spots range from 0.2 cm to 15 cm in diameter.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0080">The present invention is also directed toward triploid watermelon varieties with different dosages of spots. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref> show exemplary triploid watermelon varieties with 100% spot allele (i.e., three spot alleles), or 100% spotted triploid hybrids. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows an exemplary triploid watermelon variety with 66% spot allele (i.e., two spot alleles), or a 66% spotted triploid hybrid. For both the 100% spotted and the 66% spotted varieties, the fruit rind and the leaves (upper and lower surface) are spotted.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0081">The present invention is further directed towards diploid and tetraploid varieties and/or lines of watermelon exhibiting the spotted phenotype (e.g., on fruit rind and leaves). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an exemplary 100% spotted diploid line, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an exemplary 100% spotted tetraploid line.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0082">The percentage or dosage of the alleles underlying the spotted rind patterning trait is linked to ploidy. For all ploidies (diploid, triploid, and tetraploid), 100% means the allele is homozygously present, and 0% means the allele is absent (i.e., homozygously absent). The number of alleles present, however, varies by ploidy. If &#x201c;A&#x201d; is used to designate the spotted allele, and &#x201c;a&#x201d; is used to designate the non-spotted allele, a 100% spotted diploid line has two spotted alleles (AA), a 100% spotted triploid line has three spotted alleles (AAA), and a 100% spotted tetraploid line has four spotted alleles (AAAA). For tetraploid lines, 25% means there is one spotted allele present of a possible four (Aaaa), 50% means there are two spotted alleles present (AAaa), and 75% means there are three spotted alleles present (AAAa). For triploid varieties, 33% means there is one spotted allele present of a possible three (Aaa), and 66% means there are two spotted alleles present (AAa). For diploid lines, 50% means there is one spotted allele present of a possible two (i.e., the line is heterozygous; Aa). It is thought that the percentage of the alleles corresponds to the density of the spots, e.g., on leaves, fruit, etc.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0083">There are numerous steps in the development of any novel, desirable plant germplasm. Plant breeding begins with the analysis and definition of problems and weaknesses of the current germplasm, the establishment of program goals, and the definition of specific breeding objectives. The next step is selection of germplasm that possess the traits to meet the program goals. The selected germplasm is crossed in order to recombine the desired traits, and then through selection, varieties or parent lines are developed. The goal is to combine in a single line, variety, or hybrid an improved combination of desirable traits from the parental germplasm. These important traits may include higher yield, field performance, resistance to diseases and insects, and tolerance to drought and heat. These important traits may also include fruit and agronomic quality such as fruit shape, fruit appearance, fruit flesh firmness, and internal quality of fruit.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0084">Choice of breeding or selection methods can depend on the mode of plant reproduction, the heritability of the trait(s) being improved, and the type of cultivar used commercially (e.g., F<sub>1 </sub>hybrid cultivar, pureline cultivar, etc.). For highly heritable traits, a choice of superior individual plants evaluated at a single location will be effective, whereas for traits with low heritability, selection should be based on mean values obtained from replicated evaluations of families of related plants. Popular selection methods commonly include pedigree selection, modified pedigree selection, mass selection, and recurrent selection.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0085">The complexity of inheritance influences choice of the breeding method. Backcross breeding is used to transfer one or a few favorable genes for a highly heritable trait into a desirable cultivar. This approach has been used extensively for breeding disease-resistant varieties. Various recurrent selection techniques are used to improve quantitatively inherited traits controlled by numerous genes. The use of recurrent selection in self-pollinating crops depends on the ease of pollination, the frequency of successful hybrids from each pollination, and the number of hybrid offspring from each successful cross.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0086">Each breeding program may include a periodic, objective evaluation of the efficiency of the breeding procedure. Evaluation criteria vary depending on the goal and objectives, and can include gain from selection per year based on comparisons to an appropriate standard, overall value of the advanced breeding lines, and number of successful cultivars produced per unit of input (e.g., per year, per dollar expended, etc.).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0087">Promising advanced breeding lines are thoroughly tested and compared to appropriate standards in environments representative of the commercial target area(s) for at least three years. The best lines can then be candidates for new commercial cultivars. Those still deficient in a few traits may be used as parents to produce new populations for further selection. These processes, which lead to the final step of marketing and distribution, may take from ten to twenty years from the time the first cross or selection is made.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0088">One goal of watermelon plant breeding is to develop new, unique, and genetically superior watermelon cultivars and hybrids. A breeder can initially select and cross two or more parental lines, followed by repeated selfing and selection, producing many new genetic combinations. A plant breeder can then select which germplasms to advance to the next generation. These germplasms may then be grown under different geographical, climatic, and soil conditions, and further selections can be made during, and at the end of, the growing season.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0089">The development of commercial watermelon cultivars thus requires the development of watermelon parental lines, the crossing of these lines, and the evaluation of the crosses. Pedigree breeding and recurrent selection breeding methods may be used to develop cultivars from breeding populations. Breeding programs can be used to combine desirable traits from two or more varieties or various broad-based sources into breeding pools from which lines are developed by selfing and selection of desired phenotypes. The new lines are crossed with other lines and the hybrids from these crosses are evaluated to determine which have commercial potential.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0090">Pedigree breeding is generally used for the improvement of self-pollinating crops or inbred lines of cross-pollinating crops. Two parents which possess favorable, complementary traits are crossed to produce an F<sub>1</sub>. An F<sub>2 </sub>population is produced by selfing one or several F<sub>1</sub>s or by intercrossing two F<sub>1</sub>s (sib mating). Selection of the best individuals is usually begun in the F<sub>2 </sub>population; then, beginning in the F<sub>3</sub>, the best individuals in the best families are selected. Replicated testing of families, or hybrid combinations involving individuals of these families, often follows in the F<sub>4 </sub>generation to improve the effectiveness of selection for traits with low heritability. At an advanced stage of inbreeding (i.e., F<sub>6 </sub>and F<sub>7</sub>), the best lines or mixtures of phenotypically similar lines are tested for potential release as new cultivars.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0091">Mass and recurrent selections can be used to improve populations of either self- or cross-pollinating crops. A genetically variable population of heterozygous individuals is either identified or created by intercrossing several different parents. The best plants are selected based on individual superiority, outstanding progeny, or excellent combining ability. The selected plants are intercrossed to produce a new population in which further cycles of selection are continued.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0092">Backcross breeding may be used to transfer genes for a simply inherited, highly heritable trait into a desirable homozygous cultivar or line that is the recurrent parent. The source of the trait to be transferred is called the donor parent. The resulting plant is expected to have the attributes of the recurrent parent (e.g., cultivar) and the desirable trait transferred from the donor parent. After the initial cross, individuals possessing the phenotype of the donor parent are selected and repeatedly crossed (backcrossed) to the recurrent parent. The resulting plant is expected to have the attributes of the recurrent parent (e.g., cultivar) and the desirable trait transferred from the donor parent.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0093">New varieties can also be developed from more than two parents. The technique, known as modified backcrossing, uses different recurrent parents during the backcrossing. Modified backcrossing may be used to replace the original recurrent parent with a variety having certain more desirable characteristics or multiple parents may be used to obtain different desirable characteristics from each.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0094">In addition to being used to create a backcross conversion, backcrossing can also be used in combination with pedigree breeding. As discussed previously, backcrossing can be used to transfer one or more specifically desirable traits from one variety, the donor parent, to a developed variety called the recurrent parent, which has overall good agronomic characteristics yet lacks that desirable trait or traits. However, the same procedure can be used to move the progeny toward the genotype of the recurrent parent, but at the same time retain many components of the nonrecurrent parent by stopping the backcrossing at an early stage and proceeding with selfing and selection. For example, an inbred watermelon line may be crossed with another variety to produce a first generation progeny plant. The first generation progeny plant may then be backcrossed to one of its parent varieties to create a BC1 or BC2. Progeny are selfed and selected so that the newly developed variety has many of the attributes of the recurrent parent and yet several of the desired attributes of the nonrecurrent parent. This approach leverages the value and strengths of the recurrent parent for use in new watermelon varieties.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0095">The single-seed descent procedure in the strict sense refers to planting a segregating population, harvesting a sample of one seed per plant, and using the one-seed sample to plant the next generation. When the population has been advanced from the F<sub>2 </sub>to the desired level of inbreeding, the plants from which lines are derived will each trace to different F<sub>2 </sub>individuals. The number of plants in a population declines each generation due to failure of some seeds to germinate or some plants to produce at least one seed. As a result, not all of the F<sub>2 </sub>plants originally sampled in the population will be represented by a progeny when generation advance is completed.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0096">In addition to phenotypic observations, the genotype of a plant can also be examined. There are many laboratory-based techniques known in the art that are available for the analysis, comparison and characterization of plant genotype. Such techniques include, without limitation, High Resolution Melting (HRM), DNA- or RNA-sequencing, CAPS Markers, ELISA, Western blot, microarrays, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), Isozyme Electrophoresis, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs), Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), Arbitrarily Primed Polymerase Chain Reaction (AP-PCR), Differential Display Polymerase Chain Reaction (DD-PCR), Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR), DNA Amplification Fingerprinting (DAF), Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions (SCARs), Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs), and Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs, which are also referred to as Microsatellites).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0097">Molecular markers can also be used during the breeding process for the selection of qualitative traits. For example, markers closely linked to alleles or markers containing sequences within the actual alleles of interest can be used to select plants that contain the alleles of interest during a backcrossing breeding program. The markers can also be used to select toward the genome of the recurrent parent and against the markers of the donor parent. This procedure attempts to minimize the amount of genome from the donor parent that remains in the selected plants. It can also be used to reduce the number of crosses back to the recurrent parent needed in a backcrossing program. The use of molecular markers in the selection process is often called genetic marker enhanced selection or marker-assisted selection. Molecular markers may also be used to identify and exclude certain sources of germplasm as parental varieties or ancestors of a plant by providing a means of tracking genetic profiles through crosses.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0098">Mutation breeding may also be used to introduce new traits into watermelon varieties. Mutations that occur spontaneously or are artificially induced can be useful sources of variability for a plant breeder. The goal of artificial mutagenesis is to increase the rate of mutation for a desired characteristic. Mutation rates can be increased by many different means including temperature, long-term seed storage, tissue culture conditions, radiation (such as X-rays, Gamma rays, neutrons, Beta radiation, or ultraviolet radiation), chemical mutagens (such as base analogs like 5-bromo-uracil), antibiotics, alkylating agents (such as sulfur mustards, nitrogen mustards, epoxides, ethyleneamines, sulfates, sulfonates, sulfones, or lactones), azide, hydroxylamine, nitrous acid, or acridines. Once a desired trait is observed through mutagenesis the trait may then be incorporated into existing germplasm by traditional breeding techniques. Details of mutation breeding can be found in Principles of Cultivar Development by Fehr, Macmillan Publishing Company, 1993.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0099">The production of double haploids can also be used for the development of homozygous varieties in a breeding program. Double haploids are produced by the doubling of a set of chromosomes from a heterozygous plant to produce a completely homozygous individual. For example, see Wan et al., <i>Theor. Appl. Genet., </i>77:889-892, 1989.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0100">Additional non-limiting examples of breeding methods that may be used include, without limitation, those found in <i>Principles of Plant Breeding</i>, John Wiley and Son, pp. 115-161, 1960; Allard, 1960; Simmonds, 1979; Sneep et al., 1979; Fehr, 1987; &#x201c;Carrots and Related Vegetable Umbelliferae&#x201d;, Rubatzky, V.

This is due to the random segregation of chromosomes, which can result in chromosomes occasionally ending up distributed back to normal in the ovule and pollen such that they are balanced enough to be viable. Thus, occasional viable pollen from a triploid variety can be &#x201c;bridged&#x201d;, or crossed, onto a normal diploid or tetraploid line to make viable hybrid seed. Similarly, occasional viable ovules within a triploid can be bridged or crossed onto, using pollen from a normal tetraploid or diploid line to create viable seed. Also occasionally, a triploid within and of itself can make a viable seed that can make a fertile plant. This occasional fertility of triploid varieties is well-known by watermelon breeders, and can be taken advantage of to incorporate triploid varieties with desirable characteristics into breeding programs. Watermelon variety &#x2018;E26S.00171&#x2019;, like other triploid varieties, occasionally produces flowers with viable pollen or viable ovules.

The term &#x201c;single gene converted plant&#x201d; as used herein refers to those watermelon plants which are developed by a plant breeding technique called backcrossing wherein essentially all of the desired morphological and physiological characteristics of a cultivar are recovered in addition to the single gene transferred into the line via the backcrossing technique. Backcrossing methods can be used with the present invention to improve or introduce a characteristic into the line. The term &#x201c;backcrossing&#x201d; as used herein refers to the repeated crossing of a hybrid progeny back to one of the parental watermelon plants for that line, backcrossing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or more times to the recurrent parent. The parental watermelon plant which contributes the gene for the desired characteristic is termed the nonrecurrent or donor parent. This terminology refers to the fact that the nonrecurrent parent is used one time in the backcross protocol and therefore does not recur. The parental watermelon plant to which the gene or genes from the nonrecurrent parent are transferred is known as the recurrent parent as it is used for several rounds in the backcrossing protocol (Poehlman &#x26; Sleper, 1994; Fehr, 1987). In a typical backcross protocol, the original cultivar of interest (recurrent parent) is crossed to a second line (nonrecurrent parent) that carries the single gene of interest to be transferred. The resulting progeny from this cross are then crossed again to the recurrent parent and the process is repeated until a watermelon plant is obtained wherein essentially all of the desired morphological and physiological characteristics of the recurrent parent are recovered in the converted plant, in addition to the single transferred gene from the nonrecurrent parent.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0173">The selection of a suitable recurrent parent is an important step for a successful backcrossing procedure. The goal of a backcross protocol is to alter or substitute a single trait or characteristic in the original line. To accomplish this, a single gene of the recurrent cultivar is modified or substituted with the desired gene from the nonrecurrent parent, while retaining essentially all of the rest of the desired genetic, and therefore the desired physiological and morphological, constitution of the original line. The choice of the particular nonrecurrent parent will depend on the purpose of the backcross; one of the major purposes is to add some commercially desirable, agronomically important trait to the plant. The exact backcrossing protocol will depend on the characteristic or trait being altered to determine an appropriate testing protocol. Although backcrossing methods are simplified when the characteristic being transferred is a dominant allele, a recessive allele may also be transferred. In this instance it may be necessary to introduce a test of the progeny to determine if the desired characteristic has been successfully transferred.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0174">Many single gene traits have been identified that are not regularly selected for in the development of a new line but that can be improved by backcrossing techniques. Single gene traits may or may not be transgenic, and examples of these traits include but are not limited to, male sterility, modified fatty acid metabolism, modified carbohydrate metabolism, herbicide resistance, resistance for bacterial, fungal, or viral disease, insect resistance, enhanced nutritional quality, industrial usage, yield stability, and yield enhancement. These genes are generally inherited through the nucleus. Several of these single gene traits are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,777,196, 5,948,957 and 5,969,212, the disclosures of which are specifically hereby incorporated by reference.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Tissue Culture</heading><p id="p-0115" num="0175">As used herein, the term &#x201c;tissue culture&#x201d; indicates a composition including isolated cells of the same or a different type or a collection of such cells organized into parts of a plant. Exemplary types of tissue cultures are protoplasts, calli, meristematic cells, and plant cells that can generate tissue culture that are intact in plants or parts of plants, such as leaves, pollen, embryos, roots, root tips, anthers, pistils, flowers, seeds, petioles, and the like. Means for preparing and maintaining plant tissue culture are well known in the art. The use of tissue culture to propagate watermelon plants is exemplified in Adelberg, J. W., B. B. Rhodes, <i>Micropropagation from zygotic tissue of watermelon</i>, C. E. Thomas (ed.) Proc. of the Cucurbitaceae 89<i>: Evaluation and enhancement of cucurbit germplasm</i>, Charleston S.C., USA; and Zhang et al., <i>Shoot regeneration from immature cotyledon of watermelon</i>, Cucurbit Genetics Coop. 17:111-115 (1994).</p><p id="p-0116" num="0176">Transformation of plant protoplasts also can be achieved using methods based on calcium phosphate precipitation, polyethylene glycol treatment, electroporation, and combinations of these treatments (see, e.g., Potrykus et al., 1985; Omirulleh et al., 1993; Fromm et al., 1986; Uchimiya et al., 1986; Marcotte et al., 1988). Transformation of plants and expression of foreign genetic elements is exemplified in Choi et al. (1994) and Ellul et al. (2003). Direct uptake of DNA into protoplasts using CaCl2 precipitation, polyvinyl alcohol, or poly-L-ornithine has also been reported (see, e.g., Hain et al., 1985 and Draper et al., 1982). Electroporation of protoplasts and whole cells and tissues have also been described (see, e.g., Saker et al., 1998; Donn et al., 1990; D'Halluin et al., 1992; and Laursen et al., 1994; Chupean et al., 1989).</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Additional Breeding Methods</heading><p id="p-0117" num="0177">This invention also is directed to methods for producing a diploid, triploid, and tetraploid watermelon plants with spotted phenotypes and commercially desirable characteristics, and using these plants in breeding. In this manner, a diverse array of watermelon patterns (e.g., fruit rind, leaf, etc.), watermelon flesh color, and watermelon taste may be developed and selected for superior qualities including appearance and taste. Further, watermelon varieties may be developed and selected for superior qualities including improved firmness of flesh, improved internal quality, increased yield, and hardiness. Breeding steps that may be used in the watermelon plant breeding program include pedigree breeding, backcrossing, mutation breeding, and recurrent selection. In conjunction with these steps, techniques such as RFLP-enhanced selection, genetic marker enhanced selection (for example SSR markers) and the making of double haploids may be utilized.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0178">Several methods can be used to produce triploid seeds from an inbred tetraploid and/or diploid line. Two commonly used methods are the bee-pollination method and the hand-pollination method. In the United States, the bee-pollination method is generally used to produce triploid watermelon seed. Hand-pollination is mainly used to produce triploid watermelon seed in areas where isolation is not available and several triploid hybrids are produced in the same field block.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0179">Tetraploid watermelon lines can be developed from diploid lines by doubling the chromosomes of diploid watermelon lines using methods routine in the art. Chromosome doubling was first accomplished with the alkaloid colchicine by applying colchicine to the growing point of newly emerged watermelon seedlings. Tissue culture methods have also been developed (Zhang, X. P., B. B. Rhodes, H. T. Skorupska, W. C. Bridges, 1995, Generating Tetraploid Watermelon Using Colchicine in Vitro, G. Lester &#x26; J. Dunlap et al. (eds.), Cucurbitaceae '94: 134-139). Dinitroanilines have been used to double chromosome numbers, and their effectiveness has previously been compared with crops other than watermelon. Li et al. compared in vitro chromosome doubling effectiveness using colchicine and the dinitroanilines, ethalfluralin (N-ethyl-N-2-methyl-2-propenyl)-2,6-dinitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzanine), and oryzalin (3,5-dinitro-N4,N4-dipropylsulfanilamide) and concluded that either ethalfluralin or oryzalin was preferable to colchicine (Li, Ying, J. F. Whitesides, B. Rhodes, 1999, In vitro generation of tetraploid watermelon with two different dinitroanilines and colchicines, Cucurbit Genetics Cooperative Rpt 22:38-40).</p><p id="p-0120" num="0180">Several treatment methods can be used to induce tetraploids from diploids using the chemicals mentioned above. One exemplary method is to treat the seed before sowing. The seed are soaked in clean water for 5-6 hrs and then the seed are soaked in either colchicine solution (0.2%) or dinitroanilines (e.g. 35 &#x3bc;M oryzalin) for 24 hrs. The seed are briefly rinsed before sowing. Dry seed can also be directly soaked in the chemical solution without pre-soaking in the water. The treatment usually reduces the germination and emergence. A second method is to treat the newly emerged seedling. To illustrate, the diploid inbreds can be sown in the greenhouse in seedling flats. The soil temperature is kept at 29-31&#xb0; C. for rapid and uniform germination. One drop of colchicine (0.1%) or dinitroanilines (e.g. 35 &#x3bc;M oryzalin) solution is added to the shoot apex between the cotyledons as soon as the seedling has emerged from soil. The colchicine solution is applied to the growing point in the morning or evening for three consecutive days. Good chromosome doubling is achieved from application of oryzalin. Another illustrative method is to treat the shoot apex of germinated seed after which the germinated seed is planted into soil. The seeds are germinated in an incubator at 30&#xb0; C. When the radicles are about 2 cm long, the portion above the hypocotyls of germinated seeds is immersed upside down into colchicine (0.1%) or dinitroaniline solution (35 &#x3bc;M oryzalin) for 10-15 hrs at 30&#xb0; C. in an incubator. The treatment is typically conducted in a high humidity chamber or box to assure that the radicles/roots are not desiccated. The seeds are then washed and planted in the soil. The last two methods, although more tedious to use, usually give better recovery of tetraploid events as the root system is not affected by the treatment.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0181">The next step is to develop tetraploid lines from individual converting events. For example, the selected tetraploid individuals based on morphological expression can be self-pollinated and the resulting seeds planted in the next generation as lines. These lines can again be self-pollinated and compared for fertility and horticultural traits. Only the desirable lines are selected if there is difference among these lines. Desirable lines may be bulk harvested if there is no variation within the line and among selected lines. Further seed increases may be conducted in an isolation block. Mass selection may be conducted for this increase in the isolation plot and thereafter. Fertility of the tetraploid may be improved in subsequent generations.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0182">Crossing two different tetraploids and then going through recombination breeding can also result in new tetraploid lines. A longer breeding period is typically employed to develop a stable tetraploid line using this approach because of the larger number of combinations and the fewer seed that tetraploids produce. However, some breeders have made good progress by taking this approach.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0183">Because meiosis is sometimes irregular in autotetraploids, there can be diploids and aneuploids among the offspring. The leaves, flowers and pollen grains of tetraploids are morphologically distinct from diploids (Zhang, X. P., B. B. Rhodes, H. T. Skorupska, W. C. Bridges, 1995<i>, Generating Tetraploid Watermelon Using Colchicine in Vitro</i>, G. Lester &#x26; J. Dunlap et al. (eds.), Cucurbitaceae '94: 134-139). Tetraploids also have a different number of chloroplasts in the guard cells (Compton, M. E., D. J. Gray and G. W. Elmstrom. 1996<i>, Identification of tetraploid regenerants from cotyledons of diploid watermelon cultures in vitro</i>, Euphytica 87:165-172). These morphological traits can help the breeder eliminate the diploids and aneuploids occurring in the tetraploid population during sexual propagation. Diploid reversions can also be identified in situations in which a diploid derived from a tetraploid line is desired, and such diploid reversions are also encompassed by the present invention.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0184">The cultivar of the invention can also be used for transformation where exogenous genes are introduced and expressed by the cultivar of the invention. Genetic variants of hybrid &#x2018;E26S.00171&#x2019; created either through traditional breeding methods or through transformation of hybrid &#x2018;E26S.00171&#x2019; by any of a number of protocols known to those of skill in the art are intended to be within the scope of this invention.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0185">Mutations for use in mutation breeding can be induced in plants by using mutagenic chemicals such as ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS), by irradiation of plant material with gamma rays or fast neutrons, or by other means. The resulting nucleotide changes are random, but in a large collection of mutagenized plants the mutations in a gene of interest can be readily identified by using the TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) method (McCallum et al. (2000) Targeted screening for induced mutations. Nat. Biotechnol. 18, 455-457, and Henikoff et al. (2004) TILLING. Traditional mutagenesis meets functional genomics. Plant Physiol. 135, 630-636). The principle of this method is based on the PCR amplification of the gene of interest from genomic DNA of a large collection of mutagenized plants in the M2 generation. By DNA sequencing or by looking for point mutations using a single-strand specific nuclease, such as the CEL-I nuclease (Till et al. (2004) Mismatch cleavage by single-strand specific nucleases. Nucleic Acids Res. 32, 2632-2641), the individual plants that have a mutation in the gene of interest are identified. By screening many plants, a large collection of mutant alleles is obtained, each giving a different effect on gene expression or enzyme activity. The gene expression or protein levels can for example be tested by transcript analysis levels (e.g., by RT-PCR) or by quantification of protein levels with antibodies. Plants with the desired reduced gene expression or reduced protein expression are then back-crossed or crossed to other breeding lines to transfer only the desired new allele into the background of the crop wanted.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0186">Genes of interest for use in breeding may also be edited using gene editing techniques including transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) gene editing techniques, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR/Cas9) gene editing techniques, and/or zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN) gene editing techniques. For this, transgenic plants are generated expressing one or more constructs targeting the gene of interest. These constructs may include, without limitation, an anti-sense construct, an optimized small-RNA construct, an inverted repeat construct, a targeting construct, a guide RNA construct, a construct encoding a targeting protein, and/or a combined sense-anti-sense construct, and may work in conjunction with a nuclease, an endonuclease, and/or an enzyme, so as to downregulate the expression of a gene of interest.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0187">One of ordinary skill in the art of plant breeding would know how to evaluate the traits of two plant varieties to determine if there is no significant difference between the two traits expressed by those varieties. For example, see Fehr and Walt, Principles of Cultivar Development, p. 261-286 (1987). Thus the invention includes watermelon plants including a combination of at least two traits selected from the combination of traits listed in the Summary of the Invention for hybrid &#x2018;E26S.00171&#x2019;, so that said progeny watermelon plant is not significantly different for said traits than watermelon hybrid &#x2018;E26S.00171&#x2019;, as determined at the 5% significance level when grown in the same environmental conditions and/or may be characterized by percent similarity or identity to watermelon hybrid &#x2018;E26S.00171&#x2019;, as determined by SSR markers. Mean trait values may be used to determine whether trait differences are significant, and preferably the traits are measured on plants grown under the same environmental conditions. Once such a variety or line is developed its value is substantial since it is important to advance the germplasm base as a whole in order to maintain or improve traits such as firmness of flesh, internal quality, taste, appearance, yield, disease resistance, pest resistance, and plant performance in extreme environmental conditions.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0188">As used herein, the term &#x201c;plant&#x201d; includes plant cells, plant protoplasts, plant cell tissue cultures from which watermelon plants can be regenerated, plant calli, plant clumps, and plant cells that are intact in plants or parts of plants, such as leaves, pollen, embryos, cotyledons, hypocotyl, roots, root tips, anthers, pistils, flowers, seeds, stems, and the like.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0189">The use of the terms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the,&#x201d; and similar referents in the context of describing the invention (especially in the context of the following claims) are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context.

spotted, with four different percentages of spotted allele (100%, 75%, 50%, and 25%). The F2 plants with the spotted phenotype were then self pollinated and selected for the spotted phenotype for a sufficient number of generations to produce a homozygous spotted tetraploid line (HSTL). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an exemplary tetraploid watermelon line with 100% spot allele.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0213">The markers identified in Example 1 can be used to facilitate the breeding process described in this Example. Specifically, the markers for the spot allele are very helpful to use at the F2 stage in order to select the material with the higher dosage of spotted alleles, namely 100% (AAAA). The use of the marker allows the production of a tetraploid line homozygous for the spotted trait (HSTL) in fewer generations of inbreeding.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-sequence-list-doc id="SEQLST-1"><sequence-list file="US20230000035A1-20230105-S00001.XML" carriers="internal-electronic" seq-file-type="ST.25"/></us-sequence-list-doc><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
