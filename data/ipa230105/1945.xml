In the first embodiment, an explanation of specific contents of the assistance control will be omitted, and an explanation will be given to the function of information the driver of the state of the assistance control. The driving assistance apparatus <b>100</b> is provided with an input information device <b>10</b>, a display controller <b>20</b>, and a display executor <b>30</b>, so as to inform the driver of the state of the assistance control.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The input information device <b>10</b> is provided with an external sensor <b>11</b>, a vehicle wheel speed sensor <b>12</b>, an accelerator pedal sensor <b>13</b>, a brake pedal sensor <b>14</b>, and a steering angle sensor <b>15</b>.

Specifically, the operating area determination device <b>25</b> may specify the target of the assistance control from the course of the vehicle <b>1</b>, which is predicted by the course predictor <b>23</b>. The operating area determination device <b>25</b> may determine (or arithmetically operate) the operating area, for example, on the basis of the speed of the vehicle <b>1</b>, which is detected by the speed detector <b>21</b>, the relative speed between the vehicle <b>1</b> and the specified target, which is detected by the target distance/speed detector <b>22</b>, or the like.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Now, the operating area will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a &#x201c;recognition area&#x201d; may be typically an area determined in accordance with a detection range of the external sensor <b>11</b>, and may mean an area in which the target of the assistance control can be detected (or recognized) by the external sensor <b>11</b>. A range of the &#x201c;recognition area&#x201d; may be changed in accordance with the contents of the assistance control. It can be said that the recognition area is an area in which at least the requirement &#x201c;(i) the target is recognized&#x201d; is satisfied from among the three requirements described above. Thus, the operating area is included in the recognition area.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Back in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the non-operating area determination device <b>26</b> is configured to determine (or arithmetically operate) a non-operating area (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) on the basis of an output of the driver operation determination device <b>24</b>. Here, it takes some time from when the driver operates at least one of the accelerator pedal, the brake pedal, and the steering wheel, to when the state of the vehicle <b>1</b> becomes a state corresponding to the driver's operation. In other words, there is a response delay. The non-operating area determination device <b>26</b> may take into account the response delay and may determine (or arithmetically operate) an area as follows to be the &#x201c;non-operating area&#x201d;; namely, in the area, the first condition is currently satisfied, but the state of the vehicle <b>1</b> will change in the future due to the driver's current operation, and the first condition is presumably no longer satisfied. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the non-operating area may be typically included in the operating area. The non-operating area may not exist depending on the driver's operation.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The non-operating area determination device <b>26</b> may determine the operating area, for example, on the basis of a non-operating time or a non-operating distance of the assistance control caused by the driver's operation. Here, an example of the &#x201c;non-operating time or the non-operating distance of the assistance control caused by the driver's operation&#x201d; may include a predetermined distance indicating a time and a distance at which the assistance control is not operated after the brake pedal is released, a time and a distance at which the assistance control is not operated after the accelerator pedal is released, a time and a distance at which the assistance control is not operated after the operation amount of the steering wheel is less than or equal to a predetermined range, or the like. Alternatively, the non-operating area determination device <b>26</b> may determine the non-operating area, for example, on the basis of the speed of the vehicle <b>1</b>, the yaw rate, a result of the course prediction, or the like, in addition to the non-operating time or the non-operating distance.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Alternatively, the non-operating area determination device <b>26</b> may determine the non-operating area, for example, on the basis of a delay time, which is a time between a time point at which a deceleration request is required by an electronic control unit (ECU) of the vehicle <b>1</b> and a time point at which the deceleration request is realized on the vehicle <b>1</b>, if the assistance control is a deceleration assistance control. Here, an example of the &#x201c;delay time&#x201d; may include a delay time of a communication, a response time of an actuator, or the like. Alternatively, the non-operating area determination device <b>26</b> may determine the non-operating area, for example, on the basis of the speed of the vehicle <b>1</b>, the yaw rate, the result of the course prediction, or the like, in addition to the delay time.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The display determination device <b>27</b> is configured to determine the state of the assistance control, for example, on the basis of the operating area determined by the operating area determination device <b>25</b>, the non-operating area determined by the non-operating area determination device <b>26</b>, the speed of the vehicle <b>1</b> detected by the vehicle detector <b>21</b>, the distance from the vehicle <b>1</b> to the target and the relative speed between the vehicle <b>1</b> and the target, which are detected by the target distance/speed detector <b>22</b>, or the like.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Now, the state of the assistance control according to the first embodiment will be explained. In the first embodiment, the state of the assistance control is referred to as an &#x201c;operating state&#x201d; if the assistance control is performed.
