More specifically, it relates to a method and system for automatically ordering and fulfilling architecture, design and construction physical product and product sample requests.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a process including the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of physical spaces. Building Information Models (BIMs) programs span the whole design concept-to-occupation time-span.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Current BIM software is also used by individuals, businesses and government authorities who plan, design, construct, operate and maintain diverse physical infrastructures, from water, wastewater, electricity, gas, refuse and communication utilities to roads, bridges and ports, from houses, apartments, schools and shops to offices, factories, and prisons, etc.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A BIM model enables users to understand relationships between spaces, building materials, and various systems within a physical structure. BIM software can be used for every step of the process, from planning, to design, to construction. BIM solutions let users sequence the steps and elements of the building process, including the building materials and crews needed to complete the construction.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">When any structure is designed with BIM software, it is created in a virtual environment with virtual components, such as virtual studs, doors, windows, siding, flooring, etc. It many instances, it is difficult to visualize what the actual physical components will look like in the structure with respect to component, style, color, texture, etc.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">During the design phase for any structure it is often desirable to obtain a samples of actual architecture and construction materials used that will be used for the actual physical structure. The actual architecture and construction materials vary in a number of ways and have to be carefully selected. For example, a siding material may be appropriate for a structure in a warm climate, but may not be appropriate for the same structure in a cold climate A color selected for the walls of a room may look good in BIM simulation, but colors of paint that are actually available from paint suppliers may give a totally different look or feel when actually applied to the walls. A first manufacturer of a desired architecture or construction material may produce a high quality product, while another manufacturer may be producing a lower quality product. Architects, interior designers and engineers all benefit from obtaining actual samples of building and construction materials.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, an architect may be designing a residential structure for a client. The residential structure is to include hardwood floors. The hardwood floors are available in many different types of materials (e.g., oak, maple, bamboo, etc.,) many different sizes (e.g., &#xbd;&#x2033; &#x215c;&#x2033;, 9/16&#x2033;, etc.) and many different colors (e.g., natural, mocha, chestnut, gray, etc.). It is desirable for the architect to obtain actual samples of the hardwood flooring materials to allow the architect to evaluate the hardwood flooring samples in the context of the project and for the client to actually make a better informed decision on which hardwood flooring materials they desire.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">When an interior designer creates a pitch board/sample board for a desired project, the pitch board/sample board typically includes actual samples materials include paint chips, fabric swatches and wood and upholstery samples, accessory samples, etc. The samples of materials allow a design to be presented a comprehensible way and allows the client to envision what a space is going to look like at the end of the process.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">When an engineer is designing a new bridge, there are many choices for connecting the support materials on the bridge with bridge components such as beams, girders, decking, etc. The bridge components are available in various dimensions, diameters, finishes and materials. The engineer will often request actual samples of the bridge component from a number of different manufactures before making a final decision on which connection component to select.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">There are a number of problems with obtaining samples of building materials for a desired structure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">One problem is that architects, interior designers, engineers, etc. who a desire a particular type of architecture or construction material sample have to typically visit many web-sites, place a large number of calls to sales representatives for each desire product or make in person visits to multiple different manufacturers and/or suppliers. This takes a considerable amount of time and effort to collect the desired samples. In many instances, the sales representatives do not immediately return phone calls and the calls have to be repeated multiple times.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another problem is that since most projects have very strict time deadlines, collecting such samples requires advance planning and schedule to ensure all desired samples are available and arrive on time for the project. In many instances such planning time constraints severely affects progress on the project.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another problem is that when architects, interior designers, engineers, etc. request architecture and construction material samples, it may arrive late or never arrive at all. Such a situation could cause delays in the project or if the samples are for a project pitch, cause the project to be lost altogether.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another problem is that when architects, interior designers, engineers, etc. request building and construction material samples from multiple sources, they are arrive at different times and in different packages. The same sample provider may also send multiple packages to the same architects, interior designers, engineers, etc. on the same day and on different days. All such samples then have to be collected, organized and put into a sample library for the project.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">There are also a number of problems associated with the manufacturers and suppliers of architecture and construction materials. These manufacturers must supply samples of their building and construction materials whenever they are requested.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Building material samples are used by many different parties in many different ways, including: (1) in sales presentations to builders, contractors, architects and other pro customers; (2) in architects', designers' and engineers' libraries; (3) in architect, designer and engineering client presentations; (4) in big boxes, stores and showrooms; (5) for in-home selling by contractors and dealers; (6) as lead magnets on websites and other media; (7) as part of sales and installation training; and (8) at trade shows.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">For most building materials, not having a sample is not an option for the manufacture or provider. If the manufacture or supplier doesn't&#x2032; have a sample of a building or construction material, the product will not even be considered for a project. Even with the dramatic improvements in technologies like BIM design programs, virtual reality and 3D printing, most products still need an actual physical sample that can be provided directly to a requester.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">One problem is that for the manufacturers and suppliers of the building and construction material samples, providing samples is very expensive. For many companies, their sample program is the largest cost item in their marketing budget.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another problem is that here are additional costs a manufacturer or supplier will spend on samples including: (1) creative costs such as developing the design and copy on a web-site or in print media for the project; (2) production costs such as the cost of the product created as a sample; (3) administrative costs such as the cost to process and record sample requests; (4) picking costs, the costs associated with employees having to manually pick product samples from storage; and (5) mail and packaging costs such as the cost of placing the sample in a shipping package and mailing and/or engaging a package delivery service send out the sample.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another problem is that when samples are sent out by a manufacturer or supplier, no thought is given to the packaging the product samples arrive in. The audience receiving these samples have are creative, visually orientated people. A vast majority of sample deliveries, which are typically fulfilled by warehouse workers, arrive in unmarked brown boxes that do not any indication the requested samples are inside. The samples included in the boxes may be worn, broken or otherwise not visually appealing. This often leads to further delays in the architects, interior designers, engineers receiving the samples from the mail room, or timely opening the boxes that include the samples and the architects, interior designers, engineers being disappointed in the quality of the product samples.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Another problem is that many times the samples sent out do not include product sheets or other required or desirable information about the architecture or construction materials. Such oversights may cause architects, interior designers, engineers to select other architecture or construction materials from other manufactures or suppliers. In addition, such product sheets are expensive to create and reproduce and add an additional cost for the manufacturer or supplier of the product samples.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Another problem is that most samples that are sent out do not include a &#x201c;call to action&#x201d; in the form a coupon, discount percentage, thank you letter or business card. When architects, interior designers, engineers request a product sample, they have initial interest in the product and steps should be taken based on that initial interest to try make actual sales of the product.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Another problem is that before samples are sent out by a manufacturer or supplier a sales representative typically has to evaluate and qualify a requester. Otherwise a requester could order multiple free product samples and use the free product samples to complete a project without purchasing the actual products represented by the product samples.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Another problem is that is it often desirable to purchase actual physical products represented by the product samples. There is no easy way to purchase the actual physical products represented by the product samples.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Another problem is that even when bar codes are included on architecture and construction physical products, there is no easy way to import and record the actual products represented by the product samples from BIM programs and other programs using the bar codes.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Another problem is that when are bar codes are activated on architecture and construction physical products there is no easy way to purchase the actual products represented by the physical products from BIM programs and other programs using the bar codes.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Thus, it is desirable to solve some of the problems associated with providing access to architecture and building material products from BIM programs and other programs and providing fulfillment of such architecture and construction physical products and product samples to requesters.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention, some of the problems associated ordering and fulfilling architecture, design or construction physical product and/or product sample requests.

Such an automatic method prevents any requester from requesting and receiving a large amount of product samples and using the free product samples to complete a desired project without purchasing the actual products represented by the product samples and/or requesting such products just because they are curious and will never use or purchase the actual products, etc. Another aspect of qualifying a requester is determine if the requester is from a large and/or important requester that may purchase a large number of actual products from a manufacturer or product supplier so the requests can receive special attention and/or additional personal follow-up from the manufacturer or product supplier. Such an automatic method also saves time for sales representatives and money for manufacturers and product suppliers as they do not have to spend time to call all requesters of product samples as the requesters' eligibility to receive any requested product samples is automatically determined.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0195">For example, one exemplary AI method examines an e-mail address and/or domain name included in the electronic information collected from a requester.
