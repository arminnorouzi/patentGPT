Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used on another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. Other objects, features, and aspects of the present invention are disclosed in the following detailed description. It is to be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the present discussion is a description of exemplary embodiments only and is not intended as limiting the broader aspects of the present invention, which broader aspects are embodied in the exemplary constructions.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is to be understood that the ranges mentioned herein include all ranges located within the prescribed range. As such, all ranges mentioned herein include all sub-ranges included in the mentioned ranges. For instance, a range from 100-200 also includes ranges from 110-150, 170-190, and 153-162. Further, all limits mentioned herein include all other limits included in the mentioned limits. For instance, a limit of up to 7 also includes a limit of up to 5, up to 3, and up to 4.5.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The term &#x201c;about&#x201d; means the stated value plus or minus 10 percent unless another value range is given.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In describing the various figures herein, the same reference numbers are used throughout to describe the same material, apparatus, or process pathway. To avoid redundancy, detailed descriptions of much of the apparatus once described in relation to a figure is not repeated in the descriptions of subsequent figures, although such apparatus or process is labeled with the same reference numbers.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As best seen in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a wall stud <b>10</b> is provided have a rear wall <b>12</b>, two parallel side walls <b>14</b> and <b>14</b>&#x2032; which project in a forward direction and are connected to the rear wall at about a 90-degree angle. A cavity <b>15</b> is defined between the two side walls and the attached rear wall. The front end of each side wall is connected to a respective front wall member <b>16</b> and <b>16</b>&#x2032;, walls <b>16</b> and <b>16</b>&#x2032; being substantially parallel to rear wall <b>12</b> and which project away from the interior cavity <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Each side wall <b>14</b> and <b>14</b>&#x2032; has a length of about 4 inches. The rear wall <b>12</b> has a length of about 3.63 inches, and each front wall has a length of about 2.07 inches. The flange material is preferably one of galvanized steel and has a thickness of about 0.0713 inches (14 gauge) and a cross sectional area of about 1.09 in<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention provides for a wall stud which is tailored specifically for modular units. The center width and the flange length and respective dimension ratios offer unique advantages. The stud of the present invention has several advantages over conventional C-shaped studs. One advantage is that the present wall stud channel will save on total materials over the C-Channel and is comparable to a HSS tube. The cross section of the wall stud yields a 1.09 in<sup>2 </sup>surface area. A typical 14 ga C-Channel is 0.62 in<sup>2 </sup>and the HSS tube is 1.07 in<sup>2</sup>. These areas (with the indicated stud spacing and a typical 8 ft tall wall) yield a per square foot metal volume described below.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The stud according to the present invention in a typical 8 ft tall wall would be @ 24&#x2033; o.c., 96 in tall=6.54 in<sup>3</sup>/ft<sup>2</sup>. A sample 400S200-68 C-Channel @ 12&#x2033; o.c., 96&#x2033; tall=7.44 in<sup>3</sup>/ft<sup>2 </sup>would utilize 12% more material than the present wall stud. A HSS3&#xd7;2&#xd7;0.125 Tube @24&#x2033; o.c., 96&#x2033; tall=6.42 in<sup>3</sup>/ft<sup>2 </sup>is 2% less than the improved wall stud.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present wall stud, when compared to the HSS tube, has a surface area from the wall stud flange/web which is much wider. The interior of the wall has 3.63&#x2033; of connection surface width contacting the interior sheathing and two 2.07&#x2033; flanges in close proximity for the exterior sheathing. This creates a larger connection area and also allows for a tighter horizontal fastener spacing for high wind applications.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Additionally, the wall stud can provide in-plane shear resistance. C-Channels do not have any &#x201c;shearwall&#x201d; or &#x201c;moment frame&#x201d; capacity integrated into their design. In some cases, the wall stud itself will be able to resist imposed lateral MWFRS or Seismic loads (SDC &#x2018;C&#x2019; or less) without a shearwall sheathing analysis. The sheathing would still be necessary for many reasons, but fastener spacing and the amount of material used may remain unaltered by the shear load.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As seen in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>., the stud <b>10</b> can be used to provide for panels <b>100</b> in which the studs <b>10</b> are attached to an upper horizontal beam <b>20</b> and a lower horizontal beam <b>30</b>. On either side of the panel <b>100</b> is a respective side frame member <b>40</b> and <b>40</b>&#x2032;. Preferable the spacing between adjacent studs is about 24 inches. As is known in the art, front and rear facing materials of gypsum with an outer layer of galvanized steel sheathing may be used. Additionally, the cavity <b>15</b> may have a layer of mineral wool placed therein.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Although preferred embodiments of the invention have been described using specific terms, devices, and methods, such description is for illustrative purposes only. The words used are words of description rather than of limitation. It is to be understood that changes and variations may be made by those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit or the scope of the present invention. In addition, it should be understood that aspects of the various embodiments may be interchanged, both in whole, or in part. Therefore, the spirit and scope of the invention should not be limited to the description of the preferred versions contained therein.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
