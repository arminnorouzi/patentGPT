A great part of the pet chew products on the market are traditional &#x201c;dehydrated pizzle&#x201d; product such as dried bully pizzle, pig pizzle. Among them, bully sticks are especially welcome by dogs and consumers, which are made of natural bovine penis. Generally, foreskin of bovine penis is removed, cleaned and then dehydrated by for example heating or freeze-drying. Some other pet chews in the art are developed utilizing a natural part or a natural organ of a slaughtered animal to accommodate the chewing needs from pets. These chew toys may have a high price per gram, raw material scarcity, strong unpleasant stink or too great rigidity quality presenting jeopardy to puppies or old dogs.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the market, there are other popular products in a three-dimensional form processed by injection-moulding, cast moulding or compression moulding (especially by injection molding), appearing in various appealing shapes such as toothbrush, hedgehog, tortoise, crocodile. Also, on the market, there is another kind of popular products in a form of injection-molded or extruded stick. These kinds of products may be commercialized by many distributors or retailers under great competitions, where the competition is a homogeneous one, resulting in the products being hard to be well distinguished from another. It is not easy for a homogeneity product to attract consumers to buy.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Attention is directed to U.S. application Ser. No. 13/858,592 by Shrestha, filed on Apr. 8, 2013, discloses a pet chew including a hardened cheese and a dry animal tissue such as bully sticks attached to the cheese piece. And it also discloses a kind of animal tissue puff such as bully stick puff. U.S. Pat. No. 8,479,687 by Anderson, filed on Feb. 14, 2007, discloses a pet chew with rawhide and traditional bully stick (or steer penis) woven together. U.S. Pat. No. 8,074,609 by Grant Adkins, filed on Mar. 25, 2010, discloses a rawhide pet chew with a traditional bully stick wrapped in. U.S. Pat. No. 7,677,203 by Stern, filed on Nov. 21, 2006, discloses a pet chew with a plant based outer casing and a chewy edible material positioned within the casing. U.S. application Ser.

are provided in the following description only as examples. The general principles defined in the following description would be applied to other embodiments, alternatives, modifications, equivalents, and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The term of &#x201c;pizzle&#x201d; in the present disclosure refers to the penis of an animal (especially a bull), which may be one of, but not limited to, beef pizzle, bovine pizzle, bully pizzle, cattle pizzle, swine pizzle, horse pizzle, donkey pizzle, deer pizzle, ovine pizzle, caprine pizzle, sheep pizzle and goat pizzle. Bovine (especially bull) penis is known in pet chew trade as a kind of pizzle, which may be usually called beef pizzle or bully pizzle in the trade. The term of &#x201c;dehydrated pizzle&#x201d; refers to a pet chew product made of animal pizzle which is processed by a dehydration process (for example, it is dehydrated to arrive at a final product moisture level of 8%-18% which provides shelf-stable quality for the final product) before being formed to a final product, where the dehydration process may be solar drying, heating or freeze drying. The term of &#x201c;bully stick&#x201d; refers to a pet chew product of dehydrated animal (especially but not limited to bovine animal, bovine especially referring to bull or steer) pizzle/penis, or segment thereof, for dogs to chew on, where the pizzle is derived from a natural animal penis cut from slaughtered animals (especially bovine), typically with foreskin being removed. The bully stick is one of the aforementioned dehydrated pizzle chew. The bully stick is so called traditional bully stick substantially made of a dehydrated natural part (or natural organ) of an animal (especially bovine).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Stick-shaped pet chew of the present disclosure is intended to work as an alternative to traditional (genuine) dehydrated pizzle (or bully sticks) aforementioned.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The term of &#x201c;Artificial dehydrated-pizzle&#x201d; pet chew in the present disclosure refers to a pet chew or a pet chew member/component in a shape of a dehydrated pizzle (typically in a shape of a stick, or in a novel shape such as ring, twist, spiral, etc.), being formed from a composite/composition material and imitating or approximating some features of a dehydrated pizzle (or a bully stick product) including the shape, and/or structure, and/or appearance, and/or size, and/or color, and/or texture, and/or flavor, and/or durability, and/or palatability features, and it is not a traditional (genuine) dehydrated pizzle product or a bully stick product. Artificial Dehydrated-Pizzle may also be called man-made dehydrated-pizzle, synthetic dehydrated-pizzle, fake dehydrated-pizzle or dehydrated-pizzle substitute. The term of &#x201c;Man-made bully stick&#x201d; pet chew (or say bully-stick-like pet chew, or artificial bully stick pet chew) in the present disclosure refers to a pet chew or a pet chew member/component in a shape of stick, being formed from a composite/composition material and imitating or approximating some features of a traditional (genuine) bully stick product including the shape, and/or structure, and/or appearance, and/or size, and/or color, and/or texture, and/or flavor, and/or durability, and/or palatability features, and it is not a traditional (genuine) bully stick product. The term of &#x201c;stick&#x201d; generally refers to a long thin piece object. The term of &#x201c;composite&#x201d; generally refers to something that is formed from different materials or ingredients. For examples, a composite is formed from a formula including a plant ingredient, an animal ingredient and a chemical.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The term of &#x201c;longitudinal&#x201d; or &#x201c;longitudinally&#x201d; generally means &#x201c;in a direction or position along the length of something&#x201d;. In contrast, &#x201c;latitudinal&#x201d; or &#x201c;latitudinally&#x201d; in the present disclosure generally means &#x201c;in a direction widthwise, or horizontally, or substantially perpendicular to the centerline of an object on the surface&#x201d;. For example, when something extends &#x201c;latitudinally&#x201d; on/in the surface of a cylindrical object, it runs along a circumferential of the cylindrical object in a direction substantially perpendicular to the centerline of the cylindrical object.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">It is known that a market-popular pet chew product should include two major factors, i.e. property of &#x201c;strong durability&#x201d; and property of &#x201c;inherently good palatability&#x201d;. &#x201c;Strong durability&#x201d; means a material that can endure a dog's chewing for a fairly long time before being ingested. &#x201c;Good palatability&#x201d; means a material with inherent attractant to dogs without adding additional artificial flavorings. A market-successful pet chew product may be required to have both properties. The artificial dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) pet chew disclosed by the present disclosure may be a product with both &#x201c;inherently good palatability&#x201d; and &#x201c;strong durability&#x201d;. The term of &#x201c;Single piece&#x201d; or &#x201c;one-piece&#x201d; refers to a material consisting of or made in a single undivided piece that may not have divided or separate segments therein. The &#x201c;single piece of material&#x201d; is not the one that is formed from plural pieces that have been joined or welded together. For example, the pet chews as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> include artificial dehydrated-pizzle components formed from a single piece of material. The artificial bully stick chew stick components from the pet chews as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> may be in a configuration with outer layer and inner member, which are not considered as being formed from a &#x201c;single piece of material&#x201d;, or may be alternatively formed from a single piece of material according to desire.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Before disclosing embodiments of the present disclosure, let's address the typical specification/structure/configuration characteristics and manufacturing process that these traditional (genuine) dehydrated pizzle (or bully sticks) products, may present as follows (from points 1 to 6):</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">1. Prepare a piece of fresh pizzle. Now refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> (Prior Art), fresh pizzle <b>1000</b> gets ready which is cut from a slaughtered animal (esp. bovine). <b>1000</b> refers to a kind of full length pizzle including both shaft part (body part) <b>1001</b> and glans penis part <b>1002</b>. Body part <b>1001</b> refers to the body part of the bovine penis. The body part <b>1001</b> is a typical material of a pizzle that is universally applied to make Bully Sticks. Glans penis part <b>1002</b> refers to glans of the pizzle with head <b>1003</b>, which also can be included in finished products in some specific products (these specific products may be called full length bully sticks).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">2. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> (Prior Art) is a segment of a fresh pizzle. Groove <b>1103</b> refers to a groove longitudinally along the whole pizzle. Outer layer <b>1101</b> is muscle of the pizzle, serving as an outer layer for the whole pizzle piece distinguished from the inner member <b>1102</b>. Surface <b>1104</b> is the surface of the pizzle. Inner member <b>1102</b> includes tissues of corpus cavernosum, spongiosum, urethra, etc.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">3. Have the pizzle dehydrated by means such as solar drying, heating or freeze drying. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> (Prior Art) is a cross section figure for a final bully stick product after dehydrating process. This cross section is in a typical outline shape similar to capital letter &#x201c;B&#x201d;. <b>1201</b> is dehydrated muscle in hard quality. <b>1202</b> is dehydrated corpus cavernosum. <b>1203</b> refers to a notch/groove (u-shaped notch) longitudinally along the pizzle. <b>1204</b> is dehydrated spongiosum. The term of &#x201c;notch&#x201d; in this disclosure generally refers to a small cut (typically u-shaped, v-shaped or circular cut) on the surface or edge of something.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">4. As a typical final product, a dehydrated bully stick may have a tapered head part and a body part. It may also include a latitudinal ridge part, but in some bully stick products, this ridge part does not exist or is hardly noticeable. The groove extends longitudinally along a part of the bully sticks' body part on its surface. The tapered head may be taped to a rounded tip or a pointed tip alternatively at one end of it. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> (Prior Art) is another final product, a dehydrated bully stick with a typical cross section outline shape similar to capital letter &#x201c;B&#x201d;. <b>0901</b> and <b>0904</b> is a hard outer layer of the bully stick made of dehydrated muscle. <b>0902</b> is an inner member including tissues of corpus cavernosum, spongiosum, urethra, etc. <b>0903</b> refers to a groove longitudinally along the whole bully sticks body on its surface.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">5. Cross-section of a body part of a dehydrated pizzle (bully sticks) may have a variety of shapes. Some typical cross-section shapes may resemble a letter &#x201c;B&#x201d;, an Arabic &#x201c;8&#x201d; shape, a heart shape, a peanut shape or a cashew nut shape similar to those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">6. The typical outstanding features (such as structure features) of a natural dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) product may be derived from and determined by the aforementioned natural features of a natural animal (bovine) penis. A typical traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) product may have some typical features as follows (from A to K):</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">A. It is inherently a stick-shaped product. And in some other bully stick products, it is initially in a stick-shape material and is finally manipulated to a desired shape such as Knot, Spiral, Twist, Ring and Braid different from the initial stick shape.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">B. The stick-shaped dehydrated pizzle may have a stick-shaped body part and a tapered head part at an end. The tapered head part may have a rounded or pointed tip at one end of it and at the other end of it, it joins or meets the stick-shaped body part. The tapered head part originates from the glans part of a fresh pizzle, and the body part of the dehydrated pizzle does from a body part of a fresh pizzle.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">C. At least one inherent groove part may appear longitudinally along the Bully Sticks body part on the surface. The products as prior arts in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> (Prior Art) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> (Prior Art) reflect this feature. This structural feature (groove) is a common one to most typical bully sticks products. It should be noted that arriving at identifying this common feature requires careful observations. There are various shapes/structures/appearance that bull stick products possess, which makes it hard to identify a common structural feature. The present applicant arrives at that, &#x201c;groove&#x201d; is a key feature that most typical bully sticks products possess although they have various shapes/structures and various cross section shapes. This disclosure discloses an imitation method to imitate or approximate traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) appearance.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">D. Cross section of traditional bully stick (or dehydrated pizzle) may present characteristic outline shapes. A typical outline may be in a shape similar to capital letter &#x201c;B&#x201d;, peanut (peanut icon), cashew nut (cashew nut icon), Arabic numeral &#x201c;8&#x201d;, or heart icon. These typical outline shapes may have a common feature that they have a &#x201c;notch&#x201d; area whose bottom is significantly lower than the outline's overall edge. The &#x201c;notches&#x201d; appearing on the outline shapes are created by aforementioned &#x201c;groove&#x201d; that runs longitudinally along the bully stick body part. The items illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> (Prior Art) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> (Prior Art) reflect this feature. These outline shapes are created by an inherent feature of natural pizzle.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">E. Bully stick may have an animal pizzle as its single ingredient, which is a very strong flavor one enjoying irresistible attraction to dogs. Animal pizzle ingredient offers &#x201c;inherently good palatability&#x201d; for the pet chew.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">F. Pizzle flavor. Traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) has an inherent characteristic pizzle flavor, which greatly attracts dogs to chew on. As a sort of meat-by-products material, pizzle has a naturally strong flavor as other meat-by-products do, attractant to dogs.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">G. Bully stick may include an outer layer and an inner member/component, where the former holds the latter by surrounding it. This structure is derived from pizzle inherent structure. The outer layer is formed by muscle and inner member/component formed by tissues of corpus cavernosum, spongiosum, urethra, etc. Products in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> (Prior Art) and <b>9</b> (Prior Art) reflect this pet chew structure.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">H. After being dehydrated, inherently, the outer layer of Bully Stick formed by muscle enjoys a property of getting hard. The hardness ideally accommodates dog's chewing desire, making it an ideal pet chew product. Traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) makes itself outstanding with extraordinary durability or hardness.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">I. Typical range of thickness of the outer layer is 0.3 mm-5 mm.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">J. Typical properties of the inner member/portion include: spongy, comparatively more unconsolidated or looser in texture than the muscle outer layer/portion. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> (Prior Art), product <b>0900</b> has an inner member <b>0902</b> which includes tissues of corpus cavernosum, spongiosum and urethra, which is unconsolidated.

Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> (Prior Art), <b>1202</b> from bully stick has a plurality of tiny bubbles. These properties of inner member are created by the nature of corpus cavernosum and/or spongiosum tissues that exist in a pizzle.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">K. Inner member/portion and outer layer/portion have different appearance in color and/or texture. Inner member/portion color is comparatively lighter than outer layer/portion color. Inner member/portion color is typically white or yellowing white. Outer layer/portion color is typically light brown, brown, dark brown, red brown or muscle color. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> (Prior Art) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> (Prior Art), product <b>1200</b>/<b>0900</b> has an inner member <b>1202</b>/<b>0902</b> which includes tissues of corpus cavernosum, spongiosum and urethra, which is unconsolidated.

The artificial dehydrated-pizzle pet chew may provide significantly lower product cost and imitation to some necessary properties or features (at least including shape or appearance features) of a traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick). An artificial dehydrated-pizzle (or artificial bully stick, or man-made bully stick) pet chew as provided herein is well distinguished from traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick), which is typically an injection-moulding (cast moulding or compression moulding, or extruded) stick-shaped product formed from a composite material with plant ingredient. As a contrast, traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) is substantially a single ingredient product primarily without being processed other than a dehydrating process.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">One advantage of the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (or artificial bully stick, or man-made bully stick) pet chew may be its hugely cheaper material cost than traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick). The artificial dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) pet chew may be significantly cheaper than traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) made of substantially 100% animal (bovine) pizzle. The latter could be 4 times of the price of the former. Due to the natural scarcity property with the source of natural animal (bovine) pizzle, raw materials (animal pizzle) for producing traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) are sold at a very high price, which results in the final products, traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick), being sold to consumers at an extraordinarily high price. Another advantage is the easier acquisition of raw material versus traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) products. Producing traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) products requires huge volume of natural animal pizzle. In one embodiment, the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (or artificial bully stick, or man-made bully stick) pet chew of the present disclosure is formed from a composite/composition with meat-by-product ingredient (such as pizzle). For example, the composite/composition has 10% pizzle in formula (90% is non-pizzle ingredient which is extremely acquisition-easier material than pizzle), in which producing this product just requires about one tenth of pizzle material to manufacture the same quantity of finished products versus traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) products. Preparing the composite/composition materials for production of artificial dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) pet chew is much easier than that for production of traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick).</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments, an artificial dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) component of a pet chew product of the present disclosure has at least two parts, a tapered head part at an end and a body part (typically a stick-shaped body part). The tapered head part is in a shape imitating a similar part of a real (genuine) dehydrated pizzle (real bully stick) product. In at least one embodiment, the tapered head part of the artificial dehydrated-pizzle component is tapered to a rounded tip or a pointed tip at one end. In some embodiments, the tapered head part has an additional rounded tip or pointed tip at one end of the part. The term of &#x201c;tapered&#x201d; generally refers to &#x201c;becoming narrower towards one end&#x201d; or &#x201c;becoming gradually narrower towards one end&#x201d;. When an object is &#x201c;tapered&#x201d; in the present disclosure, it may be that one end of the object is becoming narrower or gradually narrower toward the tip but the other end may not. When an object is &#x201c;tapered&#x201d; in the present disclosure, it may be either substantially straight or not. For example, it may be alternatively bent, curved or crooked. The term of &#x201c;tapered head part&#x201d; (or &#x201c;tapered head portion&#x201d;) in the present disclosure generally refers to one part of an artificial dehydrated-pizzle, where one end of that part is becoming narrower or becoming gradually narrower and the other end of that part joints or meets other part(s) of the artificial dehydrated-pizzle. The benefits of having a tapered head part at an end of an injection-molding-processed artificial dehydrated-pizzle may include at least one of the follows. A, it provides an improved imitation against natural bully sticks than extruded artificial bully sticks without a tapered head; B, it can much easier channel a consumer to associate the artificial dehydrated-pizzle product with natural bully stick than the ones without tapered head part; C, it provides more natural raw shape than the ones without tapered head part; D, it provides more varieties in shapes or appearance than the ones without tapered head part. In some embodiments, there is an additional latitudinal ridge part between the head and body parts of the artificial dehydrated-pizzle component, similar to a natural dehydrated pizzle (or real bully stick) product. In some embodiments, between the aforementioned tapered head part and body part, there is an additional latitudinal ridge part that may protrude from around the body. In some embodiments, between the aforementioned tapered head part and body part, there is an additional raised part or raised area that may protrude from around the body (refer to raised part <b>0508</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). In some embodiments, it is positioned on the artificial dehydrated-pizzle component between the two ends of it. The raised area may be in a shape looking like a tube extending on the surface of the body part of the artificial dehydrated-pizzle but it is not a separate material from the body. The length of the raised part (raised area) is about 1 cm to 5 cm. The aforementioned ridge part, raised part and raised area may be called &#x201c;neck part&#x201d; of the artificial dehydrated-pizzle component, in addition to the body part and tapered head part. In some embodiments, there is an additional substantially round (roundish), substantially oval, substantially heart-shaped or substantially water-drop-shaped part (typically the part has a wrinkled surface, refer to wrinkle <b>0511</b> and wrinkle <b>0512</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) positioned at the (especially stick-shaped) body part of the artificial dehydrated-pizzle, in which the substantially round (roundish), oval or water-drop-shaped part is typically flat in shape, being intended to imitate a natural scrotum part (in a dehydrated status) of an animal (especially a bovine animal). In some embodiments, it looks like that the stick-shaped body part extends on the substantially round (roundish), substantially oval, substantially heart-shaped or substantially water-drop-shaped part in the middle. Part <b>0510</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> refers to a kind of substantially round (roundish), substantially oval, substantially heart-shaped or substantially water-drop-shaped part. <b>0515</b> refers to the profile of part <b>0510</b>. The aforementioned word of &#x201c;flat&#x201d; refers to an object that is not very tall or deep in relation to its length and width, where it does not have to be smooth or uneven on surface. The substantially oval, substantially round, substantially heart-shaped or substantially water-drop-shaped flat portion/part typically is positioned relatively farther away from the end with the tapered head part and nearer/closer to the other end of the chew. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the artificial dehydrated-pizzle pet chew <b>0100</b>A has a body part <b>0106</b> and a tapered head part <b>0105</b> tapering to a rounded tip <b>0107</b> at the end.

The single piece of material (or one-piece material) is composed of a single undivided piece that may not have divided segments in it. For example, it does not have outer layer member or inner member that is formed from two separate materials. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, pet chew product <b>0600</b> in stick configuration refers to an embodiment of the present disclosure. <b>0600</b> is formed from a single piece of material. <b>0600</b> may be formed by injection molding, cast molding, compression molding or extrusion process.

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, pet chew product <b>1400</b> in stick configuration refers to an embodiment of the present disclosure, with one end thicker and the other thinner. <b>1400</b> is formed from a single piece of material. Alternatively, the artificial bully stick member of the pet chew products of the present disclosure in a form of a &#x201c;single piece&#x201d; of material has a hole (hollow space in it) extending inside the body part of the Artificial Bully Stick component. This hole configuration appearing herein may provide some additional benefits such as: A, offering biting elasticity to the whole material; B, providing a space inside the chew to fill additional edible material in which may be attractant materials or flavoring enhancer materials or to fill additional edible material working as an inner portion of the artificial dehydrated-pizzle.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In comparison to other different materials to form a pet chew of the present disclosure, single piece of material may provide some benefits as following. A), Single piece of material may be easier to produce as it only requires one single material for production and potentially one single set of extrusion or injection molding machine system. B), Thanks to the continuity of the material of the pet chew member/component made of a single piece of material, a greater structural strength of the material may be obtained. C), It may better accommodate injection molding processing capability.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Alternatively, the single piece of material forming the pet chew products of the present disclosure has numerous (a plurality of) bubbles, blisters, or air-filled cavities spread into the interior of the material. The benefits of the air bubbles existing herein may include: increasing contract area with dog teeth which penetrate the exterior of the single piece of material, which provides improved tartar and dental plaque control actions; enhancing the imitation action by imitating the interior configurations or texture of a Genuine Bully Stick whose inside part is porous that is formed by tissues of corpus cavernosum and/or spongiosum; being more friendly to puppies or old dogs who have weak teeth while being gnawed. For examples, the artificial dehydrated-pizzle pet chew <b>0100</b>A as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> formed from a single piece of material may include numerous bubbles spread into the interior of the material.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Yet in some other embodiments, the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (or artificial bully stick, or bully-stick-like) pet chew (or pet chew member/component) of the present disclosure includes an outer layer member/portion and an inner member/portion, where the former holds the latter by surrounding it, in a purpose to imitate a typical feature of traditional bully stick (or dehydrated pizzle). In one embodiment, the thickness of the outer layer is substantially homogenous along the whole stick body, as traditional bully stick (or dehydrated pizzle) does. Typical thickness of the outer layer is 0.3 mm-5 mm.

It should be noted that, there are various shapes/structures/appearance that genuine bull stick products may possess, which makes it hard to identify a common structural feature of them. The present disclosure arrives at that, &#x201c;groove&#x201d; may be a key feature that the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (or artificial bully stick, or man-made bully stick) products should possess in a purpose to imitate/approximate genuine dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) appearance although genuine dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) has various shapes/structures and various cross section shapes. This disclosure discloses a viable imitation method to imitate traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) appearance. Additionally, the form of &#x201c;groove&#x201d; appearing on the pet chew may provide extra benefits of tooth cleaning action, where the groove form may accommodate dog tooth configurations and have it slide along the two walls of the groove while being gnawed by a dog, and thus tartar or dental plaque may be mechanically removed hereby. In some embodiments, the length of a groove that extends on the body part of the artificial dehydrated-pizzle accounts for at least &#xbc; (more typically at least &#x2153;) of the length of the full body part, in which the groove may be a noticeable one on the surface. A typical groove depth of the artificial bully stick is at least 1 mm as that of a genuine dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) does. Typically, the depth of a groove of the artificial bully stick accounts for at least 5% (more typically at least 10%) of the thickness of the artificial bully stick. A depth accounting for &#x201c;5% of the thickness&#x201d; may be the least one that makes a groove noticeable to consumers when it appears on the surface of an Artificial Bully Stick component.

Alternatively, the aforementioned final product shapes such as stick shape, twisted stick shape, spiral shape, pretzel knot shape, knotted bone shape, ring shape and woven braid shape may be obtained by manipulating (such as twisting and knotting by hand) an initially-stick-shaped artificial dehydrated-pizzle (initial stick shape formed by injection mold) into a product shape before being hardened to a final product.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">Here go the formulas that may alternatively form the man-made dehydrated-pizzle (or artificial bully stick, or bully-stick-like) pet chew (or pet chew member/component) in some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Firstly the phrase of &#x201c;on an as formulated basis&#x201d; in the present disclosure that may be used in following paragraphs is defined here. It is about a means to determine weight percentages of an ingredient in a product. &#x201c;On an as formulated basis&#x201d; is also a method that currently FDA (or AAFCO) organizations of USA usually utilize to determine weight percentage for an ingredient in a product. By the means of &#x201c;on an as formulated basis&#x201d;, the weight percentage of an ingredient in a food is determined as it is added in the formulation of the food, including its inherent water content, not counting the water added for processing. All weight percentage values of ingredients appearing in the present disclosure apply this &#x201c;on an as formulated basis&#x201d; rule.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In one embodiment, the formula of the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (or artificial bully stick, or man-made bully stick) pet chew (or pet chew member/component) of the present disclosure includes a specific meat by-products, pizzle (or animal penis) ingredient. The term of &#x201c;pizzle ingredient&#x201d; or &#x201c;pizzle material&#x201d; that works as an ingredient to form a composite material forming the man-made dehydrated-pizzle refers to a material derived from animal pizzle, which may be in a form of fresh pizzle, dehydrated pizzle, dried pizzle, ground pizzle, ground dehydrated pizzle, enzymatic pizzle or hydrolyzed pizzle. The advantages of including this specific meat by-products, pizzle ingredient, in the formula may include at least one of the follows (from point 1 to 4):</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">1. This product is an injection molding (or molded, or extruded) man-made dehydrated-pizzle&#x2014;(artificial bully stick) pet chew formed from a composite material intended to imitate the properties of traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) products. A formula with pizzle will make the pet chew not only with a traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) appearance, but also with real pizzle (bully stick) ingredients, where the product formula feature is in conformity with product appearance. The selling points of finished products are thus enhanced by the conformity.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">2. Another advantage of applying pizzle ingredient to the man-made dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) pet chew formula is that, it provides a good means to make full use of pizzle leftovers created from genuine dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) manufacturing industry. A marketable genuine dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick) need be fairly long, for example at least longer than 4&#x2033;. A bully stick product less than for example 4&#x2033; has a jeopardy of dog choking. Most popular bully stick length welcome by consumers is 6&#x2033; and 12&#x2033;. Producing 6&#x2033;/12&#x2033; bully sticks by cutting a pizzle with initial length to desired length certainly generate a lot of small sized pizzle segments. These segments were purchased with a full price but manufacturers did not come up with a method to make good use of them. The man-made dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) pet chew of the present disclosure can well make use of the pizzle segments by for example grinding them to small pieces and having them added to its composite formula.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">3. Yet another advantage of applying pizzle ingredient to the man-made dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) pet chew formula is that, the pizzle ingredient can provide natural pizzle flavor to the pet chew without adding artificial flavors. Natural pizzle flavor is thought to be a healthier element than artificial pizzle flavors.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">4. Pizzle ingredient is a natural premium protein source for a pet chew product.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In one embodiment, the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (or artificial bully stick, or man-made bully stick) pet chew (or pet chew member/component) of the present disclosure includes at least 3% pizzle (or animal penis) ingredient in formula. The reason why the proportion of pizzle ingredient in the formula need follow the specific &#x201c;at least 3% pizzle ingredients&#x201d; may go as follows (point 1 and 2):</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">1. &#x201c;At least 3% pizzle&#x201d; provides basic inherent attractant attracting dogs to chew on. Per palatability tests conducted by present inventor, this man-made dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) pet chew with less than 3% cannot provide basic inherent attraction to dogs without aid of another attractant ingredient. &#x201c;At least 3% pizzle&#x201d; offering &#x201c;start point&#x201d; palatability. The inventor conducted palatability contrast tests to determine the smallest percentage of pizzle ingredient to put into the man-made dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) pet chew. The test interprets that when the pizzle percentage goes up to 3% or larger than 3%, a jump of number of preferences appears versus plain injection molding (or molded, or extruded) stick chews w/o pizzle ingredient. And the preference is consistent when the pizzle percentage stays at 3% to 10%. Therefore 3% is determined to be the minimum pizzle percentage in the man-made dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) pet chew.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">2. At least 3% pizzle in formula enables product labeling to claim &#x201c;with pizzle&#x201d;, or &#x201c;with real pizzle&#x201d;, or &#x201c;with bully stick ingredient&#x201d; or &#x201c;with real bully stick&#x201d; on consumer packages, enhancing product selling points to consumers. A product with less than 3% pizzle cannot indicate &#x201c;with pizzle&#x201d; on package labels legally. This is a favorable advantage for the man-made dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) pet chew product to indicate &#x201c;with pizzle&#x201d; as a part of product name which makes the product attractive to consumers (remarks: if the ingredient goes to at least 25%, it will be applied to &#x201c;dinner&#x201d; rule in labeling). According to labeling model regulations by AAFCO (the Association of American Feed Control Officials), an ingredient cannot appear as a part of product name or be highlighted on the principal display panel if the ingredient accounts for less than 3% in product formula on an as formulated basis.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some embodiments, the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (or artificial bully stick, or man-made bully stick) pet chew (or pet chew member/component) includes 3%-50% pizzle ingredient.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In some embodiments, the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (or artificial bully stick, or man-made bully stick) pet chew (or pet chew member/component) includes 5%-65% (more typically 10%-25%) pizzle ingredient on an as formula basis in its formula. The bully-stick-like pet chew (or pet chew member/component) with over 50% (especially over 65%) pizzle ingredient is considered too expensive, which could violate the initial intention of introducing this product. Also, the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) pet chew (or pet chew member/component) with over 50% (especially over 65%) pizzle ingredient is considered to be able to ruin the &#x201c;durability&#x201d; of the pet chew. The reason is, the more an injection molding (or molded, or extruded) pet chew contains meat (meat by-product), the less durability the injection molding (or molded, or extruded) pet chew will be with. Pizzle is an animal source meat-by-product-ingredient. According to R&#x26;D findings by the inventor, 10%-25% pizzle ingredient in the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) pet chew (or pet chew member/component) is an optimized one, which provides a balance between durability, material cost, sufficient inherent natural pizzle flavor and natural protein source.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The inventor conducted palatability contrast tests to determine the starting percentage of pizzle ingredient to put into the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) pet chew (or pet chew member/component) that can secure an absolute preference for dogs for the pet chew. The test interprets that when the pizzle percentage goes up to 10% or larger than 10%, an absolute preference appears versus plain injection molding (or molded, or extruded) stick chews w/o pizzle ingredient. On the other hand, the more pizzle in a pet chew, the more expensive the pet chew will be. 10%-25% is one pizzle percentage range in the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) pet chew that can provide a balance between &#x201c;palatability&#x201d; and cost.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">In one embodiment, the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick, or bully-stick-like) pet chew (or pet chew member/component) of the present disclosure includes a plant ingredient in the formula. This artificial dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) pet chew product is an injection-molding (or extruded, or cast molding, or compression molding) product. Plant ingredient is an often-used material for injection-molding (or extruded, or cast molding, or compression molding) products, which may have advantages of the follows (point 1, 2, 3 and 4):</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">1. Significantly lower cost than animal ingredients.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">2. Provides vegetable nutrition offering a nutrition balance and a healthy diet.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">3. Facilitates to make the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) pet chew with ideal durability/hardness which enables it to imitate this essential property of traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick). Plants especially plant starch is a good material for injection molding (or molded, or extruded) products which can facilitate the achievement of ideal durability/hardness especially in an extruding (or injection molding) process. A theory explains how it works: When the starch part of plant material is cooked or heated at a particular temperature in extruder or injection molding machine (the temperature is generally &#x3e;40&#xb0; C. and what the particular temperature depends on the nature of various types of the starch), heat causes the crystalline regions of the starch to become diffuse, so that the chains begin to separate into an amorphous form. The intermolecular bonds of starch molecules begin to break down. Starch dissolves in water to a sort of paste status. Thus, gelatinization occurs in the starch which offers the durability/hardness property for the pet chew.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">4. Can materially imitate a desirable &#x201c;translucent&#x201d; appearance of the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) which may be a property of traditional (genuine) dehydrated pizzle (or bully sticks).</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">A typical material working as a plant ingredient is plant starch, such as (but not limited to) corn starch, sweet potato, sweet potato starch, tapioca starch and potato starch.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">In one embodiment, the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) component of the present disclosure includes at least 20% (for example 20%-90% plant, more typically 20%-50%) plant ingredient by weight on an as formulated basis.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">It should be noted that the &#x201c;plant&#x201d; ingredient in the present disclosure refers to all edible plant materials and edible-plant-derived materials, such as (but not limited to) vegetables, fruit, edible-plant-derived materials, vegetable-derived materials, fruit-derived materials, plant protein, vegetable protein, plant starch, vegetable starch, grains, cereals, corn, gluten-free edible plant and gluten-free vegetables. Gluten-free plant and gluten-free vegetables may be applied as &#x201c;plant ingredient&#x201d; since gluten materials are considered by experts in this industry as the ones that could potentially make dogs allergic. Examples of gluten-free plant material are tapioca, soybean, sweet potato, potato and carrot.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The reasons why it is optimal to be larger than 20% (specifically) plant ingredient in the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) component go as follows: 1. According to our research tests, 20% plant ingredient appearing in the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) formula is the least one that can successfully facilitate recipe to make the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick) product with ideal durability/hardness which enables it to imitate this essential property of traditional dehydrated pizzle (or bully stick). 2. Recipe with less than 20% plant ingredient fails to do that way with unsatisfactory durability product.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">In one embodiment, the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick, or bully-stick-like) stick-shaped pet chew is typically in length of about 6&#x2033; or 12&#x2033;, which is considered as most popular stick length welcome by consumers. Diameter of the stick-shaped chew could be 1 cm to 5 cm.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In one embodiment, the artificial dehydrated-pizzle (artificial bully stick, or bully-stick-like) pet chew member/component includes an animal ingredient (such as meat and meat by-products) ingredient in the formula.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">It should be noted that the &#x201c;meat&#x201d; ingredient in the present disclosure is defined as the material selected from (but not limited to) the group consisting of: animal flesh, animal muscle, poultry meat, chicken, chicken breast, duck, goose, turkey, venison, porcine meat, pork, bovine meat, beef, mutton, lamb, goat meat, fish, meat meal, chicken meal, fish meal, hydrolyzed meat protein, hydrolyzed animal material, hydrolyzed animal protein, meat derived ingredient and poultry derived ingredient.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">It should also be noted that the &#x201c;meat by-product&#x201d; ingredient in the present disclosure is defined as the material typically selected from (but not limited to) the group consisting of: animal pizzle, porcine meat by-product, poultry by-product, bovine meat by-product, animal viscera, animal stomach, animal tongue, animal kidney, animal blood, animal bone, partially defatted low temperature fatty tissue, animal intestines, animal spleen, animal liver, animal lung, animal heart, animal pizzle, meat by-product meal, poultry by-product meal, hydrolyzed meat-by-products protein, hydrolyzed meat-by-products material, meat by-product derived ingredient, poultry by-product derived ingredient, animal fat and animal oil. It should be noted that the &#x201c;meat by-product&#x201d; in the present disclosure does not include animal hide/skin material and collagen material with the reasons of: A, both animal hide/skin material and collagen do not have attractive flavor urging dogs to chew. B, manufacture of animal hide and collagen is relatively unregulated industry. It may create pollution to environment. H2O2 and NaOH chemicals that are used for rawhide manufacture and heavy metals may remain in finished products which harm dogs' health.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Animal ingredient (such as Meat and Meat By-products) is an often-used material for injection-moulding (or extruded, or cast moulding, or compression moulding) products with advantages of the follows (point 1 and 2). &#x201c;Animal ingredient&#x201d; is defined as edible materials derived from slaughtered animals. It includes (but not limited to) meat, meat by-products. It does not include hair, horns, teeth and hoofs.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">1. Inherent good palatability.
