Shisha devices may include one outlet, or more than one outlet so that the device may be used by more than one consumer at a time. Use of shisha devices is considered by some to be a leisure activity and a social experience.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically, traditional shishas are used in combination with a substrate, sometimes referred to in the art as hookah tobacco, tobacco molasses, or simply as molasses. Traditional shisha substrates are relatively high in sugar (in some cases, up to &#x2dc;50% vs. the &#x2dc;20% typically found in conventional tobacco substrates, such as in combustible cigarettes). The tobacco used in shisha devices may be mixed with other ingredients to, for example, increase the volume of the vapor and smoke produced, to alter flavor, or both.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditional shisha devices employ charcoal, such as charcoal pellets to heat and sometimes combust the tobacco substrate to generate an aerosol for inhalation by a user. Using charcoal to heat the tobacco may cause full or partial combustion of the tobacco or other ingredients. Additionally, charcoal may generate harmful or potentially harmful products, such as carbon monoxide, which may mix with the shisha vapor and pass through the water basin to the outlet.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One way to reduce the production of carbon monoxide and combustion by-products is to employ e-liquids rather than tobacco. Shisha devices that employ e-liquids eliminate combustion by-products but deprive shisha consumers of the traditional tobacco-based experience.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other shisha devices have been proposed that employ electric heaters to heat, but not combust, tobacco. Such electrically heated heat-not-burn shisha devices heat the tobacco substrate to a temperature sufficient to produce an aerosol from the substrate without combusting the substrate, and therefore reduce or eliminate by-products associated with combustion of tobacco.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Shisha devices may employ a cartridge for housing an aerosol-forming substrate. The cartridge may be filled with such aerosol-forming substrate. The aerosol-forming substrate may comprise tobacco, preferably shisha substrate, such as molasses&#x2014;a mixture of tobacco, water, sugar, and other components, such as glycerine, flavors, etc. The heating system of the electrically heated shisha device heats the contents of the cartridge to generate aerosol, which is conveyed through an airflow path to a user.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to facilitate airflow through the cartridge and the flow of the aerosol from the cartridge, a shisha cartridge may have one or more holes through one or more walls. The cartridge may include one or more holes at the top, one or more holes at the bottom, or both one or more holes at the top and one or more holes at the bottom. Alternatively, the top may be open, that is, the top wall may be partially or completely absent. Any holes or openings in the top and bottom walls may be closed by a removable (for example, peelable) sealing layer, such as a film, sticker, or liner, during storage. The removable layer may protect the contents (for example, the molasses) from exposure to air and oxygen. The removable layer may be removed (for example, pulled or peeled off) by a user prior to first use of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The holes or openings in the cartridge, if left unsealed, may lead to loss of freshness (for example, moisture content) or contamination of the substrate, as well as issues with leakage. For one or more reasons, such as in order to maintain freshness, to prevent leakage of the substrate, or to preserve the quality and integrity of the substrate during storage, it is desirable to close or seal the openings or holes of the cartridge prior to use or between uses if the entire contents of the cartridge are not used at once.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Some shisha devices are configured to pierce the cartridge when the cartridge is inserted into the shisha device to form one or more holes. The shelf-life of shisha cartridges that do not have holes tends to be greater than the shelf-life of shisha cartridges that do have holes, even if the holes are covered by a seal.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, formation of holes upon insertion of the shisha cartridge in the shisha device may have drawbacks. For example, if the user does not immediately use the shisha device and associated cartridge or does not exhaust the aerosol-forming substrate in the cartridge within a typical time frame for exhausting substrate, the aerosol-forming substrate may lose freshness or the contents of the cartridge may leak. If the contents of the cartridge leak while the cartridge is in the shisha device, the leaked contents, which may comprise a high sugar content, may be difficult to clean and may foul the device.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A user may insert a cartridge into a shisha device and not use the device immediately for a number of reasons. For example, a user may want to insert the cartridge for later use. A user may insert a cartridge and realize that they would prefer a different cartridge content, such as a cartridge having an aerosol-forming substrate with a different flavor profile. A user may insert a cartridge with the intention of immediate use but may get distracted prior to use.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Various embodiments of the present disclosure relate to shisha devices configured to pierce cartridges comprising aerosol-forming substrate. The shisha devices are configured to prevent piercing of the cartridge until the cartridge is inserted into a receptacle of the device. Preferably, piercing of the cartridge requires a step separate from insertion of the cartridge into the receptacle of the shisha device. That is, the shisha device is preferably configured such that insertion of the cartridge into the receptacle of the device, without more, does not cause the cartridge to be pierced.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thus, a user may insert a cartridge into the shisha device to have the cartridge and device ready for future use without losing freshness or leakage occurring, provided that the piercing mechanism has not been actuated. The user may remove from the shisha device a previously inserted cartridge, for example if the user changes their mind regarding the cartridge that they would like to use, without the cartridge having been pierced. In addition, if the user is not able to initiate an intended shisha session after insertion of the cartridge into the device, the user may be assured that the cartridge will maintain fresh contents and will not leak until the piercing mechanism is actuated at a later time. Thus, the freshness of the contents of the cartridge may be maintained and fouling of the device may be avoided.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A shisha device according to the present disclosure may comprise a vessel comprising an interior volume configured to house a liquid. The vessel may comprise an inlet and a headspace outlet. The shisha device may comprise a receptacle for receiving a cartridge comprising an aerosol forming substrate. The shisha device may comprise a heating element configured to heat the cartridge when the cartridge is received in the receptacle to generate an aerosol. The shisha device may comprise a conduit through which generated aerosol may flow from the receptacle to the vessel via the inlet of the vessel. The shisha device comprises a piercing element configured to pierce the cartridge. The shisha device may comprise an actuator operably coupled to the piercing element. Actuation of the actuator may cause the piercing element to pierce the cartridge. The shisha device may be configured to prevent the actuator from causing the piercing element to pierce the cartridge until the cartridge is received in the receptacle. The shisha device may be configured to prevent the actuator from causing the piercing element to pierce the cartridge until the cartridge is already received in the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The shisha device may comprise a release that prevents the actuator from causing the piercing element to pierce the cartridge. The release may comprise one or more of a mechanical component, an electromechanical component, and an electrical component. An electrical release may comprise control electronics and instructions to prevent or permit actuation of the actuator depending on whether the cartridge is received in the receptacle, or the like.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Insertion of the cartridge into the receptacle may cause the release to move from a first position to a second position. In the first position the release may prevent the actuator from causing the piercing element from piercing the cartridge. In the second position the release may permit the actuator to cause the piercing element to pierce the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The shisha device may comprise a sensor to detect whether the cartridge is received in the receptacle. If the cartridge is received in the receptacle, the actuator may be permitted to cause the piercing element to pierce the cartridge. For example, the sensor may be operably coupled to control electronics that prevents the actuator may from causing the piercing element to pierce the cartridge unless the sensor detects the cartridge in the receptacle. For example, the actuator may comprise a motor and the control electronics may be configured to prevent movement of the motor unless the sensor detects the cartridge in the receptacle. By way of another example, the control electronics may be operably coupled to a release that prevents the actuator from causing the piercing element from piercing the cartridge unless the sensor detects the cartridge in the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a shisha device comprises a vessel comprising an interior volume configured to house a liquid.

Actuation of the actuator causes the piercing element to pierce the cartridge. The shisha device is configured to prevent the actuator from causing the piercing element to pierce the cartridge until the cartridge is received in the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The shisha device may comprise a release that prevents the actuator from causing the piercing element to pierce the cartridge. The release may comprise one or more of a mechanical component, and electromechanical component, and an electrical component. An electrical release may comprise control electronics and instructions to prevent or permit actuation of the actuator depending on whether the cartridge is received in the receptacle, or the like.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The shisha device may comprise a sensor to detect whether the cartridge is received in the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, a shisha device comprises a vessel comprising an interior volume configured to house a liquid.

Actuation of the actuator causes the piercing element to pierce the cartridge. The heating element may form at least a portion of the receptacle for receiving the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The shisha device may comprise a release mechanism that prevents the actuator from causing the piercing element to pierce the cartridge.

In some embodiments, the top wall of the cartridge may be absent or may define one or more openings to form the one or more inlets of the cartridge. The bottom wall of the cartridge may define one or more openings to form the one or more outlets of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The one or more openings formed by the piercing element of the shisha device, together with the openings present in the cartridge prior to piercing by the piercing element, if any, may form one or more inlets and outlets that are sized and shaped to provide a suitable resistance to draw (RTD) through the cartridge.

The label, sticker, or foil may be affixed to the cartridge in any suitable manner, such as with an adhesive, crimping, welding, or otherwise being joined to the container. The seal may comprise a tab that may be grasped to peel or remove the label, sticker, or foil from the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The cartridge may be a shisha cartridge that may be used with any suitable shisha device. Preferably, the shisha device is configured to sufficiently heat the aerosol-forming substrate in the cartridge to form an aerosol from the aerosol-forming substrate but not to combust the aerosol-forming substrate. An aerosol may be formed from the aerosol-forming substrate by volatilizing one or more components of the aerosol-forming substrate.

The temperature sensor may be operably coupled to the control electronics to control the temperature of the heating element. The temperature sensor may be positioned in any suitable location. For example, the temperature sensor may be configured to insert into the cartridge when received within the receptacle to monitor the temperature of the aerosol-forming substrate being heated. In addition or alternatively, the temperature sensor may be in contact with the heating element. In addition or alternatively, the temperature sensor may be positioned to detect temperature at an aerosol outlet of the shisha device or a portion thereof. The sensor may transmit signals regarding the sensed temperature to the control electronics.

The shisha device may include any suitable power supply. For example, a power supply of a shisha device may be a battery or set of batteries. The batteries of the power supply may be one or more of rechargeable, removable and replaceable. Any suitable battery may be used. For example, heavy duty type or standard batteries existing in the market, such as used for industrial heavy-duty electrical power-tools. Alternatively, the power supply may be any type of electric power supply including a super or hyper-capacitor. Alternatively, the assembly may be connected to an external electrical power source, and electrically and electronically designed for such purpose. Regardless of the type of power supply employed, the power supply preferably provides sufficient energy for the normal functioning of the assembly for at least one shisha session until aerosol is depleted from the aerosol-forming substrate in the cartridge before being recharged or needing to connect to an external electrical power source. Preferably, the power supply provides sufficient energy for the normal functioning of the assembly for at least about 70 minutes of continuous operation of the device, before being recharged or needing to connect to an external electrical power source.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one example, a shisha device includes an aerosol-generating element that includes a cartridge receptacle, a heating element, an aerosol outlet, and an air inlet. The cartridge receptacle is configured to receive a cartridge containing the aerosol-forming substrate. The heating element may define at least part of a surface of the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The shisha device includes an air inlet channel in fluid connection with the receptacle. In use, when the aerosol-forming substrate inside the cartridge is heated, aerosol former components in the substrate vaporize. Air flowing from the air inlet channel through the cartridge becomes entrained with aerosol generated from the aerosol former components in the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Some electrically heated shisha devices employ pre-heated air and typically employ an airflow path such that the air travels in the vicinity of the heat source upon puffing. Further, some electrically heated shisha devices employ elements that increase radiation heat transfer by increasing the heated surface area.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The air inlet channel may include one or more apertures through the cartridge receptacle. Air from outside the shisha device may flow through the channel and into the cartridge receptacle through the one or more apertures. If a channel includes more than one aperture, the channel may include a manifold. The manifold may direct air flowing through the channel to each aperture. Preferably, the shisha device includes two or more air inlet channels.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As described above, the shisha device includes a piercing element configured to pierce the cartridge to form one or more openings (such as inlets, outlets, or inlets and outlets) in the body of the cartridge to allow air to flow through the cartridge. The piercing element may be operably coupled to an actuator. Actuation of the actuator causes the piercing element to pierce the cartridge. Preferably, the shisha device is configured to prevent the actuator from causing the piercing element to pierce the cartridge until the shisha device is received in the receptacle. Preferably, actuation of the actuator is a step separate from inserting the cartridge in the receptacle or closing a lid or a cover once the cartridge is received in the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The shisha device may comprise any suitable piercing element. For example, the piercing element may mechanically pierce the body of the cartridge, may pierce the body of the cartridge by focusing energy on the body of the cartridge, or the like. For example, the piercing element may comprise an elongate element comprising a tapered end for puncturing the body of the cartridge, the piercing element may comprise a laser or other suitable element for generating energy and focusing energy at one or more locations of the body of the cartridge to form the openings, the piercing element may heat the cartridge to allow formation of openings in the body of the cartridge at predetermined heat labile locations of the cartridge, or the like.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">If the cartridge is manufactured to be predisposed to forming openings in the body when the cartridge is heated, the heating element of the shisha device may serve as the piercing element. Preferably, the heating element forms at least a portion of the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">A piercing element that is configured to generate and focus energy at one or more locations of the body may comprise an energy source, such as a light source. Such a piercing element may comprise one or more appropriate lenses for focusing energy emitted from the source to one or more locations of the body of the cartridge. For example, the piercing element may comprise a laser. The energy source may be operably coupled to the control electronics of the shisha device. The actuator may also be operably coupled to the control electronics. Actuation of the actuator may cause the control electronics to activate the energy source.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">A piercing element that is configured to mechanically pierce may comprise an elongate element having a tapered end. The elongate element may be operably coupled to an actuator. Actuation of the actuator may cause the tapered end to puncture the cartridge to form one or more openings in the body of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">For example, actuation of the actuator may cause the elongate element to move from a retracted position to an extended position. Movement of the elongate element from the retracted position to the extended position may cause the elongate element to pierce the cartridge. The shisha device may further comprise a spring operably coupled to the actuator to bias the actuator towards a position that causes the elongate element to be in the retracted position.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The shisha device may comprise any suitable actuator that is operably coupled to the piercing element. The actuator may comprise a toggle, a button, a slide, or the like. Preferably, the actuator is a separate element of the shisha device that is specifically designed for actuating the piercing element.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, movement of the actuator causes movement of the piercing elements. For example, the actuator may comprise a depressible button. Pressing the button may cause movement of the piercing element, such as the elongate element, such that the piercing element pierces the cartridge, for example, by moving the elongate element from the retracted position to the extended position. A spring may be operably coupled to the button to bias the button towards a position that results in the elongate element being in the retracted position when the button is not depressed.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, the actuator is operably coupled to the control electronics, which may be coupled to the piercing element. For example, the control electronics may be operably coupled to a motor configured to move the piercing element, such as the elongate element, such that the piercing element pierces the cartridge, for example, by moving the elongate element from the retracted position to the extended position. The motor may also move the elongate element from the extended position to the retracted position after the cartridge has been pierced. As another example, the control electronics may be operably coupled to an energy source of a piercing element, such as a laser, configured to direct emitted energy towards a location of the body of the cartridge. As yet another example, the control electronics may be operably coupled to a heating element configured to cause openings to form in heat labile portions of the body of the cartridge. Actuation of the actuator, such as switching a toggle, pressing a button, sliding a slide, or the like, may result in the control electronics causing the motor to move the elongate element, causing the energy source to activate, causing the heating element to heat, or the like.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The shisha device may comprise a release configured to prevent the actuator from causing the piercing element to pierce the cartridge until the cartridge is received in the receptacle. As used in the present disclosure, a &#x201c;release&#x201d; is a mechanism that prevents actuation of the actuator from causing the piercing element from piercing the cartridge. Any suitable mechanism may be employed. For example, the release may comprise one or more of an electrical component, a mechanical component, or an electromechanical component.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments where the piercing element comprises an elongate element that moves from a retracted position to an extended position in which the elongate element pierces the cartridge, the release comprises a mechanical mechanism that prevents the actuator from causing the elongate element to move from the retracted position to the extended position until the cartridge is received in the receptacle. For example, insertion of the cartridge into the receptacle may cause an element of the release to move from a first position to a second position. The element of the release in the first position may prevent the actuator from causing the elongate element to move from the retracted position to the extended position. The element of the release in the second position may permit the actuator to cause the elongate element to move from the retracted position to the extended position. The release may comprise a mechanical release element that extends into the receptacle such that insertion of the cartridge into the receptacle causes movement of the release element to move from the first position to the second position.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The release may comprise a motor. For example, a motor may be operably coupled to a mechanical element that prevents the piercing element from piercing the cartridge. The mechanical element may contact the actuator, the piercing element, or other suitable element, in a manner that prevents the actuator from causing the piercing element from piercing the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The control electronics of the shisha device may serve as the release. For example, the control electronics may be operably coupled to a motor that is operably coupled to the piercing element, such as a piercing element comprising an elongate element. The control electronics may be configured to prevent activation of the motor when the cartridge is received in the receptacle. As another example, the control electronics may be operably coupled to a piercing element comprising an energy source or heating element and may be configured to prevent activation of the energy source or heating element until the cartridge is received in the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">The shisha device may include one or more sensors to determine whether the cartridge is received in the receptacle. The sensor may be operably coupled to the control electronics, which may prevent the actuator from causing the piercing element to pierce the cartridge until the sensor detects that the cartridge is received in the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The shisha device may optionally comprise a sensor to detect whether the received cartridge has already been consumed and may prevent the actuator from causing the piercing element to pierce the cartridge if the sensor detects that the cartridge has been consumed. Thus, activation of the piercing element may be prevented until an unused cartridge that has not previously been pierced is received in the receptacle.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">Any suitable sensor may be employed to detect whether a cartridge is received in the receptacle or whether an unused cartridge is in the receptacle. For example, the sensor may include an optical sensor, an airflow sensor, a capacitance sensor, an induction sensor, or the like.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In use and after being pierced by the piercing element, the cartridge includes one or more openings (such as inlets, outlets, or inlets and outlets) formed in the body to allow air to flow through the cartridge. Air that enters the cartridge may flow across or through, or both across and through the aerosol-forming substrate, entraining aerosol, and exiting the cartridge and receptacle via an aerosol outlet. From the aerosol outlet, the air carrying the aerosol enters a vessel of the shisha device.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The shisha device may include any suitable vessel defining an interior volume configured to contain a liquid and defining an outlet in the headspace above a liquid fill level. The vessel may include an optically transparent or opaque housing to allow a consumer to observe contents contained in the vessel. The vessel may include a liquid fill demarcation, such as a liquid fill line. The vessel housing may be formed of any suitable material. For example, the vessel housing may include glass or suitable rigid plastic material. Preferably, the vessel is removable from a portion of the shisha assembly comprising the aerosol-generation element to allow a consumer to fill, empty or clean the vessel.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">The vessel may be filled to a liquid fill level by a consumer. The liquid preferably includes water, which may optionally be infused with one or more colorants, flavorants, or colorants and flavorants. For example, the water may be infused with one or both of botanical and herbal infusions.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Aerosol entrained in air exiting the aerosol outlet of the receptacle may travel through a conduit positioned in the vessel. The conduit may be coupled to the aerosol outlet of the aerosol-generating element and may have an opening below the liquid fill level of the vessel, such that aerosol flowing through the vessel flows through the opening of the conduit, then through the liquid, into headspace of the vessel and exits through a headspace outlet, for delivery to a consumer.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The headspace outlet may be coupled to a hose comprising a mouthpiece for delivering the aerosol to a consumer. The mouthpiece may include an activation element, such as a switch activatable by a user, a puff sensor arranged to detect a user puffing on the mouthpiece, or both a switch activatable by the user and a puff sensor. The activation element is operably coupled to the control electronics of the shisha device. The activation element may be wirelessly coupled to the control electronics. Activation of the activation element may cause the control electronics to activate the heating element, rather than constantly supplying energy to the heating element. Accordingly, the use of an activation element may serve to save energy relative to devices not employing such elements to provide on-demand heating rather than constant heating.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">For purposes of example, one method for using a shisha device as described herein is provided below in chronological order. The vessel may be detached from other components of the shisha device and filled with water. One or more of natural fruit juices, botanicals, and herbal infusions may be added to the water for flavoring. The amount of liquid added should cover a portion of the conduit but should not exceed a fill level mark that may optionally exist on the vessel. The vessel is then reassembled to the shisha device. The cartridge may be prepared by removing any removable layer (if present). A portion of the aerosol-generating element may be removed or opened to allow the cartridge to be inserted into the receptacle. The aerosol-generating element is then reassembled or closed.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The actuator may be actuated by a user by, for example, toggling a switch, pressing a button, sliding a slide, or the like. In some embodiments, the actuator may be actuated by control electronics of the device upon detection that the cartridge is received in the receptacle. If the cartridge is received in the closed receptacle, actuation of the actuator causes the piercing element to pierce the cartridge to form one or more openings in the body of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">The device may then be turned on before or after actuating the actuator, as appropriate. Turning on the device may initiate a heating profile of a heating element, to heat the aerosol-forming substrate to a temperature at or above a vaporization temperature but below a combustion temperature of the aerosol-forming substrate. The aerosol forming compounds of the aerosol-forming substrate vaporize, generating an aerosol. The user may puff on the mouthpiece as desired. The user may continue using the device as long as desired or until no more aerosol is visible or being delivered. In some embodiments, the device may be arranged to automatically shut off when the cartridge or a compartment of the cartridge is depleted of usable aerosol-forming substrate. In some embodiments, the consumer may refill the device with a new cartridge after, for example, receiving the cue from the device that the aerosol-forming substrate in the cartridge is depleted or nearly depleted. The shisha device may be turned off at any time by a consumer by, for example, switching off the device.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The shisha device may have any suitable air management. In one example, puffing action from the user will create a suction effect causing a low pressure inside the device which will cause external air to flow through an air inlet of the device, into the air inlet channel, and into the receptacle. The air may then flow through the cartridge in the receptacle and become entrained with aerosol produced from the aerosol-forming substrate. The air with entrained aerosol then exits the aerosol outlet of the receptacle, flows through the conduit to the liquid inside the vessel. The aerosol will then bubble out of the liquid and into head space in the vessel above the level of the liquid, out the headspace outlet, and through the hose and mouthpiece for delivery to the consumer. The flow of external air and the flow of the aerosol inside the shisha device may be driven by the action of puffing from the user.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0095" num="0094">Reference will now be made to the drawings, which depict one or more embodiments described in this disclosure.
