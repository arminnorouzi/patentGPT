For pathogen detections, because each pathogenic microorganism has its unique characteristic nucleic acid sequences, the detection of nucleic acid molecules for specific species can be developed, also known as nucleic acid diagnostics (NADs), plays an important role in the field of food safety, environmental microbial pollution detection, human pathogen infections and the like. In another aspect, the NAD methods can also detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human beings or other species. Understanding the relationship between genetic variation and biological function at the genomic level may provide anew perspective for modern molecular biology, among which SNPs are closely related to biological function, evolution, disease and the like, thus the development of techniques for detection and analysis of SNPs is particularly important.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">So far, several NAD methods have been established, most of which are created for the detection of specific DNA molecules and some of which are for RNA molecules. Usually, DNA molecules are very stable and detection samples can be from a series of complex biological samples, while RNA molecules can be easily degraded and should be treated with care. In 1970s, restriction endonuclease digestion detection methods were developed, and then by the development of methods for detection of specific nucleic acid molecules such as Southern, Northern and dot hybridization. In 1985 when the PCR method became a routine experimental method, it led to exponential progress in molecular biology. The detection of specific nucleic acid molecules currently established usually requires two steps, the first step being target nucleic acid amplification and the second step being target nucleic acid detection. PCR technique is the first established and currently most commonly used amplification method. Based on the PCR method, fluorescence labelled probes are introduced to facilitate realtime detection of the amplification of target (named as Realtime PCR), which is a rapid and highly sensitive detection method and can be used for quantitative analysis. Besides of PCR amplification method, many alternative methods have been created, such as the ligase chain reaction, the branched DNA amplification, NASBA, SDA, transcription-mediated amplification, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), rolling circle amplification (RCA), Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) and the like. The advantage of these alternative methods lies in the isothermal characteristic, that's to say that the reaction can be simply accomplished at one temperature, without the need for thermal cycling instruments for PCR. In addition to real-time PCR, which can directly complete amplification and detection, among nucleic acid detection methods, FISH hybridization technology (Fluorescence in situ hybridization), the most commonly used detection method, hybridizes in situ with complementary target sequences by labeling molecular probes. In addition, detection methods such as next-generation sequencing technologies and Oxford Nanopore sequencing technologies have also been developed, but these methods usually require expensive experimental equipment.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The detection of SNPs first also needs to be amplified by PCR and other methods to obtain enough amounts of fragments containing SNP site regions for further detection. Common approaches include primer extension, hybridization, ligation and enzymatic cleavage. After completing the above methods, you need to use specific methods for detection, such as mass spectrometry detection, fluorescence detection, chemiluminescence detection, etc.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although many detection methods have been developed as described above for nucleic acid detection, in some cases, faster, simpler and cheaper detection is still an important development direction, such as rapid detection of pathogens in the wild, rapid detection of drug-sensitive SNPs, etc. In 2016, Collins et al. developed a rapid and inexpensive method for detecting Zika virus based on the characteristics of CRISPR-Cas9 that specifically recognizes and cleaves target sequences. In 2017, Zhang Feng et al. took advantage of the collateral effect of CRISPR-Cas13a to build a rapid nucleic acid detection method. &#x201c;Collateral effect&#x201d;, i.e., Cas13a binds to specific target RNA and then randomly cleaves other non-target RNAs (here, the RNA molecule is designed as an RNA fluorescence reporter system), combined with isothermal amplification technology RPA to achieve rapid target RNA detection; and Zhang Feng team called this detection method as SHERLOCK (Specific High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing). The SHERLOCK method involves the binding of RNA templates, so if you need to detect DNA, DNA should be first transcribed to RNA for detection; in view of the instability of RNA, this method will undoubtedly increase the difficulty of operation.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In 2015, Zhang Feng et al. discovered a new CRISPR-associated protein endonuclease Cas12a (formerly known as Cpf1), which is an RNA-guided specific DNA endonuclease like the commonly used Cas9 protein; but compared with Cas9, Cas12a has its own characteristics, such as the need for crRNA to guide the specific cleavage of double-stranded DNA and produce cohesive ends.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object of the present invention is to provide a method for detecting target nucleic acid molecules.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another object of the present invention is to provide a use of a Cas protein in a method for detecting target nucleic acid molecules.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a first aspect of the invention, provided is a kit, comprising a guide RNA, a Cas protein, a nucleic acid probe and a buffer.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">provided is a method for detecting target nucleic acid molecules, which comprises adding a guide RNA, a Cas protein, a nucleic acid probe and a buffer into the reaction system containing the target nucleic acid molecules to be detected, and then detecting the target nucleic acid molecules (especially by detection of the fluorescence intensity).</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the Cas protein is Cas12a or a Cas protein having an activity similar to the collateral single-stranded DNA cleavage activity of Cas12a.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the Cas protein is Cas12a.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The Cas12a is preferably one of FnCas12a, AsCas12a, LbCas12a, Lb5Cas12a, HkCas12a, OsCas12a, TsCas12a, BbCas12a, BoCas12a or Lb4Cas12a.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the Cas12a is LbCas12a.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, the guide RNA refers to an RNA that directs the Cas protein to specifically bind to the target DNA.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid probe is a single-stranded DNA;

Once the target DNA (single or double stranded), the crRNA, and the Cas12a protein form a ternary complex, the complex cleaves other single-stranded DNA molecules in the system. In the method, the target DNA (a DNA sequence to be detected) is targeted by the designed crRNA; and crRNA and Cas12a protein are added to the detection system. When the target DNA is present, Cas12a, the crRNA and the target DNA form a ternary complex, and the complex cleaves the single-stranded DNA with fluorescent signal label (the fluorescent group and the quenching group are respectively labelled to the two ends, and the fluorescent group can be luminescent after the DNA is cleaved) using its collateral cleavage activity, thereby emitting fluorescence. Therefore, by detecting the fluorescence, it is possible to know whether or not the target DNA molecule is contained in the system to be detected. The method of the present invention allows rapid detection of whether a sample contains a specific DNA sequence. By combining with PCR technology, the sensitivity of the detection method can be greatly improved. The nucleic acid probe in the present invention is preferably a fluorescent probe.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0137">HOLMES Condition Test</p><p id="p-0140" num="0138">The invention provides the application of Cas12 enzyme based on Cas12a, Cas12b and the like in nucleic acid detection. The following describes Cas12a as an example.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0139">Selection of Cas12a: According to the study, Cas12a has the activity of trans cleavage, ie, once the target DNA, crRNA and Cas12a protein form a ternary complex, other single-stranded DNA (collateral single-stranded DNA) in the system will be cleaved. A specific DNA detection method was designed based on this principle. Firstly, the collateral DNA was designed as a fluorescent probe consisting of a random sequence with a length of 12 nt, and labelled with the fluorescent group HEX at the 5&#x2032;-terminal end and labelled with the quenching group BHQ1 (HEX-N12-BHQ1) at the 3&#x2032;-terminal end. When the system contains the target DNA fragment, a ternary complex of the target DNA, crRNA and Cas12a protein will be formed. At this time, the probe is cleaved, and the fluorescence emitted from the HEX fluorescent group can be detected by the fluorescence detector (excitation at 535 nM, and emission at 556 nM). Secondly, 10 different Cas12a were tested, and the target sequence was double-stranded DNA, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. It can be seen that the complex composed of the target double-stranded DNA and each Cas12a protein can achieve trans cleavage activity.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0140">HOLMES Response Sensitivity: Next, the sensitivities of FnCas12a and LbCas12a response to target DNA were tested. That is, the lowest concentration of target DNA that can respond was examined. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, when the test target was directly added, the target DNA with concentration above 0.1 nM was able to respond, and the response was significant at a concentration above 1 nM. If the PCR technique is combined (i.e. HOLMES method), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, i.e. the target fragment is first amplified by PCR and then subjected to Cas12a cleavage reaction, the response sensitivity can be as low as 10 aM, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0141">SNP test: Next, whether the HOLMES method can detect the SNP genotype was tested. T1 was used as the target sequence, and mutations were introduced in the PAM or single point mutation was introduced in the target sequence at position of 1-18. And the difference between the non-mutated sequence and the mutant sequences was compared for the crRNAs of different lengths.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0142">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, when the target complementary sequence is a 24 nt crRNA (crRNA-24 nt), the single point mutations at position of 8-18 are not significantly different from the wild type. When there is any mutation in the PAM and there is any point mutation at position of 1-7, there is a significant drop on the fluorescence value. When the crRNA was truncated and the length of the paired target sequence was 18 nt, the fluorescence value of the target sequence mutated at position 8-16 nt was significantly lower than that of the target sequence with a length of 24 nt. When the length was shortened to 16 nt or 17 nt, the decrease of fluorescence value of the target sequence after mutation was more obvious. When the length was shortened to 15 nt, the fluorescence values of the target sequence and the mutation are weak for the target sequence, but still strong for other target sequences, which can be used for detection. Taken together, 15 nt, 16 nt and 17 nt crRNAs are most suitable for detection of SNPs.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0143">In the present invention, Cas12a cleaves single-stranded DNA. A programmed cleavage mode wherein Cas12a cleaves single-stranded DNA independent of PAM sequence is called cis cleavage; and once a ternary complex Cas12a/crRNA/target DNA is formed, it shows the activity of trans-cleavage, that is, the activity of cleavage of any non-target single-stranded DNA in the system.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0144">Using the characteristics of Cas12a, a method for specifically detecting nucleic acid molecules has been developed, which is called HOLMES (one Hour Low-cost Multipurpose Efficient Simple assay).

As is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0262">The cis cleavage property of Cas12a to cleave target ssDNA:</p><p id="p-0265" num="0263">First, in order to test the ssDNA cleavage property of Cas12a, several crRNAs (Table 1) targeting the short ssDNA (DMNT1-3) were designed with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) labelled at the 3&#x2032; end. After cleavage of FnCas 12a, the reaction product was analyzed by denatured urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (urea PAGE). Single-stranded DNA cleavage by Cas12a was found to be programmable, i.e., the cleavage site is from the first base in the 3&#x2032; end of the target sequence paired with the crRNA guide sequence to near the 22nd base (from 21st to 23rd bases) of the target sequence counted in the 5&#x2032; end, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>C</figref>. The dsDNA cleavage of Cas12a requires a PAM sequence, whereas ssDNA cleavage does not require a PAM sequence (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), which is similar to Cas9-mediated ssDNA cleavage. However, the Cas12a-mediated ssDNA cleavage activity is dependent on the stem-loop structure in crRNA, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, while Cas9 still exhibits weak cleavage activity against ssDNA with only 20-nt complementary RNA sequences. The stem-loop structure of crRNA is important for stabilizing the structure of Cas12a, which is responsible for the necessity of stem-loop structure of crRNA for ssDNA cleavage of Cas12a. It is further tested whether the ssDNA cleavage site by Cas12a can passed through a shorter guide sequence crRNA, such that the cleavage is outside the recognition site. When the length of the guide sequence is 16 nt, 18 nt or 20 nt, all of these crRNAs resulted in cleavage by Cpf1 near the 22nd base, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>D</figref>, meaning that the cleavage site is 4 nt, 2 nt or 0 nt outside the recognition site. Next, the cleavage efficiency of Cas12a for different substrates was tested using dsDNA and ssDNA substrates, respectively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref>. Similar to the case of Cas9 cleavage, ssDNA cleavage is slower than dsDNA cleavage, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E to <b>1</b>G</figref>. These results indicate that the mechanism of Cas12a's ssDNA recognition and cleavage may be different from dsDNA, which is a less efficient PAM-independent recognition cleavage mode; the PAM sequence accelerates target dsDNA recognition and/or cleavage by Cas12a.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0264">The trans cleavage property of Cas12a to cleave ssDNA:</p><p id="p-0267" num="0265">When the target ssDNA is labelled at the 3&#x2032; end, Cas12 cleaves around the 22nd base, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. However, when the labelling was at the 5&#x2032; end, no cleavage product band of the predicted size was observed, but a short (&#x3c;6 nt) FAM-labelled product was produced, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. Through detailed experiments, once the ternary complex Cas12a/crRNA/target ssDNA is formed, the 5&#x2032;-end labelled target ssDNA (DNMT1-3) (Table 1) is cleaved and a short FAM-labelled product is produced, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>. In addition, the ternary complex also cleaves ssDNA that does not have any complementary sequence to the crRNA in any other reaction system (i.e., collateral ssDNA), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C and <b>3</b>D</figref>. This cleavage phenomenon is a trans cleavage, which is distinguished from a programmable cis cleavage. Trans cleavage was also observed when the target ssDNA was labelled at the 3&#x2032;-end, but many cis-cleaved products were left, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, which may be due to the formation of complex Cas12a/crRNA/target ssDNA, which protected the labelled 3&#x2032;-end of the target ssDNA from being exposed in the active nuclease site of the ternary complex, and these cleavage processes can be shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>.</p><p id="p-0268" num="0266">In addition to FnCas12a tested above, nine Cas12as from other species source were also tested (Table 2 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). Except for Lb4Cas12a, all Cas12a have high endonuclease activity on plasmid DNA (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>), and all Cas12a ternary complexes show both cis and trans cleavage activity on ssDNA (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C and <b>4</b>D</figref>). This suggests that cis and trans activity of Cas12a against ssDNA is a common phenomenon.</p><p id="p-0269" num="0267">Key sites and mechanisms of the cis and trans cleavage of ssDNA by Cas12a</p><p id="p-0270" num="0268">To determine key amino acid residues in Cas12a for cis and trans activity on ssDNA, several candidate residues of Cas12a were mutated for the activity testing. First, three single amino acid mutants of FnCas12a (H843A, K852A and K869A) were purified and tested, the residues of which are related to the RNase activity. The results of the ssDNA trans-activity studies showed that wild-type FnCas12a and three mutants showed no significant difference in cis and trans cleavage activity against ssDNA, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0271" num="0269">Next, when the endonuclease activity site in FnCas12a is mutated, i.e., the RuvC domain (D917A, E1006A or D1255A) and the Nuc domain (R1218A) site, the ssDNA cis and trans-cleavage activity of these mutant Cas12a were affected as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B and <b>5</b>D</figref>. These results indicate that the key sites of Cas12a responsible for target dsDNA cleavage are closely related to the cis and trans cleavage activities of ssDNA.</p><p id="p-0272" num="0270">A recent structural study of Cas12b (i.e. C2c1), including with extended target DNA or extended non-target DNA complexes, revealed that both strands were located within the RuvC pocket, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>. By comparing the endonuclease catalyzed residues of Cas12b (i.e. C2c1) and Cas12a, it is found that these sites most likely to play a similar role in the cleavage and function of Cas12b (i.e. C2c1)and Cas12a. The results of the in vitro single amino acid mutation experiment show that it is consistent with the above hypothesis, that is, Cas12a is likely to cleave both strands by only one RuvC catalytic pocket.</p><p id="p-0273" num="0271">Trans cleavage activity of the Cas12a complex: In the structure of the Cas12b (i.e. C2c1) complex with additional ssDNA, sequence-independent ssDNA is also located on the surface of the catalytic pocket, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>, which is similar to the collateral ssDNA substrate for Cas12a . Combining single amino acid mutation experiments, it is proposed that target DNA, non-target DNA and collateral ssDNA were all cleaved in a single RuvC pocket in Cas12a, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D, <b>6</b>E and <b>6</b>F</figref>. The reason why the ternary Cas12a complex has collateral ssDNA trans cleavage activity but the monomeric or binary complex does not have collateral ssDNA trans cleavage activity can be explained by comparing monomeric, binary, and ternary complex structures. The monomeric Cas12a structure is disordered. The binary complex Cas12a/crRNA is a triangular structure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>G</figref>, while the ternary complex Cas12a/crRNA/target DNA is converted into a bilobal structure, thereby exposing the catalytic pocket to achieve trans cleavage of the collateral ssDNA (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>H</figref>).</p><p id="p-0274" num="0272">Establishment of Nucleic Acid Probing Methods</p><p id="p-0275" num="0273">Using the characteristics of Cas12a, a method for specifically detecting nucleic acid molecules has been developed, which is called HOLMES (one Hour Low-cost Multipurpose Efficient Simple assay). As the name of the technology, it is characterized as a one hour, low cost, multi-purpose, efficient, and simple test method.</p><p id="p-0276" num="0274">In the whole reaction system, it can be divided into two large steps. One is the amplification of the template nucleic acid, and the other is the specific nucleic acid detection of the Cas12a protein. Here, PCR is used for amplification of nucleic acids, but in practice, any amplification method can be combined with nucleic acid detection of the second step, such as isothermal amplification method RPA or the like. The initial nucleic acid is not limited to double-stranded DNA, and may be single-stranded DNA; even RNA can be detected by reverse transcription, and thus the method is applicable to various types of nucleic acid molecules. For the nucleic acid detection stage, three components are the key to the experiment, namely Cas12a, crRNA and the nucleic acid probe. In addition to the 10 Cas12a mentioned in the examples (these 10 proteins are randomly selected), other Cas12a proteins are equally suitable for this method. In addition, other types of Cas proteins (such as C2c1 protein) are also suitable for the scope of the present invention. According to experimental results, <i>Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris </i>Cas12b (i.e. C2c1) also has a collateral single-stranded DNA trans cleavage activity similar to Cas12a, its complex with crRNA/target DNA can also cleave collateral single-stranded DNA.</p><p id="p-0277" num="0275">The crRNA as a guiding role is more stable in the system after being engineered by artificial modification or the like. In the selection of nucleic acid probes, HEX and BHQ1 labelled short single stranded DNA is selected in the present invention, and any other detectable labeling method is theoretically applicable as long as producing a detectable difference after the nucleic acid probe is cleaved. Alternatively, the nucleic acid probe can also be designed to be fluorescent after binding to the compound to probe whether the probe is cut off.</p><p id="p-0278" num="0276">In addition, it should be
