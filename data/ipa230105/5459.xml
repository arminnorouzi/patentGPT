According to such a technique, unlike music reproduction by a speaker, it is possible to obtain the sound and sound quality of the musical instrument itself by directly playing the musical instrument. However, since the automatic playing musical instrument can output only the sound of the musical instrument itself, the reproduction data also needs to be only the musical instrument sound. However, general music includes a plurality of musical instruments, and it is impossible to enjoy these pieces by an automatic playing musical instrument. Specifically, in the technique described in Patent Document 1 described above, the sounds are mixed into the automatic playing channel of the violin. Mixing of a signal other than the vibration component of the string of the violin, that is, a signal of a percussion instrument or an electronic sound also has to be reproduced by string vibration, which causes a problem that the sound quality of the sound reproduced by the violin is significantly deteriorated. In general, most music contents distributed in the world are stereo-mixed, and reproduction data of only the violin cannot be prepared. Therefore, it has been difficult to avoid the above-described problem.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Therefore, in the present disclosure, it is realized that music data including various musical instruments is reproduced using a plurality of types of automatic playing musical instruments. As a result, for example, it is possible to realize a music reproduction system in which an orchestra includes all automatic playing musical instruments. Furthermore, a unique reproduction system can be constructed by combining speakers and headphones, or a support system can be constructed when the user himself/herself practices playing a musical instrument. Hereinafter, embodiments of the present disclosure made in view of these points will be described.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0053">[Overview]</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram for explaining a first embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a reproduction system according to the present embodiment includes a signal processing apparatus <b>1</b>. An output device (reproduction apparatus) that outputs sound is connected to the signal processing apparatus <b>1</b>. The output device is, for example, an automatic playing musical instrument. The output device may be a speaker, headphones, a robot that outputs a specific sound, or the like. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, as examples of the automatic playing musical instruments connected to the signal processing apparatus <b>1</b>, &#x201c;automatic playing violin A&#x201d;, &#x201c;automatic playing violin B&#x201d;, &#x201c;automatic playing violin C&#x201d;, &#x201c;automatic playing viola&#x201d;, &#x201c;automatic playing cello&#x201d;, &#x201c;automatic playing contrabass&#x201d;, &#x201c;automatic playing trumpet&#x201d;, &#x201c;automatic playing trombone&#x201d;, &#x201c;automatic playing clarinet&#x201d;, &#x201c;automatic playing harp&#x201d;, and &#x201c;automatic playing timpani&#x201d; are illustrated. The automatic playing musical instruments connected to the signal processing apparatus <b>1</b> may be all different types of automatic playing musical instruments, or may be partially the same type of automatic playing musical instruments. Note that, in the present embodiment, an example is assumed in which the signal processing apparatus <b>1</b> and each automatic playing musical instrument are connected by wire.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Although details will be described later, the signal processing apparatus <b>1</b> generates an audio signal dedicated to each automatic playing musical instrument. Then, the generated audio signal is output to the corresponding automatic playing musical instrument. The automatic playing musical instrument operates on the basis of the audio signal supplied from the signal processing apparatus <b>1</b> and reproduces the audio signal. As a result, it is possible to listen to an orchestra that has been conventionally heard by a speaker or headphones with the sound of the musical instrument itself. Moreover, even if there is no performer of each musical instrument, it is possible to enjoy the performance of the orchestra.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">[Configuration Example of Reproduction System]</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a specific example of the reproduction system (reproduction system <b>100</b>) according to the first embodiment.

For example, an automatic playing piano has a structure in which a piano hammer is mechanically driven from an input signal to vibrate a string, whereas, in the case of an automatic playing bass, a piezoelectric element is vibrated by an electric signal to convey vibration to the string. Meanwhile, the speaker converts the electric signal into sound vibration with a voice coil. As described above, since the sound producing mechanism and the mechanism are different, in a case where a plurality of types of output devices is used, a difference in latency affects, and a shift occurs between each of reproduction timings of sounds. The present embodiment is an embodiment for such a case.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration example of a signal processing apparatus (signal processing apparatus <b>1</b>A) according to a sixth embodiment.

Each of the synchronization adjustment units <b>61</b>A to <b>61</b>D of the synchronization adjustment unit <b>61</b> receives a latency time unique to each output device (in the present embodiment, each automatic playing musical instrument) and performs adjustment so that sounds output from all the automatic playing musical instruments are synchronized. The unique latency time is included, for example, in the reproduction apparatus information. Specifically, a delay that allows synchronization with an automatic playing musical instrument having a large latency is given to the reproduction timing of the automatic playing musical instrument having a small latency.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">Note that the latency unique to each output device can be obtained in advance by measurement. However, since each of the automatic playing musical instruments is a musical instrument, the latency may change for each individual and for each environment due to various influences such as manufacturing variations of the individual, differences in materials (wood, metal, diaphragm, and the like), contraction due to temperature and humidity, and ageing. Therefore, there is a possibility that an error from the latency time measured in advance occurs. In order to cope with this, a sound pickup apparatus (e.g., a microphone) may be provided. The sound pickup apparatus may be integrated with or separated from the signal processing apparatus <b>1</b>A. The sound pickup apparatus is installed in the same space as the output device. Then, each separated sound source is reproduced by the output device, and the sound mixed in the space is acquired by the sound pickup apparatus. The observation mixed sound is compared with the original audio data which is an input signal to the signal processing apparatus <b>1</b>A, and synchronization adjustment can be performed by using the comparison result. For example, adjustment regarding the reproduction timing of each sound source signal is performed by increasing or decreasing the delay time for each sound source signal so as to minimize the squared error between the two signals.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">According to the present embodiment, even if each output device has different latency, it is possible to synchronize each reproduced sound source signal.
