A typical issue with Coriolis flow sensors is that they have internal components with different properties that respond differently to different conditions. For instance, when elements of the Coriolis flow sensor change temperature, each element may expand or contract at its own rate, causing significant stress on the couplings between the elements.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a Coriolis sensor, when a fluid with a temperature that is different from the interior temperature of the sensor is introduced to the sensor flow tube, the temperature of the flow tube is changed by conductive and/or convective heat transfer from the fluid. The other elements, for instance, a balance bar or case, of the sensor are not in direct contact with the flow fluid, so they are less affected by the changed temperature. For instance, in an embodiment in which the flow tubes are composed of material that expand when heated, when the flow fluid is hotter than the components in the sensor, the flow tube will expand to a greater degree than other components in the flow sensor, and when the flow fluid is cooler than the components in the sensor, the flow tube will contract to a greater degree than the other components in the sensor. In sensor arrangements that have flow tubes composed of polymers, the polymeric flow tubes may contract with increases in temperature and expand with decreases in temperature. In these systems, the polymeric flow tubes may expand as other components contract and contract as other components expand. The difference in material expansion and/or contraction causes significant stress on the flow tube and flow tube couplings that couple the flow tube to other components.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some Coriolis flow sensors, the flow tubes are held in place by couplings to balance bars, perhaps via brace bars. In situations where the flow fluid temperature is different from the temperature of the balance bars, the flow tube will naturally expand or contract to a greater degree than the balance bars coupled to the flow tube. This causes stress on the flow tube itself, couplings to the flow tubes, and other flow sensor elements to which the flow tube and balance bars are coupled. These stresses can be especially high for sensor elements composed of common sensor element materials, for instance, alloy C22 (an alloy of nickel, chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten) and stainless steel. The stresses may be significant in vibratory sensors to the extent that the stresses may cause the sensors to yield, buckle, and/or fail.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a need for sensor component designs that reduce stress caused by temperature variations.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An embodiment of a balance bar (<b>230</b>) is disclosed.

The sensor mounts <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>are coupling elements used to mount sensors, for instance, pickoff assemblies, that sense vibrational responses to the vibrations driven by the driver. The sensor readings may be used to determine flow characteristics such as mass flowrate, density, viscosity, volumetric flowrate, and/or the like in manners established in the art. Side ribs <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>are protrusions that add a larger balance cross-sectional area to provide better balance for the flow tube <b>103</b> vibrations. Further side ribs <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>may provide greater and/or different stiffness to the balance bar <b>106</b>, thus defining unique stiffness in a plane orthogonal to a driving plane. This may separate the mode shapes in frequency, thereby providing a defined drive plane for a tubular section that would otherwise have no clearly preferred driving plane. Side ribs <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>are located on the sides of the flow tube <b>103</b> in the cross axis <b>2</b>.

This reduces rigidity and allows lower frequency drive excitations to be used in flow measurements than if the spaces <b>111</b><i>a </i>and <b>111</b><i>b </i>were not provided. The side ribs <b>110</b><i>a </i>and <b>110</b><i>b </i>are still continuous about the flow tube <b>103</b> along the flow axis <b>1</b>.
