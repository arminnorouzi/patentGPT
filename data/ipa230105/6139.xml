A semiconductor device generally means a device that can function by utilizing semiconductor characteristics.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In recent years, higher resolution has been required for display panels. Examples of devices that require high-resolution display panels include a smartphone, a tablet terminal, and a laptop computer. Furthermore, higher resolution has been required for a stationary display device such as a television device or a monitor device along with an increase in definition. A device absolutely required to have a high-resolution display panel is a device for virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Examples of the display device that can be used for a display panel include, typically, a liquid crystal display device, a light-emitting apparatus including a light-emitting element such as an organic electroluminescent (EL) element or a light-emitting diode (LED), and electronic paper performing display by an electrophoretic method or the like.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An organic EL element generally has a structure in which, for example, a layer containing a light-emitting organic compound is provided between a pair of electrodes. By voltage application to this element, the light-emitting organic compound can emit light. A display device including such an organic EL element needs no backlight which is necessary for a liquid crystal display device and the like and thus can have advantages such as thinness, lightweight, high contrast, and low power consumption. Patent Document 1, for example, discloses an example of a display device using an organic EL element.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Organic EL elements are sometimes used in display portions of display devices for AR or VR. Non-Patent Document 1 discloses a manufacturing method of an organic optoelectronic device using standard UV photolithography.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">REFERENCE</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0000"><ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">[Patent Document 1] Japanese Published Patent Application No. 2002-324673</li></ul></p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Non-Patent Document</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">[Non-Patent Document 1] B.

In this specification and the like, a device formed without using a metal mask or an FMM is sometimes referred to as a device having a metal maskless (MML) structure.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In this embodiment, structure examples of a display device of one embodiment of the present invention and manufacturing method examples of the display device will be described.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">One embodiment of the present invention is a display device including a light-emitting element (also referred to as a light-emitting device). The display device includes at least two light-emitting elements that emit light of different colors. The light-emitting elements each include a pair of electrodes and an EL layer therebetween. The light-emitting element is preferably an organic electroluminescent element (organic EL element). The two or more light-emitting elements emitting light of different colors include respective EL layers containing different light-emitting materials. For example, three kinds of light-emitting elements emitting red (R), green (G), and blue (B) light are included, whereby a full-color display device can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the case of manufacturing a display device including a plurality of light-emitting elements emitting light of different colors, at least layers (light-emitting layers) containing light-emitting materials different in emission color each need to be formed in an island shape. In a known method for separately forming part or the whole of an EL layer, an island-shaped organic film is formed by an evaporation method using a shadow mask such as a metal mask. However, this method has difficulty in achieving high resolution and a high aperture ratio of a display device because in this method, a deviation from the designed shape and position of the island-shaped organic film is caused by various influences such as the low accuracy of the metal mask position, the positional deviation between the metal mask and a substrate, a warp of the metal mask, and the vapor-scattering-induced expansion of the outline of the formed film. In addition, the outline of a layer may blur during vapor deposition, whereby the thickness of its end portion may be small. That is, the thickness of an island-shaped light-emitting layer may vary from area to area. In the case of manufacturing a display device with a large size, high definition, or high resolution, the manufacturing yield might be reduced because of low dimensional accuracy of the metal mask and deformation due to heat or the like. Thus, a measure has been taken for pseudo improvement in resolution (also referred to pixel density). As a specific measure, a unique pixel arrangement such as a PenTile pattern has been employed.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Note that in this specification and the like, the term &#x201c;island shape&#x201d; refers to a state where two or more layers formed using the same material in the same step are physically separated from each other. For example, &#x201c;island-shaped light-emitting layer&#x201d; means a state where the light-emitting layer and its adjacent light-emitting layer are physically separated from each other.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one embodiment of the present invention, fine patterning of an EL layer is performed by photolithography without a shadow mask such as a fine metal mask (FMM). With the patterning, a high-resolution display device with a high aperture ratio, which has been difficult to achieve, can be fabricated. Moreover, EL layers can be formed separately, enabling the display device to perform extremely clear display with high contrast and high display quality. Note that one embodiment of the present invention is not limited to the above structure. For example, a structure in which fine patterning of an EL layer is performed using both a metal mask and photolithography is also one embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Part or the whole of the EL layer can be physically partitioned, inhibiting a leakage current flowing between adjacent light-emitting elements through a layer (also referred to as a common layer) shared by the light-emitting elements. This can prevent crosstalk due to unintended light emission, so that a display device with extremely high contrast can be obtained. Specifically, a display device having high current efficiency at low luminance can be obtained.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Note that a display device can also be obtained by combining white-light-emitting elements with a color filter. In that case, the light-emitting elements having the same structure can be provided in pixels (subpixels) emitting light of different colors, allowing all the layers to be common layers. Furthermore, part or the whole of the EL layer is partitioned by photolithography, which inhibits a leakage current from flowing through the common layers to achieve a display device with high contrast. In particular, when an element has a tandem structure in which a plurality of light-emitting layers are stacked with a highly conductive intermediate layer therebetween, a leakage current through the intermediate layer can be effectively prevented, achieving a display device with high luminance, high resolution, and high contrast.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the case where the EL layer is processed into an island shape, when a resist mask is formed directly on the EL layer, a solvent or the like of a resin material to be the resist mask might dissolve part or the whole of the EL layer. Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention, a sacrificial layer is formed between the EL layer and the resist mask, preventing damage at the formation of the resist mask.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The sacrificial layer is preferably formed using a material soluble in a solvent that is unlikely to dissolve the EL layer and insoluble or poorly soluble in a solvent of the resin material to be the resist mask. In that case, after the EL layer is processed into an island shape, the sacrificial layer can be removed without causing damage to the EL layer. For example, a material soluble in water or alcohol is particularly preferably used for the sacrificial layer.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Furthermore, the resist mask and the EL layer are preferably formed using organic materials that can be etched in the same dry etching step. In that case, the resist mask does not need to be separated with a resist stripper or the like after processing of the EL layer, and can be removed in the etching step of the EL layer. This can prevent the EL layer from being unintentionally dissolved with the resist stripper. At this time, the sacrificial layer may be formed using an organic material that can be etched in the above dry etching step or a material that has etching resistance in the dry etching step.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The EL layer can be processed into an island shape in such a manner that, for example, a resist mask is formed immediately after formation of a light-emitting layer (a layer containing a light-emitting material) and then processing is performed. In such a method, damage to the light-emitting layer (e.g., processing damage) might be caused to significantly degrade the reliability. Thus, one embodiment of the present invention preferably employs a method in which a sacrificial layer and a resist mask are stacked over a layer above the light-emitting layer (e.g., a carrier-transport layer or a carrier-injection layer, and specifically an electron-transport layer or an electron-injection layer), and then the light-emitting layer is processed into an island shape. Such a method provides a highly reliable display device.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The interval between EL layers with different colors can be reduced to less than or equal to 3 &#x3bc;m, less than or equal to 2 &#x3bc;m, or less than or equal to 1 &#x3bc;m by the above-described method, whereas it is difficult to reduce the interval to less than 10 &#x3bc;m by a formation method using an FMM, for example. With the use of a light exposure tool for LSI, the interval between EL layers can be reduced to less than or equal to 500 nm, less than or equal to 200 nm, less than or equal to 100 nm, or even less than or equal to 50 nm, for example. Accordingly, the area of a non-light-emitting region that may exist between two light-emitting elements can be significantly reduced, and the aperture ratio can be close to 100%. For example, an aperture ratio higher than or equal to 50%, higher than or equal to 60%, higher than or equal to 70%, higher than or equal to 80%, or higher than or equal to 90% and lower than 100% can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Furthermore, the size of the EL layer itself can be made much smaller than that in the case of using an FMM. For example, in the case where EL layers are separately formed using an FMM, the thickness differs between the center and the edge of an island-shaped EL layer, reducing an effective area that can be used as a light-emitting region with respect to the whole area of the EL layer. By contrast, in the above manufacturing method, a film deposited to have a uniform thickness is processed to form an island-shaped EL layer with a uniform thickness. Thus, even when the EL layer has a minute size, almost the whole area can be used as a light-emitting region. Thus, the above manufacturing method achieves both high resolution and a high aperture ratio.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">As described above, with the above manufacturing method, a display device in which minute light-emitting elements are integrated can be obtained, and it is not necessary to conduct a pseudo improvement in resolution with a unique pixel arrangement such as a PenTile pattern. Thus, the display device can achieve resolution higher than or equal to 500 ppi, higher than or equal to 1000 ppi, higher than or equal to 2000 ppi, higher than or equal to 3000 ppi, or higher than or equal to 5000 ppi while having what is called a stripe pattern where R, G, and B are arranged in one direction.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Here, it is preferable that a partition covering an end portion of the pixel electrode be not provided. When such a partition is used, a region of the pixel electrode that is covered with the partition is made a non-light-emitting region, reducing the aperture ratio accordingly. In one embodiment of the present invention, the end portion of the pixel electrode has a tapered shape, improving the step coverage with an EL film deposited over the pixel electrode; thus, the EL layer can be prevented from being partitioned by a step at the end portion of the pixel electrode without using the partition. As a result, the aperture ratio can be significantly increased.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">More specific structure examples and manufacturing method examples of the display device of one embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to drawings.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Structure Example 1</heading><p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a schematic top view of a display device <b>100</b> of one embodiment of the present invention.

Thus, a pattern with rounded corners is likely to be formed even with a rectangular photomask pattern. Consequently, a top surface of a light-emitting element may have a polygonal shape with rounded corners, an elliptical shape, a circular shape, or the like.</p><p id="p-0213" num="0206">Furthermore, in the manufacturing method of the display device of one embodiment of the present invention, the EL layer is processed into an island shape with the use of a resist mask. A resist film formed over the EL layer needs to be cured at a temperature lower than the upper temperature limit of the EL layer. Therefore, the resist film is insufficiently cured in some cases depending on the upper temperature limit of the material of the EL layer and the curing temperature of the resist material. An insufficiently cured resist film may have a shape different from a desired shape by processing. As a result, a top surface of the EL layer may have a polygonal shape with rounded corners, an elliptical shape, a circular shape, or the like. For example, when a resist mask with a square top surface is intended to be formed, a resist mask with a circular top surface may be formed, and the top surface of the EL layer may be circular.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0207">To obtain a desired top surface shape of the EL layer, a technique of correcting a mask pattern in advance so that a transferred pattern agrees with a design pattern (an optical proximity correction (OPC) technique) may be used.

A light-emitting device having a single structure includes one light-emitting unit between a pair of electrodes. The light-emitting unit includes one or more light-emitting layers. To obtain white light emission with a single structure, two or more light-emitting layers are selected such that emission of the light-emitting layers can produce an achromatic color (e.g., white). For example, in the case of two colors, when emission colors of a first light-emitting layer and a second light-emitting layer are complementary colors, the light-emitting device can be configured to emit white light as a whole.</p><p id="p-0324" num="0317">A light-emitting device having a tandem structure includes a plurality of light-emitting units between a pair of electrodes. Each light-emitting unit includes one or more light-emitting layers. When light-emitting layers that emit light of the same color are used in each light-emitting unit, luminance per predetermined current can be increased, and the light-emitting device can have higher reliability than that with a single structure. To obtain white light emission with a tandem structure, the light-emitting device is configured to obtain white light emission by combining light from light-emitting layers of a plurality of light-emitting units. Note that a combination of emission colors for obtaining white light emission is similar to that for a single structure. In the light-emitting device with a tandem structure, it is preferable that an intermediate layer such as a charge-generation layer be provided between the plurality of light-emitting units.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0318">When the white light-emitting device and a light-emitting device with a SBS structure are compared to each other, the latter can have lower power consumption than the former. Meanwhile, the white light-emitting device is preferable in terms of lower manufacturing cost and higher manufacturing yield because the manufacturing process of the white light-emitting device is simpler than that of the light-emitting device with the SBS structure.</p><heading id="h-0047" level="2">&#x3c;Structure Example of Light-Emitting Device&#x3e;</heading><p id="p-0326" num="0319">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref>, the light-emitting device includes an EL layer <b>790</b> between a pair of electrodes (a lower electrode <b>791</b> and an upper electrode <b>792</b>).
