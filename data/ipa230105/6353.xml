During transmission, electrical energy is emitted while during reception, electrical energy is captured. In Radio Frequency (RF) systems, filters are placed behind antennas to reject any interference outside of the band of interest of the system. Filters are typically designed as an interconnection of resonators that are properly coupled to operate in the desired band while providing adequate selectivity. The resonant frequency of such a structure is directly related to physical dimensions of the resonators and the overall structure. Typically, resonance is achieved when the physical dimensions of the resonator approach a half wavelength. Phased array antennas have multiple antenna elements where the inputs signals to the antenna element can be manipulated to control the direction of the antenna beam. The scan volume is a characteristic of the phased array antenna based on the maximum angle the beam may be directed from boresight while maintaining a particular active return loss level. In other words, the scan volume is the volume of space in front of the array where the beam can be steered towards while maintain a particular active return loss level). Scan volume can be increased by reducing the grid spacing between the antenna elements.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A phased array antenna includes multiple antenna elements where each antenna element is an antenna apparatus that includes an antenna integrated with a filter.

interference outside of the band of interest. Since antennas do not provide the required selectivity in most situations, antennas and filters are designed separately and then interconnected to achieve the required functionality. Filters are typically designed as an interconnection of resonators which are appropriately coupled to operate in the desired band while providing adequate selectivity, and proper passband impedance match. Phased array antennas include several antenna elements where each antenna element is connected to a filter. Often in conventional systems, the grid spacing of the antenna elements is such that each filter cannot be positioned adjacent to the corresponding antenna element. As a result, the connection between the filter and the antenna element may include a wire, microstrip, stripline, conductive trace, or other conductive connection that introduces signal loss. In addition, in conventional systems, the filters and the antenna elements are typically implemented separately requiring impedance matching networks to be interposed between the filter and antenna element. This may result in additional loss and a decrease in scan volume. In phased arrays, the active impedance seen by the antenna changes with the scan angle, thus the impedance matching networks must offer a compromise between the different active impedances seen by the antenna in order to achieve a certain return loss level for all angles within the scan volume.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In accordance with the examples discussed herein, each antenna element of the phased array antenna comprises an antenna apparatus which is a radiating structure having the same intrinsic behavior as a filter. As a result, the filter is part of each antenna element and the phased array antenna provides filtering. Each integrated filter antenna apparatus forming the antenna element can be implemented to accommodate much smaller grid spacing than those possible with conventional techniques where the filters are implemented within the grid spacing. As a result, lossy connections between the radiators and filters are eliminated while scan volume is increased with smaller grid spacing as compared to conventional antennas.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The design methodology of filters is applied in order to create a radiating structure (antenna) that has the same intrinsic behavior as a filter to implement an antenna apparatus forming an antenna element. For example, signals that fall within a limited passband are transmitted and received while signals outside the passband are rejected (or at least significantly attenuated). As a result, both functionalities (radiation and filtering) are combined in a single structure. Although conventional antennas may have inherent filtering characteristics where some frequencies are attenuated, the examples of the antenna apparatus discussed herein are designed to have a particular desired filter transfer function by selecting dimensions of the resonators, radiator and the overall structure, as well as selecting dimensions related to the relationship between the radiator and the rest of the structure. Therefore, the structure is configured to obtain the desired overall frequency response by taking into account the interaction between the radiator and the other components including the filter components. In addition, interconnects can be eliminated, reducing ohmic losses to form a compact structure. The compact structure may be beneficial in many circumstances both for a standalone single antenna system and for a multiple element antenna array. As discussed above, the compact structure of the antenna apparatus allows for implementing the antenna apparatus as each antenna element within a phased array antenna where the grid spacing is half a wavelength or less. The phased array antenna, therefore, includes filtering functionality. The resulting phased array structure with integrated filtering has a design characteristic where the design parameters of the filter determine, among other performance characteristics, the scan volume. Since the dimensions of the radiating element of each antenna element are at least partially limited by the dimensions of the components of the resonators of the antenna apparatus, selection of the resonator dimensions limits the dimensions of the grid spacing of the phased array antenna. The scan volume is at least partially determined by the grid spacing and, therefore, is dependent on at least one dimension of one of the resonators in the antenna apparatuses.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some examples discussed below, an antenna apparatus includes a number of metallic patch resonators that are enclosed within metallic cavities, vertically stacked and mutually coupled. With one technique, the coupling between the metallic patches is achieved with precisely shaped openings in the ground plane, or irises. In other situations, interlayer electrical connections using metal posts, sometimes referred to as vias, are used to couple the metallic patches.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">One advantage of the discussed structure is the use of one of the resonators (radiating resonator) as a radiator. The radiating resonator is not completely enclosed, allowing the structure to radiate into free space and act as an antenna. Through dimensional control in all three space dimensions and coupling to both free space and the resonator below, a filter which radiates into free space is formed. Therefore, the filtering transfer function of the antenna apparatus is at least partially based on the distance between the radiator element (resonator element exposed to free space) and another component of the antenna apparatus such as ground patch between the radiator element and another resonator metallic patch.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a block diagram of a phased array antenna <b>10</b> including a plurality of antenna elements <b>12</b> where each antenna element includes an antenna apparatus <b>14</b> with an integrated filter.

In some situations, the entire phased array structure can be moved and directed as a single unit. In typical implementations, each antenna element is connected to other circuitry such that the phase of transmitted and/or received signals can be manipulated to change the direction and/or shape of the antenna beam formed by the phase array antenna.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The antenna elements are separated from each other by a grid spacing where the dimensions of the antenna elements <b>12</b> typically determine the grid spacing. Since the antenna elements are not necessarily square, the grid spacing <b>16</b> in a first dimension (e.g., width) <b>18</b> may be different from the grid spacing <b>20</b> in a second dimension (e.g., length) <b>22</b> of the phased array grid. The phased array antenna may include any number of antenna elements. For the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a four by four array is shown including black dots to indicate that additional antenna elements may be included in both dimensions <b>18</b>, <b>22</b>. An array may include any number of elements where typical numbers range from 16 to thousands. The number of antenna elements and grid spacing in each orientation typically depend on the particular application of the antenna array. For base stations operating in accordance with 5G specifications, antenna arrays typically have 64 elements arranged in an 8 by 8 configuration. Multiple antennas can also be operated together to form bigger arrays, for instance of <b>128</b>, <b>256</b>, <b>512</b>, <b>1024</b> element or other configurations. For indoor applications and mobile devices, the array sizes are smaller, typically having 16 elements configured in 4&#xd7;4 or 2&#xd7;8 arrays. In some circumstances, scan volume is greater in the horizontal dimension than in the vertical dimension where an example of a suitable grid spacing in terms of wavelength (lambda) is about 0.45 lambda by 0.65 lambda.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For the examples herein, the grid spacing is uniform along a dimension such that spacings <b>16</b> along the first dimension <b>18</b> are the same and the spacings <b>20</b> along the second dimension <b>22</b> are the same, although the first dimension spacings <b>16</b> may not be the same3 as the second dimension spacings <b>20</b>.

The antenna apparatus <b>100</b> is a radiating filter where at least two resonators are coupled to each other and one of the resonators is a radiator. The antenna apparatus may be used for transmission, reception, or both depending on the specific implementation. The antenna apparatus <b>100</b>, therefore, is an example of the antenna apparatus <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. For the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the antenna apparatus <b>100</b> includes an input resonator <b>102</b>, an intermediate resonator <b>104</b>, and an output resonator <b>106</b> that forms the radiator. As discussed below, the antenna apparatus <b>100</b> may include several intermediate resonators <b>104</b>. For the examples herein, each non-radiating resonator <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> is formed with a metallic resonator element <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> positioned within a cavity <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> of a metallic enclosure <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>. The metallic enclosure <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> forms an electromagnetic enclosure at the operating frequencies and, therefore, may not include continuous metal walls void of any openings. As discussed below, for example, a series of metal posts (vias) between two planar conductive patches may form the side walls of the metallic enclosure where the two planar conductive patches form the top and bottom of the metallic enclosure. In another example, metallic screen can be used to form the metallic enclosure. A dielectric (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>) other than air is used within each cavity for the examples. A portion of one metallic enclosure may form a portion of another metallic enclosure. For example, where the resonators are implemented with planar conductive patches positioned between ground plane layers, the ground plane layer between two adjacent resonators may form the top of a lower metallic enclosure and the bottom of an upper metallic enclosure.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The resonator elements in the resonators are coupled to each other through couplings <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>. Each coupling <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> may be formed with conductive elements such as posts or screws or may be implemented with an opening within a ground plane separating the resonator elements. As discussed below, for example, a coupling can be formed with an iris within the ground plane separating two adjacent resonator elements. Couplings <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> may also be formed between non-adjacent resonator elements. Therefore, a coupling <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> may be any mechanism that couples electromagnetic energy between any two resonator elements.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The input resonator <b>102</b> has an input port <b>124</b> that can be connected to a signal source or to a receiver. The input port <b>124</b>, therefore, provides an interface to other devices, components and circuits. A transfer function <b>126</b> of the antenna apparatus <b>100</b> from the input port <b>124</b> through the output resonator (radiator) <b>106</b> is determined a least by the properties of the non-radiating resonators <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, the couplings <b>120</b>, <b>122</b>, and the radiating resonator <b>106</b> and the position of the radiator relative to the other components. In most situations, the transfer function <b>126</b> also depends on the characteristics of the input port <b>124</b>. The transfer function <b>126</b>, therefore, can be adapted or configured to meet specific criteria by selecting dimensions of the resonators <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> and the couplings <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> and relative position of the radiator <b>106</b> within the structure. For example, in implementations where the resonators are stacked resonator elements within ground plane enclosures and the couplings are formed with irises in the ground plane, the transfer function depends at least on the shape and size of the irises, the distance between the resonator elements, the dimensions of the resonators, the distance between the last resonator (radiator) and the adjacent ground plane, and the size of the input strip. The design of the antenna apparatus, therefore, takes into account the properties of the output resonator and the interaction of the output resonator with the other components within the antenna apparatus structure. As a result, in addition to other design parameters, the separation (distance) between the radiator <b>106</b> and the adjacent ground (underneath in the figures) is selected to realize the desired overall filter transfer function. Accordingly, the distance (D<b>1</b>) <b>128</b> between the radiator <b>106</b> and the adjacent resonator element <b>110</b> and the distance (D<b>2</b>) <b>130</b> between the radiator <b>106</b> and the ground plane of the enclosure are selected to provide the desired output coupling and transfer function. For the examples herein, the output coupling is adjusted by adjusting D<b>1</b> <b>128</b> and D<b>2</b> <b>130</b>. Also, if D<b>1</b> <b>128</b> is changed without changing D<b>2</b> <b>130</b>, the selectivity is changed without changing the output coupling. Therefore, the filter transfer function is typically adjusted by adjusting the distances D<b>1</b> <b>128</b> and D<b>2</b> <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As a result, in addition to other design parameters, the separation (distance) between the radiator <b>106</b> and the adjacent resonator element <b>110</b> is selected to realize the desired overall filter transfer function <b>126</b>.

As discussed herein, the selectivity <b>129</b> of the filter transfer function <b>126</b> is the shape of the filter response of attenuation over frequency. The selectivity <b>129</b>, therefore, includes parameters such at the bandwidths of the passband(s) and stopband(s) and the characteristics of the transitions between passband(s) and stopband(s).

Therefore, the receive and transmit properties of the antenna apparatus are identical for the examples. The characteristics, deign parameters, and configuration of the antenna apparatus discussed with reference to transmission may be applied to the antenna apparatus when used as a receiving device. Therefore, the radiator captures signals and provides an output at the input port when the antenna apparatus is used for receiving signals. More specifically, since the antenna apparatus <b>100</b> is a linear passive structure, the reciprocity theorem applies to its operation as a transmitter and receiver. Thus, the antenna apparatus <b>100</b> behaves exactly the same in transmission as in reception. In transmit mode, a signal at the input port <b>124</b> of the antenna apparatus <b>100</b> induces currents on the radiator <b>106</b> that result in transmission of electromagnetic fields to free space.

The two interior ground planes <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> each form a portion of two resonator enclosures <b>210</b>, <b>212</b>.

In other examples discussed below, the bottom ground plane may include an opening that provides coupling to a resonant cavity below the bottom ground plane. As discussed above, an opening in the ground plane that provides coupling can be referred to as an iris. The dimensions and shape of the iris dictate characteristics of the coupling. The filter transfer function of the antenna apparatus can be established, therefore, at least partially with selection of the shape and dimensions of the irises. In addition, the shape orientation of the irises and resonators determines the polarization of the antenna apparatus radiation pattern. As discussed below, the antenna apparatus can be designed to have single polarization, dual polarization, or circular polarization. The selection of the dimensions and shapes of the irises, therefore, can be used to obtain a desired filter transfer function and polarization radiation pattern.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The resonator elements and ground planes are separated from each other by a dielectric material (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). In one example, printed circuit board (PCB) techniques are used to form the antenna apparatus. Therefore, the ground planes and resonator elements can be formed with metallic sheets laminated on dielectric material substrates <b>246</b>. For the examples discussed herein, a dielectric material having a dielectric constant greater than the dielectric constant of air is used and is illustrated as crosshatched sections in some of the figures. The figures with exploded views do not show the dielectric in the interest of clarity. For the examples, the dielectric material is uniform within the structures although, in some situations, different dielectric materials may be used. The plurality of vias between a pair of ground planes form the side walls of each resonator enclosure. The input port is formed with section of stripline <b>247</b> that extends though the lower enclosure. The input may be formed using other techniques. In another example, the input port is formed by a metal post or via that extends through the lower enclosure. When the antenna apparatus <b>200</b> is used for transmitting signals, a transmitter is connected to the input port and radio frequency (RF) signals are fed to the antenna apparatus through the input port. The RF signals are filtered by the antenna apparatus and the filtered signals radiate from the radiating element. The dimensions of the resonating element determine the resonant frequency of the resonator. For the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, each resonator element is a rectangular metallic patch and the resonator elements are slightly different in size. Although the resonators have similar sizes, the different loading of each resonator results in a difference in size. The dimension of the rectangular metallic patch that determines the resonance of the resonator is the distance that extends from the side of the input to the opposite side. For the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, therefore, the distances <b>250</b>, <b>252</b>, <b>254</b>, <b>256</b> determine the resonant frequencies of the resonators. The desired filter response is achieved by selecting the dielectric, the length of metallic patches, the length of the irises, the spacing between the ground planes and the resonator elements, the spacing between adjacent resonator elements, and the spacing, D<b>2</b>, <b>130</b> between last resonator (radiator) <b>106</b> and the adjacent ground plane <b>132</b>, which is the ground directly underneath the radiator in the figures.

One technique for simulating filter circuits and designing filters includes a coupling matrix model which is an example of a technique that can be applied to designing an antenna apparatus in accordance with the discussions herein.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">At microwave and millimeter wave frequencies, bandpass filters are frequently constructed by interconnecting (i.e. coupling) resonators. Resonators can be coupled in a cascaded connection (i.e. between adjacent resonators), which produce all-pole frequency responses, or include couplings between non-adjacent resonators, which lead to more complex frequency responses that may include transmission zeros. These filters can be modeled with a simple lumped element circuit. For a general 2-port model of a synchronous direct-coupled-resonator filter, direct-couplings (between adjacent couplings) and cross-couplings (between non-adjacent resonators) can be represented. A circuit simulator can be used to simulate the circuit response including all possible couplings (adjacent and non-adjacent) and may include synchronous resonators (formed by capacitors and inductors), admittance inverters and frequency independent admittances. An example of a suitable circuit simulator includes the NI AWR Microwave Office and Ansys Designer circuit simulator. Once the center frequency and bandwidth of the filter are defined, the filter circuit can be expressed in matrix form, known as coupling matrix. The various entries of the coupling matrix M represent the different components of the circuit. Diagonal elements represent the imaginary part of the frequency independent admittances, whereas non diagonal entries represent couplings between resonators (ie. inversion constants). This modeling and design methodology are used for simulating and designing bandpass direct-coupled-resonator filters and is one example of a technique that can be used to design the examples of the antenna apparatus discussed herein. For the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the resonators are coupled in a cascaded connection where adjacent resonators are coupled to form an all-pole frequency response. The model can also be applied to the coupling to the radiator and from the radiator to free space.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In accordance with one example, the center frequency of the filter, bandwidth, passband equiripple return loss level and location of the transmission zero are selected. With these parameters, a coupling matrix that synthesizes this response can be analytically computed.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The coupling matrix is transformed into a real implementation by identifying the features of the physical geometry that control the various elements of the coupling matrix. Generally, for example, the size of a resonator can be altered to change its resonant frequency (ie, the corresponding diagonal element of the coupling matrix) and the size of openings created between resonators can control the amount of coupling between them. Different methodologies can be used to extract geometrical values from a circuit mode where typically the design procedure begins with obtaining an initial set of dimensions. Procedures may include looking at the input group delay, or splitting the structure into simpler blocks and comparing EM simulations with circuit simulations of equivalent blocks. After the initial dimensions are established, an optimization design procedure is applied. Therefore, the design of the antenna apparatus includes synthesizing a coupling matrix that provides the adequate passband response and out-of-band rejection needed. In order to synthesize this coupling matrix, the number of resonators (N), center frequency (f0), bandwidth (BW) and desired passband equi-ripple return loss value are determined in order to satisfy a certain rejection characteristic.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">For the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, nine geometrical dimensions are manipulated to realize the desired filter response where the geometrical dimensions include the lengths of the four metallic patches forming the resonator elements, the widths of the three openings forming the coupling between the metallic patches, the distance from the metallic patch radiator to the ground plane, and the width of the input tap.

For the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the antenna apparatus <b>400</b> has two inputs ports <b>402</b>, <b>404</b> including a horizontal polarization input port <b>402</b> and a vertical polarization input port <b>404</b>. Dual orientation is achieved by adjusting the dimensions of the same set of resonators and radiator and adjusting the shaping of the irises. Each iris <b>406</b>, <b>408</b>, <b>410</b> is a combination of two rectangular irises <b>412</b>, <b>414</b> where the iris with the longer dimension that is perpendicular to the direction of an input port couples the signals from that input. Coupling from irises that have their longest dimension parallel to the direction of an input port is significantly less providing isolation between the two input ports and signals. Therefore, the first rectangular portion <b>412</b> of the iris having the length <b>416</b> perpendicular to the direction <b>418</b> of the horizontal input port <b>402</b> couples signals received at the horizontal input port <b>402</b>.

For the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the resonating cavity (supplementary resonator) <b>502</b> is formed with a metallic resonating patch <b>504</b> enclosed by the input resonator ground plane <b>506</b>, another ground plane <b>508</b> and vias <b>510</b> connecting to the two ground planes <b>506</b>, <b>508</b>.

For the example, the iris <b>516</b> has the same shape an orientation as the other irises. Form one perspective, the additional resonating cavity <b>502</b> provides a mechanism for eliminating the transmission of energy at and near a particular frequency. The metallic resonating patch <b>504</b> in resonating cavity <b>502</b> is singly coupled to the input resonator. This differs from the other resonators which are, at least doubly coupled, either to other resonators or the input and output of the structure. As a result, the energy at the resonant frequency of patch <b>504</b> is contained within the resonating cavity <b>502</b> and cannot continue towards the radiator to be radiated into free space. This is similar to the performance of extracted-pole filters, where singly coupled resonators are located at different stages of a filter to create transmission zeros in the frequency response.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is an exploded perspective view illustration of an example of an antenna apparatus <b>600</b> having circular polarization.

Circular polarization can be achieved by feeding two orthogonal linear polarizations with a 90&#xb0; phase difference. This can be achieved with the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, where the radiating patch sustains two linear polarizations. The insets in the corners provide coupling between the two resonances sustained by each patch. The 90&#xb0; phase difference between polarizations and input matching in the desired passband is achieved by properly choosing the dimensions and location of the input pad, the dimensions of the two patches, the size of the insets, the size of the iris and the relative positions of the insets between both patches.

Transmission zeros can be introduced to the transfer function by implementing non-adjacent coupling using vias, dumbbell probes or an additional resonator adjacent to the input resonator and opposite the other resonators. The integrated structure allows for the filter and antenna to be implemented in a compact format that has significant implications in at least some implementations. For example, an antenna apparatus having the appropriate filter characteristics and antenna radiation pattern and polarization can be implemented within an area having dimensions less than a half wavelength across at the operating frequency.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> is an illustration of a perspective view and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> is an illustration of a top view of an example of a phased array antenna <b>1000</b> and associated scan volume of the antenna <b>1002</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref> is an illustration of a top view, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>D</figref> is an illustration of a front view, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>E</figref> is an illustration of a side view of a portion of the phased array antenna <b>1000</b>.

Working together, the individual antennas, or elements, can be connected to individual transmitters and receivers or groups or transmitters and receivers. The electromagnetic waves radiated by each individual antenna combine and superpose, constructively interfering (adding together) to enhance the power radiated in desired directions, and destructively interfering (cancelling) to reduce the power radiated in other directions. When used for receiving, the separate electromagnetic currents from the individual antenna elements combine in the receiver with the correct phase relationship to enhance signals received from the desired directions and cancel signals from undesired directions. Phased arrays contain components to control the amplitude and phase of each element to enable &#x201c;phased&#x201d; steering. In other words, the array is mechanically stationary while the electromagnetic waves are electronically steered. Active Electronically Phased Array (AESA) include active elements placed within the phased array. The phased nature and subsequent coupling of the antenna elements place additional requirements of active impedance control to the antenna elements. The requirements for phased steering determine the element spacing and are typically around a half-wavelength at the upper end of the operational spectrum. Phased array antennas allow for more efficient use of frequency spectrum and help meet the demands of conventional communication systems. Conventional techniques, however, are limited in that the required filtering on each antenna element within the array cannot be achieved while meeting other requirements related to parameters such as sidelobe level, active return loss, efficiency, array gain, and scan volume. The antenna apparatus and techniques described herein, however, enable the implementation of phased array antennas that meet these requirements.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">One example of a suitable technique for designing the phased array antenna includes using a circuit simulator application where one or more dimensions are selected to obtain a particular characteristic and systematically setting other dimensions to adjust and compensate other characteristics. In an example of a suitable technique for designing an antenna array, design begins from the filter specifications and the required scan volume. From the scan volume, the grid spacings in azimuth and elevation are determined, along with the maximum distance between the radiator patch and the planar metallic ground. From these values, the maximum output coupling of the filter is computed, and a circuit model based on the coupling, a coupling matrix is synthesized to fulfill the filter specifications under the constraint of a maximum output coupling value. From this circuit model, the dimensions of the structure are obtained as described above in reference to design of an individual antenna element (antenna apparatus).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Clearly, other embodiments and modifications of this invention will occur readily to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of these teachings.
