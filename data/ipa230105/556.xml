3D representation of a bone structure in a zone around a joint fracture, the zone comprising essentially all fragments of broken or ruptured bones and at least the ends of unbroken bones which form part of the fractured joint; 2) identifying different bone fragments within said 3D representation; 3) simulating a reduction of said bone fragments into a full joint; 4) calculating optimal parameter values for an implantable plate; 5) obtaining the implantable plate taking into account the calculated parameter values, whereby in step 3, the reduction is simulated by automatedly fitting positions and orientations of said bone fragments to a 3D representation of a healthy joint of said patient.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000"

id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the technical field of implantable plates used for healing fractures of joints or close to joints. The present invention also relates to a method of manufacturing such implantable plates.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Fractures close to joints are notoriously difficult to treat. One of the most common fractures close to a joint are distal radius wrist fractures (32.000 cases/year in Belgium). Today, use is made of fixed-shape implants: a set containing a limited number of plates of different sizes is available to the surgeon to select from. Typically the set may consist of implants of three different widths with a variety of lengths. The selection, however, basically comes down to a selection of the size which would most likely fit the patient. At best, one can only hope that the selected plate will fit nicely in the patient's body and will provide enough support at the fractured joint.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A number of issues arise when using fixed-shape implants: they tend to cause friction on the soft tissues and there is a lack of sufficient fixation options. Complications occur in up to 36% of the patients:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0004">hardware (HW) failures, e.g. the implant bends or even breaks;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0005">tendon ruptures, e.g. because of the friction of the tendon with an implant which is slightly oversized or does not follow well the natural curves of the bones;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0006">malunions.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0005" num="0007">As a consequence, and due to the recent advancements in three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques, patient-specific or patient-engineered implants could be designed and manufactured. For instance, document WO2014047514A1 discloses methods and systems for improving the quality, throughput and efficiency of Solid Free Form manufacture of implant components. Herein, it is explained that the joint replacement field has come to embrace the concept of &#x201c;patient-specific&#x201d; and &#x201c;patient-engineered&#x201d; implant systems. With such systems, the implants, associated tools, and procedures are designed or otherwise modified to account for and accommodate the individual anatomy of the patient undergoing the surgical procedure. Such systems typically utilize non-invasive imaging data, taken of the patient pre-operatively, to guide the design and/or selection of the implant, surgical tools, and the planning of the surgical procedure itself. Various objectives of these newer systems can include: (1) reducing the amount of bony anatomy removed to accommodate the implant, (2) designing/selecting an implant that replicates and/or improves the function of the natural joint, (3) increasing the durability and functional lifetime of the implant, (4) simplifying the surgical procedure for the surgeon, (5) reducing patient recovery time and/or discomfort, and/or (6) improving patient outcomes. Because &#x201c;patient-specific&#x201d; and &#x201c;patient-engineered&#x201d; implant systems are created using anatomical information from a particular patient, such systems are generally created after the patient has been designated a &#x201c;surgical candidate&#x201d; and undergone non-invasive imaging. But, because such systems are not generally pre-manufactured and stockpiled in multiple sizes (as are traditional systems), there can be a considerable delay between patient diagnosis and the actual surgery, much of which is due to the amount of time necessary to design and manufacture the &#x201c;patient-specific&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;patient-engineered&#x201d; implant components using patient image data. Hence, document WO2014047514A1 discloses methods for efficiently 3D-printing implants.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0008">Present day techniques using an implant to heal fractures focus on healing bones, but tend not to be specifically designed to heal a fractured joint. Such fractures tend to be very complicated due to the presence of many different bone fragments. Indeed, it often is difficult to see clearly how the bones and bone fragments of the fractured joint can be put in the correct position and be fixated in that position. The present invention aims to address this and other problems, by providing an implant which is patient-specific and fracture-specific, particularly for a fractured joint.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0009">Document WO 2017/127887 A1 discloses a method and system for producing a digital model of a customised device, comprising the steps of: importing a first digital file of a base part; importing a second digital file of a target shape; determining a warping interpolation function based on source point positions associated with the base part and target point positions associated with the target shape; and applying the warping interpolation function to the points of said base part to generate a model of said customised device. It offers the user to manually position a base shape to aligned broken bones. This document, however, is not specifically related to treating joint fractures. It would seem that the teaching of this document does not address reduction of a fractured joint to ensure that all bone fragments of the fractured joint are aligned properly.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0010">Document J. G. G.

Fractures joints are more difficult to reduce than other fractures, due to a larger number of bones and bone fragments, as well as the positions thereof which allow normal functioning of the joint. It is the inventors insight that all essential fragments of broken or ruptured bones and at least the ends of unbroken bones which form part of the fractured joint need to be incorporated in order to ensure a good reduction simulation.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0085">Furthermore, the document does not refer to adapting certain parameters such as the positions and orientations of screw holes taking into account the simulated reduction of the bone fragments.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0086">The present invention relates to automatic identification and reduction of intra-articular or metaphyseal bone fracture fragments close to or in a joint, with accompanying fracture comminution, impaction of the bone fragments and bone loss, which is typically the case. Note that this is not necessary in malunion cases. The calculation of optimal parameter values for an implantable plate, and e.g. the instructions for manufacturing, preferably by 3D printing, are also different in metaphyseal fracture cases, because important fracture fragments need to be supported and this can be different in every fracture case. Therefore the optimal screw position and direction needs to be determined based on the fracture pattern. This is not an issue in malunion cases, as the osteotomy cut is planned and controlled. The starting point in these metaphyseal fractures is therefore multiple bone fragments. Malunited and fractured bones require a completely different approach.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0087">The steps will now be outlined and discussed in more detail.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Step 1: Providing a 3D Representation of a Bone Structure in a Zone Around a Joint Fracture</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0088">In a preferred embodiment, step 1 comprises the steps of<ul id="ul0025" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0025-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0026" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0026-0001" num="0089">a) providing medical images of the bone structure of a zone around a fracture, and</li>        <li id="ul0026-0002" num="0090">b) reconstructing a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the bone structure around the joint fracture on the basis of said medical images.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0049" num="0091">Medical images hereby are preferably obtained using X-ray photography or X-ray tomography, more preferably using a CT scan.

Existing image segmentation solutions often lack accuracy when segmenting internal trabecular and cancellous bone tissues from adjacent soft tissues having similar appearance and often merge regions associated with distinct fragments. These issues create problems in downstream visualization and pre-operative planning applications and impede the development of advanced image-based analysis methods such as virtual fracture reconstruction. The proposed segmentation algorithm uses a probability-based variation of the watershed transform, referred to as the Probabilistic Watershed Transform (PWT). The PWT uses a set of probability distributions, one for each bone fragment, that model the likelihood that a given pixel is a measurement from one of the bone fragments. The likelihood distributions proposed improve upon known shortcomings in competing segmentation methods for bone fragments within CT images. A quantitative evaluation of the bone segmentation results is provided that compare our segmentation results with several leading competing methods as well as human-generated segmentations. Note that this paper relates generally to bone fragments and not particularly to bone fragments of a fractured joint. It is the present inventor's insight that this technique may nevertheless be used in a preferred embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0100">In a preferred embodiment, at least two bone fragments are identified, More preferably, at least three bone fragments are identified, such as 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 bone fragments. As the fracture of a joint can be very intricate, it is important to identify as much bone fragments as possible, preferably all bone fragments in the zone around the joint fracture.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Step 3: Simulating a Reduction of Said Bone Fragments Into a Full Joint</heading><p id="p-0059" num="0101">Reduction is a procedure to realign the bone fragments of a fracture. When a bone fractures, the fragments lose their alignment in the form of displacement or angulation. For the fractured bone to heal without any deformity the bony fragments must be re-aligned to their normal anatomical position. Orthopaedic surgery attempts to recreate the normal anatomy of the fractured bone by reduction of the displacement. In the present invention, the reduction of the bones of the fractured joint is first simulated. Simulation of the reduction prior to the actual reduction allows the surgeon to better prepare the operation. Additionally, in the present invention, the simulation allows to compute the parameters for the implantable plate.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0102">An exemplary way of 3D bone fragment reduction is provided in &#x201c;Virtual 3D bone fracture reconstruction via inter-fragmentary surface alignment&#x201d;, Beibei Zhou et al., Published in: 2009 IEEE 12th International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops, ICCV Workshops. This paper presents a system for virtual reconstruction of comminuted bone fractures. The system takes as input a collection of bone fragment models represented as surface meshes, typically segmented from CT data. Users interact with fragment models in a virtual environment to reconstruct the fracture. In contrast to other approaches that are either completely automatic or completely interactive, the system attempts to strike a balance between interaction and automation. There are two key fracture reconstruction interactions: (1) specifying matching surface regions between fragment pairs and (2) initiating pairwise and global fragment alignment optimizations. Each match includes two fragment surface patches hypothesized to correspond in the reconstruction. Each alignment optimization initialized by the user triggers a 3D surface registration which takes as input: (1) the specified matches and (2) the current position of the fragments. The proposed system leverages domain knowledge via user interaction, and incorporates recent advancements in surface registration, to generate fragment reconstructions that are more accurate than manual methods and more reliable than completely automatic methods.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0103">The method of the prior art discussed here, however, is not particularly related to joint fractures, and furthermore relates to a reduction step which is partially manual and partially automated. One main shortcoming of this method is that the technique relies heavily on the surgeon's experience and abilities to obtain a good reduction simulation. And even if the surgeon is experienced and very capable, good reductions remain difficult. The present inventor therefore has found that the quality of the reduction simulation can be drastically improved, and fully or nearly fully automated, if the reduction is simulated by fitting said bone fragments to a 3D representation of a healthy joint of said patient.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0104">Hereby, the 3D representation of a healthy joint of said patient can be obtained via a number of ways.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0105">Firstly, one could have such 3D representation of medical images allowing to reconstruct such 3D representation of the healthy joint of the patient already from a previous medical check-up. This may be the preferred option, if available.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0106">If not available, the 3D representation of the healthy joint of the patient can preferably be based on medical images of the contralateral joint to the fractured joint. Contralateral joints have been found to coincide with each other's mirror reverse by up to 98% or more.

The common feature shared by these technologies is the ability to produce freeform, complex geometry components directly from a computer generated model. SFF processes generally rely on the concept of layerwise material addition in selected regions. A computer generated model serves as the basis for making a replica. The model is mathematically sliced and each slice is recreated in the material of choice to build a complete object. A typical SFF machine can be likened to a miniaturized &#x201c;manufacturing plant&#x201d; representing the convergence of mechanical, chemical, electrical, materials and computer engineering sciences. Patient-specific and/or patient-engineered implants can be produced using 3-dimensional printing technology (also known as Solid Freeform Fabrication or &#x201c;SFF&#x201d;) to create solid, physical implant components from an electronic or computerized data file (e.g., a CAD file or STL file). 3D printing techniques such as Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), EBM (Electron Beam Melting) and Selective Laser Melting (SLM&#x2014;also known as Direct Metal Laser Sintering&#x2014;DMLS&#x2014;or LaserCusing) can allow the creation of durable metallic objects that are biocompatible and can directly serve as implant components.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0150">As the surgeon still needs to check the resulting implantable plate, step 5 preferably comprises the step of manually altering the instructions.

As the joint is fractured and the bone fragments need to be reduced in vivo, it is helpful for the surgeon to have a guide device in which the bone fragments fit correctly, i.e. the guide device is made to fit closely onto one or more bone fragments and the surgeon can thus easily position the guide device onto said one or more bone fragments. Once fitted onto the bone fragment, the guiding device shows the positions for the fixation screws, e.g. for shaft screws, and thereby allows the surgeon the correctly pre-drill holes in the one or more bone fragments. Hence, the guide device may preferably be provided with indications for the positions and/or orientations of one or more screw holes. This allows the surgeon to pre-drill holes onto the bone fragments, resulting in better positioning and better fixation of the implantable plate to the intact part of the bone and/or the reduced bone fragments.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0153">The computer program product for 3D printing a positioning guide device can be obtained by the following steps:<ul id="ul0043" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0043-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0044" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0044-0001" num="0154">i) providing a 3D representation of a bone structure in a zone around a joint fracture;</li>        <li id="ul0044-0002" num="0155">ii) identifying different bone fragments within said 3D representation;</li>        <li id="ul0044-0003" num="0156">iii) simulating a reduction of said bone fragments into a full joint;</li>        <li id="ul0044-0004" num="0157">iv) calculating optimal parameter values for an positioning guide device;</li>        <li id="ul0044-0005" num="0158">v) composing instructions for 3D printing the positioning guide device on the basis of the calculated parameter values,<br/>whereby in step 3, the reduction is simulated by fitting said bone fragments to a 3D representation of a healthy joint of said patient.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0087" num="0159">Clearly, the steps i-iii needed to obtain the computer program product for 3D printing a positioning guide device are the same as the steps 1-3 to obtain the computer program product for 3D printing the implantable plate according to the invention, and steps iv-v are very similar to steps 4-5.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0160">As such, the present invention also concerns a computer program product which combines the computer program product for 3D printing a positioning guide device and the computer program product for 3D printing an implantable plate, whereby steps 1-5 and iv-v are performed.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0161">In a preferred embodiment, the computer program products for the plate, for the guide device or for both, will comprise an STL file.

The distal radius fractures is fixated using one of the plates and locking screws by an experienced surgeon. Four weeks after surgery, displaced fragments are observed in X-ray images.

Accordingly, if the proximal shaft end comprises a triangular shape, said proximal shaft end is oriented with a tip of the triangle at the outer longitudinal extremity.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0184">The implantable plate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is similar to the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The main difference lies in the shape of the proximal shaft end, which in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is not of a triangular shape, and in the location of the three screw holes. Hence, in another preferred embodiment of the implantable plate according to the present invention and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the proximal shaft end comprises three, and preferably not more than three, screw holes (<b>44</b>,<b>45</b>,<b>46</b>). The three screw holes are preferably located in a triangle-setup. Hereby, preferably the three screw holes are located in the triangle-setup with a tip of the triangle oriented towards the shaft (<b>32</b>). Such implantable plate may be preferred as it can be fixated better and more stably onto the bone shaft. In this preferred embodiment, the proximal shaft end (<b>43</b>) may preferably comprise a shape comprising an essentially constant width along the longitudinal direction (L).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0185">In particularly preferred embodiments of implantable plates according to the present invention, screw holes comprise non-parallel screw directions. The screw direction relates to the direction in which the screw moves when it is inserted through the screw hole, and can be at least partially determined by the direction of the screw hole through the implantable plate. Preferably, in the present invention, the screw direction of a screw hole, and more preferably of all screw holes, is determined up to an angle of less than 7&#xb0;, more preferably less than 6&#xb0;, still more preferably of less than 5&#xb0;. Note that the prior art allows the screw direction to vary over larger angles than this because larger angle variation allows the surgeon more possibility to adapt the screw direction during the actual surgery. However, larger variability in screw direction tends to lead to worse fixation. In the present invention, however, the pre-operative planning is performed much better than in the prior art, and thereby allows to keep the variation in screw direction small. As the surgeon tends to prefer or even require to have some possibility to vary the screw direction during the actual surgery, in a preferred embodiment, the screw direction of a screw hole, and more preferably of all screw holes, is determined to an angle of more than 1&#xb0;; preferably more than 2&#xb0;, such as 3&#xb0;, 4&#xb0; or 5&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0186">In an embodiment, at least two screw holes may comprise a parallel screw direction.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0187">An embodiment wherein the screw directions are non-parallel is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>B and <b>6</b>C</figref>, which also show the screws along the different screw directions (<b>51</b>,<b>52</b>,<b>53</b>). Hereby, the screw directions (<b>52</b>) and (<b>53</b>) may seem parallel in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, but are clearly non-parallel in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> which shows the same plate as <b>6</b>B from a different viewpoint. Note, however, that the feature of non-parallel screw directions is not limited to the embodiment illustrated in these figures, but can be applied more generally to the implantable plates of the present invention. Non-parallel screw directions are preferred over parallel screw directions because this limits the risk of the implantable plate loosening due to pulling forces in the direction of the screws.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0188">The plate templates and the type of implantable plates illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> are preferably used for healing wrist fractures.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0189">Although not shown in the figure, the widened end (<b>31</b>) preferably comprise one or two screw holes. If the widened end comprises two screw holes, the two screw holes are preferably located near opposite transversal ends, i.e. one screw holes near a left transversal end (<b>40</b>) and the other screw hole near a right transversal end (<b>42</b>).</p><p id="p-0107" num="0190">One more aspect of the present invention relates to a medical kit comprising the implantable plate according to the present invention, and a fixation system. Said fixation system preferably comprises a set of screws. Hereby the screws of the set are preferably selected taking into account the number of screw holes in the implantable plate.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0191">In a preferred embodiment, the set of screws comprises one or more compression screws. A compression screw allows to compress bone fragments towards each other and thus can be used to obtain a better fixation than non-compression screws. Hereto, a compression screw preferably comprises a screw component and a counter-screw component, whereby the counter-screw component can be screwed over or into an insertion end of the screw component. Typically, the screw component can be inserted with an insertion end through a first opening of a hole, e.g. a drill hole, through one or more bone fragments, and the counter screw component can be attached to the insertion end of the screw component at or via a second opening of the hole, e.g. the drill hole, through the one or more bone fragments. The screw component and the counter-screw component can be screwed together with a larger force, but also with a more controllable force than is possible for non-compression screws. Prior art techniques typically do not make use of compression screws because:<ul id="ul0049" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0049-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0050" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0050-0001" num="0192">the effects of the compression cannot always be well controlled. For instance, the use of compression screws may lead to tangential forces along a fracture surface between two bone fragments, which in turn could lead to undesired friction and even further fracture. Such tangential forces typically arise if the screw direction deviates too much from the optimal screw direction which preferably fixates the plate, a bone and/or one or more bone fragments perpendicular to one another,</li>        <li id="ul0050-0002" num="0193">it is not always possible to predict where the insertion end of the screw component will be located. In current practice, a screw is inserted during surgery into the bones or bone fragments in a screw direction which can somewhat vary. As indicated above, this variation in screw direction may be quite large, e.g. typically up to 15&#xb0;. Hence, it is not always clear where the insertion end of the screw will be located. Hence, it is also not easy to plan how to attach the counter-screw component to the screw component. Typically, one needs to make another incision, or one needs to perform a completely open surgery, to be able to reach opposite sides of the bone and bone fragments. Clearly, surgeons try to avoid any unnecessary incisions or completely open surgery if possible.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0109" num="0194">Therefore, the use of compression screws is usually avoided in joint fracture surgery.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0195">However, the present invention allows better advance planning of the surgery, and allows to better control the position of the insertion end of a screw component of a compression screw. Hence, a second incision to allow the counter-screw component to be attached to the screw component, may be kept very small.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0196">In a preferred embodiment, the compression screw comprises or is accompanied with a washer. A washer allows the force acting onto the surface of a bone fragment to be better spread out. Preferably the washer is a tiltable washer. A tiltable washer allows a counter-screw component to be attached onto a screw component with an even spreading of the force over the surface of the washer, even if the counter-screw component needs to be attached onto the screw component in a direction which is non-perpendicular to the surface of the bone or bone fragment. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a number of tiltable washers of different shapes (<b>57</b>, <b>58</b>, <b>59</b>) connected at an insertion end (<b>56</b>) of a screw component (<b>61</b>). The different shapes, e.g. circular (<b>57</b>), square (<b>58</b>), pentagonal (<b>59</b>) may be selected in function of the contact surface of the bone or bone fragment adjacent to the washer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows a different view of the treated joint fracture of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>. One can see the implantable plate (<b>60</b>) and one screw component (<b>61</b>) inserted with an insertion end (<b>56</b>) through a screw hole in the plate and through a set of bone fragments. At the side of the joint opposite of the implantable plate (<b>60</b>), the tiltable washer (<b>58</b>) allows a counter-screw component (not shown) to be attached to the insertion end (<b>56</b>) even if, as shown, the insertion end of the screw component does not protrude perpendicularly out of the bone fragment's surface. Note that the washer, preferably the tiltable washer, is preferably selected to fit the compression screw, in particular if the screw is directed in the intended orientation of the compression screw as determined by the method of the present invention. The present invention allows to obtain information on the optimal orientation of the screws and thus allows upfront selection of the best screw, counterscrew, and washer with respect to size and orientation.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0197">The use of a washer may allow to firmly attach the implantable plate without using a counter-plate on an opposite side of the fractured joint.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
