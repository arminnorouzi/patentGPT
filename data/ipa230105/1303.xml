In some embodiments, users that are distant in the first environment are brought closer together by switching to the virtual reality environment.</p><p id="p-0418" num="0417">In embodiments with more than one user in the first three dimensional environment, a user can view the characters controlled by other users in the three dimensional environment. When a user enters the virtual reality environment by performing the interaction process with the virtual reality object, an idling mode is triggered to provide feedback to other users that the character is in the virtual reality environment. In some embodiments, the idling mode the computer resource of other resources perform an idling animation on the idling character thereby to provide natural character behaviour for other users.</p><p id="p-0419" num="0418">The idling animation may include shuffling feet or whistling. The idling animation may include sitting or lying down, or any other suitable movement where the character remains substantially stationary.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0419">It will be understood that idling animations may be used during other in-game actions, for example, when a viewer has switched to inspection mode to inspect a virtual object for purchase, or a user is viewing a video panel or viewing a video display area.</p><p id="p-0421" num="0420">In some embodiments, the first environment is provided at a first computing resource and the second environment is provided at a second computing resource. As a first non-limiting example the first environment is hosted at a first game server (of a first shared further computing resource) and the virtual reality environment is hosted as a second game server (of a second shared further computing resource).</p><p id="p-0422" num="0421">In the described embodiments, the user is able to switch from a first computer generated environment to a second computer generated environment, the virtual reality environment where the first environment and the second environment are visually distinctive. It will be understood that in some embodiments, the second environment is based on the first environment, for example, the first and second environments may have common structural elements, for example, buildings or walls. The first and second environments may have common objects provided.</p><p id="p-0423" num="0422">In some embodiments, the second environment is substantially the same as the first environment except for the presence or absence of structural elements and/or the presence or absence of virtual objects. In some embodiments, the second environment is substantially the same as the first environment, except for augmented reality features. The augmented reality features may be provided in the second environment such that they are visible only a subset, for example, one or more users in the second environment.</p><p id="p-0424" num="0423">In some embodiments, the two computer generated environments (the virtual reality environment and the first computer generated environment) comprise substantially different sets of objects including structural elements and interactive objects.
