Through such an isolation deployment, mutual interference between the electronic parts and/or the electrical structures can be minimized and increase design efficiency. efficiently.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some conductive structures disposed in an electronic device may be electrically connected to a nearby substrate through an electrical connection member. If a distance between the conductive structures and the substrate is relatively large, in the state in which the conductive member has been electrically fixed to a flexible substrate (e.g., a flexible RF cable (FRC) or a flexible printed circuit board (FPCB)), the conductive structures may be electrically connected for operation. For example, at least some conductive structures electrically connected to the substrate may be used as an antenna radiator for communication through at least one wireless communication circuitry disposed in the substrate or may be used for a ground. The electrical connection member may be formed in a metal plate shape, and may be electrically connected in a way to be clamped to the conductive structures through a clamping member, such as a screw.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The electrical connection member may be equipped with a tension structure for preventing loosening after being clamped by a screw. When implementing such a tension structure, the electrical connection member may be deformed when being clamped by the screw.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, if the electrical connection member has one end fixed to the flexible substrate and the other end clamped to the conductive structures through a screw, deformation caused by a clamping force of the screw or the tension structure of the electrical connection member is delivered to the flexible substrate as a stress concentration phenomenon. As a result, the electrical connection member may be disconnected from the flexible substrate. Furthermore, a phenomenon in which the tension structure is not accurately clamped at corresponding locations of the conductive structures may occur because the tension structure generates deformation of the electrical connection member during screw clamping. Accordingly, there is a need to address these drawbacks.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Certain embodiments of the present disclosure may provide an electronic device including an electrical connection member having an improved clamping property.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, an object to be solved in the present disclosure is not limited to the aforementioned object, and may be variously extended without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to certain embodiments, an electronic device may include a housing, a first substrate disposed in an internal space of the housing, a conductive structure disposed at a location isolated from the first substrate, a second substrate electrically connected to the conductive structure and the first substrate, and an electrical connection member electrically connecting the second substrate to the conductive structure. The electrical connection member may include a first fixing portion fixed to the conductive structure, a second fixing portion fixed to the second substrate, and a connection portion connecting the first fixing portion and the second fixing portion. The first fixing portion may include a first bent portion extending from a neck portion that is, a boundary area of the connection portion and bent along a first bent line, and a second bent portion bent along a second bent line from the first bent portion. The first bent portion may be bent in a first direction and dispose at a distance from the conductive structure. The second bent portion may be bent in a second direction which is opposite to the first direction.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It would be readily apparent that the electrical connection member according to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, as explained hereinafter, can help to reduce a stress concentration phenomenon on a flexible substrate attributable to deformation during a clamping operation and also improve clamping reliability because the fixing portion clamped to the conductive structure has an inverse &#x201c;V&#x201d; shape twice bent in an opposite direction at a designated location, thereby being stably supported by the conductive structure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In relation to the description of the drawings, the same or similar reference numerals may be used with respect to the same or similar constituent elements, in which in which:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of the front of an electronic device (e.g., a mobile electronic device) according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of the rear of the electronic device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the electronic device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is a construction diagram of a part of the electronic device according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is an expanded perspective view of an area <b>4</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of a flexible substrate including an electrical connection member according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is a plan view and side view of the electrical connection member according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a part of the electronic device which is viewed along line <b>6</b><i>b</i>-<b>6</b><i>b </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a process of the electrical connection member being clamped to a conductive structure according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a graph comparing relations between repulsive forces of the electrical connection member according to screw clamping operations according to certain embodiments of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view showing a front surface of a mobile electronic device according to an embodiment of the disclosure, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view showing a rear surface of the mobile electronic device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, a mobile electronic device <b>100</b> may include a housing <b>110</b> that includes a first surface (or front surface) <b>110</b>A, a second surface (or rear surface) <b>110</b>B, and a lateral surface <b>110</b>C that surrounds a space between the first surface <b>110</b>A and the second surface <b>110</b>B.

In contrast, in the first fixing portion <b>521</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, as deformation timing (an area <b>804</b>) is relatively advanced or earlier, a repulsive force may occur (a graph <b>803</b>) while the screw is being clamped (e.g., when the screw is clamped by half). As the deformation start section of the first fixing portion <b>521</b> is advanced during the screw clamping operation, a repulsive force is relatively increased in the same section which in turn help to improve clamping reliability.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, although the screw S is clamped (a loose insertion) to some extent without being fully clamped, the first fixing portion <b>521</b> may be electrically connected to the conductive member <b>4211</b> through a repulsive force that has previously occurred, thereby helping to improve mass-production stability. Furthermore, it is apparent that the repulsive force of the first fixing portion <b>521</b> according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure occurs earlier than the repulsive force of the conventional fixing portion until the screw clamping is completed.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to certain embodiments, an electronic device (e.g., the electronic device <b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) may include a housing (e.g., the housing <b>410</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), a first substrate (e.g., the substrate <b>430</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) disposed in an internal space (e.g., the internal space <b>4001</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) of the housing, a conductive structure (e.g., the conductive portion <b>4211</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) disposed at a location isolated from the first substrate, a second substrate (e.g., the flexible substrate <b>510</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) electrically connecting the conductive structure and the first substrate, and an electrical connection member (e.g., the electrical connection member <b>520</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) electrically connecting the second substrate to the conductive structure.
