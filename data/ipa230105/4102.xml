INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus which forms an image on a recording material by electrophotography.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, an electrophotographic image forming apparatus (hereinafter simply as the &#x201c;image forming apparatus&#x201d;) requires toner refilling and maintenance of various processing unit. In order to facilitate such toner refilling or maintenance, there is a commercially available cartridge including for example a photosensitive drum, charging unit, developing unit, and cleaning unit combined together in a frame, so that the cartridge is detachably mounted to the main body of the image forming apparatus. The cartridge type image forming apparatus has a detecting mechanism for detecting insertion of a cartridge such as a process cartridge. This prevents unwanted jam when printing operation is carried out without inserting a cartridge. The mechanism is referred to as a cartridge presence/absence detecting mechanism. In other words, the image forming apparatus does not operate when the cartridge presence/absence detecting mechanism detects &#x201c;cartridge absence,&#x201d; and the image forming apparatus is allowed to operate when &#x201c;cartridge presence&#x201d; is detected.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2002-323822, the image forming apparatus may be provided with a shutter member at the entrance of a fixing apparatus. This is for the purpose of protecting a user and keeping the user from touching a heat-generating portion for example during jam processing. Hereinafter, the shutter member will be referred to as the &#x201c;fixing entrance shutter.&#x201d; Examples of known mechanisms for driving the fixing entrance shutter include the mechanism operating in a manner in conjunction with opening/closing of the door as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2002-323822 and the mechanism operating in a manner in conjunction with insertion/removal of the cartridge as disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2019-95643. These mechanisms are selected as appropriate depending on the structure of the apparatus main body or the structure of the cartridge.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since the driving mechanism for the fixing entrance shutter and the cartridge presence/absence detecting mechanism are directed to different purposes, these mechanisms are individually provided as independent mechanisms from each other.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As described above, the cartridge presence/absence detecting mechanism and the mechanism for activating the fixing entrance shutter are separately provided in a conventional apparatus. In addition, the mechanisms each require an interface part which operates under direct influence of opening/closing operation of the door or the insertion/removal of the cartridge as a trigger for operation in conjunction with each other. This requires a large amount of space, which increases the size of the main body. Furthermore, the number of components for each mechanism increases, which increases the cost.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the present invention to allow a shutter driving mechanism and a cartridge presence/absence detecting mechanism in an image forming apparatus to operate in a manner in conjunction with each other less costly and in a reduced space.</p><p id="p-0008"

The interface member <b>120</b> moves substantially linearly (linearly move), while the cartridge presence/absence detecting lever <b>130</b> pivots (rotational move). In order to operate in conjunction with these two components, the engagement groove <b>123</b> according to the embodiment has a gap substantially orthogonal to the direction in which the cartridge B inserted (the mounting direction).

More specifically, the sensor link member <b>131</b>, which pivots in a manner in conjunction with the cartridge presence/absence detecting lever <b>130</b>, stops when the sensor link-side abutting portion <b>136</b> and the paper width detecting lever-side abutting portion <b>152</b> come into abutment. Therefore, there is a gap between the lever-side abutting portion <b>135</b> and the sensor link-side abutting portion <b>136</b>. At the time, the light-shielding portion <b>132</b> of the sensor link member <b>131</b> is in a position where the optical axis (not shown) of the photo-interrupter <b>133</b> attains a light-shielding state.

When the tip end of the sheet PA contacts the paper width detecting portion <b>153</b>, the paper width detecting portion <b>153</b> (contact portion) is pushed by the sheet PA, and the paper width detecting lever <b>150</b> pivots. The rotation of the paper width detecting lever <b>150</b> causes the paper width detecting lever-side abutting portion <b>152</b> to pivot. Here, since the sensor link member <b>131</b> is biased in the direction of the arrow R<b>2</b> by the biasing member which is not shown, the paper width detecting lever-side abutting portion <b>152</b> and the sensor link-side abutting portion <b>136</b> kept in abutment state. This causes the sensor link member <b>131</b> to pivot, and when the rotation of the paper width detecting lever <b>150</b> by the sheet PA exceeds a certain amount, the light-shielding portion <b>132</b> of the sensor link member <b>131</b> comes in a position (third position) where the optical axis (not shown) attains a transmission state. In this way, it can be determined that the sheet PA is larger than the prescribed size. That is, the sensor link member <b>131</b> is configured to move from the second position to the third position when the sensor link member <b>131</b> is pushed by the recording material whose width in the conveying direction of the recording material is equal to or larger than a predetermined width.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0105">Thereafter, when the rear end of the sheet PA exits the paper width detecting portion <b>153</b>, the paper width detecting lever <b>150</b> returns to the state in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>. When the sheet PA is smaller than the prescribed size (when width is narrower than the predetermined width), the paper width detecting portion <b>153</b> and the sheet PA do not come into abutment against each other. Therefore, the paper width detecting lever <b>150</b> does not pivot, and the optical axis of the photo-interrupter <b>133</b> (not shown) is kept in the light-shielding state.

More specifically, in the cartridge presence/absence detecting mechanism, when the photo-interrupter <b>133</b> changes from the light-shielding state to the transmission state (when the cartridge B is removed), the direction of rotation of the light-shielding portion <b>132</b> is one rotation direction. In the paper width detecting mechanism, when the photo-interrupter <b>133</b> changes from the light-shielding state to the transmission state (when the passage of a recording material is detected), the direction of rotation of the light-shielding portion <b>132</b> is the other direction, which is the opposite of the above-mentioned direction. From a different point of view, in the flow of events from mounting of the cartridge B in the apparatus main body A to detection of the width for conveying the recording material, the direction in which the light-shielding portion <b>132</b> rotates with respect to the photo-interrupter <b>133</b> is one direction (the other rotation direction). Similarly, the direction in which the light-shielding portion <b>132</b> rotates with respect to the photo-interrupter <b>133</b> is one direction (one rotation direction) in the flow of events until when the passage of the recording material is no longer detected and the cartridge B is removed from the apparatus main body A.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0108">Next, the fixing entrance shutter mechanism will be described. As described above, the interface member <b>120</b> has a sliding surface <b>124</b> including a slope. In other words, when the interface member <b>120</b> moves in the insertion direction of the cartridge B, the sliding surface <b>124</b> also moves in the insertion direction of the cartridge B. The sliding surface abutting portion <b>143</b> of the shutter link member <b>142</b> is constantly in abutment against the sliding surface <b>124</b> and can move linearly only in the vertical direction (the z-axis direction) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>, and therefore the sliding surface abutting portion <b>143</b> moves upward as the sliding surface <b>124</b> moves. In other words, the slope of the sliding surface <b>124</b> functions as a cam surface. As a result, the shutter push-up portion <b>144</b> also moves upward. That is, a rotation direction of the sensor link member <b>131</b> from the second position to the third position is opposite to a rotation direction of the link sensor member <b>131</b> from the second position to the first position.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0109">Here, the operation of the interface member <b>120</b>, the shutter link member <b>142</b>, and the fixing entrance shutter when the cartridge B is inserted in the embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B, and <b>16</b>C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A, <b>16</b>B and <b>16</b>C</figref> are views of the apparatus main body A from the left side (the non-driving side), and parts irrelevant to the present invention, such as the conveying guide <b>91</b> are not shown in order to make the parts related to the present invention visible.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref> shows the state at the moment the cartridge-side protruding portion <b>102</b> of the cartridge B and the main body side abutting portion <b>122</b> come into contact (abutment).

In the embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B</figref>, the contact between the shutter push-up portion <b>144</b> and the shutter side abutting portion <b>145</b> is switched from the tip end to the base portion during the movement of the interface member <b>120</b>. In other words, the fixing entrance shutter <b>140</b> is configured so that the distance from the center of the rotation axis to the shutter side abutting portion <b>145</b> as the abutted portion against which the shutter push-up portion <b>144</b> abuts changes with rotation and is reduced with rotation during the movement from the closed state to the open state. This is for the purpose of further reducing the size of the apparatus main body A by reducing the moving amount of the interface member <b>120</b> and the moving amount of the shutter link member <b>142</b>. For example, when the distance from the center of the rotation axis to the shutter side abutting portion <b>145</b> is constant, the moving amount of the interface member <b>120</b> must be set longer than that in the embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>C</figref> shows the state in which the cartridge B has been completely inserted. In the state, the sliding surface abutting portion <b>143</b> of the shutter link member <b>142</b> has reached the uppermost, flat portion of the sliding surface <b>124</b> of the interface member <b>120</b>. In other words, the shutter push-up portion <b>144</b> is at the uppermost portion, and the base side of the shutter side abutting portion <b>145</b> is lifted to the uppermost position. At the time, the fixing entrance shutter <b>140</b> is in a completely open state.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0111">As described above, the manner of switching the contact between the shutter push-up portion <b>144</b> and the shutter side abutting portion <b>145</b> in the embodiment is for the purpose of further reducing the size of the apparatus main body A. Therefore, when there is a sufficient space for the interface member <b>120</b> and the shutter link member <b>142</b> to operate, or when the shutter push-up portion <b>144</b> of the shutter link member <b>142</b> can be raised to a sufficient level to contact the tip end side of the shutter side abutting portion <b>145</b> of the fixing entrance shutter <b>140</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>C</figref>, such switching of the contact is not necessary.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0112">As in the foregoing, by operating in conjunction with the cartridge presence/absence detecting mechanism and the fixing entrance shutter mechanism by the single interface member, the space can be saved and the number of components can be reduced, so that the cost can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0113">According to the embodiment, the interface member <b>120</b> moves linearly, the cartridge presence/absence detecting mechanism is a link mechanism capable of linear and pivoting movement using an engagement groove, and the fixing entrance shutter mechanism is a link mechanism using a sliding surface.

When the signal from the photo-interrupter <b>216</b> which is detected for the first time corresponds to a &#x201c;transmission (ON)&#x201d; state, then the sensor flag <b>212</b> is the state in (3), i.e., either in the detection position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref>) or in the paper passing position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>B</figref>).

When the opening/closing door is opened in response to an instruction for example from the display of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>, the operator can visually check whether the cartridge B is present, and when the cartridge B is inserted but preparation for printing is not yet complete, the operator can immediately determine that the sheet PA is still in the apparatus.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0163">When the state of the signal from the photo-interrupter <b>216</b> is checked in (2) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, and if the signal is in a &#x201c;light shielding (OFF)&#x201d; state, the sensor flag <b>212</b> is in the standby position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>A</figref>), which is the state (4). This is limited to the situation where the first lever <b>210</b> and the second lever <b>211</b> are in the standby position and the third lever <b>217</b> is rotated from the detection position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref>) to the standby position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0161" num="0164">Therefore, it can be determined that the cartridge B is inserted in the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> and that the sheet PA remaining in the apparatus is at least not in the range of the rotation trajectory of the first lever <b>210</b> and the second lever <b>211</b>. In this situation, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> determines for the first time that printing preparation (preparation for image forming operation) has been completed. After the state (4), when printing starts and the sheet PA reaches the conveyance path P<b>1</b>, the state of the signal from the photo-interrupter <b>216</b> is checked again. At the time, when the signal from the photo-interrupter <b>216</b> remains in the &#x201c;light shielding (OFF)&#x201d; state even though a sufficient time period has passed for the sheet PA to reach the positions of the first and second levers <b>210</b> and <b>211</b>, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> determines that the passed sheet PA is a small-size sheet L<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0165">On the other hand, in (5), when the signal from the photo-interrupter <b>216</b> is in the &#x201c;transmission (ON)&#x201d; state, the first lever <b>210</b> and the second lever <b>211</b> contact the sheet PA and rotate, and the disengaged sensor flag <b>212</b> rotates to the paper-passing position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>B</figref>). Therefore, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> determines that the conveyed sheet PA is a large-size sheet L<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0166">According to the embodiment, the following advantages are provided in the sheet width and attachable/detachable unit presence/absence detecting mechanism in the image forming apparatus.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0167">In an image forming apparatus provided with a sheet width detecting mechanism and a photo-interrupter corresponding to the sheet width detection, a lever member is provided to detect the presence or absence of an attachable/detachable unit such as a toner cartridge that can be attached to or detached from the main body of the apparatus, and by operating the member in conjunction with the sheet width detecting mechanism, the presence or absence of the attachable/detachable unit can be detected without providing a new dedicated photo-interrupter. In this way, the configuration of the image forming apparatus can be simplified and the cost can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0168">According to the embodiment, it cannot be determined whether printing preparation is not complete in state (3) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> because the cartridge B is not inserted or because the sheet PA remains inside the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>. However, when the embodiment is combined with the signal state of another photo-interrupter provided for a different purpose, it can be determined which state the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> is in in the state (3).</p><p id="p-0166" num="0169">For example, many image forming apparatuses are provided with a sheet tip end detecting lever for detecting the tip end position of a sheet PA and a corresponding photo-interrupter in the range in which the first lever <b>210</b> and the second lever <b>211</b> are provided in the conveyance path P<b>1</b>. In the state in (3), when the signal from the photo-interrupter for detecting the tip end position of the sheet is a signal corresponding to the paper-passing position of the sheet tip end detecting lever, the sheet tip end detecting lever contacts the sheet PA to move, indicating that the lever is in the paper-passing position. Therefore, it can be determined that the signal from photo-interrupter <b>216</b> is in the &#x201c;transmission (ON)&#x201d; state, not because the cartridge B is not inserted, but because the sheet PA remains in the conveyance path P<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0170">Meanwhile, in the state (3), when the signal from the photo-interrupter for detecting the sheet tip end position is a signal corresponding to the standby position of the sheet tip end detecting lever, it is unlikely that there is any sheet PA remaining in the conveyance path P<b>1</b>, and it can be determined that the cartridge B is not inserted.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0171">According to the embodiment, the signal from the photo-interrupter <b>216</b> in the standby position as one position is in the &#x201c;light shielding (OFF)&#x201d; state and the signal from the photo-interrupter <b>216</b> in the paper passing position and detection position as the other position is in the &#x201c;transmission (ON)&#x201d; state, but the invention is not limited by this. When the shape of the light-shielding portion <b>212</b><i>c </i>of the sensor flag <b>212</b> is changed, the standby position as the other position may be set to correspond to the &#x201c;transmission (ON)&#x201d; state and the paper-threading position and the detection position to one position to the &#x201c;light-shielding (OFF)&#x201d; state.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0172">According to the embodiment, the cartridge B is used as an example of the attachable/detachable unit to be attached to and detached from the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>, and detection of the detached/attached state of the cartridge B has been described, but the attachable/detachable unit according to the present invention is not limited to the cartridge B. For example, the invention can be applied to detection of the insertion/withdrawal state of the sheet tray <b>4</b>, which is loaded with sheets PA and can be inserted to and removed from the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>. Furthermore, the invention can be applied to detection of any detection state other than the detection of the detached/attached state of the attachable/detachable unit. For example, the invention can be applied to detection of the open/closed state of a door member that can be opened and closed with respect to the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0170" num="0173">While the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed exemplary embodiments.
