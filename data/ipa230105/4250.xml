In addition, the presence or absence of a touch on the display panel and a touch position can be sensed based on the change in capacitance.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Meanwhile, since such a touch display device provides both a display function and a touch sensing function, electrodes, signal lines, and the like for display driving are disposed on the display panel.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, capacitance may be formed between the electrodes, the signal lines, and the like for display driving and a touch line to which a touch driving signal is applied. There is a problem in that such capacitance may cause noise on a touch sensing signal.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">One aspect of embodiments disclosed herein is to provide a touch display panel and a touch display device, which is capable of sensing a user's touch based on a change in capacitance and of reducing capacitance causing noise on a touch sensing signal, so that touch sensing performance can be enhanced.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, another aspect of embodiments disclosed herein is to provide a touch display panel and a touch display device, in which a structure capable of reducing capacitance causing noise on a touch sensing signal can be easily configured.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, an aspect of embodiments disclosed herein is to provide a touch display panel and a touch display device, in which noise of a touch sensing signal can be reduced such that touch sensing can be performed independently of display driving.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an aspect, embodiments disclosed herein provide a touch display device including: a plurality of touch electrodes embedded in a touch display panel and separated from each other; a touch line overlapping some of the plurality of touch electrodes and connected to one of the overlapped touch electrodes through at least one contact hole; a data line at least partially overlapping the touch line; and a shielding structure disposed between the touch line and the data line and electrically connected to the touch electrode connected to the touch line.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, embodiments disclosed herein provide a touch display panel including: a data line; a touch line disposed on the data line and applied with a touch driving signal; a touch electrode connected to the touch line; a shielding structure disposed between the data line and the touch line, the shielding structure being applied with a touch driving signal or a shielding signal corresponding to the touch driving signal; and a touch load reduction layer disposed between the touch line and the shielding structure.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect, embodiments disclosed herein provide a touch display panel including: a data line; at least one first insulating layer disposed on the data line; a touch electrode disposed on the first insulating layer and partially overlapping the data line; a second insulating layer disposed on the touch electrode; and a touch line disposed on the second insulating layer, and overlapping the data line and the touch electrode.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the embodiments of the present disclosure, by arranging a shielding structure in a region where a touch line and a data line overlap each other, it is possible to prevent direct capacitance from being formed between the touch line and the data line.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, by connecting the shielding structure to a touch electrode that forms relatively large capacitance, it is possible to prevent capacitance formed between the shielding structure and the data line from affecting a touch sensing signal transmitted through the touch line.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Accordingly, it is possible to prevent capacitance formed between the data line and the touch line from causing interference that will be seen as noise on a touch sensing signal and thus improve touch sensing performance.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, by providing a structure in which the shielding structure is formed on the same layer as the touch electrode or the pixel electrode, it is easy to configure a structure for reducing noise on a touch sensing signal.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further, by disposing the touch load reduction layer between the shielding structure and the touch line, it is possible to reduce noise caused by capacitance between the touch line and the non-overlapped data line.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As described above, by removing the influence of display noise on a touch sensing signal, touch sensing can be performed independently of display driving.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The above and other aspects, features and advantages of the present disclosure will be more apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view illustrating a schematic configuration of a touch display device according to embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a view illustrating a concept of a shielding structure included in the touch display device according to the embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> are views each illustrating a first embodiment of a structure in which a shielding structure is disposed in the touch display device according to the embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref> are views each illustrating a second embodiment of a structure in which a shielding structure is disposed in the touch display device according to the embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref> are views each illustrating a third embodiment of a structure in which a shielding structure is disposed in the touch display device according to the embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> are views each illustrating a fourth embodiment of a structure in which a shielding structure is disposed in the touch display device according to the embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a view illustrating an example of a planar structure in which touch lines and shielding structures are arranged in a touch display device according to embodiments of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref> are views illustrating examples of cross-sectional structures of a portion B-B&#x2032;
