FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a watch comprising an optical filtering element.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNOLOGICAL BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A watch conventionally comprises a bracelet and a watch case in which a mechanical movement or even an electronic quartz movement is arranged. It is known that such movements are often very sensitive to temperature variations which can be the cause of many malfunctions as well as degradation of the preservation thereof. By way of example, an increase in temperature can cause an expansion of the materials constituting in particular the springs and the balance of a mechanical movement. Such an expansion then generates a modification of the stiffness of the spring and the inertia of the balance, which causes a change in the frequency of the mechanism. In this context, in order to avoid such malfunctions, it is known to use mechanisms for compensating for the effect of these temperature variations on the running of these movements which are not always very efficient.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is understood that there is a need to find a solution, in particular which does not have the drawbacks of the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To this end, the invention relates to a watch comprising a bracelet and a watch case including at least one electrical or electronic component, said watch comprising at least one Dewar device configured to enclose at least one of said electrical or electronic components, said at least one Dewar device including inner and outer walls and a vacuum or quasi-vacuum space defined between these called walls, the inner wall delimiting a volume in which said at least one electrical or electronic component is likely to be arranged, said watch comprising an optical filtering element defined in all or part of a particularly visible outer face of said case, said filtering element being capable of transmitting only the visible electromagnetic spectrum.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thanks to the presence in the watch case of at least one Dewar device which encapsulates the electrical or electronic components of the watch and of the filtering element, such components are protected from possible extreme temperatures outside which could be comprised between &#x2212;150 and +125 degrees Celsius. Such a watch configuration thus allows using standard electrical or electronic components in contexts and environments where the temperatures can be extreme, such as for example space or lunar missions. This thus allows rationalising the costs as well as maintaining a reasonable complexity for the components used in the watch for such missions. In addition, the presence in the watch case of such an optical filtering element, the amount of radiant or radiative energy likely to enter the watch is greatly limited. Thus, electrical or electronic components of the watch included in the case of this watch are protected from temperatures which would be likely to damage them.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In other embodiments of this watch:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0007">the optical filtering element is an interferometric filter;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0008">the interferometric filter comprises a grid or a lattice having a mesh whose dimensions are such that they only allow certain predetermined wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum to pass;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0009">the interferometric filter comprises a plasmonic filter;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0010">the Dewar device is formed in all or part by the watch case and encloses at least one of said electrical or electronic components;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0011">the Dewar device comprises the following parts of the watch case delimiting said volume: a middle, a crystal and a bottom;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0012">the middle and the bottom of the case form a one-piece part, said part defining an opening opposite to the bottom which is likely to be closed by the crystal of said watch in particular in a removable manner;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0013">the middle and the crystal of the watch case form a one-piece part, said part defining an opening opposite to the crystal which is likely to be closed by the bottom of said watch in particular in a removable manner;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0014">the Dewar device comprises two thin inner and outer walls nested one inside the other, the inner wall delimiting the volume inside which the or each electrical or electronic component is arranged, the outer wall which is arranged on the outer side of the watch, the vacuum or quasi-vacuum space separating the inner wall from the outer wall;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0015">said at least one electrical or electronic component is selected from the group consisting of: a display device, a processor, a memory, an energy storage component, a motor, an integrated circuit and an electronic oscillator.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0016">the watch is a quartz watch.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0017">Other features and advantages will emerge clearly from the description given below, by way of indication and without limitation, with reference to the appended figures, in which:</p><p id="p-0009" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic representation of a top view of a watch, a case of which comprises in particular an optical filtering element, according to one embodiment of the invention, and</p><p id="p-0010" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a sectional view along the axis II-II of the schematic representation of the watch of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, according to the embodiment of the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> represent a watch <b>2</b> comprising a bracelet <b>4</b> and a watch case <b>6</b>. Without this being limiting in the context of the present invention and for a better understanding of this invention, the watch herein is an electronic watch <b>2</b> such as a quartz watch.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0021">In this context, the watch case <b>6</b> then includes, in a conventional manner, at least one electrical or electronic component <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>g. </i>In a non-limiting and non-exhaustive manner, the watch case <b>6</b> includes seven electrical or electronic components <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>g </i>which constitute sensitive portions of this watch <b>2</b>. Of course, the watch case <b>6</b> can include more electrical or electronic components than those represented in these figures, or can only include a subset of components from the components <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>g. </i>In these variants, the watch case <b>6</b> thus includes for example a display device <b>8</b><i>a, </i>a processor <b>8</b><i>b, </i>a memory <b>8</b><i>c, </i>an energy storage component <b>8</b><i>d, </i>a motor <b>8</b><i>e, </i>an integrated circuit <b>8</b><i>f </i>and an electronic oscillator <b>8</b><i>g. </i></p><p id="p-0013" num="0022">This watch case <b>6</b> further includes an optical filtering element <b>22</b> defined in all or part of a particularly visible outer face of said case <b>6</b>, said filtering element being capable of transmitting only the visible electromagnetic spectrum. This optical filtering element <b>22</b> is preferably an interferometric filter. Such an interferometric filter is able to act as a shielding element relative to certain predetermined wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. The presence of such an interferometric filter allows advantageously limiting the amount of radiative energy entering the watchcase <b>6</b>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0023">Typically, this interferometric filter can be configured to allow only certain wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum to pass, for example the wavelengths located in the visible range comprised between 390 nm and 750 nm, otherwise called &#x201c;visible electromagnetic spectrum&#x201d;, and to reflect all other wavelengths of the spectrum, in particular the wavelengths relating to infrared or microwaves. The interferometric filter can be arranged in or on one or more opaque portions of the watch case <b>6</b>, or in or on one or more transparent or semi-transparent portions thereof. In the illustrative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the interferometric filter is arranged on the outer face of the watch case, namely a surface of an outer wall of the middle and an outer surface of the crystal of this watch case <b>6</b>. This interferometric filter can be a grid or a lattice forming a coating which is applied on the outer face of the watch case <b>6</b>. This grid or lattice has a mesh whose dimensions are such that they allow only certain predetermined wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, typically the wavelengths of the visible domain, to pass. This grid or lattice acts like a Faraday cage. Alternatively, which is not represented, the interferometric filter can be a plasmonic filter.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0024">In this watch <b>2</b>, this case <b>6</b> can comprise at least one Dewar device <b>10</b>. This Dewar device <b>10</b> has the same properties and features as a Dewar tube/vase well known in the state of the art. As will be seen later, the properties and features of this Dewar device <b>10</b> contribute to giving it a good thermal insulation with regard to temperatures which may prevail in the external environment in which it may be located. This device comprises a containment/encapsulation space which is herein a volume <b>14</b> defined inside this device <b>10</b> and which is provided to receive at least one of said electrical or electronic components <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>g </i>so that it is thermally isolated from the external environment. This volume <b>14</b> is also called containment/encapsulation volume <b>14</b>. Indeed, this Dewar device <b>10</b>, by thus encapsulating these electrical or electronic components <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>g </i>of the watch, participates in protecting said components <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>g </i>from any extreme temperatures present outside which may be comprised between &#x2212;150 and +125 degrees Celsius. In addition, it should be noted that such a configuration of the watch thus allows using standard electrical or electronic components in contexts and environments where the temperatures can be extreme, such as for example space or lunar missions. In addition, this configuration also allows rationalising the manufacturing costs of such a watch as well as maintaining a reasonable complexity for the components used in the watch for such missions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0025">In this watch <b>2</b>, the watch case <b>6</b> therefore comprises this called at least one Dewar device <b>10</b>. More specifically, the Dewar device <b>10</b> can be formed in all or part by the watch case <b>6</b>. Such a Dewar device <b>10</b> is preconfigured to enclose at least one of said electrical or electronic components <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>g. </i>In other words, this device <b>10</b> comprises the space <b>14</b> (or volume <b>14</b>) in which each component <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>g </i>can be arranged by being encapsulated in this space <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0026">In a first alternative of this watch <b>2</b> visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the Dewar device <b>10</b> can enclose all electrical or electronic components <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>g </i>of the watch <b>2</b>. In this context, this Dewar device <b>10</b> is then formed by parts of the watch case <b>6</b> such as the middle <b>20</b>, a crystal <b>18</b> and a bottom <b>19</b>. The assembly of these parts participates in producing the containment space <b>14</b>, or containment volume <b>14</b>, of this Dewar device <b>10</b> provided for the arrangement of the components <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>g. </i>These three parts, the middle <b>20</b>, the crystal <b>18</b> and the bottom <b>19</b> can be parts which are distinct and subsequently joined together to construct this encapsulation space <b>14</b> or encapsulation volume <b>14</b>. In an alternative manner, the middle <b>20</b> and the bottom <b>19</b> of the box can together form a one-piece part visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, said one-piece part defining an opening opposite to the bottom <b>19</b> which is likely to be closed by the crystal <b>18</b> and this, in a removable manner. In another alternative manner, the middle <b>20</b> and the crystal <b>18</b> of the watch case <b>6</b> can together form a one-piece part, said one-piece part defining an opening opposite to the crystal <b>18</b> which is likely to be closed by the bottom <b>19</b> and this, also in a removable manner. In these configurations, the space <b>14</b>, or volume <b>14</b> is formed between these three parts. In this first alternative visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, this Dewar device <b>10</b> includes the inner wall formed by internal walls of the crystal <b>18</b>, the bottom <b>19</b> and the middle <b>20</b>, and the outer wall <b>12</b><i>b </i>formed by external walls of this crystal <b>18</b>, this bottom <b>19</b> and this middle <b>20</b>. These inner and outer walls <b>12</b><i>a, </i><b>12</b><i>b </i>are separated by the vacuum or quasi-vacuum space <b>16</b>. Furthermore, this inner wall <b>12</b><i>a </i>delimits the volume <b>14</b> in which the electrical or electronic components <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>g </i>are likely to be arranged.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0027">In a second alternative of this watch <b>2</b>, which is not represented in the figures, the Dewar device <b>10</b> encloses at least one of the electrical or electronic components <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>g </i>of the watch. In this context, this Dewar device <b>10</b> is then formed by at least two parts which are capable of cooperating together by being assembled together to form this device <b>10</b>. Such parts comprise a part for partitioning the watch case <b>6</b> which may have a particular form in order to both:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0028">define by cooperating with at least one other part of the watch case <b>6</b>, a containment or encapsulation space <b>14</b> also called containment or encapsulation volume, which takes into account the volume likely to be occupied by the component(s) <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>g, </i>and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0029">be able to be assembled with at least one other part of the watch case <b>6</b>, such as all or part of the internal wall of the middle <b>20</b> of this case <b>6</b>, or all or part of the internal wall of the bottom <b>19</b> or even to the internal wall of this bottom <b>19</b> and this middle <b>20</b>.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0019" num="0030">In this second alternative, this Dewar device <b>10</b> has an inner wall <b>12</b><i>a </i>which is formed by an internal wall of at least one other part of the watch case <b>6</b> (the crystal <b>18</b>, the bottom <b>19</b> or the middle <b>20</b>) and an internal wall of the partitioning part, and the outer wall <b>12</b><i>b </i>is itself formed by an external wall of at least one other part (the crystal <b>18</b>, the bottom <b>19</b> or the middle <b>20</b>) and an external wall of the partitioning part. Also, in this alternative, these inner and outer walls <b>12</b><i>a, </i><b>12</b><i>b </i>are separated by the vacuum or quasi-vacuum space <b>16</b>. Furthermore, this inner wall <b>12</b><i>a </i>delimits the volume <b>14</b> in which the component(s) <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>g </i>is/are likely to be arranged.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0031">This Dewar device <b>10</b> of the watch case <b>6</b> typically comprises two thin inner and outer walls <b>12</b><i>a, </i><b>12</b><i>b </i>nested one inside the other.

An outer wall <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the device <b>10</b> which, according to the variants, can be arranged on the outer side of the watch <b>2</b>, or on the outer side of the watch <b>2</b> and within the enclosure of the watch case. This Dewar device <b>10</b> thus defines an empty or quasi-empty space <b>16</b> which separates the inner wall <b>12</b><i>a </i>from the outer wall <b>12</b><i>b. </i>It is clearly understood herein that this space <b>16</b> is hermetically sealed and that it is under vacuum or quasi-vacuum. These walls <b>12</b><i>a, </i><b>12</b><i>b </i>are preferably made in a non-limiting and non-exhaustive manner of a metal material, of glass or of thermosetting or thermoplastic polymer resins reinforced with carbon or glass fibres or even of ceramic materials.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0032">It will be noted that when the inner and outer walls <b>12</b><i>a, </i><b>12</b><i>b </i>are transparent or semi-transparent, for example by being made of glass, the outer surface of this inner wall <b>12</b><i>a </i>and the inner surface of this outer wall <b>12</b><i>b </i>can be coated with a reflective metal coating or the like, such as for example a silver layer.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0033">In this watch <b>2</b>, the crystal <b>18</b> of watch case <b>6</b> is formed of at least one transparent or semi-transparent window.

Thus, when the temperature outside the watch <b>2</b> reaches extreme values, typically in the range of &#x2212;125 to +125&#xb0; C., the temperature inside the encapsulation space <b>14</b> (or encapsulation volume <b>14</b>) remains for its part substantially equal to the temperature of the ambient medium in which the encapsulation has been performed, typically in the range of 20&#xb0; C. It is thus conceivable that such a configuration allows protecting the electrical or electronic components <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<b>8</b><i>g </i>of the watch <b>2</b>, and thus enabling their operation in extreme external temperature conditions.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0036">In this watch case <b>6</b> which comprises the Dewar device <b>10</b>, it will be noted that the optical filtering element <b>22</b> is defined in all or part of the outer face of the watch case <b>6</b> in particular in all or part of the visible face of said case <b>6</b>. This visible face comprises the parts of the watch case <b>6</b> which are likely to be exposed to an electromagnetic radiation in particular when the watch <b>2</b> is worn by the wearer.
