The traditional method is a furnace, ventilation, and air conditioning systems that have ductwork leading therefrom to the various rooms in a building. The ductwork in a residential building or home typically is arranged in a trunk and branch configuration. A plenum or trunk conveys air from an air handler of a HVAC system through various ducts and distribution boxes to smaller branch ducts that carry air to individual rooms of the home. Many ducts, particularly trunk ducts and plenums, are formed of sheet metal and are rigid. Rigid ducts can be made from a wide variety of materials, such as, for example, sheet metal, duct board, foam board, or any other suitably rigid material. Larger ducts and distribution boxes may be formed of duct board, a rigid insulating material formed of an insulation layer and a reinforcing layer. Branch ducts may be rigid sheet metal ducts or flexible ducts.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Flexible ducts are typically formed of a wire-reinforced core, an insulation layer, and an outer sheath. Typically, flex (flexible) ducts begin from a connector at a trunk duct, plenum, or rigid duct branch and terminate at duct boots that connect the ducts to air registers or vents arranged in the floor, walls, or ceiling of a room. Existing methods of connecting flexible ducts to rigid ducts made of stainless or galvanized steel or duct board include sheet metal screws, mastic, adhesive tape, and plastic ties. These methods may be used on their own or in concert to connect ducts together. Mastic is a non-hardening adhesive compound that may be used on its own or with a reinforcing material such as fiberglass mesh tape.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a need for a flex duct system that is easy to use, has a quick connect attachment at both ends of the flex duct that is securely yet releasably attachable thereto, saves the installer time, and is securely yet releasably attachable to duct boots.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, flex duct systems are disclosed that have a flex duct having a wire-reinforced core and first and second hollow connector ends threaded to one each of ends of the wire-reinforced core.
