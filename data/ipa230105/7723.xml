Those of ordinary skill in the art may recognize that with the evolution of the network architecture and the emergence of new service scenarios, the technical solutions provided by the examples of the present disclosure are also applicable to similar technical problems.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> which is a schematic structural diagram of a wireless communication system according to an example of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the wireless communication system is a communication system based on cellular mobile communication technology, and may include more than one terminals <b>110</b> and more than one base stations <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The terminals <b>110</b> may be devices providing at least one of voice and data connectivity to a user. The terminals <b>110</b> may communicate with one or more core networks via a Radio Access Network (RAN). The terminals <b>110</b> may be Internet of Things terminals, such as sensor devices, mobile phones (or &#x201c;cellular&#x201d; phones), and computers with Internet of Things terminals, such as fixed, portable, pocket, hand-held, computer built-in or vehicle-mounted devices. For example, the terminals <b>110</b> may be stations (STAs), subscriber units, subscriber stations, mobile stations, mobiles, remote stations, access points, remote terminals, access terminals, user terminals, user agents, user devices, or user equipment. Or, the terminals <b>110</b> may be devices of an unmanned aerial vehicle. Or, the terminals <b>110</b> may be vehicle-mounted devices, such as trip computers with a wireless communication function, or wireless terminals connected to an external trip computer. Or, the terminals <b>110</b> may be roadside devices, such as streetlights and signal lights with a wireless communication function.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The base stations <b>120</b> may be network-side devices in the wireless communication system. The wireless communication system may be a 4th generation mobile communication (4G) system which is also referred to as a Long Term Evolution (LTE) system, or a 5G system which is also referred to as a new radio (NR) system or 5G NR system, or a next-generation system of the 5G system. An access network in the 5G system may be referred to as a New Generation-Radio Access Network (NG-RAN).</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The base stations <b>120</b> may be evolved base stations (eNBs) in the 4G system, or base stations with centralized distributed architecture (gNBs) in the 5G system. In general, each base station <b>120</b> with the centralized distributed architecture includes a central unit (CU) and at least two distributed units (DUs). The central unit is provided with protocol stacks of a Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer, a Radio Link Control (RLC) protocol layer, and a Media Access Control (MAC) layer. The distributed units are provided with protocol stacks of a physical (PHY) layer. The implementation manner of the base stations <b>120</b> is not limited in the example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A wireless connection may be established between the base stations <b>120</b> and the terminals <b>110</b> through wireless radio. In different implementations, the wireless radio is wireless radio based on the standard of the 4th generation mobile communication network technology (4G), or wireless radio based on the standard of the 5th generation mobile communication network technology (5G), for example, new radio, or wireless radio based on the standard of next-generation mobile communication network technology of 5G.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some examples, an End to End (E2E) connection may also be established between the terminals <b>110</b>, for example, vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication, vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication and vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) communication in vehicle to everything (V2X) communication.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some examples, the above wireless communication system may further include a network management device <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The more than one base stations <b>120</b> are respectively connected to the network management device <b>130</b>. The network management device <b>130</b> may be a core network device in the wireless communication system. For example, the network management device <b>130</b> may be a Mobility Management Entity (MME) in an Evolved Packet Core (EPC), or other core network devices, such as a Serving Gateway (SGW), a Public Data Network Gateway (PGW), a Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF) unit, or a Home Subscriber Server (HSS). The implementation form of the network management device <b>130</b> is not limited in the example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, there is provided an information processing method according to an example. The information processing method is performed by a user equipment (UE), and includes:</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">S<b>110</b>: assistant information for at least one Discontinuous Reception (DRX) group among at least two DRX groups is reported. The assistant information indicates an expected DRX configuration for the DRX group.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The UE may be various types of UE, such as Machine Type Communication (MTC) UE or Internet of Things (IoT) UE.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to the present disclosure, one UE may be configured with at least two DRX groups, and different DRX groups may correspond to different carriers. For example, carriers corresponding to DRX groups needing to report carrier information respectively may be non-contiguous carriers according to an example of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The different DRX groups may correspond to different functional structures in the UE. In response to a DRX group entering an activation state, for example, entering an activation time of a DRX cycle corresponding to the DRX group, a functional structure configured to the DRX group by the UE exits a sleep state and enters the activation state. If a DRX group is in the sleep state, a functional structure configured to the DRX group by the UE is also in the sleep state, such that the power consumption of the UE is saved.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The functional structure may include a transceiver in the UE, such as a Radio Frequency Chain. For another example, the functional structure may include a Base Band Processor (BP) in the UE, and so on.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the example of the present disclosure, when the UE finds that a current DRX configuration for a DRX group is inappropriate, the UE may automatically report assistant information indicating a DRX configuration expected by the UE.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">By reporting the assistant information, a base station may know the DRX configuration, expected by the UE at present, for the DRX groups, such that the UE may adjust the DRX configuration for each DRX group in time according to the power consumption and data transmission requirements of the UE. In this way, the power consumption of the UE is reduced as much as possible while low-latency transmission of data of the UE is ensured.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some examples, after the assistant information for one or more DRX groups is reported to the base station, the base station may adjust the DRX configuration for the DRX groups of the UE according to the assistant information. After the base station adjusts the DRX configuration for the DRX groups of the UE, the base station may send configuration information for the adjusted DRX configuration to the UE such that the base station may communicate with the UE subsequently according to the adjusted DRX configuration via corresponding DRX groups.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In other examples, after the assistant information for one or more DRX groups is reported to the base station, the base station may determine whether to validate the expected DRX configuration according to current system conditions of an entire cell or a wireless communication system. If it is determined to validate the expected DRX configuration, a current DRX configuration for a corresponding DRX group is changed to the expected DRX configuration. Otherwise, the current DRX configuration for the corresponding DRX group may be maintained.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The DRX configuration here may include any configuration for the DRX cycle or any configuration for at least one of the activation time and the sleep time of the DRX groups. For example, the DRX configuration may include a configuration for various timers for the DRX groups, such as a timing configuration for one or more of a DRX activity timer, a DRX Inactivity Timer, a DRX downlink retransmission timer, and a DRX uplink retransmission timer.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some examples, the timers for the DRX groups may further include a DRX short cycle timer.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">When the timers are in a timing state, corresponding DRX groups are all in the activation state. When the timers expire, the corresponding DRX groups enter the sleep state.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the example of the present disclosure, conditions for triggering the UE to report the assistant information may include at least one of the following:</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">in response to an expected DRX configuration for a DRX group needing to be reported for the first time, it is determined to trigger the reporting of the assistant information for the corresponding DRX group; and</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">in response to a current DRX configuration for a DRX group not being the DRX configuration expected by the UE (namely the above expected DRX configuration), it is determined to trigger the reporting of the assistant information for the DRX group.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Determining, in response to the current DRX configuration for the DRX group not being the DRX configuration expected by the UE (namely the above expected DRX configuration), to trigger the reporting of the assistant information for the DRX group includes a case as follows: in response to it being determined that the expected DRX configuration for the DRX group has changed after the UE reports assistant information for the DRX group, but has not yet obtained a DRX configuration updated based on assistant information reported last time, it is determined to trigger the reporting of the assistant information for the DRX group.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some examples, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, S<b>110</b> may include:</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">S<b>111</b>: the assistant information for the at least one DRX group among the at least two DRX groups is reported in an explicit value manner. The explicit value manner is a manner in which the assistant information indicates a value of the DRX configuration.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">The explicit value manner is a manner of directly indicating the value of the expected DRX configuration via the assistant information. In this way, after the base station receives the assistant information, in response to it being determined to replace the current DRX configuration for the DRX group with the expected DRX configuration, a DRX configuration corresponding to the DRX group in the base station may be directly modified.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some examples, the assistant information for the at least one DRX group among the at least two DRX groups is reported in an increment manner. The increment manner is a manner in which the assistant information indicates an increment value of the DRX configuration.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, S<b>110</b> may include:</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">S<b>112</b>: The increment manner is to determine a difference between the current DRX configuration and the expected DRX configuration for the DRX group, and report the difference, an index value of the difference, etc. via the assistant information.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Information content reported by the assistant information is different for the explicit value manner than for the increment manner. During the implementation, the assistant information may be reported in any manner.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">For example, in response to the quantity of values of the DRX configurations being limited and a value difference between the more than one DRX configurations being constant, an index of the increment value may be configured to complete the reporting of the assistant information with fewer bits and to reduce signaling overheads.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some examples, reporting assistant information for at least one Discontinuous Reception (DRX) group among at least two DRX groups includes one of the following:</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">reporting the assistant information for all the DRX groups at one time via a first message;</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">reporting the assistant information for at least one DRX group via a second message including more than one reporting field, where each reporting field is configured to carry the assistant information for one DRX group; and</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">reporting the assistant information for different DRX groups via different third messages respectively.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, the first message may report the assistant information for all the DRX groups in the UE at one time. For example, if the UE currently includes 2 DRX groups, for example, a DRX group <b>1</b> and a DRX group <b>2</b>, in response to the DRX group <b>1</b> having an expected DRX configuration different from a current DRX configuration, even if a current DRX configuration for the DRX group <b>2</b> is the expected DRX configuration for the DRX group <b>2</b>, both assistant information for the DRX group <b>1</b> and assistant information for the DRX group <b>2</b> need to be carried by the first message for reporting if the first message is used for reporting.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The second message may include the more than one reporting fields, and each reporting field may be configured to report assistant information for one DRX group. Only assistant information for the DRX groups needing to be reported may be reported in the second message. For example, in response to the expected DRX configuration for the DRX group <b>1</b> being inconsistent with the current DRX configuration for the DRX group <b>1</b> and the current DRX configuration for the DRX group <b>2</b> being the expected DRX configuration for the DRX group <b>2</b>, the second message may carry the assistant information for the DRX group <b>1</b> through one reporting field, or, the second message may carry two reporting fields, one reporting field carrying the assistant information for the DRX group <b>1</b> and the other reporting field being null or carrying a preset value but not carrying the assistant information for the DRX group <b>2</b>. The preset value here may be: an all &#x201c;0&#x201d; sequence or an all &#x201c;1&#x201d; sequence, or a cross sequence of &#x201c;0&#x201d; and &#x201c;1&#x201d; arranged in a preset sorting manner. From the UE side, reducing the quantity of reporting fields or reducing the reporting fields corresponding to the DRX groups that do not need to report assistant information can simplify encoding on the UE side and reduce the power consumption caused by modulation, encoding and reporting of the assistant information on the UE side.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In other examples, a mapping relationship is established between each reporting field and one corresponding DRX group. In response to the UE being configured with M DRX groups, the second message has M reporting fields, and the M reporting fields correspond to the numbers of the DRX groups in sequence. In this way, when the UE encodes and reports the assistant information, the assistant information for corresponding DRX groups needs to be filled in corresponding reporting fields of the second message. After receiving the second message, the base station may determine which DRX group the assistant information carried by the reporting fields belongs to according to the mapping relationship between the reporting fields and the DRX groups. In this case, the mapping relationship is a fixed mapping relationship, and is known by both the UE and the base station.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some examples, in response to a current DRX configuration for one DRX group being not the expected DRX configuration, a corresponding reporting field of the second message carries the assistant information. In this case, the second message may carry the assistant information for the DRX group whose current DRX configuration is not the expected DRX configuration.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some examples, in response to a current DRX configuration for one DRX group being expected to be cancelled, a corresponding reporting field in the second message is null or a first predetermined value. In this case, under the condition that a current DRX configuration for one DRX group needs to be maintained, a corresponding reporting field in the second message may be a third predetermined value.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In other examples, in response to a current DRX configuration for one DRX group being expected to be maintained, a corresponding reporting field in the second message is null or a second predetermined value. In this case, under the condition that a current DRX configuration for one DRX group needs to be cancelled, a corresponding reporting field in the second message may be a fourth predetermined value.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some examples, in response to a current expected DRX configuration for one DRX group being different from a DRX configuration indicated by the assistant information reported last time, a corresponding reporting field of the second message carries the assistant information.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In other examples, in response to current reporting being the first reporting for one DRX group, a corresponding reporting field of the second message carries the assistant information.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some examples, reporting the assistant information for at least one DRX group via the second message including more than one the reporting fields includes:</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">reporting the assistant information for the different DRX groups respectively via the second message capable of carrying an identifier indication bit. The identifier indication bit is configured to indicate the DRX group for which the assistant information is reported.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In response to a reporting field in the second message being not fixedly mapped to a corresponding DRX group, for example, in response to a reporting field in the m-th position in the second message being not fixedly mapped to a DRX group m of the UE, the second message may carry the identifier indication bit to indicate which DRX group the assistant information in the current second message belongs to.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In this way, in some examples, since the second message only carries part of the DRX groups of the UE via one or more reporting fields, the DRX groups with the assistant information being reported are indicated via the identifier indication bit. It is certain that the second message may carry the identifier indication bit, but the second message may not carry the identifier indication bit in the specific reporting process.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some examples, one UE includes M DRX groups, the identifier indication bit may include M bits, and one bit indicates one DRX group. For example, two bit values (i.e., &#x201c;0&#x201d; and &#x201c;1&#x201d;) of one bit in the identifier indication bit corresponding to the DRX groups indicate two states, namely whether the assistant information for the DRX groups is carried or not.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">For example, assuming that M is equal to 2, the current value of the identifier indication bit is &#x201c;10&#x201d;, and &#x201c;0&#x201d; indicates that the assistant information for the corresponding DRX group is not carried, it indicates that the current second message carries the assistant information for the DRX group <b>1</b> but does not carry the assistant information for the DRX group <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some examples, the identifier indication bit may precede all the reporting fields. For example, in some examples, the reporting fields are located within the body of the second message, and the identifier indication bit may be located in the header of the second message.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In yet other examples, one or more identifier indication bits are configured to indicate the DRX groups corresponding to one reporting field. In this case, the identifier indication bits may be located adjacent to the corresponding reporting field, for example, the identifier indication bits are located in front of the corresponding reporting field.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some examples, the DRX groups include a first DRX group and a second DRX group.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">In response to the assistant information carried by the second message belonging to the first DRX group, the identifier indication bit included in the second message is a default value, the second message carries no identifier indication bit, or the identifier indication bit included in the second message is a group identifier of the first DRX group.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In response to the assistant information carried by the second message belonging to the second DRX group, the identifier indication bit included in the second message is a group identifier of the second DRX group.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">For example, in some examples, the UE is configured with different DRX groups among which there are DRX groups with a high frequency of usage, and DRX groups with a low frequency of usage. In this case, the first DRX group may be a DRX group with a high frequency of usage, and the second DRX group may be a DRX group with a low frequency of usage.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">For another example, the first DRX group may be a primary DRX group, and the second DRX group may be a secondary DRX group. A carrier corresponding to the primary DRX group is a primary carrier, and a carrier corresponding to the secondary DRX group may be a secondary carrier.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In this way, the frequency of changing the DRX configuration for the first DRX group is higher. In order to reduce the bit overheads of the second message, or reduce the encoding complexity of the second message, the indication bit included in the second message may be set to be the default value in response to the assistant information carried by the second message being the assistant information for the first DRX group. It is certain that the second message may also directly carry the group identifier of the first DRX group in response to the assistant information carried by the second message belonging to the first DRX group. For example, in response to the assistant information for the first DRX group needing to be quickly reported, the identifier indication bit may carry encoding information corresponding to the default value. Since the encoding information corresponding to the default value may be pre-encoded, the transmission rate may be increased. In the example of the present disclosure, the group identifier of each DRX group may be, but is not limited to, the number of the DRX group.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some examples, the example of the present disclosure provides three types of messages for the UE to report the assistant information. The UE may select one from the first message, the second message and the third message according to provisions in a communication protocol, an instruction of the base station or negotiations with the base station to report the assistant information.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">In other examples, the UE may also determine and select a message suitable for the current reporting scenario according to the reporting requirement of the current assistant information. For example, the first message may be selected in response to all the DRX groups having assistant information to be reported currently. For another example, the third message may be used in response to the UE being configured with a large quantity of DRX groups and currently only one or a small quantity of DRX groups having assistant information to be reported. For yet another example, the UE may use the second message for reporting in response to the quantity of DRX groups with assistant information needing to be reported being constant currently.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some examples, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the method further includes:</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">S<b>100</b>: a reporting time for the DRX groups with the assistant information needing to be reported is determined according to timing of a prohibit timer.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the example of the present disclosure, the confusion of wireless transmission caused by random reporting of the assistant information by the UE is reduced by introducing the prohibit timer to determine the reporting time for the assistant information. Once the reporting time is determined, the assistant information is reported for DRX groups with a reporting need, and the assistant information is not reported for DRX groups having no reporting need.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some examples, the timing duration of the prohibit timer may be associated with the duration of the DRX cycle, for example, the timing duration of the prohibit timer may be an integral multiple of the DRX cycle, and the prohibit timer is set to expire within the onDuration time of the DRX cycle. In this way, the UE may complete the reporting of the assistant information within the activation time of the DRX cycle, instead of being woken up from a sleep state due to the expiration of the prohibit timer when the UE is in the sleep time of the DRX cycle and then performing the reporting of the assistant information, such that the power consumption of the terminal may be further reduced.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">The reporting of the assistant information may be a triggering event for the start of the prohibit timer. The reporting of the assistant information may not be allowed within the timing range of the prohibit timer, and next reporting of the assistant information is performed after the prohibit timer expires.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some examples, S<b>100</b> may include:</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">in response to the at least two DRX groups sharing one prohibit timer, the reporting time for the DRX groups with the assistant information needing to be reported is determined according to at least one of a DRX configuration updating requirement of the DRX groups and the timing of the shared prohibit timer.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In response to at least two DRX groups sharing one prohibit timer, the reporting time for the assistant information and DRX groups having assistant information to be reported are determined according to at least one of the DRX configuration updating requirement of the DRX groups and the timing of the prohibit timer.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">For example, determining, in response to the at least two DRX groups sharing one prohibit timer, the reporting time for the DRX groups with the assistant information needing to be reported according to at least one of the DRX configuration updating requirement of the DRX groups and the timing of the shared prohibit timer includes:</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">in response to the at least two DRX groups sharing one prohibit timer and a DRX configuration for at least one DRX group needing to be updated, determining current time as the reporting time for the DRX groups with the assistant information needing to be reported, and determining expiration time of the prohibit timer as the reporting time for the rest of the DRX groups with the assistant information needing to be reported.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Since the assistant information for the DRX group that previously has the DRX configuration updating requirement is reported when there is the DRX configuration updating requirement, the assistant information for the DRX group is reported when the prohibit timer expires. It is certain that the assistant information for the rest of the DRX groups is also reported after the prohibit timer expires and when the DRX configurations for the rest of the DRX groups need to be updated.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some examples, determining, in response to the at least two DRX groups sharing one prohibit timer, the reporting time for the DRX groups with the assistant information needing to be reported according to at least one of the DRX configuration updating requirement of the DRX groups and the timing of the shared prohibit timer includes at least one of the following:</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">in response to the at least two DRX groups sharing one prohibit timer and the DRX configuration for each DRX group needing to be updated, current time is determined as the reporting time for the DRX groups with the assistant information needing to be reported; and</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100">in response to the at least two DRX groups sharing one prohibit timer and the DRX configuration for at least one DRX group does not need to be updated, expiration time of the prohibit timer is determined as the reporting time for the DRX groups with the assistant information needing to be reported.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">The UE may determine whether there is a DRX configuration updating requirement according to at least one of data reporting requirements and energy storage conditions of the UE. For example, the UE determines whether to adjust the DRX configurations for the DRX groups (that is, whether the DRX configurations for the one or more DRX groups in the UE need to be updated) according to the quantity of data cached by the UE, so as to report accumulated data as soon as possible to reduce the data overflow caused by too much cache data.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">For another example, the UE may determine whether to adjust the DRX cycle of the DRX groups according to the urgency of the service corresponding to the data cached by the UE. For example, service corresponding to current cached data is so urgent that a security accident or other issues may be caused if the data are not reported. For example, a smart meter finds abnormal power consumption by detecting a current, and a power accident may occur if the condition is not reported as soon as possible. In this case, the smart meter may determine that power consumption data cached by the smart meter are so urgent. The UE may enter an onDuration state as soon as possible by shorting the sleep time in the DRX configuration to complete reporting of the urgent data.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">Since the power consumption of the UE in the onDuration state is greater than the power consumption of the UE in the sleep state, the UE may also determine whether to update the current DRX configuration according to the storage condition of the UE.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">For example, in response to the UE entering a low battery state where a battery level is already lower than a first battery level threshold, the UE may determine that the sleep time in the DRX configuration that enables the UE to be in the sleep state needs to be prolonged, for example, prolonging the sleep time within the DRX cycle of the one or more DRX groups. In this case, the UE determines that the DRX configuration for the one or more DRX groups needs to be updated.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">For another example, in response to the UE exiting from the low battery state after being charged and entering a high battery state with the battery level higher than a second battery level threshold, the immediacy of data transmission is more important for the UE, and it is expected to prolong the onDuration time in the DRX configuration that enables the UE to be in the onDuration state. In this case, the UE determines that the DRX configuration for the one or more DRX groups needs to be updated.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">In a word, in the example of the present disclosure, whether a DRX configuration for a DRX group needs to be updated may be applied to various application scenarios correspondingly, and may be determined by the UE, and the specific implementation is not limited here.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">In some examples, determining the reporting time for the DRX groups with the assistant information needing to be reported according to timing of the prohibit timer includes:</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">determining, in response to different DRX groups using different prohibit timers, the expiration time of the corresponding prohibit timers as the reporting time for the corresponding DRX groups.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Since different DRX groups use different prohibit timers, which means that each DRX group is provided with an independent prohibit timer, an m-th DRX group has assistant information to be reported when an m-th prohibit timer expires.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In some examples, the timing duration of the prohibit timer may be configured by the base station or pre-specified via a communication protocol. In response to the prohibit timer being configured by the base station, the base station may send configuration information for the prohibit timer to the UE via a broadcast message or an RRC message. The configuration information for the prohibit timer may indicate at least one of the following:</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">a configuration manner of the prohibit timer, for example, whether the currently configured prohibit timer is a public prohibit timer shared by the more than one DRX groups, or is an independent prohibit timer configured for one DRX group;</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">the timing duration of the prohibit timer; and</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">start time of the prohibit timer.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In some examples, the assistant information is configured to indicate at least one of the following:</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">duration information of onDuration time in a DRX cycle; and</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">timing information of an Inactivity Timer.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The Inactivity Timer may be configured to prolong the duration of the onDuration time in the DRX cycle. During timing of the Inactivity Timer, the UE may be in an activation state even if the corresponding onDuration time of the DRX cycle expires, so as to perform data transceiving with the base station. Typical Inactivity Timers include, but are not limited to, the above DRX Inactivity Timer.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, there is provided an information processing method according to an example. The information processing method is performed by a base station, and includes:</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">S<b>200</b>: assistant information, reported by a UE, for at least one DRX group among at least two DRX groups is received.

After receiving the assistant information, the base station may update a DRX configuration for one or more DRX groups in the UE later by referring to the assistant information. In this way, the base station may take at least one of the data transmission requirements and power consumption requirements, etc. in the UE into consideration for the DRX configuration for one or more DRX groups of the UE, and the DRX configuration for the UE is more in line with the requirements of a terminal.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In some examples, the assistant information is reported in an explicit value manner or in an increment manner. The explicit value manner is a manner in which the assistant information indicates a value of the DRX configuration. The increment manner is a manner in which the assistant information indicates an increment value of the DRX configuration.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Whether the UE reports the assistant information in the explicit value manner or the increment manner may be negotiated by the base station and the UE in advance, or randomly selected by the UE. The base station decodes the assistant information in the two manners separately, and determines the manner in which the UE reports the assistant information based on a correct decoding manner. For example, the explicit value manner and the increment value manner correspond to different information formats, the base station blindly decodes the assistant information via the two information formats, and the manner corresponding to the information format used when decoding succeeds is the manner adopted by the UE to report the assistant information.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">For example, the value of the DRX configuration in the assistant information reported in the increment manner is small, while the value of the DRX configuration reported in the explicit value manner is great. After decoding the assistant information, the base station may determine the manner adopted by the UE to report the assistant information according to the characteristics of the values carried by the assistant information.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In some examples, S<b>200</b> may include: receiving a first message, a second message or a third message carrying the assistant information reported by the UE.
