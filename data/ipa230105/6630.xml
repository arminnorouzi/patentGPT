id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">An RF circuit device using modified lattice, lattice, and ladder circuit topologies. The devices can include four resonator devices and four shunt resonator devices. In the ladder topology, the resonator devices are connected in series from an input port to an output port while shunt resonator devices are coupled the nodes between the resonator devices. In the lattice topology, a top and a bottom serial configurations each includes a pair of resonator devices that are coupled to differential input and output ports. A pair of shunt resonators is cross-coupled between each pair of a top serial configuration resonator and a bottom serial configuration resonator. The modified lattice topology adds baluns or inductor devices between top and bottom nodes of the top and bottom serial configurations of the lattice configuration. These topologies may be applied using single crystal or polycrystalline bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img

More particularly, the present invention provides techniques related to a method of manufacture and a structure for bulk acoustic wave resonator devices, single crystal bulk acoustic wave resonator devices, single crystal filter and resonator devices, and the like. Merely by way of example, the invention has been applied to a single crystal resonator device for a communication device, mobile device, computing device, among others.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Mobile telecommunication devices have been successfully deployed world-wide. Over a billion mobile devices, including cell phones and smartphones, were manufactured in a single year and unit volume continues to increase year-over-year. With ramp of 4G/LTE in about 2012, and explosion of mobile data traffic, data rich content is driving the growth of the smartphone segment&#x2014;which is expected to reach 2B per annum within the next few years. Coexistence of new and legacy standards and thirst for higher data rate requirements is driving RF complexity in smartphones. Unfortunately, limitations exist with conventional RF technology that is problematic, and may lead to drawbacks in the future.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">With 4G LTE and 5G growing more popular by the day, wireless data communication demands high performance RF filters with frequencies around 5 GHz and higher. Bulk acoustic wave resonators (BAWR) using crystalline piezoelectric thin films are leading candidates for meeting such demands. Current BAWRs using polycrystalline piezoelectric thin films are adequate for bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filters operating at frequencies ranging from 1 to 3 GHz; however, the quality of the polycrystalline piezoelectric films degrades quickly as the thicknesses decrease below around 0.5 um, which is required for resonators and filters operating at frequencies around 5 GHz and above. Single crystalline or epitaxial piezoelectric thin films grown on compatible crystalline substrates exhibit good crystalline quality and high piezoelectric performance even down to very thin thicknesses, e.g., 0.4 um. Even so, there are challenges to using and transferring single crystal piezoelectric thin films in the manufacture of BAWR and BAW filters.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">From the above, it is seen that techniques for improving methods of manufacture and structures for acoustic resonator devices are highly desirable.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the present invention, techniques generally related to electronic devices are provided. More particularly, the present invention provides techniques related to a method of manufacture and structure for bulk acoustic wave resonator devices, single crystal resonator devices, single crystal filter and resonator devices, and the like. Merely by way of example, the invention has been applied to a single crystal resonator device for a communication device, mobile device, computing device, among others.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an example, the present invention provides an RF filter circuit device in a ladder configuration. The device can include an input port, a first node coupled to the input port, a first resonator coupled between the first node and the input port. A second node is coupled to the first node and a second resonator is coupled between the first node and the second node. A third node is coupled to the second node and a third resonator is coupled between the second node and the third node. A fourth node is coupled to the third node and a fourth resonator is coupled between the third node and the output port. Further, an output port is coupled to the fourth node. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Each of the first, second, third, and fourth resonators can include a capacitor device. Each such capacitor device can include a substrate member, which has a cavity region and an upper surface region contiguous with an opening in the first cavity region.

Also, each capacitor device can include a top electrode overlying the piezoelectric material and the bottom electrode, as well as an insulating material overlying the top electrode and configured with a thickness to tune the resonator. As used, the terms &#x201c;top&#x201d; and &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; are not terms in reference to a direction of gravity. Rather, these terms are used in reference to each other in context of the present device and related circuits. Those of ordinary skill in the art would recognize other modifications, variations, and alternatives.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The device also includes a serial configuration includes the input port, the first node, the first resonator, the second node, the second resonator, the third node, the third resonator, the fourth resonator, the fourth node, and the output port. A separate shunt configuration resonator is coupled to each of the first, second, third, fourth nodes. A parallel configuration includes the first, second, third, and fourth shunt configuration resonators. Further, a circuit response can be configured between the input port and the output port and configured from the serial configuration and the parallel configuration to achieve a transmission loss from a pass-band having a characteristic frequency centered around 5.5025 GHz and having a bandwidth from 5.170 GHz to 5.835 GHz such that the characteristic frequency centered around 5.5025 GHz is tuned from a lower frequency ranging from about 4.7 GHz to 5.4 GHz.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a specific example, the first, second, third, and fourth piezoelectric materials are each essentially a single crystal aluminum nitride (AlN) bearing material or aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) bearing material, a single crystal gallium nitride (GaN) bearing material or gallium aluminum nitride (GaAlN) bearing material, or the like.

The parallel configuration also forms a resonance profile and an anti-resonance profile. These profiles are such that the resonance profile from the serial configuration is off-set with the anti-resonance profile of the parallel configuration to form the pass-band.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a specific example, the pass-band is characterized by a band edge on each side of the pass-band and having an amplitude difference ranging from 10 dB to 60 dB.

In particular, the present device can be manufactured in a relatively simple and cost effective manner while using conventional materials and/or methods according to one of ordinary skill in the art. Using the present method, one can create a reliable single crystal based acoustic resonator using multiple ways of three-dimensional stacking through a wafer level process. Such filters or resonators can be implemented in an RF filter device, an RF filter system, or the like. Depending upon the embodiment, one or more of these benefits may be achieved. Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">With 4G LTE and 5G growing more popular by the day, wireless data communication demands high performance RF filters with frequencies around 5 GHz and higher. Bulk acoustic wave resonators (BAWR), widely used in such filters operating at frequencies around 3 GHz and lower, are leading candidates for meeting such demands. Current bulk acoustic wave resonators use polycrystalline piezoelectric AlN thin films where each grain's c-axis is aligned perpendicular to the film's surface to allow high piezoelectric performance whereas the grains' a- or b-axis are randomly distributed. This peculiar grain distribution works well when the piezoelectric film's thickness is around 1 um and above, which is the perfect thickness for bulk acoustic wave (BAW) filters operating at frequencies ranging from 1 to 3 GHz. However, the quality of the polycrystalline piezoelectric films degrades quickly as the thicknesses decrease below around 0.5 um, which is required for resonators and filters operating at frequencies around 5 GHz and above.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Single crystalline or epitaxial piezoelectric thin films grown on compatible crystalline substrates exhibit good crystalline quality and high piezoelectric performance even down to very thin thicknesses, e.g., 0.4 um. The present invention provides manufacturing processes and structures for high quality bulk acoustic wave resonators with single crystalline or epitaxial piezoelectric thin films for high frequency BAW filter applications.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">BAWRs require a piezoelectric material, e.g., AlN, in crystalline form, i.e., polycrystalline or single crystalline. The quality of the film heavy depends on the chemical, crystalline, or topographical quality of the layer on which the film is grown. In conventional BAWR processes (including film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) or solidly mounted resonator (SMR) geometry), the piezoelectric film is grown on a patterned bottom electrode, which is usually made of molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), or ruthenium (Ru). The surface geometry of the patterned bottom electrode significantly influences the crystalline orientation and crystalline quality of the piezoelectric film, requiring complicated modification of the structure.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">Thus, the present invention uses single crystalline piezoelectric films and thin film transfer processes to produce a BAWR with enhanced ultimate quality factor and electro-mechanical coupling for RF filters. Such methods and structures facilitate methods of manufacturing and structures for RF filters using single crystalline or epitaxial piezoelectric films to meet the growing demands of contemporary data communication.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In an example, the present invention provides transfer structures and processes for acoustic resonator devices, which provides a flat, high-quality, single-crystal piezoelectric film for superior acoustic wave control and high Q in high frequency. As described above, polycrystalline piezoelectric layers limit Q in high frequency. Also, growing epitaxial piezoelectric layers on patterned electrodes affects the crystalline orientation of the piezoelectric layer, which limits the ability to have tight boundary control of the resulting resonators. Embodiments of the present invention, as further described below, can overcome these limitations and exhibit improved performance and cost-efficiency.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-<b>16</b>C</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b>A-<b>31</b>C</figref> illustrate a method of fabrication for an acoustic resonator device using a transfer structure with a sacrificial layer.

Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In each of the preceding examples relating to transfer processes, energy confinement structures can be formed on the first electrode, second electrode, or both. In an example, these energy confinement structures are mass loaded areas surrounding the resonator area. The resonator area is the area where the first electrode, the piezoelectric layer, and the second electrode overlap. The larger mass load in the energy confinement structures lowers a cut-off frequency of the resonator. The cut-off frequency is the lower or upper limit of the frequency at which the acoustic wave can propagate in a direction parallel to the surface of the piezoelectric film. Therefore, the cut-off frequency is the resonance frequency in which the wave is travelling along the thickness direction and thus is determined by the total stack structure of the resonator along the vertical direction. In piezoelectric films (e.g., AlN), acoustic waves with lower frequency than the cut-off frequency can propagate in a parallel direction along the surface of the film, i.e., the acoustic wave exhibits a high-band-cut-off type dispersion characteristic. In this case, the mass loaded area surrounding the resonator provides a barrier preventing the acoustic wave from propagating outside the resonator. By doing so, this feature increases the quality factor of the resonator and improves the performance of the resonator and, consequently, the filter.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">In addition, the top single crystalline piezoelectric layer can be replaced by a polycrystalline piezoelectric film. In such films, the lower part that is close to the interface with the substrate has poor crystalline quality with smaller grain sizes and a wider distribution of the piezoelectric polarization orientation than the upper part of the film close to the surface. This is due to the polycrystalline growth of the piezoelectric film, i.e., the nucleation and initial film have random crystalline orientations. Considering AlN as a piezoelectric material, the growth rate along the c-axis or the polarization orientation is higher than other crystalline orientations that increase the proportion of the grains with the c-axis perpendicular to the growth surface as the film grows thicker. In a typical polycrystalline AlN film with about a 1 um thickness, the upper part of the film close to the surface has better crystalline quality and better alignment in terms of piezoelectric polarization. By using the thin film transfer process contemplated in the present invention, it is possible to use the upper portion of the polycrystalline film in high frequency BAW resonators with very thin piezoelectric films. This can be done by removing a portion of the piezoelectric layer during the growth substrate removal process. Of course, there can be other variations, modifications, and alternatives.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In an example, the present invention provides a high-performance, ultra-small pass-band Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) Radio Frequency (RF) Filter for use in 5.5 GHz Wi-Fi applications.
