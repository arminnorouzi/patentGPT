There are two main subtypes; acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML is less common, accounting for approximately 18% of childhood leukemia diagnoses. These leukemia types also occur in adults, and AML becomes more common in older individuals. The etiology of the two subtypes is likely quite different based on both cell lineage and epidemiological studies of incidence and risk factors. Aggressive chemotherapies are required to improve the prognosis of patients diagnoses with leukemias such as ALL or AML.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Asparaginase, a bacterial enzyme that depletes the nonessential amino acid asparagine, is an integral component of acute leukemia therapy <sup>1,2</sup>. The antineoplastic effects of asparaginase are likely caused by its depletion of extracellular asparagine and glutamine creating a state of amino acid deficiency and subsequent inhibition of protein synthesis. However, other mechanisms remain to be identified. Despite its efficacy in ALL, asparaginase has been used only occasionally in the treatment of other leukemias and solid tumors. Previous in vitro studies have observed varied response to asparaginase in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) across the French-American-British subtypes. Asparaginase resistance remains a common clinical problem for leukemia patients where the biologic basis of the resistance is poorly understood.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention described herein is related, in part, to the discovery that GSK3&#x3b1; puncta are formed in cells in response to asparagine starvation.

Primary patient samples of the indicated types (T-ALL, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; B-ALL, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; AML, acute myeloid leukemia) were expanded in immunodeficient mice, and viably frozen. Samples were then thawed and treated with asparaginase (100 U/L) for 48 hours in cell culture conditions, and GSK3&#x3b1; body formation was assessed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Asparaginase response was assessed after 48 hours by trypan blue viable cell counts. PDXs with a viability &#x2264;60% were considered as sensitive to asparaginase treatment. ****, p&#x3c;0.0001.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts a model for synthetic lethal interaction of Wnt pathway activation and asparaginase. Asparaginase induces leukemic cell death by depleting asparagine. Drug-resistant leukemias rely on protein degradation as a catabolic source of asparagine to survive asparaginase treatment. This is mediated by GSK3, which can phosphorylate a large number of cellular proteins, to form a phospho-degron that marks proteins for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This adaptive response is blocked by activation of Wnt signaling (the so-called Wnt-dependent stabilization of proteins, Wnt/STOP), or by selective inhibition of GSK3&#x3b1;.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> show asparaginase resistance is uniquely dependent on the N-terminal low complexity domain of GSK3&#x3b1;.

We then expressed various domain-swapped alleles in which the N-terminal, kinase, and C-terminal domains of GSK3&#x3b1; and p were swapped in various configurations. Note that the N-terminus of GSK3&#x3b1; is required for asparaginase resistance, because GSK3&#x3b2; is unable to rescue asparaginase sensitivity unless its N-terminus is replaced by that of GSK3&#x3b1;. Conversely, a GSK3&#x3b1; allele in which its N-terminus is swapped with that of GSK3b is completely unable to restore asparaginase resistance.

Asparagine depletion is lethal to some cancer cells, a vulnerability exploited clinically using asparaginase. Data presented herein show that resistance to asparagine starvation is uniquely dependent on an N-terminal low-complexity domain of GSK3&#x3b1; lacking in its paralog GSK3&#x3b2;. Upon depletion of specific amino acids, including asparagine, leucine or valine, this domain mediates spatial sequestration of GSK3&#x3b1; into membraneless cytoplasmic bodies together with the ubiquitin proteasome system, a catabolic amino acid source. In normal cells, GSK3&#x3b1; promotes survival during essential amino acid starvation. In human leukemia, GSK3&#x3b1; body formation predicts asparaginase resistance, and sensitivity to the combination of asparaginase and a small molecule GSK3&#x3b1; inhibitor. Our data indicate that GSK3&#x3b1; body formation provides a cellular mechanism to maximize the catalytic efficiency of proteasomal protein degradation during amino acid starvation, an adaptive response co-opted by cancer cells for asparaginase resistance.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Methods of Treating Cancer</heading><p id="p-0087" num="0085">The invention described herein is related, in part, to the discovery that treatment with a GSK3&#x3b1; inhibitor induces profound sensitization to asparaginase in acute leukemias and colorectal cancers that are refractory to monotherapy with asparaginase. This is because GSK3&#x3b1; function mediates asparaginase resistance in these cells by stimulating protein degradation. Protein degradation leads to the release of free amino acids, which replenish the pool of asparagine in cancer cells and allow these to survive during therapy with asparaginase. The current invention described herein involves the discovery that GSK3&#x3b1; undergoes physical re-localization upon treatment with asparaginase, from its diffuse cytoplasmic localization at baseline into GSK3&#x3b1;-positive puncta in the cytoplasm of these cells. Formation of these puncta reflects the fact that cells are activating GSK3&#x3b1;-dependent protein degradation by concentrating GSK3&#x3b1; together with other key components of the cellular machinery for protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, in order to maximize efficiency of this biochemical reaction in response to asparagine starvation. Activation of GSK3&#x3b1; dependent protein degradation in response to asparaginase treatment or asparagine starvation can be measured using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, which reveals the markedly altered localization of GSK3&#x3b1; from its diffuse cytoplasmic localization at baseline into these cytoplasmic puncta (or inclusions), which were termed GSK3&#x3b1; bodies. The inventors have now shown that formation of these GSK3&#x3b1; bodies correlates with resistance to asparaginase monotherapy, and predicts response to the combination of GSK3&#x3b1; inhibition and asparaginase. This is a one of a kind diagnostic method; there are no other means to identify patients who will respond to the combination of GSK3&#x3b1; inhibition and asparaginase.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0086">Accordingly, one aspect described herein is a method of treating cancer comprising (a) obtaining a biological sample from a subject having cancer; (b) assaying the sample and identifying the cancer as forming GSK3&#x3b1;-positive puncta; and (c) administering an asparaginase and an agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; to a subject who has been identified as forming GSK3&#x3b1;-positive puncta.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0087">Another aspect described herein is a method of treating cancer comprising (a) receiving the results of an assay that identifies a subject as having a cancer forming GSK3&#x3b1;-positive puncta; and (b) administering an asparaginase and an agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; to a subject who has been identified as forming GSK3&#x3b1;-positive puncta.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0088">Another aspect described herein is a method of treating asparaginase-resistant cancer comprising: (a) obtaining a biological sample from a subject having cancer; (b) assaying the sample to identify for GSK3&#x3b1;-positive puncta; (c) identifying a subject as having asparaginase-resistant cancer if the cancer forms GSK3&#x3b1;-positive puncta; and (d) administering an asparaginase and an agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; to a subject who has been identified as having asparaginase-resistant cancer.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">Yet another aspect described herein is a method of treating asparaginase-resistant cancer comprising (a) receiving the results of an assay that identifies a subject as having a cancer forming GSK3&#x3b1;-positive puncta; (b) identifying a subject as having asparaginase-resistant cancer if the cancer forms GSK3&#x3b1;-positive puncta; and (c) administering an asparaginase and an agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; to a subject who has been identified as having asparaginase-resistant cancer.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">Another aspect described herein is a method of treating cancer comprising (a) obtaining a biological tumor sample from a subject having cancer; (b) assaying the sample by treating with an asparaginase, or culturing in conditions of asparagine starvation or amino acid starvation; (c) identifying the sample as forming GSK3&#x3b1;-positive puncta in response to asparagine starvation; and (d) administering an asparaginase and an agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; to a subject who has been identified as having a sample that forms GSK3&#x3b1;-positive puncta.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">Another aspect described herein is a method of treating cancer comprising (a) receiving the results of an assay that identifies a subject as having a cancer that forms GSK3&#x3b1;-positive puncta in response to asparaginase treatment or asparagine starvation; and (b) administering an asparaginase and an agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; to a subject who has been identified as having a cancer that forms GSK3&#x3b1;-positive puncta in response to asparagine starvation.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">Another aspect described herein is a method of treating asparaginase-resistant cancer comprising (a) obtaining a biological sample from a subject having cancer; (b) assaying the sample to identify formation of GSK3&#x3b1;-positive puncta in response to asparaginase treatment or asparagine starvation; (c) identifying a subject as having asparaginase-resistant cancer if the cancer forms GSK3&#x3b1;-positive puncta in response to asparagine starvation; and (d) administering an asparaginase and an agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; to a subject who has been identified as having asparaginase-resistant cancer.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">Another aspect described herein is a method of treating asparaginase-resistant cancer comprising (a) receiving the results of an assay that identifies a subject as having a cancer that forms GSK3&#x3b1;-positive puncta in response to asparaginase treatment or asparagine starvation; (b) administering an asparaginase and an agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; to a subject who has been identified as having asparaginase-resistant cancer.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">In various embodiments, methods described herein comprise the step of diagnosing a subject with having cancer or receiving the results of an assay that diagnoses a subject of having cancer prior to administering the treatment (e.g., an asparaginase and/or an agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1;).

In one embodiment, the cancer is DLBCL or Follicular lymphoma.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0117">Leukemias (also known as &#x201c;blood cancers&#x201d;) are cancers of the bone marrow, which is the site of blood cell production. Leukemia is often associated with the overproduction of immature white blood cells. Immature white blood cells do not function properly, rendering the patient prone to infection. Leukemia additionally affects red blood cells, and can cause poor blood clotting and fatigue due to anemia.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0118">In one embodiment of any aspect, the leukemia is acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Examples of leukemia include, but are not limited to, Myelogenous or granulocytic leukemia (malignancy of the myeloid and granulocytic white blood cell series), Lymphatic, lymphocytic, or lymphoblastic leukemia (malignancy of the lymphoid and lymphocytic blood cell series), and Polycythemia vera or erythremia (malignancy of various blood cell products, but with red cells predominating).</p><p id="p-0121" num="0119">In one embodiment, the cancer is a solid tumor. Non-limiting examples of solid tumors include Adrenocortical Tumor, Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma, Chondrosarcoma, Colorectal Carcinoma, Desmoid Tumors, Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor, Endocrine Tumors, Endodermal Sinus Tumor, Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma, Ewing Sarcoma, Germ Cell Tumors (Solid Tumor), Giant Cell Tumor of Bone and Soft Tissue, Hepatoblastoma, Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Melanoma, Nephroma, Neuroblastoma, Non-Rhabdomyosarcoma Soft Tissue Sarcoma (NRSTS), Osteosarcoma, Paraspinal Sarcoma, Renal Cell Carcinoma, Retinoblastoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma, Synovial Sarcoma, and Wilms Tumor. Solid tumors can be found in bones, muscles, or organs, and can be sarcomas or carinomas.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0120">In one embodiment of any aspect, the cancer is resistant to a cancer therapy. In one embodiment of any aspect, the cancer is resistant to an asparaginase. A cancer resistant to a therapy, for example, asparaginase, is one that previously responded to the treatment but is now capable of growing or persisting despite the presence of continued treatment. Resistance to a therapy can occur due to, e.g., acquired mutations in the cancer cell, gene amplification in the cancer cell, or the cancer cell develops mechanisms to prevent the uptake of the treatment. In one embodiment of any aspect, the cancer is not resistant to a cancer therapy or asparaginase.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0121">In one embodiment, the cancer is metastatic (e.g., the cancer has disseminated from its primary location to at least one secondary location).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0122">In one embodiment, the cancer has relapsed following administration of a cancer therapy. A &#x201c;relapsed cancer&#x201d; is defined as the return of a disease or the signs and symptoms of a disease after a period of improvement.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0000">Asparaginase and Agents that Inhibit GSK3&#x3b1;</p><p id="p-0126" num="0123">Asparaginase, an antileukemic enzyme that degrades the nonessential amino acid asparagine is a chemotherapy drug used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It can also be used to treat some other blood disorders. Asparaginase is also known in the art as, e.g., Erwinase, Crisantaspase or L-asparaginase. Asparaginase catalyzes the conversion of L-asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia, thus depriving the leukemic cell of circulating asparagine, which leads to cell death.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0124">In one embodiment, the asparaginase is L-asparaginase (Elspar), pegaspargase (PEG-asparaginase; Oncaspar), SC-PEG asparaginase, Calaspargase pegol (Cal-PEG; SHP663), <i>Erwinia </i>asparaginase (Erwinaze), cristantaspase, Asparaginase medac, Recombinant Crisantaspase, or Recombinant Crisantaspase with half-life extension or pegylation.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0125">L-asparaginase (Elspar), pegaspargase (PEG-asparaginase; Oncaspar), and SC-PEG asparaginase (Calaspargase pegol) are all based on the <i>Escherichia coli </i>asparaginase gene ansB, either in its native form or conjugated to polyethylene glycol (pegylated), which encodes a gene product having a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="right"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;3)</entry></row><row><entry>MEFFKKTALAALVMGFSGAALALPNITILATGGTIAGGGDSATKSNYT</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>VGKVGVENLVNAVPQLKDIANVKGEQVVNIGSQDMNDNVWLTLAKKIN</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>TDCDKTDGFVITHGTDTMEETAYFLDLTVKCDKPVVMVGAMRPSTSMS</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>ADGPFNLYNAVVTAADKASANRGVLVVMNDTVLDGRDVTKTNTTDVAT</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>FKSVNYGPLGYIHNGKIDYQRTPARKHTSDTPFDVSKLNELPKVGIVY</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>NYANASDLPAKALVDAGYDGIVSAGVGNGNLYKSVFDTLATAAKTGTA</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>VVRSSRVPTGATTQDAEVDDAKYGFVASGTLNPQKARVLLQLALTQTK</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>DPQQIQQIFNQY</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0130" num="0126">The <i>Erwinia </i>asparaginases (Erwinaze, Recombinant Crisantaspase, or Recombinant Crisantaspase with half-life extension) are based on the ansB gene from <i>Erwinia chrysanthemi </i>(also known as <i>Dickeya chrysanthemi</i>), either in its native form or conjugated to polyethylene glycol (pegylated), which encodes a gene product having a sequence of SEQ ID NO: 4.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="right"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;4)</entry></row><row><entry>MERWFKSLFVLVLFFVFTASAADKLPNIVILATGGTIAGSAATGTQTT</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>GYKAGALGVDTLINAVPEVKKLANVKGEQFSNMASENMTGDVVLKLSQ</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>RVNELLARDDVDGVVITHGTDTVEESAYFLHLTVKSDKPVVFVAAMRP</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>ATAISADGPMNLLEAVRVAGDKQSRGRGVMVVLNDRIGSARYITKTNA</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>STLDTFKANEEGYLGVIIGNRIYYQNRIDKLHTTRSVFDVRGLTSLPK</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>VDILYGYQDDPEYLYDAAIQHGVKGIVYAGMGAGSVSVRGIAGMRKAM</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>EKGVVVIRSTRTGNGIVPPDEELPGLVSDSLNPAHARILLMLALTRTS</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>DPKVIQEYFHTY</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0132" num="0127">In one embodiment, the asparaginase encodes a gene product having a sequence that comprises a sequence with at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% or greater sequence identity to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 3 or 4.

Inhibition of GSK3&#x3b1; will prevent activation of the WNT signaling pathway. One skilled in the art can determine if the presence, amount or level of GSK3&#x3b1; has been reduced using PCR-based assays or westernblotting to assess GSK3&#x3b1; mRNA or protein levels, respectively, or by visualizing the GSK3&#x3b1; protein via immunofluorescence of an anti-GSK3&#x3b1; antibody. One skilled in the art can determine if the activity of GSK3&#x3b1; has been reduced using functional assays that assess downstream effects of GSK3&#x3b1;, such as, determining if its downstream substrate, &#x3b2;-catenin, is phosphorylated via western blotting or immunofluorescence with an anti-phospho &#x3b2;-catenin specific antibody.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0134">An agent can inhibit e.g., the transcription, or the translation of GSK3&#x3b1; in the cell.

or is substantially similar to any of the small molecules described herein, for example as listed in Table 2. A molecule is said to be a &#x201c;derivative&#x201d; of another molecule when it contains additional chemical moieties not normally a part of the molecule and/or when it has been chemically modified. Such moieties can improve the molecule's expression levels, enzymatic activity, solubility, absorption, biological half-life, etc. The moieties can alternatively decrease the toxicity of the molecule, eliminate or attenuate any undesirable side effect of the molecule, etc. Moieties capable of mediating such effects are disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th edition, A. R. Gennaro, Ed., MackPubl., Easton, Pa. (1990). A &#x201c;variant&#x201d; of a molecule is meant to refer to a molecule substantially similar in structure and function to either the entire molecule, or to a fragment thereof. A molecule is said to be &#x201c;substantially similar&#x201d; to another molecule if both molecules have substantially similar structures and/or if both molecules possess a similar biological activity. Thus, provided that two molecules possess a similar activity, they are considered variants as that term is used herein even if the structure of one of the molecules not found in the other, or if the structure is not identical. An &#x201c;analog&#x201d; of a molecule is meant to refer to a molecule substantially similar in function to either the entire molecule or to a fragment thereof.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0139">In one embodiment, the small molecule inhibitor of GSK3&#x3b1;, e.g., a small molecule listed in Table 2, is conjugated to an E3 ubiquitin ligase recruitment element. As used herein, &#x201c;conjugated&#x201d; refers to two or more smaller entities (e.g., a small molecule and a E3 ubiquitin ligase recruitment element) that are linked, connected, associated, bonded (covalently or non-covalently), or any combination thereof, to form a larger entity. The conjugated E3 ubiquitin ligase recruitment element recruits an E3, which mediates the transfer of an ubiquitin from an E2 to the protein substrate. Binding of an ubiquitin to a protein substrate marks the protein for degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system. Thus, a small molecule inhibitor of GSK3&#x3b1; conjugated to an E3 ubiquitin ligase recruitment element would, e.g., bind to GSK3&#x3b1; and subsequently promote its degradation. E3 ubiquitin ligase recruitment elements can include, but are not limited to, thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or a VHL ligand that mimics the hydroxyproline degradation motif of HIF1-alpha. Chemical structures for exemplary E3 ubiquitin ligase recruitment element are presented herein in Table 3, and are further described in, e.g., Pavia, S L, and Crews, C M. Current Opinion in Chemical Biology. 2019. 50; 111-119, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Use of conjugated E3 ubiquitin ligase recruitment elements are further described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,208,157B2 and 9,770,512, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0140">In one embodiment, a small molecule conjugated to an E3 ubiquitin ligase recruitment element further comprises a linker. In one embodiment, the inhibitor of GSK3&#x3b1; is a heterobifunctional GSK3&#x3b1; degrader (e.g., as shown herein Table 3). It is specifically contemplated herein that the specifications of the linker (e.g., length, sequence, etc.) would be optimized for greatest efficacy of the small molecule and E3 ubiquitin ligase recruitment element. For example, a linker would be designed such that it does not interfere with binding of the small molecule to its target (e.g., the binding pocket on the protein of interest) or the transfer of the ubiquitin from the E2 to the protein substrate.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0141">In various embodiments, the agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; is an antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, or an antibody reagent that is specific for GSK3&#x3b1;. As used herein, the term &#x201c;antibody reagent&#x201d; refers to a polypeptide that includes at least one immunoglobulin variable domain or immunoglobulin variable domain sequence and which specifically binds a given antigen. An antibody reagent can comprise an antibody or a polypeptide comprising an antigen-binding domain of an antibody. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, an antibody reagent can comprise a monoclonal antibody or a polypeptide comprising an antigen-binding domain of a monoclonal antibody. For example, an antibody can include a heavy (H) chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VH), and a light (L) chain variable region (abbreviated herein as VL). In another example, an antibody includes two heavy (H) chain variable regions and two light (L) chain variable regions. The term &#x201c;antibody reagent&#x201d; encompasses antigen-binding fragments of antibodies (e.g., single chain antibodies, Fab and sFab fragments, F(ab&#x2032;)2, Fd fragments, FAT fragments, scFv, CDRs, and domain antibody (dAb) fragments (see, e.g. de Wildt et al., Eur J. Immunol. 1996; 26(3):629-39; which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety)) as well as complete antibodies. An antibody can have the structural features of IgA, IgG, IgE, IgD, or IgM (as well as subtypes and combinations thereof). Antibodies can be from any source, including mouse, rabbit, pig, rat, and primate (human and non-human primate) and primatized antibodies. Antibodies also include midibodies, nanobodies, humanized antibodies, chimeric antibodies, and the like.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0142">In one embodiment, the antibody or antibody reagent binds to an amino acid sequence that corresponds to the amino acid sequence encoding GSK3&#x3b1; (SEQ ID NO: 2).</p><p id="p-0149" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00005" num="00005"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" tabstyle="monospace"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="right"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>(SEQ&#x2003;ID&#x2003;NO:&#x2003;2)</entry></row><row><entry>MSGGGPSGGGPGGSGRARTSSFAEPGGGGGGGGGGPGGSASGPGGTGG</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>GKASVGAMGGGVGASSSGGGPGGSGGGGSGGPGAGTSFPPPGVKLGRD</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>SGKVTTVVATLGQGPERSQEVAYTDIKVIGNGSFGVVYQARLAETREL</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>VAIKKVLQDKRFKNRELQIMRKLDHCNIVRLRYFFYSSGEKKDELYLN</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>LVLEYVPETVYRVARHFTKAKLTIPILYVKVYMYQLFRSLAYIHSQGV</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>CHRDIKPQNLLVDPDTAVLKLCDFGSAKQLVRGEPNVSYICSRYYRAP</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>ELIFGATDYTSSIDVWSAGCVLAELLLGQPIFPGDSGVDQLVEIIKVL</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>GTPTREQIREMNPNYTEFKFPQIKAHPWTKVFKSRTPPEAIALCSSLL</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>EYTPSSRLSPLEACAHSFFDELRCLGTQLPNNRPLPPLFNFSAGELSI</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>QPSLNAILIPPHLRSPAGTTTLTPSSQALTETPTSSDWQSTDATPTLT</entry></row><row><entry> </entry></row><row><entry>NSS</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0150" num="0143">In another embodiment, the anti- GSK3&#x3b1; antibody or antibody reagent binds to an amino acid sequence that comprises the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2; or binds to an amino acid sequence that comprises a sequence with at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, at least 99% or greater sequence identity to the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2.

As used herein, an &#x201c;antisense oligonucleotide&#x201d; refers to a synthesized nucleic acid sequence that is complementary to a DNA or mRNA sequence, such as that of a microRNA. Antisense oligonucleotides are typically designed to block expression of a DNA or RNA target by binding to the target and halting expression at the level of transcription, translation, or splicing. Antisense oligonucleotides of the present invention are complementary nucleic acid sequences designed to hybridize under cellular conditions to a gene, e.g., GSK3&#x3b1;. Thus, oligonucleotides are chosen that are sufficiently complementary to the target, i.e., that hybridize sufficiently well and with sufficient specificity in the context of the cellular environment, to give the desired effect. For example, an antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; may comprise at least 5, at least 10, at least 15, at least 20, at least 25, at least 30, or more bases complementary to a portion of the coding sequence of the human GSK3&#x3b1; gene (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1), respectively.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0147">In one embodiment, GSK3&#x3b1; is depleted from the cell's genome using any genome editing system including, but not limited to, zinc finger nucleases, TALENS, meganucleases, and CRISPR/Cas systems. In one embodiment, the genomic editing system used to incorporate the nucleic acid encoding one or more guide RNAs into the cell's genome is not a CRISPR/Cas system; this can prevent undesirable cell death in cells that retain a small amount of Cas enzyme/protein. It is also contemplated herein that either the Cas enzyme or the sgRNAs are each expressed under the control of a different inducible promoter, thereby allowing temporal expression of each to prevent such interference.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0148">When a nucleic acid encoding one or more sgRNAs and a nucleic acid encoding an RNA-guided endonuclease each need to be administered in vivo, the use of an adenovirus associated vector (AAV) is specifically contemplated. Other vectors for simultaneously delivering nucleic acids to both components of the genome editing/fragmentation system (e.g., sgRNAs, RNA-guided endonuclease) include lentiviral vectors, such as Epstein Barr, Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Each of the components of the RNA-guided genome editing system (e.g., sgRNA and endonuclease) can be delivered in a separate vector as known in the art or as described herein.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0149">In one embodiment, the agent inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; by RNA inhibition. Inhibitors of the expression of a given gene can be an inhibitory nucleic acid. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the inhibitory nucleic acid is an inhibitory RNA (iRNA). The RNAi can be single stranded or double stranded.</p><p id="p-0158" num="0150">The iRNA can be siRNA, shRNA, endogenous microRNA (miRNA), or artificial miRNA. In one embodiment, an iRNA as described herein effects inhibition of the expression and/or activity of a target, e.g. GSK3&#x3b1;. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the agent is siRNA that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1;. In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the agent is shRNA that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1;.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0151">One skilled in the art would be able to design siRNA, shRNA, or miRNA to target GSK3&#x3b1;, e.g., using publically available design tools. siRNA, shRNA, or miRNA is commonly made using companies such as Dharmacon (Layfayette, Colo.) or Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.).</p><p id="p-0160" num="0152">In some embodiments of any of the aspects, the iRNA can be a dsRNA. A dsRNA includes two RNA strands that are sufficiently complementary to hybridize to form a duplex structure under conditions in which the dsRNA will be used. One strand of a dsRNA (the antisense strand) includes a region of complementarity that is substantially complementary, and generally fully complementary, to a target sequence. The target sequence can be derived from the sequence of an mRNA formed during the expression of the target. The other strand (the sense strand) includes a region that is complementary to the antisense strand, such that the two strands hybridize and form a duplex structure when combined under suitable conditions</p><p id="p-0161" num="0153">The RNA of an iRNA can be chemically modified to enhance stability or other beneficial characteristics. The nucleic acids featured in the invention may be synthesized and/or modified by methods well established in the art, such as those described in &#x201c;Current protocols in nucleic acid chemistry,&#x201d; Beaucage, S. L. et al. (Edrs.), John Wiley &#x26; Sons, Inc., New York, N.Y., USA, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0154">In one embodiment, the agent is miRNA that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1;. microRNAs are small non-coding RNAs with an average length of 22 nucleotides. These molecules act by binding to complementary sequences within mRNA molecules, usually in the 3&#x2032; untranslated (3&#x2032;UTR) region, thereby promoting target mRNA degradation or inhibited mRNA translation. The interaction between microRNA and mRNAs is mediated by what is known as the &#x201c;seed sequence&#x201d;, a 6-8-nucleotide region of the microRNA that directs sequence-specific binding to the mRNA through imperfect Watson-Crick base pairing. More than 900 microRNAs are known to be expressed in mammals. Many of these can be grouped into families on the basis of their seed sequence, thereby identifying a &#x201c;cluster&#x201d; of similar microRNAs. A miRNA can be expressed in a cell, e.g., as naked DNA. A miRNA can be encoded by a nucleic acid that is expressed in the cell, e.g., as naked DNA or can be encoded by a nucleic acid that is contained within a vector.</p><p id="p-0163" num="0155">The agent may result in gene silencing of the target gene (e.g., GSK3&#x3b1;), such as with an RNAi molecule (e.g. siRNA or miRNA). This entails a decrease in the mRNA level in a cell for a target by at least about 5%, about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 95%, about 99%, about 100% of the mRNA level found in the cell without the presence of the agent. In one preferred embodiment, the mRNA levels are decreased by at least about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 95%, about 99%, about 100%. One skilled in the art will be able to readily assess whether the siRNA, shRNA, or miRNA effective target e.g., GSK3&#x3b1;, for its downregulation, for example by transfecting the siRNA, shRNA, or miRNA into cells and detecting the levels of a gene (e.g., GSK3&#x3b1;) found within the cell via western-blotting.</p><p id="p-0164" num="0156">The agent may be contained in and thus further include a vector. Many such vectors useful for transferring exogenous genes into target mammalian cells are available. The vectors may be episomal, e.g. plasmids, virus-derived vectors such cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, etc., or may be integrated into the target cell genome, through homologous recombination or random integration, e.g. retrovirus-derived vectors such as MMLV, HIV-1, ALV, etc. In some embodiments, combinations of retroviruses and an appropriate packaging cell line may also find use, where the capsid proteins will be functional for infecting the target cells. Usually, the cells and virus will be incubated for at least about 24 hours in the culture medium. The cells are then allowed to grow in the culture medium for short intervals in some applications, e.g. 24-73 hours, or for at least two weeks, and may be allowed to grow for five weeks or more, before analysis. Commonly used retroviral vectors are &#x201c;defective&#x201d;, i.e. unable to produce viral proteins required for productive infection. Replication of the vector requires growth in the packaging cell line.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0157">The term &#x201c;vector&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to a nucleic acid construct designed for delivery to a host cell or for transfer between different host cells. As used herein, a vector can be viral or non-viral. The term &#x201c;vector&#x201d; encompasses any genetic element that is capable of replication when associated with the proper control elements and that can transfer gene sequences to cells. A vector can include, but is not limited to, a cloning vector, an expression vector, a plasmid, phage, transposon, cosmid, artificial chromosome, virus, virion, etc.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0158">As used herein, the term &#x201c;expression vector&#x201d; refers to a vector that directs expression of an RNA or polypeptide (e.g., an GSK3&#x3b1; inhibitor) from nucleic acid sequences contained therein linked to transcriptional regulatory sequences on the vector. The sequences expressed will often, but not necessarily, be heterologous to the cell. An expression vector may comprise additional elements, for example, the expression vector may have two replication systems, thus allowing it to be maintained in two organisms, for example in human cells for expression and in a prokaryotic host for cloning and amplification. The term &#x201c;expression&#x201d; refers to the cellular processes involved in producing RNA and proteins and as appropriate, secreting proteins, including where applicable, but not limited to, for example, transcription, transcript processing, translation and protein folding, modification and processing. &#x201c;Expression products&#x201d; include RNA transcribed from a gene, and polypeptides obtained by translation of mRNA transcribed from a gene. The term &#x201c;gene&#x201d; means the nucleic acid sequence which is transcribed (DNA) to RNA in vitro or in vivo when operably linked to appropriate regulatory sequences. The gene may or may not include regions preceding and following the coding region, e.g. 5&#x2032; untranslated (5&#x2032;UTR) or &#x201c;leader&#x201d; sequences and 3&#x2032; UTR or &#x201c;trailer&#x201d; sequences, as well as intervening sequences (introns) between individual coding segments (exons).</p><p id="p-0167" num="0159">Integrating vectors have their delivered RNA/DNA permanently incorporated into the host cell chromosomes. Non-integrating vectors remain episomal which means the nucleic acid contained therein is never integrated into the host cell chromosomes. Examples of integrating vectors include retroviral vectors, lentiviral vectors, hybrid adenoviral vectors, and herpes simplex viral vector.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0160">One example of a non-integrative vector is a non-integrative viral vector. Non-integrative viral vectors eliminate the risks posed by integrative retroviruses, as they do not incorporate their genome into the host DNA. One example is the Epstein Barr oriP/Nuclear Antigen-1 (&#x201c;EBNA1&#x201d;) vector, which is capable of limited self-replication and known to function in mammalian cells. As containing two elements from Epstein-Barr virus, oriP and EBNA1, binding of the EBNA1 protein to the virus replicon region oriP maintains a relatively long-term episomal presence of plasmids in mammalian cells. This particular feature of the oriP/EBNA1 vector makes it ideal for generation of integration-free iPSCs. Another non-integrative viral vector is adenoviral vector and the adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0161">Another non-integrative viral vector is RNA Sendai viral vector, which can produce protein without entering the nucleus of an infected cell. The F-deficient Sendai virus vector remains in the cytoplasm of infected cells for a few passages, but is diluted out quickly and completely lost after several passages (e.g., 10 passages).</p><p id="p-0170" num="0162">Another example of a non-integrative vector is a minicircle vector. Minicircle vectors are circularized vectors in which the plasmid backbone has been released leaving only the eukaryotic promoter and cDNA(s) that are to be expressed.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0163">As used herein, the term &#x201c;viral vector&#x201d; refers to a nucleic acid vector construct that includes at least one element of viral origin and has the capacity to be packaged into a viral vector particle. The viral vector can contain a nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide as described herein in place of non-essential viral genes. The vector and/or particle may be utilized for the purpose of transferring nucleic acids into cells either in vitro or in vivo. Numerous forms of viral vectors are known in the art.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="2">Administration</heading><p id="p-0172" num="0164">In various embodiments, the methods described herein relate to treating a subject having or diagnosed as having cancer (e.g., leukemia, colon cancer, or pancreatic cancer) having GSK3&#x3b1; puncta comprising administering an agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; in combination with an asparaginase as described herein. Subjects having cancer can be identified by a physician using current methods of diagnosing a condition. Symptoms and/or complications of cancer, which characterize this disease and aid in diagnosis are well known in the art. Tests that may aid in a diagnosis of, e.g., cancer, include blood tests and non-invasive imaging. A family history of a particular cancer will also aid in determining if a subject is likely to have the condition or in making a diagnosis of cancer.</p><p id="p-0173" num="0165">The agents described herein (e.g., an agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1;) and an asparaginase can be administered in combination to a subject having or diagnosed as having cancer (e.g., leukemia, colon cancer, or pancreatic cancer). Administration of an agent or asparaginase described herein can be performed in a variety of manners, for example, in a single dose, in reoccurring multiple doses, via continuous infusion, via pulsed administration. In one embodiment, an agent or asparaginase described herein can be administered to a subject at least once every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, or 24 hours; or every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 days; or every 1, 2, 3, or 4 weeks; or every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 months, or more. It is specifically contemplated herein that the dosing of an agent or asparaginase described herein is determined based on the half-life of the agent, e.g., such that the effect of the agent (for example, inhibition of GSK&#x3b1;) is continuous, or nearly continuous, in the subject. For example, if the half-life of a given GSK&#x3b1; inhibitor is 12hours, it would be administered every 12 hours to the subject such that it maintains continuous inhibition of GSK&#x3b1; in the subject.</p><p id="p-0174" num="0166">In one embodiment, the agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; and the asparaginase are administered in the same manner, e.g., the agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; and the asparaginase are administered in a single dose, in multiple doses, via continuous infusion, via pulsed administration. In one embodiment, the agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; and the asparaginase are administered in different manners, e.g., the agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; is administered via continuous infusion, and the asparaginase is administered in a single dose.</p><p id="p-0175" num="0167">In one embodiment agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; and the asparaginase are formulated together in one composition for administration. In one embodiment agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; and the asparaginase are formulated in separate compositions and are administered as separate compositions.</p><p id="p-0176" num="0168">In some embodiments, the methods described herein comprise administering an effective amount of the agents to a subject in order to alleviate at least one symptom of a given cancer.

As compared with an equivalent untreated control, such reduction is by at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99% or more as measured by any standard technique. A variety of means for administering the agents and/or an asparaginase described herein to subjects are known to those of skill in the art. In one embodiment, the agent is administered systemically or locally (e.g., to the affected organ, e.g., the colon). In one embodiment, the agent is administered intravenously. In one embodiment, the agent is administered continuously, in intervals, or sporadically. The route of administration of the agent will be optimized for the type of agent being delivered (e.g., an antibody, a small molecule, an RNAi), and can be determined by a skilled practitioner.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0169">The term &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; as used herein refers to the amount of an agent (e.g., an agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1;) and/or an asparaginase that can be administered to a subject having or diagnosed as having cancer (e.g., leukemia, colon cancer, or pancreatic cancer) needed to alleviate at least one or more symptom of cancer. The term &#x201c;therapeutically effective amount&#x201d; therefore refers to an amount of an agent and/or an asparaginase that is sufficient to provide a particular anti-cancer effect when administered to a typical subject. An effective amount as used herein, in various contexts, would also include an amount of an agent and/or an asparaginase sufficient to delay the development of a symptom of cancer, alter the course of a symptom of cancer (e.g., slowing the progression of cancer), or reverse a symptom of cancer. Thus, it is not generally practicable to specify an exact &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d;. However, for any given case, an appropriate &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using only routine experimentation.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0170">In one embodiment, the agent and/or an asparaginase is administered continuously (e.g., at constant levels over a period of time). Continuous administration of an agent can be achieved, e.g., by epidermal patches, continuous release formulations, or on-body injectors.</p><p id="p-0179" num="0171">Effective amounts, toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy can be evaluated by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals. The dosage can vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compositions and methods that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. A therapeutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. Also, a dose can be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the IC50 (i.e., the concentration of the agent, which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symptoms) as determined in cell culture, or in an appropriate animal model. Levels in plasma can be measured, for example, by high performance liquid chromatography. The effects of any particular dosage can be monitored by a suitable bioassay, e.g., measuring neurological function, or blood work, among others. The dosage can be determined by a physician and adjusted, as necessary, to suit observed effects of the treatment.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Dosage</heading><p id="p-0180" num="0172">&#x201c;Unit dosage form&#x201d; as the term is used herein refers to a dosage for suitable one administration. By way of example a unit dosage form can be an amount of therapeutic disposed in a delivery device, e.g., a syringe or intravenous drip bag. In one embodiment, a unit dosage form is administered in a single administration. In another, embodiment more than one unit dosage form can be administered simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0181" num="0173">Typically, the dosage ranges are between 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, inclusive. In some embodiments, the dosage range is from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to lg/kg body weight, from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 0.5 g/kg body weight, from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 0.1 g/kg body weight, from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 50 mg/kg body weight, from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 25 mg/kg body weight, from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 10 mg/kg body weight, from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 5 mg/kg body weight, from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 1 mg/kg body weight, from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 0.1 mg/kg body weight, from 0.001 mg/kg body weight to 0.005 mg/kg body weight. Alternatively, in some embodiments the dosage range is from 0.1 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 0.5 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 1 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 1.5 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 2 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 2.5 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 3 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 3.5 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 4 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 4.5 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight, from 4.8 g/kg body weight to 5 g/kg body weight. In one embodiment, the dose range is from 5 &#x3bc;g/kg body weight to 30 &#x3bc;g/kg body weight. Alternatively, the dose range will be titrated to maintain serum levels between 5 &#x3bc;g/mL and 30 &#x3bc;g/mL.</p><p id="p-0182" num="0174">The dosage of the agent and/or an asparaginase as described herein can be determined by a physician and adjusted, as necessary, to suit observed effects of the treatment. With respect to duration and frequency of treatment, it is typical for skilled clinicians to monitor subjects in order to determine when the treatment is providing therapeutic benefit, and to determine whether to administer further cells, discontinue treatment, resume treatment, or make other alterations to the treatment regimen. The dosage should not be so large as to cause adverse side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome. Generally, the dosage will vary with the age, condition, and sex of the patient and can be determined by one of skill in the art. The dosage can also be adjusted by the individual physician in the event of any complication.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="2">Combination Treatment</heading><p id="p-0183" num="0175">In one aspect, the agent and an asparaginase described herein are administered in combination for the treatment of cancer. Administered &#x201c;in combination,&#x201d; as used herein, means that two (or more) different treatments (e.g., an asparaginase and an agent that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1;, or a cancer therapy) are delivered to the subject during the course of the subject's affliction with the disorder, e.g., the two or more treatments are delivered after the subject has been diagnosed with the disorder (e.g., cancer) and before the disorder has been cured or eliminated or treatment has ceased for other reasons. In some embodiments, the delivery of one treatment is still occurring when the delivery of the second begins, so that there is overlap in terms of administration. This is sometimes referred to herein as &#x201c;simultaneous&#x201d; or &#x201c;concurrent delivery.&#x201d; In other embodiments, the delivery of one treatment ends before the delivery of the other treatment begins. In some embodiments of either case, the treatment is more effective because of combined administration. For example, the second treatment is more effective, e.g., an equivalent effect is seen with less of the second treatment, or the second treatment reduces symptoms to a greater extent, than would be seen if the second treatment were administered in the absence of the first treatment, or the analogous situation is seen with the first treatment. In some embodiments, delivery is such that the reduction in a symptom, or other parameter related to the disorder is greater than what would be observed with one treatment delivered in the absence of the other. The effect of the two treatments can be partially additive, wholly additive, or greater than additive. The delivery can be such that an effect of the first treatment delivered is still detectable when the second is delivered. The agents described herein and the at least one additional therapy can be administered simultaneously, in the same or in separate compositions, or sequentially. For sequential administration, the agent and/or an asparaginase described herein can be administered first, and the additional agent can be administered second, or the order of administration can be reversed. The agent and/or other therapeutic agents, procedures or modalities can be administered during periods of active disorder, or during a period of remission or less active disease. The agent can be administered before another treatment, concurrently with the treatment, post-treatment, or during remission of the disorder.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0176">When administered in combination, the agent and an asparaginase, or all, can be administered in an amount or dose that is higher, lower or the same as the amount or dosage of each agent used individually, e.g., as a monotherapy. In certain embodiments, the administered amount or dosage of the agent, the additional agent (e.g., second or third agent), or all, is lower (e.g., at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, or at least 50%) than the amount or dosage of each agent used individually. In other embodiments, the amount or dosage of agent, the additional agent (e.g., second or third agent), or all, that results in a desired effect (e.g., treatment of cancer) is lower (e.g., at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, or at least 50% lower) than the amount or dosage of each agent individually required to achieve the same therapeutic effect.</p><p id="p-0185" num="0177">In one embodiment, the cancer therapy is selected from the group consisting of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, surgery, hormone therapy, stem cell therapy, targeted therapy, gene therapy, and precision therapy.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0178">In other embodiments of any method described herein, the cancer therapy is selected from the group consisting of growth inhibitory agents, cytotoxic agents, anti-angiogenesis agents, apoptotic agents, anti-tubulin agents, anti-HER-2 antibodies, anti-CD20 antibodies, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonist, a HER1/EGFR inhibitor, a platelet derived growth factor inhibitor, a COX-2 inhibitor, an interferon, and a cytokine (e.g., G-CSF, granulocyte - colony stimulating factor).</p><p id="p-0187" num="0179">In other embodiments, the cancer therapy is selected from the group consisting of 13-cis-retinoic acid, 2-CdA, 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine, 5-Azacitidine, azacytidine, 5-Fluorouracil, 5-FU, 6-Mercaptopurine, 6-MP, 6-TG, 6-Thioguanine, abiraterone acetate, Abraxane, Accutane&#xae;, Actinomycin-D, Adriamycin&#xae;, Adrucil&#xae;, Afinitor&#xae;, Agrylin&#xae;, Ala-Cort&#xae;, Aldesleukin, Alemtuzumab, ALIMTA, Alitretinoin, Alkaban-AQ&#xae;, Alkeran&#xae;, All-transretinoic Acid, Alpha Interferon, Altretamine, Amethopterin, Amifostine, Aminoglutethimide, Anagrelide, Anandron&#xae;, Anastrozole, Arabinosylcytosine, Ara-C, Aranesp&#xae;, Aredia&#xae;, Arimidex&#xae;, Aromasin&#xae;, Arranon &#xae;, Arsenic Trioxide, Arzerra&#x2122;, Asparaginase, ATRA, Avastin&#xae;, Axitinib, Azacitidine, BCG, BCNU, Bendamustine, Bevacizumab, Bexarotene, BEXXAR&#xae;, Bicalutamide, BiCNU, Blenoxane &#xae;, Bleomycin, Bortezomib, Busulfan, Busulfex&#xae;, C225, Cabazitaxel, Calcium Leucovorin, Campath&#xae;

Since administration of parenteral dosage forms typically bypasses the patient's natural defenses against contaminants, parenteral dosage forms are preferably sterile or capable of being sterilized prior to administration to a patient. Examples of parenteral dosage forms include, but are not limited to, solutions ready for injection, dry products ready to be dissolved or suspended in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle for injection, suspensions ready for injection, controlled-release parenteral dosage forms, and emulsions.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0181">Suitable vehicles that can be used to provide parenteral dosage forms of the disclosure are well known to those skilled in the art.

Ideally, the use of an optimally designed controlled-release preparation in medical treatment is characterized by a minimum of drug substance being employed to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled-release formulations include: 1) extended activity of the drug; 2) reduced dosage frequency; 3) increased patient compliance; 4) usage of less total drug; 5) reduction in local or systemic side effects; 6) minimization of drug accumulation; 7) reduction in blood level fluctuations; 8) improvement in efficacy of treatment; 9) reduction of potentiation or loss of drug activity; and 10) improvement in speed of control of diseases or conditions. (Kim, Cherng-ju, Controlled Release Dosage Form Design, 2 (Technomic Publishing, Lancaster, Pa.: 2000)). Controlled-release formulations can be used to control a compound of formula (I)'s onset of action, duration of action, plasma levels within the therapeutic window, and peak blood levels. In particular, controlled- or extended-release dosage forms or formulations can be used to ensure that the maximum effectiveness of an agent is achieved while minimizing potential adverse effects and safety concerns, which can occur both from under-dosing a drug (i.e., going below the minimum therapeutic levels) as well as exceeding the toxicity level for the drug.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0184">A variety of known controlled- or extended-release dosage forms, formulations, and devices can be adapted for use with any agent described herein.

The inventors recently found that Wnt-induced inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) profoundly sensitizes drug-resistant leukemias to asparaginase (Hinze et al, Cancer Cell, 2019;35:664) and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/271,629, which are incorporated herein by reference in its entireties. This effect is mediated by a &#x3b2;-catenin independent branch of Wnt signaling termed Wnt-dependent stabilization of proteins (Wnt/STOP), which inhibits GSK3-dependent protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (Acebron et al, Mol Cell, 2014;54:663). Thus, asparaginase-resistant leukemias rely on catabolic protein degradation as an alternative source of amino acids to survive asparaginase therapy. Asparaginase resistance is selectively mediated by GSK3&#x3b1;, because its genetic or pharmacologic inhibition fully phenocopied Wnt-induced sensitization to asparaginase (p&#x3c;0.0001), whereas selective inhibition of GSK3&#x3b2; had no effect. This is surprising because GSK3&#x3b1; and GSK3&#x3b2; are closely related paralogs thought to be redundant for many of their biologic functions. Thus, work presented herein defines how asparaginase resistance is selectively dependent on GSK3&#x3b1; activity.</p><p id="p-0203" num="0257">To define the GSK3 domains responsible for asparaginase resistance, the inventors leveraged the fact that selective depletion of GSK3&#x3b1; induces profound sensitization to asparaginase, and this effect is rescued by expression of a cDNA encoding GSK3&#x3b1;, but not GSK3&#x3b2;. They thus tested whether asparaginase resistance could be restored by expression of a series of GSK3 alleles in which the N-terminal, kinase, and C-terminal domains of GSK3&#x3b1; and GSK3&#x3b2; were swapped in various configurations. This revealed that asparaginase resistance is dependent on the N-terminal domain of GSK3&#x3b1;, whereas the kinase and the C-terminal domain were interchangeable. Fusing the N-terminus of GSK3&#x3b1; to the kinase and C-terminal domains of GSK3&#x3b2; fully restored asparaginase resistance in GSK3&#x3b1; depleted T-ALL (p&#x3c;0.0001) and AML cells (p&#x3c;0.0001). By contrast, fusing the N-terminus of GSK3&#x3b2; to the kinase and C-terminus of GSK3&#x3b1; had no discernible effect on response to asparaginase (p=n.s.). To investigate how the N-terminus of GSK3&#x3b1; regulates asparaginase response, structural prediction algorithms were applied. This revealed that the N-terminal domain of GSK3&#x3b1; is a low-complexity (or prion-like) domain predicted to be intrinsically disordered, features associated with liquid-liquid phase separation. Phase separation is an increasingly recognized feature of cell biology that allows cells to concentrate components of important biochemical reactions in so-called membraneless organelles, thus promoting high-catalytic efficiency. Indeed, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy revealed that GSK3&#x3b1;, but not GSK3&#x3b2;, translocates into cytoplasmic bodies in response to asparagine depletion (p&#x3c;0.0001). The cytoplasmic GSK3&#x3b1; bodies were membraneless, as assessed by a proteinase K protection assay, and appeared to be distinct from known phase-separated compartments such as stress granules, P-bodies and aggresomes. However, cytoplasmic GSK3&#x3b1; bodies colocalized with the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), K48-linked ubiquitin and the proteasome, suggesting that these bodies function in protein unfolding, ubiquitination and degradation. Indeed, genetic depletion of either GSK3&#x3b1; or HSP70 blocked formation of phase-separated GSK3&#x3b1; bodies (p&#x3c;0.0001) and induced asparaginase sensitivity (p&#x3c;0.0001).</p><p id="p-0204" num="0258">To explore the clinical relevance of GSK3&#x3b1; body formation in response to asparagine starvation, a panel of matched asparaginase resistant vs. sensitive T-ALL, AML and B-ALL patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) were tested, and found that the ability of GSK3&#x3b1; to undergo phase separation significantly correlated with resistance to asparaginase in T-ALL, B-ALL and AML (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, p&#x3c;0.0001).</p><p id="p-0205" num="0259">Data presented herein support a model in which inducible phase separation of GSK3&#x3b1; and heat shock proteins represents a previously unrecognized response to amino acid starvation that concentrates the cellular machinery for protein degradation, thus allowing efficient catalysis of this alternative source of amino acids in response to amino acid starvation.</p><heading id="h-0022" level="1">Example 2</heading><p id="p-0206" num="0260">Asparaginase is a therapeutic enzyme that has long been known to kill leukemia cells by depleting the amino acid asparagine, but the development of resistance is a major clinical problem with a poor prognosis. Asparaginase has no known activity in colorectal cancer.

This adaptive response to asparagine starvation is absolutely dependent on the function of GSK3&#x3b1;.</p><p id="p-0208" num="0262">The current invention involves the discovery that activating protein degradation in response to asparaginase therapy involves the physical re-localization of GSK3&#x3b1; from its diffuse cytoplasmic localization at baseline into GSK3&#x3b1;-positive cytoplasmic puncta (e.g., GSK3&#x3b1; bodies), and that formation of these bodies is a biomarker of response to asparaginase in combination with a drug that inhibits GSK3&#x3b1; function. Therefore, formation of GSK3&#x3b1; bodies after short-term treatment of human tumor specimens with asparaginase represents a prognostic biomarker that will allow patient selection for therapy with the combination of asparaginase and a GSK3&#x3b1; inhibitor. GSK3&#x3b1; bodies can be readily visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy of asparaginase-treated cells. While this requires ex vivo treatment of primary human tumor specimens, exemplary methods for are applying biomarkers involving similar short-term ex vivo treatment of human tumors, e.g., are further described in international application WO 2018/081830, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The methods described herein would differ from the methods of international application WO 2018/081830 however, as the endpoint of the assay in this instant application is microscopy-based.</p><p id="p-0209" num="0263">We discovered GSK3&#x3b1; body formation by trying to understand our previous discovery that asparaginase resistance is solely dependent on GSK3&#x3b1;, and not its closely related homolog GSK3&#x3b1; (Hinze et al., 2019). The enzymatic domains of GSK3&#x3b1; and GSK3&#x3b2; are highly conserved, but the C- and N-termini of these enzymes are not well conserved. Using domain-swap experiments, we found that asparaginase resistance uniquely requires the N-terminal domain of GSK3&#x3b1;, whereas the enzymatic (kinase) and C-terminal domains of GSK3&#x3b1; and GSK3&#x3b2; are interchangeable (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The N-terminus of GSK3&#x3b1; does not appear to be related to any other protein domain, but domain prediction algorithms predict that this is a low-complexity domain highly enriched in small polar amino acids (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), features associated with liquid-liquid phase separation behavior.</p><p id="p-0210" num="0264">Liquid-liquid phase separation (or phase separation) is an increasingly recognized feature of cellular biology that allows cells to concentrate key components of specific biochemical reactions in so-called membraneless organelles, in order to promote catalysis of specific biochemical reactions.

Indeed, we found that asparagine starvation induces phase separation of GSK3&#x3b1; (and not GSK3&#x3b2;) into cytoplasmic puncta (which we call GSK3&#x3b1; bodies) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). This effect is uniquely dependent on the N-terminal domain of GSK3&#x3b1; because GSK3&#x3b2; does not undergo phase separation unless its N-terminus is swapped with that of GSK3&#x3b1;. We also confirmed that GSK3&#x3b1; bodies are membraneless cellular compartments based on proteinase protection assays (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). Formation of GSK3&#x3b1; bodies reflects the fact that cells are activating GSK3&#x3b1;-dependent protein degradation by concentrating GSK3&#x3b1; together with other core components of the cellular machinery for protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, in order to allow protein degradation to proceed at maximal catalytic efficiency in response to amino acid starvation.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0265">Formation of GSK3&#x3b1; bodies reflects the fact that cells are activating GSK3&#x3b1;-dependent protein degradation by concentrating GSK3&#x3b1; together with other key components of the cellular machinery for protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, in order to maximize efficiency of this biochemical reaction in response to asparaginase starvation.

In eukaryotic cells, amino acid starvation inhibits mTORC1 and activates GCN2 to orchestrate a network of adaptive responses. These include inhibition of protein synthesis to reduce amino acid consumption, upregulation of amino acid biosynthesis and transport, and increased generation of amino acids from lysosomal protein degradation by stimulating both autophagy and pinocytosis (1-5). However, increasing amino acid biogenesis and import cannot rescue cells from starvation of amino acids they are unable to synthesize. Moreover, some tissues such as the brain are unable to efficiently induce autophagy as a catabolic amino acid source during starvation (6). Proteasomal protein degradation is an alternative catabolic source of amino acids that accounts for the majority of basal protein degradation in mammalian cells (7, 8). While several studies have linked proteasomal function to the maintenance of amino acid homeostasis (9-11), the cellular and molecular mechanisms linking amino acid starvation to induction of proteasomal protein degradation are unknown.</p><p id="p-0217" num="0271">Mammals have two paralogs of glycogen synthase kinase 3, GSK3&#x3b1; and GSK3&#x3b2; (also known as GSK3A and GSK3B) that are largely redundant and ubiquitously expressed (12). However, GSK3&#x3b2; has received the bulk of the attention in the literature, in part because it is the only mammalian GSK3 paralog that can rescue embryonic development in GSK3-deficient drosophila (13, 14). A number of studies leveraging GSK3&#x3b1;-deficient mice have implicated a preferential role for this GSK3 paralog in diverse so-called cardiometabolic functions [reviewed in (15)]. However, the molecular basis for the paralog-selective effects of GSK3 proteins remain poorly understood.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0272">The inventors identified that activation of Wnt-dependent stabilization of proteins (Wnt/STOP), a &#x3b2;-catenin independent branch of Wnt signaling that inhibits GSK3-dependent protein degradation (16), induces a profound therapeutic vulnerability to asparagine depletion in acute leukemias and in colorectal cancer (17, 18). GSK3 can phosphorylate a large fraction of cellular proteins to form a phosphodegron that marks proteins for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, and Wnt-induced inhibition of GSK3 prolongs total cellular protein half-life and increases cell size (16, 19-21). The inventors also found that Wnt-induced asparaginase sensitization is uniquely dependent on GSK3&#x3b1; (17, 18), because GSK3&#x3b2; fully compensates for loss of GSK3&#x3b1; in canonical Wnt/&#x3b2;-catenin signaling (22-25). Using domain-swap experiments, the inventors show herein that resistance to asparagine starvation is selectively dependent on an N-terminal low-complexity domain unique to GSK3&#x3b1;. This domain mediates spatial sequestration of GSK3&#x3b1; and the ubiquitin proteasome system in response to amino acid starvation. It is specifically contemplated herein that GSK3&#x3b1; body formation provides a cellular mechanism to stimulate proteasomal protein degradation as a catabolic source of amino acids during starvation.</p><p id="p-0219" num="0273">Results</p><p id="p-0220" num="0274">Asparagine Starvation Triggers Spatial Sequestration of GSK3&#x3b1; in a Manner Dependent on its N-Terminal Low-Complexity Domain</p><p id="p-0221" num="0275">To define why asparaginase resistance is uniquely dependent on GSK&#x3b1; and not GSK3&#x3b2;, domain-swap approach was applied.

Such features have been associated with intrinsically disordered domains that mediate biomolecular condensation, which can promote the catalytic efficiency of specific biochemical reactions by concentrating their key factors in so-called membraneless organelles (29, 30).</p><p id="p-0223" num="0277">To test whether GSK3&#x3b1; undergoes spatial sequestration in response to asparaginase, we applied immunofluorescence using paralog-selective antibodies (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. S<b>4</b></figref>). We found that the GSK3&#x3b1; protein was broadly distributed at baseline, but asparaginase treatment triggered its condensation into distinct cytoplasmic puncta, which we termed GSK3&#x3b1; bodies (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). By contrast, GSK3&#x3b2; remained broadly distributed regardless of asparaginase therapy (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>), unless its N-terminus was swapped with that of GSK3&#x3b1; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. S<b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0224" num="0278">It was found that GSK3&#x3b1; body formation was a specific response to asparaginase among a panel of antileukemic drugs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>), arguing against a nonspecific cytotoxic response. Moreover, culturing these cells in media that was deficient of all nonessential amino acids was sufficient to trigger GSK3&#x3b1; body formation, and this effect was blocked by replenishing asparagine alone, but not the physiochemically similar amino acid glutamine (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). It was sought to determine whether GSK3&#x3b1; body formation might reflect its accumulation inside membrane-bound compartments as part of a starvation response, but found no significant co-staining of GSK3&#x3b1; bodies with established markers of autophagosomes, lysosomes or endosomes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0225" num="0279">It was then determined whether GSK3&#x3b1; bodies are membraneless using the proteinase K protection assay. Jurkat cells were treated with vehicle or asparaginase to trigger GSK3&#x3b1; body formation. As a positive control, treatment with Wnt3A was included, which triggers sequestration of GSK3 inside membrane-bound multivesicular endosomes (19). Following cytoplasmic membrane permeabilization with digitonin, cells were treated with proteinase K, and GSK3&#x3b1; protein levels were assessed by Western blot analysis. This revealed that GSK3&#x3b1; remained accessible to proteinase K digestion at baseline and in asparaginase-treated cells. By contrast, GSK3&#x3b1; was protected from protease digestion by treatment with Wnt3A, unless all membranes were permeabilized using Triton X-100 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). These findings indicate that GSK3&#x3b1; bodies are membraneless. No evidence was found to indicate that GSK3&#x3b1; accumulates in known membraneless cytoplasmic compartments, including stress granules, P-bodies or aggresomes, based on lack of co-staining with established markers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0226" num="0280">To test whether the N-terminus of GSK3&#x3b1; is sufficient to trigger spatial sequestration of a heterologous protein, expression constructs encoding the N-terminus of GSK3&#x3b1; fused to HaloTag were generated, which allows for covalent labeling and visualization of its fusion protein in live cells (31). The N-terminus of GSK3&#x3b2; was used as a negative control. Jurkat cells were transduced with these constructs, treated with vehicle or asparaginase, and we assessed HaloTag localization using its fluorescent ligand Oregon Green. This revealed that the N-terminus of GSK3&#x3b1;, but not GSK3&#x3b2;, was sufficient to drive HaloTag into cytoplasmic bodies in response to asparaginase therapy (Fig. S<b>9</b>).</p><p id="p-0227" num="0281">Asparagine Depletion Triggers Spatial Sequestration of GSK3&#x3b1; with the Ubiquitin Proteasome System</p><p id="p-0228" num="0282">The inventors' prior studies linking Wnt-induced inhibition of GSK3 to asparaginase sensitivity demonstrated that drug-resistant cancers tolerate asparaginase by relying on protein degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome system (17, 18). It was sought was to determine whether GSK3&#x3b1; body formation might provide a cellular mechanism to maximize the catalytic efficiency of proteasomal protein degradation by concentrating GSK3&#x3b1; and the ubiquitin proteasome system in response to amino acid starvation. Indeed, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that GSK3&#x3b1; bodies co-localized with ubiquitin (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>), which marks proteins for proteasomal degradation (8). Treatment with the ATP-competitive GSK3&#x3b1; inhibitor BRD0705 (24) did not block the ability of GSK3&#x3b1; to undergo biomolecular condensation in response to asparaginase, but did prevent accumulation of ubiquitin in GSK3&#x3b1; bodies (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref>), indicating that GSK3&#x3b1; bodies function in protein ubiquitination. GSK3&#x3b1; bodies also co-localized with the proteasome, as assessed by immunofluorescence for the proteasomal subunit PSMA4 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0229" num="0283">Heat shock proteins are required for degradation of misfolded proteins in some biomolecular condensates (32). Indeed, it was found that GSK3&#x3b1; bodies often co-localized with HSP70 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>) and to a lesser degree HSP90, but not HSC70 or HSP40 (Fig. S11, A-F). Inhibition of HSP70 using two structurally unrelated allosteric inhibitors (33, 34) blocked both GSK3&#x3b1; body formation and asparaginase resistance, and this effect was phenocopied by HSP70-targeting shRNAs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>). By contrast, inhibition of HSP90 had a subtle effect on GSK3&#x3b1; body formation, and no effect on asparaginase resistance (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">Fig. S<b>11</b></figref>, G and H). Thus, the enzymatic activity of HSP70 is required for GSK3&#x3b1; body formation.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0284">GSK3&#x3b1; Promotes Survival During Starvation of Essential Amino Acids</p><p id="p-0231" num="0285">It was then sought to determine if GSK3&#x3b1; body formation was stimulated by mTORC1 inhibition or GCN2 activation, which mediate the best-known responses to amino acid starvation (1, 3). However, inhibition or either mTORC1 or GCN2 was insufficient to trigger GSK3&#x3b1; body formation, and did not block asparaginase-induced GSK3&#x3b1; body formation (Fig. S<b>12</b>).</p><p id="p-0232" num="0286">The studies presented herein above indicated that depletion of asparagine was unique among nonessential amino acids in its ability to trigger GSK3&#x3b1; body formation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). However, proteasomal protein degradation is a catabolic source of all proteinogenic amino acids, thus it might be evolutionarily advantageous for such a response to be triggered by depletion of essential amino acids, which cannot be synthesized by mammalian cells. Indeed, culturing Jurkat cells in medium depleted only of essential amino acids was sufficient to trigger GSK3&#x3b1; body formation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). Individual essential amino acid depletion experiments revealed that formation of GSK3&#x3b1; bodies was a unique response to individual depletion of leucine or valine, in addition to asparagine (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). By contrast, individual depletion of any other essential amino acid was insufficient to trigger this response. It was noted that while leucine deficiency is known to be sensed directly to inhibit mTORC1 activity via the Rag GTPase pathway (35), neither valine nor asparagine are known to have direct sensors in this pathway. Moreover, depletion of methionine and arginine, which are sensed by this pathway to inhibit mTORC1 (36, 37), failed to trigger GSK3&#x3b1; body formation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). These findings strengthen the argument that GSK3&#x3b1; body formation is regulated by mechanisms distinct from those that couple amino acid availability to mTORC1.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0287">It was then sought to determine whether GSK3&#x3b1; promotes survival in response to starvation of these amino acids. Treatment with the GSK3&#x3b1; inhibitor BRD0705 impaired viability of Jurkat cells cultured in leucine- or valine-deficient medium, and the toxicity of GSK3&#x3b1; inhibition was rescued by replenishing the missing amino acid, but not isoleucine as a negative control (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>). It was then asked whether GSK3&#x3b1; promotes the survival of normal cells in response to essential amino acid starvation, using normal human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors or CCD841 cells derived from normal human intestinal epithelium (38). It was found that essential amino acid starvation triggered GSK3&#x3b1; body formation in these cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>). Moreover, the GSK3&#x3b1; inhibitor BRD0705 impaired survival under essential amino acid starvation, whereas the structurally related negative control BRD5648 (24) had no effect (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0234" num="0288">GSK3&#x3b1; Body Formation Predicts Asparaginase Response in Human Leukemia.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0289">If formation of GSK3&#x3b1; bodies mediates resistance to asparagine starvation, then the ability of human leukemia cells to form these bodies should predict asparaginase response. To test this prediction, a cohort of human leukemias was leveraged, including established cell lines and primary patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Assessment of asparaginase cytotoxicity to these cases revealed a generally binary pattern of response, allowing their classification as either asparaginase sensitive or resistant (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">Fig. S<b>14</b></figref>, A and B). It was found that the ability of these cells to form GSK3&#x3b1; bodies after short-term culture with asparaginase was a strong predictor of asparaginase resistance, both in leukemia cell lines and PDX models (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B</figref>). Assessment of the performance of GSK3&#x3b1; body formation as a prognostic biomarker using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that GSK3&#x3b1; body formation robustly discriminates asparaginase-sensitive versus resistant leukemias in this cohort (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>). It was also asked whether GSK3&#x3b1; body formation correlates with clinical treatment response in this cohort of PDX models derived from patients with B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with asparaginase-intensive combination chemotherapy on contemporary clinical trials (data not shown). It was found that samples collected at diagnosis from patients with who went on to have an excellent treatment response were unable to efficiently induce GSK3&#x3b1; bodies in response to asparaginase. By contrast, GSK3&#x3b1; body formation was robust in samples that relapsed after this asparaginase-based treatment regimen (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>C</figref>).</p><p id="p-0236" num="0290">It was asked whether GSK3&#x3b1; body formation might allow the prospective identification of asparaginase-resistant cases that will prove sensitive to this combination, and distinguish these from cases that are resistant due to alternative mechanisms of asparaginase resistance. Indeed, asparaginase-resistant leukemia cell lines and PDX models that proved sensitive to the combination of asparaginase and the GSK3&#x3b1; inhibitor BRD0705 were able to form GSK3&#x3b1; bodies much more robustly than those that proved resistant to this combination (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>F, <b>21</b>D, <b>21</b>E</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">Figure S<b>14</b></figref>, C and D).</p><heading id="h-0025" level="1">DISCUSSION</heading><p id="p-0237" num="0291">Data presented herein highlight that the tolerance of asparagine starvation is dependent on an N-terminal low-complexity domain of GSK3&#x3b1; that is lacking in its paralog GSK3&#x3b2;. In response to amino acid starvation, this domain mediates spatial sequestration of GSK3&#x3b1;, together with the cellular machinery for protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, in membraneless cytoplasmic bodies. GSK3&#x3b1; body formation is stimulated in response to depletion of specific amino acids, including asparagine, leucine, and valine, indicating the existence of unknown cellular sensors for these amino acids. GSK3&#x3b1; promotes the survival of normal hematopoietic cells in response to essential amino acid starvation. Moreover, the ability of human leukemias to form GSK3&#x3b1; bodies predicts resistance to asparaginase, and sensitivity to asparaginase in combination with a small molecule GSK3&#x3b1; inhibitor. Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, it is specifically contemplated herein that spatial sequestration of GSK3&#x3b1; with core components of the ubiquitin proteasome system provides a cellular mechanism to promote the catalytic efficiency of this catabolic source of amino acids in response to amino acid starvation. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) has recently been shown to undergo phase separation in the nucleus in response to hyperosmotic stress, where it functions to degrade disassembled ribosomal proteins (39). Data presented herein indicate that the propensity of the UPS to undergo phase separation has been exploited for evolution of this inducible response to amino acid starvation. Deciphering the molecular regulation of this adaptive response will require the discovery and manipulation of the relevant molecules that sense amino acid insufficiency and signal this to GSK3&#x3b1; and the UPS. Data presented herein also indicates that the unique role of GSK3&#x3b1; in the amino acid starvation response may be one factor behind its evolutionary conservation, despite ubiquitous expression of its paralog GSK3&#x3b2;, which is largely redundant (12, 23).</p><p id="p-0238" num="0292">While ATP-competitive inhibitors with approximately 8-fold selectivity for GSK3&#x3b1; over GSK3&#x3b2;can be developed (24), the ATP-binding pockets of these paralogs differ by a single amino acid, leading to some uncertainty over the degree to which this specificity can be further improved. Given the practical constraints of drug dosing in human patients, effectively inhibiting GSK3&#x3b1; with such small molecules will require doses that will result in at least partial inhibition of GSK3&#x3b2;. This approach is expected to have toxicity, because inhibiting both GSK3 paralogs results in activation of oncogenic (3-catenin signaling (23). By contrast, GSK3 &#x3b1; deficient mice are viable and have no known tumor predisposition (40). Thus, the data presented herein indicate an alternative approach for selective inhibition of GSK3&#x3b1; by selectively blocking its ability to undergo biomolecular condensation in response to asparagine starvation. The data presented herein also indicate that GSK3&#x3b1; body formation may provide a useful prognostic biomarker that will allow future clinical trials of asparaginase in combination with GSK3&#x3b1; inhibitors to be targeted to those patients most likely to derive meaningful clinical benefit.</p><heading id="h-0026" level="1">REFERENCES</heading><p id="p-0239" num="0293">1.
