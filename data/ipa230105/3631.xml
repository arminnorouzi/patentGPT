For example, particle-type differentiation, and even identification in some cases, can be aided by the knowledge of a particle's 3D form. Such information is also useful to estimate particle volume. Methods are available to resolve or reconstruct the 3D form of particles of this size, such as confocal microscopy and X-ray, electron, or optical tomographic microscopy. In most cases, these methods require fixing particles to a transparent stage, trapping them optically, or confining them in a liquid. As such, they are not useful in cases where particles must be observed in free space without contact or confinement. Aerosols are one example where contact-free imaging is preferred to avoid shape-related particle collection artifacts, or is required, as is the case for ice or liquid-drop particles</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a previous work with digital holography (DH), a particle or a collection of particles is illuminated by a laser beam and the interference pattern, i.e., hologram, produced by the particle's forward scattered light and the beam is recorded by a CCD sensor. Applying Fresnel-Kirchhoff scalar diffraction theory to the hologram then yields a silhouette-like 2D image of the particle from the perspective of the beam direction. By pulsing the laser at the &#x2dc;200 ns time scale, free-flowing particles can be imaged, and a number of additional useful quantiles can be derived such as the particle's scattering pattern to and extinction cross section.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other examples of 2D imaging include investigations of laboratory generated aerosols and the HOLODEC instrument, where cloud aerosol particles are observed from aircraft in the field. Other work that achieves 3D imaging via DH or related methods. However, in these cases, the particles under study are trapped or confined in some way such that they reside within the depth of focus of a microscope objective. This restricts the sensing volume to micrometers, or millimeters at most, in the axial direction.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there is a need to use DH to provide an approximate realization of the 3D form of a free-flowing particle or cluster of particles without trapping and without lenses such that a large sensing volume is achieved.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the present invention are directed toward apparatus for and methods of obtaining images of free-flowing aerosol particles from three orthogonal directions using digital holography. Embodiments of the invention generally use diode lasers of different wavelengths to simultaneously illuminate flowing particles and form digital holograms on separate sensors. Images of the same particles from orthogonal perspectives are reconstructed from these holograms and used to infer the three-dimensional structure of the particles. The apparatus employs inexpensive components and does not require lenses to achieve the imaging, giving it a large sensing volume.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the present invention permit images of particles to be obtained from three directions in a contact-free manner. In certain embodiments of the present invention no lenses are used, which provides a large working volume and enables high through put of particle material. The described algorithms are used to approximately reconstruct single or multiple particle morphology in three dimensions.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the present invention can be manufactured from relatively inexpensive parts and have a small form factor enabling use of the present invention, for example, on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or as a sensor network. The 3D particle-information provided could aid in particle classification, identification, or differentiation. In one embodiment, there is provided an imaging apparatus for creating a three-dimensional image of particles suspended within a fluid. The imaging apparatus comprises a housing configured to receive a flow of the fluid containing the particles, and first, second, and third lasers configured to emit respective first, second, and third laser beams into the housing. Each of the first, second, and third lasers are oriented such that each of the first, second, and third laser beams are directed into the housing at an angle that is substantially orthogonal to each of the other laser beams. The apparatus further comprises first, second, and third optical sensors located within the housing and positioned opposite the first, second, and third lasers, respectively. Each of the first, second, and third optical sensors are operable to generate a two-dimensional silhouette of the particles passing through the housing.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, there is provided a method of forming a three-dimensional image of particles suspended within a fluid. The method comprises introducing the fluid comprising the particles to an imaging apparatus and illuminating the particles by simultaneously emitting first, second, and third laser beams from first, second, and third lasers, respectively, into the imaging apparatus. The illuminating forms a plurality of two-dimensional particle silhouettes on first, second, and third optical sensors positioned opposite the first, second, and third lasers, respectively. The three-dimensional image is formed using the plurality of two-dimensional particle silhouettes.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additional features of the present invention are described in more detail in the following pages.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a perspective view of an orthographic imaging apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a top internal view of the orthographic imaging apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and also shows the unscattered and scattered light from the particles that forms the holograms;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is a coordinate system showing the three sensor surfaces from the imaging apparatus of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, and defining the sensor surface (37), the particles (80), and the physical and reconstruction wave vectors, k&#x2032;<sub>n </sub>and k<sub>n</sub>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a coordinate system showing contrast holograms I<sub>r</sub><sup>con</sup>, I<sub>g</sub><sup>con</sup>, and I<sub>b</sub><sup>con</sup>, wherein I<sub>r</sub><sup>con </sup>is shown on the plane formed by axes x&#x2032; and y&#x2032;, I<sub>g</sub><sup>con </sup>is shown on the plane formed by axes y&#x2032; and z&#x2032;, and I<sub>g</sub><sup>con </sup>is shown on the plane formed by axes x&#x2032; and z&#x2032;;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a coordinate system showing two-dimensional particle silhouettes for each viewing direction of three orthogonally arranged sensors formed using the contrast holograms of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> is an electron micrograph of glass sphere particles with &#x2dc;50 &#x3bc;m diameter;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a coordinate system showing contrast holograms I<sub>r</sub><sup>con</sup>, I<sub>g</sub><sup>con</sup>, and I<sub>b</sub><sup>con</sup>, wherein I<sub>r</sub><sup>con </sup>is shown on the plane formed by axes x&#x2032; and y&#x2032;, I<sub>g</sub><sup>con </sup>is shown on the plane formed by axes y&#x2032; and z&#x2032;, and I<sub>b</sub><sup>con </sup>is shown on the plane formed by axes x&#x2032; and z&#x2032;;;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a coordinate system showing particle silhouettes generated from the holograms of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> for a single particle-cluster;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is an electron micrograph of pollen grains, which are &#x2dc;21-22 &#x3bc;m diameter.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, an exemplary orthographic imaging apparatus <b>10</b> is shown. In the embodiment shown, imaging apparatus <b>10</b> generally comprises central housing <b>20</b>. In certain embodiments, housing <b>20</b> is in the form of a hollow &#x201c;mounting&#x201d; cube. Housing <b>20</b> may be constructed of various materials, such as metals (such as aluminum), plastics, ceramics, and the like. Housing <b>20</b> further comprises inlet port <b>22</b> and outlet port <b>24</b>, through which the particles to be imaged are permitted to enter and exit internal chamber <b>26</b>, as described in greater detail below. Housing <b>20</b> and other components of imaging apparatus <b>10</b> may be of various sizes and dimensions, depending on the particular application. However, in certain embodiments, housing <b>20</b> is sized so as to provide an imaging volume within internal particle chamber <b>26</b> of about 0.1 cm<sup>3 </sup>to about 100 cm<sup>3</sup>, preferably about 0.5 cm<sup>3 </sup>to about 50 cm<sup>3</sup>, and more preferably about 1 cm<sup>3 </sup>to about 10 cm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Apparatus <b>10</b> further comprises first laser <b>32</b>, second laser <b>42</b>, and third laser <b>52</b>. Each laser (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>52</b>) is configured to emit a beam into internal particle chamber <b>26</b> of central housing <b>20</b>. In certain embodiments, each laser (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>52</b>) is oriented substantially orthogonal to each of the other lasers (i.e., at right angles relative to each other). Thus, when viewed in a three-dimensional coordinate system, one laser is positioned to emit light along the x axis, another laser is positioned to emit light along the y axis, and the final laser is positioned to emit light along the z axis. In certain embodiments, one or more of first laser <b>32</b>, second laser <b>42</b>, and/or third laser <b>52</b> is a diode laser. In certain embodiments, each laser (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>52</b>) is configured to emit a laser beam at a different wavelength. For example, lasers (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>52</b>) can be configured to emit beams as different colors within the visible light spectrum (e.g., red, blue, and green). In certain embodiments, a first laser beam is emitted from first laser <b>32</b> and comprises (consists of, or consists essentially of) red light having an average wavelength of about 635 nm to about 700 nm. In certain embodiments, a second laser beam is emitted from second laser <b>42</b> and comprises (consists of, or consists essentially of) green light having an average wavelength of about 520 nm to about 560 nm. In certain embodiments, a third laser beam is emitted from third laser <b>52</b> and comprises (consists of, or consists essentially of) blue light having an average wavelength of about 450 nm to about 490 nm. In certain embodiments, first laser <b>32</b>, second laser <b>42</b>, and third laser <b>52</b> are positioned adjacent first elongated tube <b>30</b>, second elongated tube <b>40</b>, and third elongated tube <b>50</b>, respectively. In the embodiment shown, each of first elongated tube <b>30</b>, second elongated tube <b>40</b>, and third elongated tube <b>50</b> are coupled to, and preferably attached to, housing <b>20</b>. Thus, in certain such embodiments, each laser (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>52</b>) is configured to emit a beam through the corresponding elongated tube (<b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>) into particle chamber <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">First elongated tube <b>30</b>, second elongated tube <b>40</b>, and third elongated tube <b>50</b> are each generally configured to direct laser beams emitted from respective lasers (<b>32</b>, <b>43</b>, <b>52</b>) into particle chamber <b>26</b> of housing <b>20</b>. In certain embodiments, the elongated tubes (<b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>) may be in the form of lens tubes, which can be configured to mount lasers (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>52</b>) and/or direct the laser beams emitted from lasers (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>52</b>) into particle chamber <b>26</b> while shielding particle chamber <b>26</b> from interference from external light. Thus, elongated tubes (<b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>) are similarly oriented substantially orthogonal to each of the other elongated tubes (i.e., at right angles relative to each other). That is, when viewed in a three-dimensional coordinate system, one of the elongated tubes is positioned along the x axis, another of the elongated tubes is positioned along the y axis, and the final of the elongated tubes is positioned along the z axis.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In certain embodiments, one or more (or all three) of first elongated tube <b>30</b>, second elongated tube <b>40</b>, and third elongated tube <b>50</b> do not include a lens. That is, when the laser beams are emitted from lasers (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>52</b>), the laser beams do not pass through glass or other clear lens materials before entering particle chamber <b>26</b>. Advantageously, the absence of lenses in the elongated tubes (<b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>) provides a larger working volume for particle image capture and enables a higher through-put of particle material than prior imaging systems. Elongated tubes (<b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>) may be of various dimensions as needed or desired for the particular application. In certain embodiments, one or more of elongated tubes (<b>30</b>, <b>40</b>, <b>50</b>) may have an average diameter of about 1 mm to about 100 mm, preferably about 10 mm to about 50 mm.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In certain embodiments, imaging apparatus <b>10</b> further comprises optical sensors (<b>36</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>56</b>) within housing <b>20</b> opposite each laser (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>52</b>) (i.e., positioned along the same axis and facing the laser).

In certain embodiments, one or more of optical sensors (<b>36</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>56</b>) is a board-level monochrome CMOS sensor. Optical sensors (<b>36</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>56</b>) are operable to create a hologram of the particles introduced into housing <b>20</b>.

For example, in certain embodiments, optical sensor <b>36</b> comprises a red bandpass filter (not shown, but similar to <b>48</b> and <b>58</b> below) configured to permit only light having a wavelength of about 635 nm to about 700 nm to pass through and be detected by optical sensor <b>36</b>.

As described above, three individual lasers (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>52</b>) are positioned along separate axes and arranged at right angles relative to each other. Lasers (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>52</b>) operate to simultaneously emit laser beams toward internal particle chamber <b>26</b> located within housing <b>20</b>. Preferably, each laser beam is transmitted at a different wavelength. In certain embodiments, before introducing particles <b>80</b> into imaging apparatus <b>10</b>, a plurality of two-dimensional background images is captured by optical sensors (<b>36</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>56</b>) by simultaneously pulsing a first laser beam, a second laser beam, and a third laser beam from first laser <b>32</b>, second laser <b>42</b>, and third laser <b>52</b>, respectively, into housing <b>20</b>, and particularly into particle chamber <b>26</b>, thereby exposing sensors (<b>36</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>56</b>) when no particles are present. To begin capture of the particle images, a free-flowing fluid comprising a quantity of particles <b>80</b> suspended therein is introduced into internal particle chamber <b>26</b> of housing <b>20</b>. In certain embodiments, the quantity of particles <b>80</b> is in the form of an aerosol composition, with particles <b>80</b> suspended in air or other gas. In certain embodiments, the quantity of particles <b>80</b> has an average particle size (measured as the largest diameter) of about 0.1 &#x3bc;m to about 1000 &#x3bc;m, preferably about 0.5 &#x3bc;m to about 500 &#x3bc;m, more preferably about 1 &#x3bc;m to about 100 &#x3bc;m, and most preferably about 20 &#x3bc;m to about 50 &#x3bc;m. In certain embodiments, the quantity of particles <b>80</b> are introduced by feeding (actively or passively) the fluid comprising particles <b>80</b> through inlet port <b>22</b>. In certain embodiments, the fluid comprising particles <b>80</b> is directed through inlet port <b>22</b> using inlet conduit <b>60</b> positioned adjacent inlet port <b>22</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. The flow rate of the fluid and particles <b>80</b> will largely depend on the size of internal chamber <b>26</b> and holes <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. However, the fluid comprising particles <b>80</b> is generally fed through inlet port <b>22</b> at a velocity of about 0.1 m/s to about 100 m/s, preferably about 0.5 m/s to about 50 m/s, and more preferably about 1 m/s to about 10 m/s. Once particles <b>80</b> are within internal chamber <b>26</b> of housing <b>20</b>, the particles are illuminated by simultaneously pulsing a first laser beam, a second laser beam, and a third laser beam, emitted from first laser <b>32</b>, second laser <b>42</b>, and third laser <b>52</b>, respectively. During the pulsing, the laser beams emitted by each laser simultaneously impinge upon respective surfaces of particles <b>80</b>. In certain embodiments, the illuminating comprises simultaneously emitting each laser beam from lasers (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>52</b>) for a duration of about 1 nanosecond to about 1000 nanoseconds, preferably about 50 nanoseconds to about 500 nanoseconds, and more preferably about 100 nanoseconds to about 250 nanoseconds.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The illuminating forms a plurality of two-dimensional particle silhouettes on optical sensors (<b>36</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>56</b>). In certain embodiments, the plurality of particle silhouettes is formed by subtracting the plurality of two-dimensional background images (without particles) from the plurality of two-dimensional images captured during illuminating the particles. As noted above, optical sensors (<b>36</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>56</b>) are positioned opposite each respective laser (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>52</b>). Thus, each sensor (<b>36</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>56</b>) records a hologram of the particles <b>80</b> as viewed directly across from lasers (<b>32</b>, <b>42</b>, <b>52</b>). Each hologram is then used to reconstruct a two-dimensional image of the particles. The plurality of two-dimensional silhouette images is then used to form a three-dimensional representation of the particles <b>80</b> in space, as described in the examples below.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Finally, after illuminating and image capturing, the fluid comprising particles <b>80</b> may be removed from imaging apparatus <b>10</b>, specifically from internal particle chamber <b>26</b>, through outlet port <b>24</b>. In certain embodiments, the fluid comprising particles <b>80</b> is removed through outlet port <b>26</b> using outlet conduit <b>70</b>, and preferably a vacuum conduit such as a nozzle, positioned adjacent outlet port <b>26</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Additional advantages of the various embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art upon review of the disclosure herein and the working examples below.

It is to be understood, however, that these examples are provided by way of illustration and nothing therein should be taken as a limitation upon the overall scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">This example presents an experiment where three two-dimensional (2D) images of several types of free-flowing aerosol particles are obtained using in-line digital holography (DH) without the need to collect, confine, or otherwise trap the particles. Two specific types of particles are considered: individual spherical glass particles and aggregates of optically opaque sphere-like pollen grains in a non-spherical arrangement. The multiple 2D images are generated by a focusing procedure and are then back-projected into the sensing volume (discussed below) to infer the 3D shape of the particle or cluster. The geometry of a sphere is used as a &#x201c;base element,&#x201d; or geometric primitive, to express the 3D form because the particles are either spheres or clusters thereof.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> achieves this goal. A hollow mounting cube with 25.4 mm diameter threaded holes through each face is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. In three of the holes that share a common cube-corner are 25.4 mm diameter lens tubes (although no lenses are used). Mounted to the ends of each tube is a diode laser (DL), each emitting at a different wavelength: &#x3bb;<sub>T</sub>=660 nm or &#x201c;red&#x201d; for short, &#x3bb;<sub>g</sub>=520 nm, or &#x201c;green,&#x201d; and &#x3bb;<sub>b</sub>=450 nm, &#x201c;blue.&#x201d; The beam path for the blue and green DLs can be seen in the side view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. Opposite each DL at the far cube-face is a bandpass filter, corresponding to the DL's wavelength, followed by a board-level monochrome CMOS sensor. A hole &#x2dc;1 mm in diameter is drilled through the cube along its main diagonal from one apex to another as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>. The hole allows an aerosol stream to be passed from top to bottom through the central region of the cube where the particles are simultaneously illuminated by the three orthogonal DLs and the resulting holograms are recorded.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Board-level sensors are used to allow the hologram recording to be as close to the aerosol stream as practical, which improves the eventual image resolution and gives the apparatus a small form-factor of approximately 10&#xd7;10&#xd7;10 cm. These sensors (FLIR, BFS-U3-50S5-BD) have an array size of 2448&#xd7;2048 pixels, with a pixel size of 3.45&#xd7;3.45 &#x3bc;m, and a global shutter readout. Clear hologram fringes are recorded by pulsing the DLs simultaneously to emit for a 200 ns period after the electronic-shutter activation, having the effect of freezing-out the particle motion.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The purpose of the bandpass filters is to ensure that only light from the DL across the cube from a sensor reaches that sensor's surface. In other words, the filters prevent optical &#x201c;cross talk&#x201d; between the sensors. This is preferable to pulsing the DLs sequentially because the likelihood that the particles would change orientation between each pulse.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Because each hologram is formed by illuminating the same group of particles from a different orthogonal direction, the 3D form of a given particle can be inferred from the 2D images, or &#x201c;views,&#x201d; that are reconstructed from each hologram. As will be seen below, this inference is incomplete and only approximate, yet is vastly better than what is typically achieved from a single viewing direction in lensless DH.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Particle-image reconstruction begins with a background measurement, which is simply an exposure of the sensors to the DL pulses when no particles are present. This background is then subtracted from the same measurement when the particles are present.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The result is a contrast hologram I<sup>con </sup>of which there are three corresponding to the orthogonal views: I<sub>r</sub><sup>con</sup>, I<sub>g</sub><sup>con </sup>and I<sub>b</sub><sup>con</sup>. Both the particle-free and particle-present exposures are obtained with synchronized DL pulses &#x2dc;200 ns in duration.

Evaluating |K<sub>n</sub>|<sup>2 </sup>gives the 2D particle image for n<sup>th </sup>view by iteratively adjusting the value of d<sub>n </sub>until the image develops a clear focus using a simple sharpness metric.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0044">The 2D views must then be assessed in 3D space in a way that best conveys a particle's 3D form. To explain how this is done, refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, where the sensor surfaces are shown in the sensor coordinate system (x&#x2032;, y&#x2032;, z&#x2032;), abbreviated as SCS, along with the corresponding DL wave vectors, k&#x2032;<sub>n</sub>. Equation (1) is evaluated for each I<sub>n</sub><sup>con </sup>using auxiliary coordinates (&#x3b7;&#x2032;, &#x3be;&#x2032;) and a reconstruction wave vector k<sub>n</sub>=&#x2212;k&#x2032;<sub>n</sub>, where the coordinate associated with k<sub>n </sub>is perpendicular to the (&#x3b7;&#x2032;, &#x3be;&#x2032;) plane. The particle images then reside in the particle coordinate system (x, y, z), or PCS. For example, consider the red viewing direction, n=r. Here, the auxiliary coordinates would be &#x3b7;&#x2032;=x&#x2032; and &#x3be;&#x2032;=y&#x2032; because I<sub>r</sub><sup>con </sup>resides in the (x&#x2032;, y&#x2032;) plane in the SCS. If the physical wave vector k&#x2032;<sub>r</sub>=k<sub>r</sub>{circumflex over (z)} were used to evaluate Eq. (1), the particle image would be generated in the (&#x3b7;=x, &#x3be;=y) plane in the PCS at a distance d<sub>r </sub>along the negative z-axis, i.e., one obtains the virtual particle-image.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0045">Using the reconstruction wave vector k<sub>r </sub>generates the image along the positive z-axis where the particles actually reside. In other words, the reconstruction uses the backpropagation of the DL light. Alternatively, k&#x2032;<sub>r </sub>can be used provided d<sub>r</sub>&#x2192;&#x2212;d<sub>r</sub>, which can be seen to have the same effect from Eq. (2). Once reconstructed, the three 2D images are positioned in the PCS such that each corresponds to the geometric projection of the particles along a given viewing direction.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C</figref> show an example of orthographic imaging of free-flowing 50 &#x3bc;m &#x2205; spherical aerosol particles.

Evaluating Eq. (1) as described in the text generates the 2D particle silhouettes for each viewing direction, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. The holograms and silhouettes are color-coded to match the DL light. The dashed lines show how the center points of the silhouettes are back-projected into 3D space to identify the location of each particle, where a sphere is then drawn. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> is an electron micrograph of the glass sphere with &#x2dc;50 &#x3bc;m diam.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0047">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C</figref>, the particles are a powder of glass microspheres with mean radii of R<sub>s</sub>=25 &#x3bc;m that are aerosolized and passed to the injection nozzle (IN), such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. A large number of particles pass through the beams at &#x2dc;1 m/s velocity and are removed by another nozzle (VN) by a weak vacuum line. Simultaneously pulsing the DLs results in the contrast holograms shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, which are color-coded to match the DL wavelengths. Each exhibit an intricate fringe pattern with features associated with individual particles. Application of Eq. (1) to these holograms yields the orthographic images shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> in the PCS where the silhouettes are color coded similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. Note that the holograms in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> are slightly cropped to a square size of 2048&#xd7;2048 pixels rather than the full-sensor size of 2448&#xd7;2048 pixels.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0048">By surveying the relative positions of all silhouettes in the three views in the PCS, it is usually possible to identify a &#x201c;fiducial&#x201d; silhouette in each view that corresponds to the same, single particle. A circle is then drawn enclosing this silhouette in each view, defining three radii R<sub>r</sub>, R<sub>g</sub>, and R<sub>b</sub>. From each radius, a scale factor a<sub>n </sub>is determined such that the radii equal the known particle size, i.e., a<sub>r</sub>R<sub>r</sub>=a<sub>g</sub>R<sub>g</sub>=a<sub>b</sub>R<sub>b</sub>=R<sub>s</sub>. This procedure addresses the different image-magnification effects due to the different wavelengths and the divergence of the DL beams, which is approximately 10&#xb0;. The centers of these circles allow the views to be correctly positioned in the PCS by translating each image in its own plane such that back projection of the circles corresponds to the center of a single spherical particle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows dashed lines denoting this back-projection to two spheres from the corresponding view silhouettes. Note that the 3D sphere shapes here are artificially drawn, i.e., they are geometric primitives, while the silhouettes are real images that validate the use of these primitives.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0049">Once the scale factors a<sub>n </sub>are identified, other particle types can be investigated with the PCS axes now scaled to micrometers. An example is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B</figref>, and <b>3</b>C, which shows orthographic imaging of a ragweed pollen aerosol. In this example, a powder of dried, dead ragweed pollen grains is used as the particle source. These are sphere-like particles approximately 20-30 &#x3bc;m diameter with an echinate surface that promotes clustering of individual grains. As such, the use of spheres as geometric primitives is again justified. In analogy to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows the contrast holograms and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows the particle silhouettes generated from those holograms for a single particle-cluster. Following alignment of the 2D views via inscribing circles as described in the text, sphere primitives of equal size are placed in 3D space such that their projections onto each of the image planes best agree with the structure seen in each silhouette. To provide more detail, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> also shows different perspectives of the blue and green views to highlight the correspondence between the silhouettes and the placement of the spheres. The isolated pollen grain labeled (*) is not associated with a sphere because it is visible only in the green view. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> shows an electron micrograph of the pollen grains, which are &#x2dc;21-22 &#x3bc;m diam.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0050">The imaging process and results of this example are described in greater detail below. As noted above, the contrast holograms are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and the resulting views are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. As before, a circle enclosing the silhouette of a single cluster is drawn in each view and the views are then positioned in 3D space via the circles' centers in the PCS. Once positioned, 22 &#x3bc;m diameter spheres are placed in the PCS such that their projections onto the image planes approximately agree with the silhouettes. This sphere size is determined from the blue and green views, where outlines of individual grains in most of the cluster can be discerned. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows the result of this process, where the blue and green-views are included as insets. Close inspection reveals a small degree of misalignment between the spheres and projections, which is more an effect of parallax than misplacement. Small-scale features of the cluster are not captured by this process such as the surface roughness of individual grains and void spaces between grains. This is due to the limited image-resolution of the apparatus, which is estimated as 10 &#x3bc;m from the features that do appear clear in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. One can also see a lone grain silhouette in the green view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> indicated by (*) that is not seen in the other views, and thus, is not represented by a sphere.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0051">The utility of this imaging approach can be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> in that if one were provided a single view only, it would be unlikely to generate a reasonable 3D rendering of the full particle-cluster. Consider the red view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> as an example. While this view gives an approximate sense for the overall size of the cluster, is does not clearly reveal that the particle is a cluster of spherical grains like the other views do. Indeed, from the red view alone, one may not realize the comparatively long extent of the cluster along the z-axis (axial direction for this view).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0052">The knowledge of the 2D image of the same cluster from the different orthogonal directions is the key property that allows this method to work. For example, consider the red viewing direction in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> again. The individual pollen grains of the cluster have different axial and transverse positions with respect to the z-axis that obscure their 3D location. All that can be determined from the red view is the transverse location of an undetermined number of overlapping sphere primitives; the axial positions are completely obscured and some are not well focused. However, when this same cluster is viewed from the other directions, the transverse locations become known for those views, which identifies the correct axial position for the obscured view. It is then possible to infer the locations of all the spheres. Of course, this approach cannot work if the image resolution prevents a clear silhouette, and it would not be possible to resolve the location of a particle that is obscured by other particles in all three views. The latter case could occur for more compact clusters and aerosol streams involving a large number density of particles.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0053">A useful aspect of this method is the absence of lenses, which gives it nearly an order of magnitude larger sensing volume than what is typically possible in conventional microscopy. In principle, any particle that occupies the overlap volume of the three DL beams, which is approximately 1 cm<sup>3</sup>, will contribute to the holograms and can be imaged in this way.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0054">While the idea to use multiple silhouettes to obtain 3D information of particle form may not be new, the application to free-flowing aerosols with all three orthogonal views is. Most comparable methods require either fixing, trapping, or confinement of the particles. Microscope objectives are also employed resulting in a much-reduced sensing volume. Applying such methods to free flowing aerosol particles would be difficult because the particle motion even in moderate flow velocities (&#x2dc;1 m/s) will washout the hologram interference pattern unless pulsed illumination is used on the 100's of ns time scale. Also, note that the pollen grains in the example above are opaque, and thus the attractive methods based on transparent phase objects, such as biological cells in water, have not been applied to such aerosol particles as far as we know.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0055">At the time of the present invention, there were no known commercial instruments that determine the shape of freely flowing aerosol particles. Given the design simplicity, small form-factor, and large sensing volume of the apparatus in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, it is believed that such instruments could be deployed on unmanned aerial vehicles.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-math idrefs="MATH-US-00001" nb-file="US20230003632A1-20230105-M00001.NB"><img id="EMI-M00001" he="6.01mm" wi="76.20mm" file="US20230003632A1-20230105-M00001.TIF" alt="embedded image " img-content="math" img-format="tif"/></us-math><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
