A transparent roof panel is fastened to a support frame, which in turn is fixedly connected to corresponding roof body portions of the vehicle body of the passenger car. For shading the transparent roof panel, a shading structure is provided, which, for displacement between a rest position and a shading position, is guided longitudinally displaceably in guide rails in the region of an underside of the roof panel. The guide rails are positioned in the region of opposite side edges of the shading structure and have a C-shaped channel profile. One C-limb of the channel profile is bonded face-to-face to the underside of the transparent roof panel. Guide slides of a pull-out profile of the shading structure are displaceably mounted in the C-shaped channel profile.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is the object of the invention to create a glass roof arrangement of the type mentioned at the outset, which enables improved usability of the ceiling height in a vehicle interior.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This object is achieved in that a guide profile cross-section of each guide rail, in which the shading structure is guided laterally in each case, is formed from an edge limb, which is attached at least largely orthogonally to the underside of the roof panel, and a guide limb, which extends at least largely parallel to the underside and is attached to the edge limb, in such a way that a lateral guide channel for the shading structure is formed and delimited by the underside of the roof panel, the edge limb, and the guide limb. According to the invention, the edge limb of the guide profile cross-section of the guide rail either sits butted directly against the underside of the roof panel, so that the corresponding end edge of the edge limb directly contacts the underside of the roof panel, or the edge limb is positioned at a small distance of about one to three tenths of a millimeter from the underside of the roof panel. In the case of direct contact, the edge limb is advantageously provided with a soft material, such as plastic in particular, in the region of its edge facing the underside of the roof panel, in order to avoid unpleasant scraping or squeaking noises at the contact point during driving operation of the motor vehicle. The guide profile cross-section remains the same over the length of the guide rail, the guide rail being understood to mean merely the length portion over which the shading structure is displaceable between a rest position, exposing the roof panel, and a shading position, shading the roof panel from below. The at least one transparent roof panel is made of a transparent, dimensionally rigid roofing material, which is manufactured as a glass composite material, as a transparent plastic, or the like. Accordingly, the term &#x2018;glass roof arrangement&#x2019; is also not intended to mean that the roof arrangement is made of glass. Rather, the term &#x2018;glass roof arrangement&#x2019; is intended to make clear that the roof arrangement is transparent to allow light radiation to pass through. The term &#x2018;transparent design of the roof panel&#x2019; is intended to mean any type of light transmission. This means that the transparent roof panel can be tinted, or in edge portions can be impermeable to light, matte transparent, opaque or similarly designed. The solution according to the invention reduces the overall height of the guide rail for the shading structure compared to known guide rails, since no channel limb of the guide rail is used as the top channel wall for guiding the shading structure, but rather directly the underside of the roof panel. The reduced overall height of the guide rail allows additional installation space in the upward direction of a vehicle interior, which can be used advantageously for the appropriate design of the vehicle interior. The solution according to the invention is particularly advantageous for passenger cars designed as electric vehicles, in which battery charges in the region of a floor of the vehicle body can lead to a reduced height of the vehicle interior.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an embodiment of the invention, each guide rail has an adhesive limb which projects from the edge limb in the opposite direction to the guide limb and is positioned at a distance from the underside of the roof panel. By means of the adhesive limb, which is spaced from the underside of the roof panel, bonding to the underside of the roof panel can be effected without a corresponding adhesive layer increasing the overall height of the guide rail. This is because, in contrast to the prior art, an adhesive layer preferably applied by an adhesive bead is not provided at the guide channel for the shading structure, but rather is offset laterally outward. For this purpose, the adhesive limb is advantageously spaced apart from the underside of the roof panel in order to create space for a corresponding adhesive layer between the adhesive limb and the underside of the roof panel. Advantageously, the distance of the adhesive limb from the underside of the roof panel is such that a gap is formed to accommodate an adhesive bead. The adhesive layer formed by the adhesive bead is thus positioned laterally outside the guide channel for the shading structure. In addition, the adhesive limb of the guide profile cross-section of the guide rail is spaced from the underside of the roof panel to form the gap for the adhesive layer. The height of the guide rail in the state bonded to the underside of the roof panel is thus defined exclusively by the height of the edge limb of the guide profile cross-section of the guide rail. The adhesive limb, the edge limb and the guide limb of the guide rail are designed as a one-piece longitudinal profile, either made of a light metal alloy or of a suitable plastics material, and preferably produced by extrusion as an endless profile.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a further embodiment of the invention, the distance of the adhesive limb to the underside of the roof panel is less than a distance of the guide limb to the underside of the roof panel. Thus, the adhesive limb and the guide limb of the guide profile cross-section of each guide rail are offset relative to each other in the upward direction. On the one hand, this increases a rigidity of the corresponding longitudinal profile of the guide rail formed by the edge limb, the guide limb and the adhesive limb. On the other hand, this arrangement, which is offset in height, is adapted to the different requirements needed for the height of the guide channel for the shading structure on the one hand and for the height of the adhesive bead for fastening the guide rail to the underside of the roof panel on the other hand. The thickness of the adhesive bead in the cured adhesive position is preferably somewhat greater than the distance between the adhesive limb and the underside of the roof panel, so that the edge limb is positioned at a smaller distance of about one to three tenths of a millimeter from the underside of the roof panel.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a further embodiment of the invention, the guide rail consists of plastic, at least in portions. In this case, the guide rail can be produced from a fiber-reinforced plastics material or by multi-component extrusion from a multi-component plastic. Preferably, when the guide rail is produced from a multi-component plastic, the edge limb is produced from an elastic plastics material at least in its edge region facing the underside of the roof panel, so that contact of this edge region with the underside of the roof panel cannot lead to unpleasant noises during driving operation of the motor vehicle.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further embodiment of the invention, the edge limb is provided with an elastically flexible damping material at least in its edge region facing the underside of the roof panel. The elastically flexible damping material can either be produced by one-piece manufacture in the manufacturing process of the guide rail, or the damping material can be subsequently applied to the edge limb and connected to the edge limb in a frictionally engaged, form-fitting or integrally bonded manner. The damping material thus forms a spacer so that a dimensionally rigid and hard portion of the edge limb does not lie directly against the underside of the roof panel in the assembled operating state.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further advantages and features of the invention will become clear from the claims and from the following description of a preferred embodiment of the invention, which is presented with reference to the drawings.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a plan view of an embodiment of a glass roof arrangement for a passenger car according to the invention;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows, in an enlarged view, a cross-section along line of section II-II through a subregion of the glass roof arrangement according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>; and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the illustration according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, but in which the shading structure is shown in somewhat more detail.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, a glass roof arrangement <b>1</b> for a passenger car has a transparent roof panel <b>2</b>, which is fixedly connected on the underside in the region of its peripheral edge to a dimensionally stable support frame <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the roof panel <b>2</b> is bonded at the edge in the region of its underside to support profile portions <b>4</b> which are parts of the support frame <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>. On the basis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, a headliner portion <b>5</b> of a vehicle interior is also additionally indicated and is intended to cover lateral roof frame regions of the vehicle body that are not shown. The lateral roof frame portions are roof structure parts of the vehicle body in the sense of the invention. The support frame <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> is fixedly connected to corresponding roof structure parts of the vehicle body in the ready-for-use assembled state.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> that a shading structure <b>6</b> of a shading device is associated with the roof panel <b>2</b> in the region of its underside. The shading structure has a flexible shading web <b>8</b>, which is held in a manner not shown so that it can be wound onto and unwound from a roller shaft. The roller shaft is mounted in the region of the support frame <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> so as to be rotatable about an axis of rotation extending in the transverse direction of the vehicle. In a rest position, in which the underside of the roof panel <b>2</b> is exposed, the shading web <b>8</b> is wound at least almost completely onto the roller shaft. In a shading position, in which the shading web <b>8</b> covers the underside of the roof panel <b>2</b> in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle and in the transverse direction of the vehicle, the shading web <b>8</b> is extended and stretched over its surface. The shading web <b>8</b> has a flexible design and is preferably made of a textile sheet material, in particular a textile knitted fabric.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">At a front end region in the pull-out direction, the shading web <b>8</b> is connected to a dimensionally stable pull-out profile <b>7</b>, which extends across the width of the shading web <b>8</b> in the transverse direction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows that the shading web <b>8</b> is folded around the extension profile <b>7</b>. This ensures a particularly intimate and high-quality connection between the extension profile <b>7</b> and the shading web <b>8</b>. The pull-out profile <b>7</b> has, at each of its opposite end faces, a guide slider <b>9</b> which is inserted into an open side of the pull-out profile <b>7</b>, which is embodied as a hollow profile, and is fixedly connected to the pull-out profile <b>7</b>. The guide slider <b>9</b> is slidably guided on the opposite longitudinal sides of the shading web <b>8</b> in a guide rail <b>10</b> in each case, wherein only one guide rail <b>10</b> is shown on the basis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. The opposite guide rail <b>10</b> is mirror-symmetrical to a vertical vehicle center longitudinal plane, but otherwise is of identical design.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The guide rail <b>10</b> is formed by a dimensionally stable longitudinal profile made of a light metal alloy or a suitable plastics material. The guide rail <b>10</b> has a guide limb <b>11</b>, which faces the vehicle interior, is spaced at least largely parallel to the underside of the roof panel <b>2</b>, and can be seen in cross-section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. The guide limb <b>11</b> projects in one piece from an edge limb <b>12</b> pointing approximately at right angles in the direction of the underside of the roof panel <b>2</b>. In addition, an adhesive limb <b>13</b> is provided, which also projects in one piece from the edge limb <b>12</b>, but in the opposite direction to the guide limb <b>11</b>. In addition, the distance of the adhesive limb <b>13</b> from the underside of the roof panel <b>2</b> is less than the distance of the guide limb <b>11</b> from the underside of the roof panel <b>2</b>. The adhesive limb <b>13</b> and the guide limb <b>11</b> are oriented parallel to one another. All three limbs, i.e. the edge limb <b>12</b>, the guide limb <b>11</b> and the adhesive limb <b>13</b>, are embodied as rectilinear ribs and form integral portions of the one-part longitudinal profile which constitutes the guide rail <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the edge limb <b>12</b> is fitted in a manner butted against the surface of the underside of the roof panel <b>2</b>. In this case, the edge limb <b>12</b> is supported on the underside of the roof panel <b>2</b> by its upwardly pointing, longitudinal end face, so that this end face of the edge limb <b>12</b> directly contacts the underside of the roof panel <b>2</b> in a linear manner. A height of the edge limb <b>12</b> corresponds to the distance of the guide limb <b>11</b> to the underside of the roof panel <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">An upwardly facing inner side of the guide limb <b>11</b>, a longitudinal side of the edge limb <b>12</b> pointing to the right in the plane of the drawing, and the underside of the roof panel <b>2</b> form a guide channel for the guide slider <b>9</b>, said guide channel extending in the longitudinal direction of the glass roof arrangement <b>2</b>. In the illustrated exemplary embodiment, the opposing guide rails <b>10</b> are oriented parallel to one another in their mounted operating state on the underside of the roof panel <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">To fix the longitudinal profile forming the guide rail <b>10</b> to the underside of the roof panel <b>2</b>, an adhesive bead K is provided laterally outside the guide channel of the guide rail <b>10</b> and thus offset laterally outwardly from the edge limb <b>12</b>, and forms an adhesive layer for bonding the longitudinal profile to the underside of the roof panel <b>2</b>. The adhesive bead K is dimensioned such that it fills a gap between the adhesive limb <b>13</b>, the outwardly facing longitudinal side of the edge limb <b>12</b>, and the underside of the roof panel <b>2</b> at least largely completely and over the surface. For an assembly of the guide rail <b>10</b>, the adhesive bead K can already be continuously applied to the adhesive limb <b>13</b> before the longitudinal profile, i.e. the guide rail <b>10</b>, is pressed from below against the underside of the roof panel <b>2</b>. Alternatively, the adhesive bead K can be provided on the underside of the roof panel <b>2</b>, and the longitudinal profile is pressed against the adhesive bead K. In both cases, once the adhesive bead K has cured, a stable connection between the guide rail <b>10</b> and the underside of the roof panel <b>2</b> is achieved. On the basis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the orientations of the adhesive limb <b>13</b>, the edge limb <b>12</b> and the guide limb <b>11</b> of the longitudinal profile are more strongly emphasized in order to be able to clearly recognize the longitudinal gap for the adhesive bead K on the one hand and the guide channel for the guide slider <b>9</b> on the other hand.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
