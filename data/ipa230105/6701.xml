The role of the RF PA front end module is to amplify modulated RF signals received from a transceiver baseband accurately, and send the amplified modulated RF signals to an antenna for radiating out to a base station with a required output power, minimal battery consumption, and minimal spurious emissions. During operation, an RF PA's power dissipation generates high temperatures which can adversely affect key performance parameters of the RF PA such as linearity, power added efficiency (PAE), and gain.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To handle high-power requirements, an RF PA output stage normally uses an output array formed of similar device cells. However, due to thermal coupling between neighboring devices, such output arrays produce uneven thermal distribution across the output array. This uneven thermal distribution leads to reduced linearity and efficiency of the RF PA. Therefore, there is a need for RF PA output arrays having more even thermal distribution and improved linearity.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Example embodiments provide a radio frequency (RF) power amplifier including a non-uniform segmented output array having non-uniform loading to provide more even thermal distribution and improved linearity.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with an example embodiment, a power amplifier output stage is provided.

It should be appreciated, however, that the present disclosure provides many applicable concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely illustrative of specific ways to make and use the embodiments, and do not limit the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example wireless communications system <b>100</b>. Communications system <b>100</b> includes an access node <b>110</b> serving a user equipment (UE) <b>120</b> within a coverage area <b>101</b>. In a first operating mode, communications to and from UE <b>120</b>, using an uplink connection <b>130</b> and a downlink connection <b>135</b>, respectively, pass through access node <b>110</b>. In a second operating mode, communications to and from UE <b>120</b> do not pass through access node <b>110</b>, however, access node <b>110</b> typically allocates resources used by UE <b>120</b> to communicate. Access nodes may also be commonly referred to as Node Bs, evolved Node Bs (eNBs), next generation (NG) Node Bs (gNBs), master eNBs (MeNBs), secondary eNBs (SeNBs), master gNBs (MgNBs), secondary gNBs (SgNBs), network controllers, control nodes, base stations, access points, transmission points (TPs), transmission-reception points (TRPs), cells, carriers, macro cells, femtocells, pico cells, and so on, while UEs may also be commonly referred to as mobile stations, mobiles, terminals, users, subscribers, stations, and the like. Access nodes may provide wireless access in accordance with one or more wireless communication protocols, e.g., the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) long term evolution (LTE), LTE advanced (LTE-A), 5G, 5G LTE, 5G New Radio (NR), High Speed Packet Access (HSPA), Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ad/ax/ay, etc. The access node <b>110</b> may be in communication with a backhaul network <b>140</b>. While it is understood that communications systems may employ multiple eNBs capable of communicating with a number of UEs, only one eNB and one UE are illustrated for simplicity.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">As discussed above, a radio frequency (RF) power amplifier (PA) front end module is a critical component of the UE. To evaluate the performances of the RF PA, a few key parameters are used such as output power, gain, PAE (power added efficiency), linearity, adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR), error vector magnitude (EVM), and harmonics leakage. The performance of the RF PA directly determines the operating mode (e.g., 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G, Wi-Fi) that the UE can support, how long the battery of the UE can last, and the stability of the communication between the UE and other devices. When the RF PA is in operation, the power dissipation of the RF PA generates high temperatures and currents, for example 150 to 200 degrees Celsius (&#xb0; C.) with over 2 amps (A) of current, under certain antenna operating conditions. High temperatures adversely affect the RF PA's key performance parameters such as linearity, PAE, gain, etc. High temperatures may also impact the UE's long-term reliability, dramatically reducing the UE's mean time to failure (MTTF).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">To handle such high-power requirements, RF PA output stages typically use a uniformly distributed array of many identical semiconductor device cells. To minimize the uneven distribution of power across the output array, direct current (DC) ballasting is a standard technique used to attempt to prevent device thermal runaway, which is a catastrophic event. However, due to thermal coupling between neighboring devices of the output array, the output array inevitably ends up with uneven temperature distribution across the output array with typically substantially higher temperatures for devices in the middle of the output array, and lower temperatures for devices at the side ends of the output array. The temperature differences between the middle devices and side end devices of the output array may reach as much as 40&#xb0; C. in some examples. In many aspects of performance of an RF PA, such as linearity, power saturation and reliability, devices in the middle of the output array are determinative factors in overall performance of the output array. Performance of a semiconductor device depends heavily upon its temperature, and each individual device in the array may perform differently due to uneven temperature distribution. For a linear RF amplifier, a device operating at higher temperature compresses the output signal earlier than a device operating at a lower temperature, thus becoming less linear as well as being less efficient, producing less gain, and more vulnerable in reliability.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">An RF PA output stages includes many individual semiconductor devices ideally working as a united group to handle the power amplification task of the PA. Due to physical restrictions, without mitigation the output array will inevitably have uneven temperature distribution with much higher temperature for those individual devices the located in or near the center, or middle, of the output array.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The goals of achieving minimum power consumption while preserving excellent linearity with robust long-term reliability require an output stage with a thermal distribution that is as even as possible across the output stage. Accordingly, it is desirable to obtain an even thermal distribution across the output array at a target maximum output power while achieving an overall reduced temperature, improved linearity, an extended compression point, and improved long-term reliability as well as maintaining minimum power consumption.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">One or more embodiments provide for a non-uniform segmented output array in which the semiconductor devices of the array are segmented into non-uniform groups of semiconductor devices, for example, having a different number, size, and/or type of semiconductor devices in each group. In embodiments, the semiconductor devices of the output array are divided into several semi-independent groups, for example, two side end groups and one middle group. The non-uniform segmented output array further includes tunable loading for each segment group.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The temperature of a semiconductor device is proportional to the power dissipated within the device, The power dissipation within the device depends upon a few key factors, such as the source loading, the output loading, and the bias received by the device. In embodiments, adjusting one or more of the source loading, the output loading, and the bias provided to each group of semiconductor devices allows controllable non-uniform (e.g., different) provision of power dissipated in each group. By segmenting the output array into non-uniformly distributed groups of semiconductor devices with non-uniform loading, device sizing, and/or input power, power dissipation in each group can be regulated in a controllable and tunable manner. Thus, power dissipated into each individual group can be controlled to compensate and counteract thermal coupling between devices to achieve relatively even temperature distribution with an overall reduction in temperature of the RF PA.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In an embodiment, one or more of the UEs <b>120</b> and/or access node <b>110</b> may include an RF PA output stage having a non-uniform segmented output array with non-uniform loading as further described herein with respect to one or more embodiments.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of architecture for a UE <b>200</b> in which the non-uniform segmented output array may be utilized.
