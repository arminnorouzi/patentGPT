document contains material which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent files or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. Copyright 2021, SG Gaming, Inc.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates generally to gaming systems, apparatus, and methods and, more particularly, to game features using multipliers or modifiers that change within the game feature.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The gaming industry depends upon player participation. Players are generally &#x201c;hopeful&#x201d; players who either think they are lucky or at least think they can get lucky&#x2014;for a relatively small investment to play a game, they can get a disproportionately large return. To create this feeling of luck, a gaming apparatus relies upon an internal or external random element generator to generate one or more random elements such as random numbers. The gaming apparatus determines a game outcome based, at least in part, on the one or more random elements.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A significant technical challenge is to improve the operation of gaming apparatus and games played thereon, including the manner in which they leverage the underlying random element generator, by making them yield a negative return on investment in the long run (via a high quantity and/or frequency of player/apparatus interactions) and yet random and volatile enough to make players feel they can get lucky and win in the short run. Striking the right balance between yield versus randomness and volatility to create a feeling of luck involves addressing many technical problems, some of which can be at odds with one another. This luck factor is what appeals to core players and encourages prolonged and frequent player participation. As the industry matures, the creativity and ingenuity required to improve such operation of gaming apparatus and games grows accordingly.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another significant technical challenge is to improve the operation of gaming apparatus and games played thereon by increasing processing speed and efficiency of usage of processing and/or memory resources. To make games more entertaining and exciting, they often offer the complexities of advanced graphics and special effects, multiple bonus features with different game formats, and multiple random outcome determinations per feature. The game formats may, for example, include picking games, reel spins, wheel spins, and other arcade-style play mechanics. Inefficiencies in processor execution of the game software can slow down play of the game and prevent a player from playing the game at their desired pace.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Yet another significant technical challenge is to provide a new and improved level of game play that uses new and improved gaming apparatus animations. Improved animations represent improvements to the underlying technology or technical field of gaming apparatus and, at the same time, have the effect of encouraging prolonged and frequent player participation.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one aspect of the present disclosure, a gaming machine is provided comprising a display device and game-logic circuitry configured to initiate a cycle counter at an initial counter value, link a first multiplier value to a first symbol position of a plurality of symbol positions, and cause the display device to present a first game cycle outcome by selectively populating the first symbol position with a value-bearing symbol including award indicia visually indicating an award value associated with the value-bearing symbol. The game-logic circuitry is further configured to cause, in response to the first symbol position being populated by the value-bearing symbol, the display device to: (i) update the award indicia of the value-bearing symbol at least partially as a function of the award value and the first multiplier, and (ii) lock the value-bearing symbol within the first symbol position for at least one subsequent game cycle outcome.

Rather, the invention is to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">While this invention is susceptible of embodiment in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail preferred embodiments of the invention with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the broad aspect of the invention to the embodiments illustrated. For purposes of the present detailed description, the singular includes the plural and vice versa (unless specifically disclaimed); the words &#x201c;and&#x201d; and &#x201c;or&#x201d; shall be both conjunctive and disjunctive; the word &#x201c;all&#x201d; means &#x201c;any and all&#x201d;; the word &#x201c;any&#x201d; means &#x201c;any and all&#x201d;; and the word &#x201c;including&#x201d; means &#x201c;including without limitation.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">For purposes of the present detailed description, the terms &#x201c;wagering game,&#x201d; &#x201c;casino wagering game,&#x201d; &#x201c;gambling,&#x201d; &#x201c;slot game,&#x201d; &#x201c;casino game,&#x201d; and the like include games in which a player places at risk a sum of money or other representation of value, whether or not redeemable for cash, on an event with an uncertain outcome, including without limitation those having some element of skill. In some embodiments, the wagering game involves wagers of real money, as found with typical land-based or online casino games. In other embodiments, the wagering game additionally, or alternatively, involves wagers of non-cash values, such as virtual currency, and therefore may be considered a social or casual game, such as would be typically available on a social networking web site, other web sites, across computer networks, or applications on mobile devices (e.g., phones, tablets, etc.). When provided in a social or casual game format, the wagering game may closely resemble a traditional casino game, or it may take another form that more closely resembles other types of social/casual games.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Embodiments of the present invention comprise an innovative application of data processing steps that, when implemented by game-logic circuitry, direct an electronic display device to present a symbol-value aggregation and/or dynamic modifier process that minimizes processing overhead by utilizing numbered indicia to represent credit values instead of complex, fanciful game images. Further, the process aggregates displayed values borne by special symbols (i.e., value-bearing symbols) according to stored, variable criteria. In this way, the value-bearing symbols provide building blocks for innumerable different aggregation sequences simply by manipulating the aggregation criteria associated with the value-bearing symbols, resulting in fewer rules needed for the aggregation process than would be necessary for calculating values of winning symbol combinations enumerated in stored paytables, as found in prior art reel-spinning routines. At the same time, embodiments of the present invention provide a straightforward, what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) visual presentation that is simple to understand and, therefore, effective in generating player excitement and enthusiasm. The result is a highly flexible value-aggregation process that can be easily adapted to any theme/brand while remaining easily understood by players.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there is shown a gaming machine <b>10</b> similar to those operated in gaming establishments, such as casinos. With regard to the present invention, the gaming machine <b>10</b> may be any type of gaming terminal or machine and may have varying structures and methods of operation. For example, in some aspects, the gaming machine <b>10</b> is an electromechanical gaming terminal configured to play mechanical slots, whereas in other aspects, the gaming machine is an electronic gaming terminal configured to play a video casino game, such as slots, keno, poker, blackjack, roulette, craps, etc. The gaming machine <b>10</b> may take any suitable form, such as floor-standing models as shown, handheld mobile units, bartop models, workstation-type console models, etc. Further, the gaming machine <b>10</b> may be primarily dedicated for use in playing wagering games, or may include non-dedicated devices, such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants, personal computers, etc. Exemplary types of gaming machines are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,517,433, 8,057,303, and 8,226,459, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The gaming machine <b>10</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> comprises a gaming cabinet <b>12</b> that securely houses various input devices, output devices, input/output devices, internal electronic/electromechanical components, and wiring. The cabinet <b>12</b> includes exterior walls, interior walls and shelves for mounting the internal components and managing the wiring, and one or more front doors that are locked and require a physical or electronic key to gain access to the interior compartment of the cabinet <b>12</b> behind the locked door.

A notification mechanism <b>16</b>, such as a candle or tower light, is mounted to the top of the cabinet <b>12</b>. It flashes to alert an attendant that change is needed, a hand pay is requested, or there is a potential problem with the gaming machine <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The input devices, output devices, and input/output devices are disposed on, and securely coupled to, the cabinet <b>12</b>. By way of example, the output devices include a primary display <b>18</b>, a secondary display <b>20</b>, and one or more audio speakers <b>22</b>. The primary display <b>18</b> or the secondary display <b>20</b> may be a mechanical-reel display device, a video display device, or a combination thereof in which a transmissive video display is disposed in front of the mechanical-reel display to portray a video image superimposed upon the mechanical-reel display. The displays variously display information associated with wagering games, non-wagering games, community games, progressives, advertisements, services, premium entertainment, text messaging, emails, alerts, announcements, broadcast information, subscription information, etc. appropriate to the particular mode(s) of operation of the gaming machine <b>10</b>. The gaming machine <b>10</b> includes a touch screen(s) <b>24</b> mounted over the primary or secondary displays, buttons <b>26</b> on a button panel, a bill/ticket acceptor <b>28</b>, a card reader/writer <b>30</b>, a ticket dispenser <b>32</b>, and player-accessible ports (e.g., audio output jack for headphones, video headset jack, USB port, wireless transmitter/receiver, etc.). It should be understood that numerous other peripheral devices and other elements exist and are readily utilizable in any number of combinations to create various forms of a gaming machine in accord with the present concepts.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The player input devices, such as the touch screen <b>24</b>, buttons <b>26</b>, a mouse, a joystick, a gesture-sensing device, a voice-recognition device, and a virtual-input device, accept player inputs and transform the player inputs to electronic data signals indicative of the player inputs, which correspond to an enabled feature for such inputs at a time of activation (e.g., pressing a &#x201c;Max Bet&#x201d; button or soft key to indicate a player's desire to place a maximum wager to play the wagering game). The inputs, once transformed into electronic data signals, are output to game-logic circuitry for processing. The electronic data signals are selected from a group consisting essentially of an electrical current, an electrical voltage, an electrical charge, an optical signal, an optical element, a magnetic signal, and a magnetic element.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The gaming machine <b>10</b> includes one or more value input/payment devices and value output/payout devices. In order to deposit cash or credits onto the gaming machine <b>10</b>, the value input devices are configured to detect a physical item associated with a monetary value that establishes a credit balance on a credit meter such as the &#x201c;credits&#x201d; meter <b>84</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The physical item may, for example, be currency bills, coins, tickets, vouchers, coupons, cards, and/or computer-readable storage mediums. The deposited cash or credits are used to fund wagers placed on the wagering game played via the gaming machine <b>10</b>. Examples of value input devices include, but are not limited to, a coin acceptor, the bill/ticket acceptor <b>28</b>, the card reader/writer <b>30</b>, a wireless communication interface for reading cash or credit data from a nearby mobile device, and a network interface for withdrawing cash or credits from a remote account via an electronic funds transfer. In response to a cashout input that initiates a payout from the credit balance on the &#x201c;credits&#x201d; meter <b>84</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), the value output devices are used to dispense cash or credits from the gaming machine <b>10</b>. The credits may be exchanged for cash at, for example, a cashier or redemption station. Examples of value output devices include, but are not limited to, a coin hopper for dispensing coins or tokens, a bill dispenser, the card reader/writer <b>30</b>, the ticket dispenser <b>32</b> for printing tickets redeemable for cash or credits, a wireless communication interface for transmitting cash or credit data to a nearby mobile device, and a network interface for depositing cash or credits to a remote account via an electronic funds transfer.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, there is shown a block diagram of the gaming-machine architecture. The gaming machine <b>10</b> includes game-logic circuitry <b>40</b> securely housed within a locked box inside the gaming cabinet <b>12</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The game-logic circuitry <b>40</b> includes a central processing unit (CPU) <b>42</b> connected to a main memory <b>44</b> that comprises one or more memory devices. The CPU <b>42</b> includes any suitable processor(s), such as those made by Intel and AMD. By way of example, the CPU <b>42</b> includes a plurality of microprocessors including a master processor, a slave processor, and a secondary or parallel processor. Game-logic circuitry <b>40</b>, as used herein, comprises any combination of hardware, software, or firmware disposed in or outside of the gaming machine <b>10</b> that is configured to communicate with or control the transfer of data between the gaming machine <b>10</b> and a bus, another computer, processor, device, service, or network. The game-logic circuitry <b>40</b>, and more specifically the CPU <b>42</b>, comprises one or more controllers or processors and such one or more controllers or processors need not be disposed proximal to one another and may be located in different devices or in different locations. The game-logic circuitry <b>40</b>, and more specifically the main memory <b>44</b>, comprises one or more memory devices which need not be disposed proximal to one another and may be located in different devices or in different locations. The game-logic circuitry <b>40</b> is operable to execute all of the various gaming methods and other processes disclosed herein. The main memory <b>44</b> includes a wagering-game unit <b>46</b>. In one embodiment, the wagering-game unit <b>46</b> causes wagering games to be presented, such as video poker, video blackjack, video slots, video lottery, etc., in whole or part.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The game-logic circuitry <b>40</b> is also connected to an input/output (I/O) bus <b>48</b>, which can include any suitable bus technologies, such as an AGTL+ frontside bus and a PCI backside bus. The I/O bus <b>48</b> is connected to various input devices <b>50</b>, output devices <b>52</b>, and input/output devices <b>54</b> such as those discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The I/O bus <b>48</b> is also connected to a storage unit <b>56</b> and an external-system interface <b>58</b>, which is connected to external system(s) <b>60</b> (e.g., wagering-game networks).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The external system <b>60</b> includes, in various aspects, a gaming network, other gaming machines or terminals, a gaming server, a remote controller, communications hardware, or a variety of other interfaced systems or components, in any combination. In yet other aspects, the external system <b>60</b> comprises a player's portable electronic device (e.g., cellular phone, electronic wallet, etc.) and the external-system interface <b>58</b> is configured to facilitate wireless communication and data transfer between the portable electronic device and the gaming machine <b>10</b>, such as by a near-field communication path operating via magnetic-field induction or a frequency-hopping spread spectrum RF signals (e.g., Bluetooth, etc.).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The gaming machine <b>10</b> optionally communicates with the external system <b>60</b> such that the gaming machine <b>10</b> operates as a thin, thick, or intermediate client. The game-logic circuitry <b>40</b>&#x2014;whether located within (&#x201c;thick client&#x201d;), external to (&#x201c;thin client&#x201d;), or distributed both within and external to (&#x201c;intermediate client&#x201d;) the gaming machine <b>10</b>&#x2014;is utilized to provide a wagering game on the gaming machine <b>10</b>. In general, the main memory <b>44</b> stores programming for a random number generator (RNG), game-outcome logic, and game assets (e.g., art, sound, etc.)&#x2014;all of which obtained regulatory approval from a gaming control board or commission and are verified by a trusted authentication program in the main memory <b>44</b> prior to game execution. The authentication program generates a live authentication code (e.g., digital signature or hash) from the memory contents and compare it to a trusted code stored in the main memory <b>44</b>. If the codes match, authentication is deemed a success and the game is permitted to execute. If, however, the codes do not match, authentication is deemed a failure that must be corrected prior to game execution. Without this predictable and repeatable authentication, the gaming machine <b>10</b>, external system <b>60</b>, or both are not allowed to perform or execute the RNG programming or game-outcome logic in a regulatory-approved manner and are therefore unacceptable for commercial use. In other words, through the use of the authentication program, the game-logic circuitry facilitates operation of the game in a way that a person making calculations or computations could not.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">When a wagering-game instance is executed, the CPU <b>42</b> (comprising one or more processors or controllers) executes the RNG programming to generate one or more pseudo-random numbers. The pseudo-random numbers are divided into different ranges, and each range is associated with a respective game outcome. Accordingly, the pseudo-random numbers are utilized by the CPU <b>42</b> when executing the game-outcome logic to determine a resultant outcome for that instance of the wagering game. The resultant outcome is then presented to a player of the gaming machine <b>10</b> by accessing the associated game assets, required for the resultant outcome, from the main memory <b>44</b>. The CPU <b>42</b> causes the game assets to be presented to the player as outputs from the gaming machine <b>10</b> (e.g., audio and video presentations). Instead of a pseudo-RNG, the game outcome may be derived from random numbers generated by a physical RNG that measures some physical phenomenon that is expected to be random and then compensates for possible biases in the measurement process. Whether the RNG is a pseudo-RNG or physical RNG, the RNG uses a seeding process that relies upon an unpredictable factor (e.g., human interaction of turning a key) and cycles continuously in the background between games and during game play at a speed that cannot be timed by the player, for example, at a minimum of 100 Hz (100 calls per second) as set forth in Nevada's New Gaming Device Submission Package. Accordingly, the RNG cannot be carried out manually by a human and is integral to operating the game.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The gaming machine <b>10</b> may be used to play central determination games, such as electronic pull-tab and bingo games. In an electronic pull-tab game, the RNG is used to randomize the distribution of outcomes in a pool and/or to select which outcome is drawn from the pool of outcomes when the player requests to play the game. In an electronic bingo game, the RNG is used to randomly draw numbers that players match against numbers printed on their electronic bingo card.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The gaming machine <b>10</b> may include additional peripheral devices or more than one of each component shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Any component of the gaming-machine architecture includes hardware, firmware, or tangible machine-readable storage media including instructions for performing the operations described herein. Machine-readable storage media includes any mechanism that stores information and provides the information in a form readable by a machine (e.g., gaming terminal, computer, etc.). For example, machine-readable storage media includes read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), magnetic-disk storage media, optical storage media, flash memory, etc.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, there is illustrated an image of a basic-game screen <b>80</b> adapted to be displayed on the primary display <b>18</b> or the secondary display <b>20</b>. The basic-game screen <b>80</b> portrays a plurality of simulated symbol-bearing reels <b>82</b>. Alternatively or additionally, the basic-game screen <b>80</b> portrays a plurality of mechanical reels or other video or mechanical presentation consistent with the game format and theme. The basic-game screen <b>80</b> also advantageously displays one or more game-session credit meters <b>84</b> and various touch screen buttons <b>86</b> adapted to be actuated by a player. A player can operate or interact with the wagering game using these touch screen buttons or other input devices such as the buttons <b>26</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The game-logic circuitry <b>40</b> operates to execute a wagering-game program causing the primary display <b>18</b> or the secondary display <b>20</b> to display the wagering game.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In response to receiving an input indicative of a wager covered by or deducted from the credit balance on the &#x201c;credits&#x201d; meter <b>84</b>, the reels <b>82</b> are rotated and stopped to place symbols on the reels in visual association with paylines such as paylines <b>88</b>. The wagering game evaluates the displayed array of symbols on the stopped reels and provides immediate awards and bonus features in accordance with a pay table. The pay table may, for example, include &#x201c;line pays&#x201d; or &#x201c;scatter pays.&#x201d; Line pays occur when a predetermined type and number of symbols appear along an activated payline, typically in a particular order such as left to right, right to left, top to bottom, bottom to top, etc. Scatter pays occur when a predetermined type and number of symbols appear anywhere in the displayed array without regard to position or paylines. Similarly, the wagering game may trigger bonus features based on one or more bonus triggering symbols appearing along an activated payline (i.e., &#x201c;line trigger&#x201d;) or anywhere in the displayed array (i.e., &#x201c;scatter trigger&#x201d;). The wagering game may also provide mystery awards and features independent of the symbols appearing in the displayed array.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In accord with various methods of conducting a wagering game on a gaming system in accord with the present concepts, the wagering game includes a game sequence in which a player makes a wager and a wagering-game outcome is provided or displayed in response to the wager being received or detected. The wagering-game outcome, for that particular wagering-game instance, is then revealed to the player in due course following initiation of the wagering game. The method comprises the acts of conducting the wagering game using a gaming apparatus, such as the gaming machine <b>10</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, following receipt of an input from the player to initiate a wagering-game instance. The gaming machine <b>10</b> then communicates the wagering-game outcome to the player via one or more output devices (e.g., primary display <b>18</b> or secondary display <b>20</b>) through the display of information such as, but not limited to, text, graphics, static images, moving images, etc., or any combination thereof. In accord with the method of conducting the wagering game, the game-logic circuitry <b>40</b> transforms a physical player input, such as a player's pressing of a &#x201c;Spin Reels&#x201d; touch key, into an electronic data signal indicative of an instruction relating to the wagering game (e.g., an electronic data signal bearing data on a wager amount).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the aforementioned method, for each data signal, the game-logic circuitry <b>40</b> is configured to process the electronic data signal, to interpret the data signal (e.g., data signals corresponding to a wager input), and to cause further actions associated with the interpretation of the signal in accord with stored instructions relating to such further actions executed by the controller. As one example, the CPU <b>42</b> causes the recording of a digital representation of the wager in one or more storage media (e.g., storage unit <b>56</b>), the CPU <b>42</b>, in accord with associated stored instructions, causes the changing of a state of the storage media from a first state to a second state. This change in state is, for example, effected by changing a magnetization pattern on a magnetically coated surface of a magnetic storage media or changing a magnetic state of a ferromagnetic surface of a magneto-optical disc storage media, a change in state of transistors or capacitors in a volatile or a non-volatile semiconductor memory (e.g., DRAM, etc.). The noted second state of the data storage media comprises storage in the storage media of data representing the electronic data signal from the CPU <b>42</b> (e.g., the wager in the present example). As another example, the CPU <b>42</b> further, in accord with the execution of the stored instructions relating to the wagering game, causes the primary display <b>18</b>, other display device, or other output device (e.g., speakers, lights, communication device, etc.) to change from a first state to at least a second state, wherein the second state of the primary display comprises a visual representation of the physical player input (e.g., an acknowledgement to a player), information relating to the physical player input (e.g., an indication of the wager amount), a game sequence, an outcome of the game sequence, or any combination thereof, wherein the game sequence in accord with the present concepts comprises acts described herein. The aforementioned executing of the stored instructions relating to the wagering game is further conducted in accord with a random outcome (e.g., determined by the RNG) that is used by the game-logic circuitry <b>40</b> to determine the outcome of the wagering-game instance. In at least some aspects, the game-logic circuitry <b>40</b> is configured to determine an outcome of the wagering-game instance at least partially in response to the random parameter.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, the gaming machine <b>10</b> and, additionally or alternatively, the external system <b>60</b> (e.g., a gaming server), means gaming equipment that meets the hardware and software requirements for fairness, security, and predictability as established by at least one state's gaming control board or commission. Prior to commercial deployment, the gaming machine <b>10</b>, the external system <b>60</b>, or both and the casino wagering game played thereon may need to satisfy minimum technical standards and require regulatory approval from a gaming control board or commission (e.g., the Nevada Gaming Commission, Alderney Gambling Control Commission, National Indian Gaming Commission, etc.) charged with regulating casino and other types of gaming in a defined geographical area, such as a state. By way of non-limiting example, a gaming machine in Nevada means a device as set forth in NRS 463.0155, 463.0191, and all other relevant provisions of the Nevada Gaming Control Act, and the gaming machine cannot be deployed for play in Nevada unless it meets the minimum standards set forth in, for example, Technical Standards 1 and 2 and Regulations 5 and 14 issued pursuant to the Nevada Gaming Control Act. Additionally, the gaming machine and the casino wagering game must be approved by the commission pursuant to various provisions in Regulation 14. Comparable statutes, regulations, and technical standards exist in other gaming jurisdictions. As can be seen from the description herein, the gaming machine <b>10</b> may be implemented with hardware and software architectures, circuitry, and other special features that differentiate it from general-purpose computers (e.g., desktop PCs, laptops, and tablets).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The gaming systems and methods described herein provide a game feature with dynamic modifiers or multipliers that are applied to value-bearing symbols. The value-bearing symbols include award indicia visually indicating to the player an award value of the value-bearing symbol. It is to be understood that although the term &#x201c;award value&#x201d; is used herein, the value may not be limited to a credit amount, but rather may include other forms of value such as jackpots, free spins, and/or other suitable awards. The dynamic modifiers or multipliers are incorporated within a unique presentation sequence for the game feature to invoke player engagement and excitement. In one example, the game feature may have a limited duration, and a set of multipliers may increase as the end of the game feature approaches until a value-bearing symbol is associated with one of the multipliers. In another example, an active modifier region is defined in the play area, and value-bearing symbols within the region after a number of spins or outcomes are modified based on one or more modifiers of the region.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a flow diagram of an example method <b>100</b> for conducting a game is presented. More specifically, the game associated with the method <b>100</b> includes a game feature including value-bearing symbols and dynamic multipliers for the value-bearing symbols. The method <b>100</b> may be performed at least partially by game-logic circuitry (e.g., the game-logic circuitry <b>40</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), which may be local and/or remote to a gaming machine used to present the game via one or more display devices. It is to be understood that although a single display device is used herein to describe the presentation of game elements, presenting the game elements over a plurality of display devices is contemplated by the present disclosure as within the scope of a &#x201c;display device&#x201d; or &#x201c;electronic display device&#x201d; as used herein. In other embodiments, the method <b>100</b> may be performed at least partially by another suitable device, and the method <b>100</b> may include additional, fewer, or alternative steps, including those described elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the example embodiment, at step <b>102</b>, a base game feature is initiated. Initiation of the base game feature may include a player initiating a gaming session at the gaming machine. For example, for wagering games, the player may present one or more credit inputs to the gaming machine to establish a credit balance for placing wagers and receiving awards. The credit inputs may be physical items (e.g., bills, coins, tickets, cards, etc.) or data communicated to the gaming machine (e.g., funds transferred from a digital wallet of the player). The gaming machine may be configured to receive a plurality of forms of credit input by including a plurality of credit input devices, such as the input devices described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In another example, the gaming session may be initiated through receiving input other that a credit input, such as receiving indication of a player account associated with the player. The gaming session may be configured to continue until the player manually terminates the session by initiating a cash out sequence, the credit balance is at zero, the gaming machine detects the player has left the gaming machine (e.g., through the absence of player input), and/or other suitable termination conditions are met.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In at least some embodiments, the base game feature may be a reel-based game feature, such as the feature shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. In other embodiments, other suitable base games may be provided. Play of the base game feature may include generating one or more outcomes and evaluating any winning symbols, sequences, and/or other aspects of the outcomes trigger an award, which may be credited to the player's credit balance. In some embodiments, the base game feature may include value-bearing symbols. The value-bearing symbols may be incorporated within the outcomes of the base game feature (i.e., the award values of the value-bearing symbols can be awarded within the base game feature), or the value-bearing symbols may be limited to triggering a bonus game feature. In other embodiments, the value-bearing symbols are not present in the bonus game feature.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">At step <b>104</b>, the game-logic circuitry detects whether a trigger event has occurred in the base game feature. The trigger event may include one or more conditions of the base game feature that, when present, cause the game-logic circuitry to initiate a bonus game feature. For example, the trigger event may include a number of value-bearing symbols within an outcome of the base game feature meeting or exceeding a threshold number of symbols (e.g., four or six value-bearing symbols). In other embodiments, other suitable trigger events may be used, such as meeting or exceeding a threshold number of a particular non-value-bearing symbol. In the example embodiment, if the trigger event is not detected, play of the base game feature continues. If the trigger event is detected, then the bonus game feature is initiated at step <b>106</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The bonus game feature is configured to be conducted within a plurality of symbols positions, which may be arranged into a symbol array (e.g., a single grouping of positions arranged in columns and rows) or other suitable groupings. In some embodiments in which the base game feature is conducted using symbol positions, the bonus game feature may use the same symbol positions. In such embodiments, any value-bearing symbols from the trigger event may be retained within the symbol positions for use in the bonus game feature. In other embodiments in which the base game feature does not include value-bearing symbols, initiating the bonus game feature may include populating one or more symbol positions with value-bearing symbols. At the initiation of the bonus game feature, at least one symbol position is unoccupied by a value-bearing symbol.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the example embodiment, the game-logic circuitry causes any value-bearing symbols within the symbol positions at step <b>106</b> to be locked within the symbol positions. That is, for at least one subsequent game cycle or outcome, the locked value-bearing symbols remain in the symbol positions. The game-logic circuitry may cause the display device to visually distinguish locked symbols and symbols positions from unlocked symbol positions. For example, the display device may present a different color, overlay, background, overlay, and/or the like for locked symbol positions. In other embodiments, the presence or absence of the value-bearing symbols may distinguish between locked and unlocked positions.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the example embodiment, at step <b>108</b>, the game-logic circuitry initiates a game cycle counter and one or more multiplier values for unlocked symbol positions. The game cycle counter indicates the length of the bonus game feature and may be visually presented to the player. The game cycle counter is initiated at an initial counter value, such as three or zero. The game cycle counter may be configured to increment, decrement, or otherwise change in value in response to events of the bonus game feature as described herein. For example, if the game cycle counter is initiated at three, the game cycle counter may decrement in response to each game cycle outcome and be reset to the initial counter value in response to another event. That is, in at least some embodiments, the game cycle counter is not limited to linear progression and may be reset (to the initial counter value or another suitable value) such that the length of the bonus game feature may be dynamic rather than predetermined.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The multiplier values are generated and assigned to at least a portion of the unlocked symbol positions. In the example embodiment, each unlocked symbol position is assigned a respective multiplier value. In other embodiments, a portion of the unlocked symbol positions may be assigned multiplier values and selecting the portion of unlocked symbol positions may be based at least in part on one or more random determinations, game conditions (e.g., a preexisting value-bearing symbol is adjacent the unlocked symbol position), wager conditions (frequency and/or number of wagers), player conditions, player input, and/or the like. The multiplier values may be independently activated and/or deactivated (which may include removing the multiplier value) as described herein. It is to be understood that the term &#x201c;deactivated&#x201d; in the context of multiplier values may include removal of the multiplier value, freezing or locking the multiplier value, and/or otherwise not applying the multiplier value to subsequent game events. The multiplier values may be synchronized such that every active multiplier value has the same value (e.g., 1&#xd7;, 2&#xd7;, 4&#xd7;, 5&#xd7;, etc.), or the values may be independent from each other. The multiplier values may be initialized at a predetermined value (e.g., 1&#xd7;) or dynamically determined. The dynamic determination, similar to determining which unlocked symbol positions to assign multiplier values in some embodiments, may be based at least in part on one or more random determinations, game conditions, wager conditions, player conditions, player input, and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">At step <b>110</b>, the game-logic circuitry generates a game-cycle outcome. The game-cycle outcome includes selectively populating the unlocked symbol positions with new value-bearing symbols. That is, a game-cycle outcome may include all, none, or a portion of the unlocked symbol positions being populated with value-bearing symbols. The game-cycle outcome may be at least partially generated using one or more random numbers or outcomes. As described in detail herein, generating the game-cycle outcome and presenting the game-cycle outcome may be performed separately or in unison. That is, in one example, the game-logic circuitry may generate all game-cycle outcomes of the bonus game feature prior to and/or during the presentation of the game-cycle outcomes. In another example, the game-logic circuitry may generate and present each game-cycle outcome sequentially. In a further example, the game-logic circuitry may generate one or more random determinations prior to the game-cycle outcomes (e.g., at step <b>106</b>) that affect the sequential generation and/or presentation of the game-cycle outcomes.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The value-bearing symbols may include a predetermined award value as indicated by the respective award indicia or may include a dynamic award value. The dynamic award value may be selected from a set of available award values or generated as a function of one or more parameters associated with the bonus game feature (e.g., wager frequency, wager amount, game conditions, etc.). In some embodiments, the value-bearing symbols having different award values may be treated as separate symbols in generating the game-cycle outcome, where the game-logic circuitry may randomly select one or none of the available value-bearing symbols for each unlocked symbol position.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Presentation of the game-cycle outcome may include one or more animations to indicate to the player an outcome is occurring. For example, a spinning animation may cycle through available symbols (including no symbol) for each unlocked symbol position before landing on the symbols or lack of symbols within the game-cycle outcome. The presentation of the game-cycle outcome may be automatic or in response to player input, where the player input may be provided to affect the game-cycle outcome or to simply initiate the presentation. It is to be understood that a plurality of suitable animations and presentation elements used to convey the game-cycle outcome are contemplated as within the scope and spirit of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">At step <b>112</b>, for each game-cycle outcome, the game-logic circuitry determines whether any new value-bearing symbols populated the unlocked symbol positions. In certain embodiments, the determination at step <b>112</b> may be focused on specific unlocked symbol positions rather than any unlocked symbol position. If a new value-bearing symbol is detected, the method <b>100</b> proceeds to step <b>114</b>. If no new value-bearing symbol is detected, the method <b>100</b> proceeds to step <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the example embodiment, at step <b>114</b>, the game-logic circuitry causes the display device of the gaming machine to lock the new value-bearing symbols into respective unlocked symbol positions. The respective unlocked symbol positions may be the symbol positions in which the new value-bearing symbols populated in the game-cycle outcome or other suitable unlocked symbol positions. Similar to the locking performed at step <b>106</b>, the display device may visually distinguish the newly locked symbol positions from the remaining unlocked symbol positions, which may include a transitional animation to reflect the change in state of the locked symbol positions.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In response to a value-bearing symbol being locked into a symbol position having an active multiplier value, the award value of the value-bearing symbol is combined with the active multiplier value to generate an updated award value of the value-bearing symbol. In the example embodiment, the award value is multiplied by the multiplier value, which may result in the same award value (i.e., for multiplier values of 1&#xd7;) or a different value. The multiplier value may be any suitable value, including zero or fractional values. In other embodiments, the mathematical function to generate the updated award value may not be limited to multiplication between the two values. That is, other suitable mathematical operations may be performed to calculate the updated award value at least from the initial award value and the multiplier value. In certain embodiments, rather than a mathematical function, the award value of a value-bearing symbol is selected from a set of award values, and the multiplier value causes a different award value to be selected from the set of award values.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the example embodiment, the game-logic circuitry causes the display device to present one or more animations and/or presentation elements to indicate the change in award value to the player. For example, the award indicia of the value-bearing symbol may be animated to indicate the change in award value. In another example, the award indicia may be initially shown with the updated award value, and other animations and/or presentation elements associated with the value-bearing symbol and the occupied symbol position indicate the change to the award value.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In response to a multiplier value being applied to a respective value-bearing symbol, the multiplier value may be deactivated. Deactivating the multiplier value may include visually removing any indication of the multiplier value from the associated symbol position and preventing the multiplier value from changing in response to the game events as described herein. That is, the updated award value of the value-bearing symbol may be locked to a given value because the multiplier value may not change in value or update the award value again. In other embodiments, the multiplier value may be reactivated in response to one or more suitable game events (e.g., the value-bearing symbol occupying the symbol position is shifted to another symbol position, thereby &#x201c;unlocking&#x201d; the symbol position and the corresponding multiplier value).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">At step <b>116</b>, the game cycle counter and at least a portion of the active multiplier values may be reset in response to new value-bearing symbols. In the example embodiment, the game cycle counter and the multiplier values are reset to the respective initial values. For example, the game cycle counter may be reset to three, and the multiplier values may be reset to a 1&#xd7; value. As a result, the game cycle counter is configured to count the number of consecutive game cycle outcomes without new value-bearing symbols, and the multiplier values are configured to change in response to changes to the current count of the game cycle counter as described herein in step <b>118</b>. In other embodiments, the game cycle counter and/or the multiplier values may be reset to another value instead of the initial respective values. In certain embodiments, the game cycle counter does not reset, but rather continues to count each and every generated game cycle outcome such that the length of the bonus game feature is predetermined.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">After step <b>116</b>, the game-logic circuitry is configured to generate a new game cycle outcome at step <b>110</b> and cause the display device to present the new game cycle outcome. As mentioned above, the game-logic circuitry may already have the new game cycle outcome generated and proceeds to cause the display device to present the new game cycle outcome in response to step <b>116</b>. The method <b>100</b> then proceeds again to the determination of step <b>112</b> to determine if the new game cycle outcome includes any new value-bearing symbols, where any value-bearing symbols from the first game cycle outcome are now considered to be &#x201c;preexisting value-bearing symbols.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the example embodiment, if no new value-bearing symbols are detected in the current game cycle outcome, the game logic circuitry updates the game cycle counter and multiplier values at step <b>118</b>. More specifically, the game cycle counter is updated to increase or decrease towards a termination value, and the multiplier values are updated at least partially as a function of the updated count of the game cycle counter. In other embodiments, the updates to the game cycle counter and/or the multiplier values may be in response to certain unlocked symbol positions not including new value-bearing symbols in the current game cycle outcome rather than requiring the absence of new value-bearing symbols through all of the unlocked symbol positions.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The game cycle counter may be incremented or decremented to update the current count. In one example, the initial counter value is three, and the termination value is zero. In this example, at step <b>118</b>, the counter value is decremented by one towards the termination value. When the termination value is reached or exceeded, the bonus game feature may be concluded as described herein. It is to be understood that any suitable mathematical and/or logical operation may be used to update the game cycle counter, and any suitable termination value may be used in the embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The multiplier values are configured to update in response to changes to the game cycle counter. In some embodiments, the multiplier values are configured to update at least partially as a mathematical function of the current count of the game cycle counter. For example, if the game cycle counter increases from one or two, the multipliers may be updated from 1&#xd7; to 2&#xd7;. In other embodiments, each multiplier value is selected from a set of available multiplier values, and changing the game cycle counter causes a new multiplier value to be selected from the set of available multiplier values. In the example embodiment, the multiplier value is selected from a set of at least 1&#xd7;, 2&#xd7;, and 5&#xd7; multiplier values, where the closer the game cycle counter approaches the termination value, the higher the multiplier value. From the player's perspective in the example embodiment, advancement of the game cycle counter means one or more game cycle outcomes without new value-bearing symbols (and therefore potentially no increase to the eventual aggregate award). As a result, the increasing multiplier value may enhance the engagement and excitement of the player through creating tension and &#x201c;near-miss&#x201d; opportunities.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">To aid the player in contextualizing the changes made in step <b>118</b>, the game-logic circuitry is configured to cause the display device to present animations and/or presentation elements to update the game cycle counter and/or the multiplier values. For example, the game cycle counter may be presented throughout the bonus game feature, and the current count is visually updated at step <b>118</b>. To indicate the multiplier values, the display device may be configured to present multiplier indicia at step <b>120</b>. The multiplier indicia, similar to the award indicia of the award values, provides a visual identity to each multiplier value. Unlike the award indicia, which is associated with a respective value-bearing symbol, the multiplier indicia is associated with a given unlocked symbol position. The multiplier indicia may be presented within the symbol position and/or via other suitable means to indicate the relationship between the symbol position and the multiplier value. In one example, the multiplier indicia is a text-based indicator. In another example, the multiplier indicia is a colored background of the symbol position, where the color of the background indicates which multiplier value is associated with the symbol position. In certain embodiments, a single multiplier indicum may be presented for a plurality of symbol positions, such as when a group of adjacent symbol positions have the same multiplier value.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">It is to be understood that, although step <b>120</b> is illustrated as occurring between steps <b>118</b> and <b>122</b>, the multiplier indicia may be presented at any suitable point of the bonus game feature (e.g., at the initial state of step <b>106</b>) and may persist through a plurality of steps of the method <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the multiplier indicia are not shown for multiplier values of 1&#xd7;, but rather are shown for 2&#xd7;, 3&#xd7;, . . . , N&#xd7; multiplier values to give the player an expectation of a change in the award value of a value-bearing symbol in response to populating the associated symbol position. Removal of multiplier values from symbol positions may be indicated to the player through the visual removal of and/or visual changes to the multiplier indicia. In certain embodiments, the visual changes to the multiplier indicia may be different depending on the underlying change to the multiplier value (e.g., visual changes for removal of the multiplier value may be different from the visual changes for the multiplier value resetting).</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the example embodiment, at step <b>122</b>, the game-logic circuitry determines whether or not any termination or end conditions of the bonus game feature have been met. If one or more termination conditions have been met, the bonus game feature may conclude or otherwise progress to a new stage of the bonus game feature at step <b>124</b>. If no termination conditions have been met, the game-logic circuitry continues to generate a new, subsequent game cycle outcome, thereby repeating steps <b>110</b>-<b>122</b>. The termination conditions may include the game cycle counter reaching or exceeding a termination counter value. For example, if the initial counter value is three, the game cycle counter may be decremented at step <b>118</b> until the current count reaches or exceeds a termination counter value of zero, which causes the bonus game feature to conclude. Other suitable termination conditions may be considered in combination with the current count of the game cycle counter and/or separately from the current count. For example, the player may be given the option to manually initiate a &#x201c;card-out&#x201d; or &#x201c;cashout&#x201d; sequence to end the bonus game feature. In another example, populating each and every symbol position with a value-bearing symbol may automatically end the bonus game feature. In such an example, the determination at step <b>122</b> may also occur with steps <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, and <b>116</b> to detect whether every symbol position has been occupied.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the example embodiment, the display device is configured to present one or more award sequences associated with the bonus game feature to the player. The award sequences provide one or more awards to the player for play of the bonus game feature. More specifically, the one or more awards include at least the award values of the locked value-bearing symbols. In the example embodiment, the award sequence may be presented at step <b>124</b> such that the award values of the value-bearing symbols are provided to the player as an aggregated award. It is to be understood that although the term &#x201c;aggregated award&#x201d; is used, the award values are not necessarily combined prior to being added to a credit balance of the player but may be applied separately to the credit balance in at least some embodiments. In certain embodiments, the aggregated award values may be applied to the credit balance as a single value, but the animation of the award sequence may apply each award value separately to the player credit balance.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The display device may use one or more presentation elements and/or animations to convey the award sequences. In addition to the display device, the gaming machine may include other suitable components to convey the award sequences. For example, the gaming machine may include emotive lighting, speakers, vibration motors, and the like to engage the senses of the player. Any suitable combination of sensory presentation elements (including graphically displayed elements) may be used to convey the award sequence and are considered within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>G</figref> depict an example game interface <b>200</b> in a plurality of states of a bonus game feature similar to or the same as the bonus game feature described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.

In such an example, the multiplier value may not change for one or more game cycles from the initial, 1&#xd7; value. Decrementing the counter <b>210</b> prior to or during presentation of the game cycle outcome may facilitate three consecutive game cycle outcomes without value-bearing symbols <b>212</b> instead of four.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref> depicts the game interface in an example fifth state following a subsequent game cycle outcome from the fourth state.

Accordingly, the current count of the game cycle counter <b>210</b> is updated by removing or visibly changing another indicator, thereby leaving one indicator full.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">In addition to updating the game cycle counter <b>210</b>, the multiplier values of the unlocked symbol positions are updated. In at least some embodiments, the multiplier values are updated at least partially as a function of the current count of the game cycle counter <b>210</b>. In one example, the multiplier values are selected from a set of available multiplier values based on the current count of the game cycle counter. In the example embodiment, the set of available multiplier values include 1&#xd7;, 2&#xd7;, and 5&#xd7; multiplier values, where the multiplier value increases as the game cycle counter decreases. In other embodiments, the multiplier values may be calculated based on the current count of the game cycle counter <b>210</b>.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the example embodiment, to convey the multiplier values to the player, multiplier indicia <b>216</b> are presented for each of the unlocked symbol positions. The multiplier indicia <b>216</b> may be any suitable visual presentation element for indicating the effect of the multiplier values as described herein. For example, and without limitation, the multiplier indicia <b>216</b> may include text, borders, backgrounds, graphical elements, animations, and/or other suitable presentation elements to represent the multiplier values. The multiplier indicia <b>216</b> may be separate for each unlocked symbol position or grouped together, such as for adjacent symbol positions having the same multiplier value. In the example embodiment, with two indicators removed or empty from the game cycle counter <b>210</b>, the multiplier value is updated from 1&#xd7; to 2&#xd7; for all of the unlocked symbol positions <b>208</b>, and the multiplier indicia <b>216</b> is presented. In other embodiments, the unlocked symbol positions <b>208</b> may not have the same multiplier value and may be updated separately. For example, in response to the game cycle counter <b>210</b> decrementing, only a portion of the symbol positions <b>208</b> may have the corresponding multiplier values updated.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref> depicts the game interface in an example sixth state following a subsequent game cycle outcome from the fifth state.

The multiplier values are increased from 2&#xd7; to 5&#xd7; in this example, and the multiplier indicia <b>216</b> are updated accordingly. At the sixth state, at least one more game cycle outcome is guaranteed in the bonus game feature. If the next game cycle outcome does not result in the game cycle counter <b>210</b> resetting (e.g., due to no new value-bearing symbols added to the symbol array <b>202</b>), the bonus game feature may conclude and award the player for the locked value-bearing symbols present within the symbol array <b>202</b>. In certain embodiments, the award sequence for the locked value-bearing symbols may not be automatic at the conclusion of the bonus game feature, but rather may require one or more award conditions to receive the award (e.g., achieve a threshold number of value-bearing symbols in a row, column, and/or the array as a whole).</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>G</figref> depicts the game interface in a seventh state following a game cycle outcome after the sixth state. More specifically, a new value-bearing symbol <b>218</b> has populated the symbol array <b>202</b>, thereby resetting the game cycle counter <b>210</b> to the initial counter value and continuing the bonus feature game. In addition to the resetting the game cycle counter <b>210</b>, the multiplier values for the remaining multiplier values may be reset to 1&#xd7;. In the example embodiment, the multiplier indicia <b>216</b> are hidden or removed from the interface <b>200</b> while the multiplier values are 1&#xd7;. In other embodiments, the multiplier indicia <b>216</b> may be continuous shown and updated with the multiplier values.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">The new value-bearing symbol <b>218</b> is locked into the symbol position <b>220</b> and the award value is updated based on the current multiplier value. In the example embodiment, the initial award value of the new value-bearing symbol <b>218</b> is 200, and the current multiplier value was 5&#xd7; as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>F</figref>. Accordingly, combining the initial award value and the current multiplier value caused the new value-bearing symbol to be updated to an award value of 1000. The interface <b>200</b> may include presentation elements and/or animations to convey the change in award value to the player. For example, the multiplier indicia <b>216</b> may temporarily be overlaid with the new value-bearing symbol <b>218</b>, where both the initial award value and the multiplier indicia <b>216</b> are both visible. An animation to update the award value may remove the multiplier indicia <b>216</b> and depict the award value increasing to the new, updated award value.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">In some embodiments, the number of new value-bearing symbols added to the symbol array <b>202</b> throughout the bonus game feature is random based on the random determinations in generating each game cycle outcome. In other embodiments, the number of new value-bearing symbols may be based on random determinations other than the game cycle outcome generation such that one or more game cycle outcomes are at least partially predetermined based on the prior random determinations.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flow diagram of an example method <b>300</b> for determining game outcomes within a bonus game feature similar to the feature described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b>G</figref>. The method <b>300</b> may be at least partially performed by the game-logic circuitry of the gaming machine, which may cause one or more display devices to display presentation elements for the game based on the steps described herein. In other embodiments, the method <b>300</b> may include additional, fewer, or alternative steps, including those described elsewhere herein.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">At step <b>302</b>, the bonus game feature is initiated. Initiating the bonus game feature may include, for example, detecting a trigger condition in the base game feature, locking any preexisting value-bearing symbols in the symbol positions, initiating multiplier values for unlocked symbol positions, and/or initiating a game cycle counter.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">At step <b>304</b>, the game-logic circuitry determines multiplier outcomes for the bonus game feature based on one or more random outcomes (e.g., from a random number generator). The multiplier outcomes indicate at least how many value-bearing symbols will populate the symbol array in the bonus game feature. In the example embodiment, the multiplier outcomes further indicate the number of value-bearing symbols to populate the symbol array at a given multiplier value. For example, if the three available multiplier values are 1&#xd7;, 2&#xd7;, and 5&#xd7;, the multiplier outcomes may indicate that three value-bearing symbols will be added at 1&#xd7;, no value-bearing symbols at 2&#xd7;, and two value-bearing symbols will be added at 5&#xd7; throughout the bonus game feature. Notably, in the example embodiment, the initial award value and symbol position of each value-bearing symbol may not be predetermined, but rather are randomly determined in the game cycle outcome determinations described herein. In other embodiments, the initial value, symbol position, and/or game cycle outcome of each value-bearing symbol may be determined as part of the multiplier outcomes.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The multiplier outcome may be randomly selected from one or more weighted tables of multiplier outcomes. The weighted tables define or link the underlying random outcomes or determinations to different multiplier outcomes. For example, a random number generator of the game-logic circuitry may be configured to generate random values within a range of values, and the weighted table may define different multiplier outcomes associated with different subsets of values within the range of random values. In some embodiments, a plurality of weighted tables is available for a plurality of different states. The states may be based on one or more game parameters, such as the number of trigger symbols (e.g., value-bearing symbols) that initiate the bonus game feature. For example, initiating the bonus game feature with six trigger symbols may have a first weighted table for determining a multiplier outcome, whereas initiating the bonus game feature with seven trigger symbols may have a second weighted table different from the first table.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">At step <b>306</b>, the game-logic circuitry proceeds to generate game cycle outcomes. The game cycle outcomes may be based on one or more random outcomes separate from the multiplier outcomes, such as the location and/or initial award value of any value-bearing symbols within a game cycle outcome. At step <b>308</b>, which may occur prior to, during, or after the game cycle outcomes of step <b>306</b> are generated, the game-logic circuitry may generate one or more guaranteed game cycle outcomes based on the multiplier outcomes. The guaranteed game cycle outcomes may be generated to facilitate compliance between the game cycle outcomes to the number of value-bearing symbols to be added and at which multiplier value as established by the multiplier outcomes. The guaranteed game cycle outcomes may be fully predefined by the multiplier outcomes or partially predefined (e.g., position and initial award value are randomly generated for any new value-bearing symbols). The guaranteed game cycle outcomes are not necessarily limited to outcomes with new value-bearing symbols but may also include outcomes without value-bearing symbols to increase the multiplier values and/or to conclude the bonus game feature after the multiplier outcomes have been satisfied. In certain embodiments, the multiplier outcomes and the corresponding guaranteed game cycle outcomes only define a threshold number of value-bearing symbols to be awarded during the bonus game feature, and additional value-bearing symbols may be randomly awarded through the bonus game feature within the game cycle outcomes generated at step <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">The game cycle outcomes of steps <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> may be generated as whole prior to the presentation of the game cycle outcomes in some embodiments given the relative speed of generating game outcomes. In certain embodiments,</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">At step <b>310</b>, one or more termination conditions of the bonus game feature have been met, and an award sequence for providing an aggregated award is initiated. Within the underlying game logic, the award values of the value-bearing symbols may be aggregated throughout the bonus game feature or at the conclusion of the bonus game feature. After the aggregated award is provided to the player, the bonus game feature may conclude at step <b>312</b>, and the base game feature is resumed.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">The foregoing systems and methods describe the use of dynamic multipliers and value-bearing symbols based on a counter and irrespective of location within a symbol array.

The bonus game feature may be initiated in response to one or more conditions or events associated with a base game feature, such as a base game outcome including a number of value-bearing symbols meeting or exceeding a trigger threshold. In one example, the trigger threshold may be three or more value-bearing symbols within a base game outcome. In certain embodiments, the base game feature and the bonus game feature both incorporate a plurality of symbol positions that are selectively populated by symbols (including value-bearing symbols). In other embodiments, the bonus game feature may include presenting symbol positions according to a predefined configuration (e.g., a symbol array) to facilitate the features and functions of the bonus game feature as described herein.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Initiating the bonus game feature may include causing the display device to lock any preexisting value-bearing symbols from the base game feature within the symbol array. In at least some embodiments, the value-bearing symbols may include a number of trigger value-bearing symbols for generating multipliers as described herein. In certain embodiments, other non-value-bearing symbols may be used to generate the multipliers as described herein. In such embodiments, the trigger non-value-bearing symbols may persist within the symbol positions at least until a region associated with the multipliers is defined.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">At step <b>404</b>, the game-logic circuitry defines one or more multiplier regions within the plurality of symbol positions for generating multipliers. The multiplier region may include at least one symbol position (and potentially up to all symbol positions) and is composed of one or more subregions, where the subregions may overlap each other. Each subregion is generated based on a trigger symbol from the initiation of the bonus game feature. The trigger symbol may be present from the base game outcome triggering the bonus game feature or may be applied at step <b>402</b> during initiation of the bonus game feature. In certain embodiments, rather than symbols populating the symbol positions, the trigger symbols may be tracked and stored in a separate counter, which may be display in combination with the symbol positions.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">In the example embodiment, at least a portion of the value-bearing symbols may act as trigger symbols. The trigger symbols may be visually distinguished from non-trigger symbols, such as through different colors, borders, presentation elements, and the like. In certain embodiments, all of the value-bearing symbols may act as trigger symbols. In such embodiments, only the value-bearing symbols present at the initiation of the bonus game feature may be used to define the multiplier region, while other embodiments may facilitate a dynamic multiplier region throughout the bonus game feature based on new value-bearing symbols within the symbol positions. The multiplier region and/or the multiplier subregions may be randomly selected from a weighted table of a plurality of available multiplier regions and/or subregions based on the number of trigger symbols. That is, different weighted tables may be used for different amounts of trigger symbols.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">For each trigger symbol, a subregion is established within the plurality of symbol positions. The subregions include one or more symbol positions. The symbol positions, shape, and/or size of the subregions may be at least partially random. For example, a subregion may be randomly selected from a plurality of available subregions associated with the trigger symbol. At step <b>406</b>, the display device presents multiplier selectors for symbol positions within the subregions of the multiplier region. Each multiplier selector may be associated with a respective symbol position or group of symbol positions (e.g., one multiplier selector may be used for an entire multiplier region). The multiplier selector may visually present a plurality of available multiplier values that may be applied to value-bearing symbols occupying the associated one or more symbol positions.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The multiplier selectors may be configured to initiate at a predefined set of available multiplier values. However, for symbol positions within two or more multiplier subregions, the available multiplier values may increase in value and/or increase in number of available multiplier values based on the number of overlapping multiplier regions. In one example, the multiplier values for a given symbol position may initiate at 1&#xd7;, 2&#xd7;, and 3&#xd7; and increase to 2&#xd7;, 3&#xd7;, and 5&#xd7; in response to the symbol position being within two multiplier subregions. In another example, rather than increasing the value of the multipliers, the set of available multipliers may be updated to 1&#xd7;, 2&#xd7;, 3&#xd7;, and 5&#xd7;.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">In some embodiments, to present the multiplier region and the multiplier selectors, each multiplier subregion may be applied to the symbol positions sequentially, where applying the multiplier subregion may include visually distinguishing between symbol positions within and outside of the multiplier region. The multiplier selectors are presented in the symbol positions of each subregion and, as overlapping subregions are applied, the multiplier values of the multiplier selectors may be updated. In other embodiments, other suitable animation and/or presentation elements may be used to convey the application of the multiplier region and the multiplier selectors. For example, rather than visually applying the subregions separately, the multiplier region as a whole may be visually applied to the symbol positions.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">As the multiplier region is formed from the subregions, the borders between different subregions may be removed such that the multiplier region may appear to be a single, continuous group of symbol positions. The evidence of any overlapping subregions in such an embodiment may be found in the varying sets of multiplier values of the multiplier selectors. In other embodiments, at least some presentation elements and/or animations may be used to distinguish between subregions. In one example, the symbol positions may be distinguished within a &#x201c;heat map,&#x201d; where symbol positions have a different color, border, and/or the like based on the number of overlapping subregions.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Unlike the prior embodiments in which multiplier values are only applicable to new value-bearing symbols added within the bonus game feature to the symbol positions, the multiplier region and the multiplier selectors may be applied to preexisting value-bearing symbols within the symbol positions. In certain embodiments, the multiplier region may be guaranteed to include at least one preexisting value-bearing symbol and/or new value-bearing symbol.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">At step <b>408</b>, the game-logic circuitry generates a game cycle outcome and causes the display device to present the game cycle outcome. The game cycle outcome includes selectively and randomly populating unlocked symbol positions with value-bearing symbols. That is, each unlocked symbol position may or may not be populated with a new value-bearing symbol. A symbol position not populated with a value-bearing symbol may be populated with a non-value-bearing symbol or left unoccupied (sometimes referred to herein as populated by a &#x201c;void&#x201d;). The animation of the game cycle outcome may include a plurality of available symbols and/or voids rotating, spinning, or otherwise temporarily occupying the unlocked symbols before landing on the symbol or void specified by the game cycle outcome.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">At step <b>410</b>, any new value-bearing symbols from the game cycle outcome are locked within the symbol positions. Locking the new value-bearing symbols within the symbol positions may include any suitable animations and/or presentation elements to convey to the player the value-bearing symbols will remain for at least one or more subsequent outcomes. In some embodiments, the new value-bearing symbols are locked into the respective symbol positions each new value-bearing symbol occupies in the game cycle outcome. In other embodiments, the new value-bearing symbols may be shifted to other symbol positions to be locked for one or more subsequent game cycle outcomes. In one example, one or more new value-bearing symbols may be shifted into or out of the multiplier region. In certain embodiments, only new value-bearing symbols occupying the multiplier region are locked into the symbol positions such that symbol positions external to the multiplier region are repopulated irrespective of the types of symbols within the external symbol positions.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">At step <b>412</b>, the game-logic circuitry determines whether or not one or more termination conditions have been met for the bonus game feature. The termination conditions may include, but are not limited to, reaching a predefined threshold number of game cycle outcomes, reaching a threshold number of game cycle outcomes without new value-bearing symbols (consecutive outcomes or otherwise), no remaining unlocked symbol positions available, and the like. In some embodiments, the bonus game feature is configured to have a predefined length (e.g., N number of game cycle outcomes). The length of the bonus game feature may be adjusted at the initiation of the bonus game feature, such as based on the number of trigger symbols or value-bearing symbols. In other embodiments, the length of the bonus game feature is dynamic and may continue or terminate based on the game cycle outcomes. In such embodiments, the length of the bonus game feature may last at least a predetermined minimum number of game cycles and/or up to a predetermined maximum number of game cycles.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">If the termination conditions have not been met, the game-logic circuitry causes another game cycle outcome to be generated and continue steps <b>408</b>-<b>412</b> until the termination conditions are met. In response to meeting the termination conditions, the game-logic circuitry applies multiplier values to the value-bearing symbols within the multiplier region at step <b>414</b>. More specifically, for each value-bearing symbol within the multiplier region, a multiplier value is selected from the multiplier selector of the symbol position occupied by the value-bearing symbol. The multiplier value selection may be random, partially random, predetermined, and/or manual (e.g., the player is given the option to select the multiplier). The selected multiplier is then applied to the award value of the value-bearing symbol. Application of the multiplier may include mathematical operations, such as multiplication, and/or selecting a new award value from a plurality of available award values based on the multiplier.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">For symbol positions within the multiplier region that are unpopulated by value-bearing symbols, the multipliers are removed. The value-bearing symbols external to the multiplier region may remain in the symbol positions, but the corresponding award values remain the same. In certain embodiments, play of the bonus game feature and/or player input may enable one or more external value-bearing symbols to be shifted within the multiplier region. For example, trigger value-bearing symbols may be shifted within the multiplier region.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The display device may be configured to present one or more presentation elements and/or animations associated with the multiplier selectors and the features of step <b>414</b>. For example, through the game cycle outcomes, the multiplier selectors may be animated to cycle the available multiplier values using any suitable animation schemes (e.g., spinning through the values, highlight values according to a sequence, etc.). Selection of a multiplier value may include the selected multiplier value being highlighted or otherwise visually distinguished from the other available multiplier values before updating the award value of the associated value-bearing symbol. The multiplier selectors may be visually hidden, removed, or changed in response to selecting and applying a multiplier value. The award indicia of the value-bearing symbols within the multiplier region may be updated to reflect the new award values, which may include animations convey the change in award value.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the example embodiment, at step <b>416</b>, the game-logic circuitry ends the bonus game feature with an awards sequence to provide an aggregated award at least partially based on the award values indicated by the value-bearing symbols. The award values may be individually or collectively applied to a credit balance of the player through one or more animations. The animations may include, for example, the award value of a given value-bearing symbol being added to the credit balance (or a running total of the aggregated award) while the value-bearing symbol is removed from the corresponding symbol position. After the award sequence is complete, the bonus game feature may conclude, and the base game feature may resume.

In one example, a multiplier subregion may have a randomized shape, but is required to include the symbol position of the associated trigger value-bearing symbol <b>506</b>.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> depicts the first multiplier subregion <b>508</b> as a 2&#xd7;2 square indicated by the bolded border, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> depicts the second multiplier subregion <b>510</b> as another 2&#xd7;2 square of symbol positions, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>D</figref> depicts the third multiplier subregion <b>512</b> as four symbol positions across the middle row of the array <b>502</b>. These multiplier subregions <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> are combined to form a multiplier region for play of the bonus game feature. Combining the multiplier subregions <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> may be done sequentially within the presentation by the display device such that the multiplier region dynamically grows with each additional subregion.

The game-logic circuitry is configured to track the number of multiplier subregions <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> overlapping each symbol position.

More specifically, the multiplier subregions <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> have been combined to form a multiplier region <b>514</b> as indicated by border <b>516</b>. The multiplier region <b>514</b> may include any suitable visual features to aid the player in distinguishing between symbol positions within and outside of the multiplier region <b>514</b>. For example, and without limitation, the multiplier region <b>514</b> and the symbol positions within may include a border, background, animations, and/or other distinctive visual features. Although the border <b>516</b> is shown only around the external edge of the multiplier region <b>514</b>, at least some embodiments include highlighted borders around each symbol position within the multiplier region <b>514</b>. In certain embodiments, the multiplier subregions <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> may be visually distinguishable within the multiplier region <b>514</b> through the bonus game feature.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">For the symbol positions within the multiplier region <b>514</b>, the game-logic circuitry causes the display device to present one or more multiplier selectors <b>518</b>. In the example embodiment, each symbol position has a respective multiplier selector <b>518</b>. In other embodiments, each multiplier selector <b>518</b> may be associated with a group of symbol positions. In certain embodiments, one multiplier selector <b>518</b> is presented for the multiplier region <b>514</b> as a whole. Each multiplier selector <b>518</b> is configured to present a plurality of available multiplier values. Although the multiplier selectors <b>518</b> show all three available multiplier values concurrently, other suitable presentations of the multiplier selectors <b>518</b> may include cycling through the available multiplier values one at a time. In certain embodiments, the multiplier selector <b>518</b> does not present the multiplier values, but rather keeps the multiplier value visibly hidden until a multiplier value is to be selected as described herein.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In the example embodiment, the multiplier selectors <b>518</b> are initialized with a set of 1&#xd7;, 2&#xd7;, and 5&#xd7; multiplier values. However, these multiplier values are configured to increase based on the number of multiplier subregions overlapping the corresponding symbol position. In this example, the values increase to 2&#xd7;, 4&#xd7;, and 5&#xd7; in response to the symbol position being within two multiplier subregions, and the values further increase to 5&#xd7;, 8&#xd7;, and 10&#xd7; in response to the symbol position being within all three multiplier subregions. In some embodiments, the increase in multiplier values may be the result of a mathematical function of the prior multiplier values and the number of overlapping multiplier subregions. It is to be understood that the specific multiplier values as used herein are for exemplary purposes only and are not intended to limit the embodiments described herein.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">In some embodiments, in addition to or in place of increasing the multiplier values, additional multiplier values may be added to the set of available multiplier values. For example, if the initial set of multiplier values is 1&#xd7;, 2&#xd7;, and 5&#xd7;, the set may be updated to 1&#xd7;, 2&#xd7;, 4&#xd7;, and 5&#xd7; in response to the symbol position being within two multiplier subregions. In certain embodiments, some multiplier values, such as the lowest values in the set, may be removed in response to the symbol position being within more than one multiplier subregion, thereby increasing the chance of a higher multiplier value being selected.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">In the example embodiment, symbol position <b>520</b> is within all three multiplier regions <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>, symbol positions <b>522</b> are within two of the multiplier regions <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>, and symbol positions <b>524</b> are only within one of the multiplier subregions <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>512</b>. Accordingly, the multiplier values for each symbol position of the multiplier region <b>514</b> are updated based on the number of overlapping subregions. In certain embodiments, as each multiplier subregion <b>508</b>, <b>510</b>, <b>512</b> is applied to the array <b>502</b>, the multiplier selectors <b>518</b> are added to the corresponding symbol positions and/or updated in response to an overlapping multiplier subregion.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">The multiplier selectors <b>518</b> may be presented in a manner that enables a player to view both the multiplier selector <b>518</b> and the award indicia of a value-bearing symbol <b>504</b> associated with a given symbol position simultaneously. In other embodiments, particularly embodiments in which the multiplier value is selected from the multiplier selector <b>518</b> immediately in response to a value-bearing symbol <b>504</b> occupying the corresponding symbol position, the multiplier selector <b>518</b> or the value-bearing symbol <b>504</b> may visually obscure the other until the multiplier selector is removed or hidden.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>F</figref> depicts the game interface <b>500</b> in a third state following a game cycle outcome.

That is, all, some, or none of the unoccupied symbol positions may be populated with a new value-bearing symbol for a given game cycle outcome. In the third state, a new value-bearing symbol <b>526</b> is locked into a symbol position of the multiplier region <b>514</b>. The new value-bearing symbol <b>526</b> may remain fixed or locked until an award is provided for the new value-bearing symbol <b>526</b> (e.g., at the conclusion of the bonus game feature). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>G</figref> depicts the game interface <b>500</b> in a fourth state following another game cycle outcome.

In other embodiments, the multiplier region <b>514</b> may be dynamically adjusted during the bonus game feature. For example, new trigger value-bearing symbols <b>506</b> added to the symbol array <b>502</b> during the bonus game feature may expand or otherwise change the multiplier region <b>514</b>. In another example, the player may be provided the option to manually add and/or remove certain symbol positions from the multiplier region <b>514</b>. In certain embodiments, new trigger value-bearing symbols <b>506</b> may not affect the multiplier region <b>514</b> or may not be generated during the bonus game feature.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">In the example embodiment, the multiplier selectors <b>518</b> are not applied to the value-bearing symbols <b>504</b> until a termination condition of the bonus game feature is met. In other embodiments, the multiplier selectors <b>518</b> may be applied, separately or as a whole, throughout any suitable point of the bonus game feature. If the multiplier selectors <b>518</b> are applied prior to the termination condition, the multiplier region <b>514</b> may be configured to update to remove the corresponding symbol position such that the multiplier region <b>514</b> only includes unpopulated symbol positions.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">To apply the multiplier selectors <b>518</b> to value-bearing symbols <b>504</b> within the associated symbol positions, a multiplier value is selected from each multiplier selector <b>518</b>. The selection process may be random, partially random, or predetermined. The presentation of the selection may include cycling through the available multiplier values until landing on the selected multiplier value and updating the award value of the corresponding value-bearing symbol <b>504</b>. The updated award value is conveyed to the player through updating the award indicia of the value-bearing symbol <b>504</b>. The multiplier selector <b>518</b> may then be visually hidden or removed, and the multiplier region <b>514</b> may also be removed in response to all of the multiplier selectors <b>518</b> being applied. Multiplier selectors <b>518</b> associated with symbol positions not occupied by value-bearing symbols <b>504</b> may be removed without affecting the award values of the value-bearing symbols <b>504</b>.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>H</figref> depicts the game interface <b>500</b> after the multiplier selectors <b>518</b> have been applied and removed. More specifically, the value-bearing symbol <b>526</b> had a 1&#xd7; multiplier applied, the value-bearing symbol <b>528</b> had an 8&#xd7; multiplier applied, and the value-bearing symbol <b>530</b> (which was a preexisting symbol from the first state) had a 5&#xd7; multiplier applied. As a result, the award value of the value-bearing symbol <b>526</b> remained at <b>300</b>, the award value of the value-bearing symbol <b>528</b> increased from 200 to 1600, and the award value of the value-bearing symbol <b>530</b> increased from 200 to 1000 as reflected by the respective award indicia.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">In the example embodiment, the award values of the value-bearing symbols <b>504</b> within the array <b>502</b> are provided to the player through one or more award sequences. The award sequences may include removal of the value-bearing symbols <b>504</b> from the array <b>502</b>. In other embodiments, the value-bearing symbols <b>504</b> are not immediately removed, but rather are unlocked from the symbol positions.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">Although the foregoing embodiments from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>8</b>H</figref> are described in relation to bonus game features, it is to be understood that the game features may also be incorporated into play of a base game feature. The game feature may include variations, particularly to the trigger and termination conditions, to facilitate the use in a base game. Moreover, the foregoing game features may not be limited to wagering games, but rather may also be used in casual games. In such casual games, the awards and credits may not have monetary value, and are used to fund the duration of the game, purchase digital items having no monetary value, and/or other similar uses.</p><p id="p-0152" num="0151">In the embodiments disclosed herein, each value-bearing symbol may be assigned a credit value that is displayed upon the symbol. The credit value may, for example, range from a minimum credit value to a maximum credit value and be based on the total amount wagered on the game. For example, if a player wagers a minimum of 100 credits, the assigned credit value may range from 100 to 1000 credits. And if a player wagers a maximum of 500 credits, the assigned credit value may proportionately increase and thereby range from 500 to 5000 credits. In some embodiments, the assigned value may be randomly selected from a list of possible multipliers of the total amount wagered on the game, for example, 1&#xd7;, 2&#xd7;, 3&#xd7;, 4&#xd7;, 5&#xd7;, 10&#xd7;, 15&#xd7;, 20&#xd7;, 50&#xd7;, and 100&#xd7;. In other embodiments, the value may be pre-assigned to each value-bearing symbol as part of the reel strip layouts of the game reels. In still other embodiments, the assigned value may be randomly selected before, during, or at the conclusion of a reel spin.</p><p id="p-0153" num="0152">As disclosed in the embodiments herein, awards may be provided for each game outcome based on at least the remaining symbols. For example, line pays and scatter pays may be awarded for each game cycle outcome based on the symbols populating the symbol array. In some embodiments, the value-bearing symbols may not be associated with awards outside of the features described herein. In other embodiments, the value-bearing symbols may be included within line pays, scatter pays, and/or other suitable awards. For example, the value-bearing symbols may be treated as a special symbol, such as a wild symbol.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">The embodiments of the present invention provide innovative procedures for aggregating values of symbols in a symbol array and applying dynamic modifiers. Game-logic circuitry executing instructions in accordance with the embodiments present a visual display of spinning reels with clearly enumerated symbology that combine in readily understood arrangements to increase in value. An observer experiences excitement and anticipation as new symbols land in the array and aggregate values are summed and displayed. In stark contrast to conventional reel-spinning games in which symbol images are evaluated for winning combinations by paytable rules, the disclosed embodiments provide immediately recognizable values in WYSIWYG display configurations while adding variability as to how the values to be awarded to the player are selected and accumulated.</p><p id="p-0155" num="0154">The value-aggregation and dynamic modifier procedures may be symbol- and game-agnostic. Themes and imagery of symbols and environment may be varied with no effect on the value-aggregation and dynamic modifier processes. Or, if so desired, the criteria for value-aggregation and/or dynamic modifier may be modified in innumerable ways to produce new visual/animation effects and exciting summation sequences.</p><p id="p-0156" num="0155">Further benefits are realized in increased computer processing efficiency, fewer rules to be evaluated, and simpler graphical representations. For example, in a conventional paytable evaluation, overlapping payline sections require multiple evaluation steps. Often, analysis is required to determine which payline results in the highest credit total, with the lesser value paylines being discarded but only after being evaluated-all this adds to processing overhead. Special symbols like wilds, multipliers, and scatter symbols can modify paytable values and may require separate, additional evaluation according to customized rule sets. All these procedures can be inherently more complex than simple aggregation (i.e., addition) of number values. The embodiments disclosed herein represents a win-win: simpler, almost self-explanatory graphics combined with faster, more efficient processing. The inventive value-aggregation and dynamic modifier procedures can be implemented on the vast majority of casino gaming machines without requiring upgrades or modifications.</p><p id="p-0157" num="0156">Each of these embodiments and obvious variations thereof is contemplated as falling within the spirit and scope of the claimed invention, which is set forth in the following claims.
