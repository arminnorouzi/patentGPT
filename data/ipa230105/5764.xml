Producing patterned material on a substrate requires controlled methods for removal of exposed material. Chemical etching is used for a variety of purposes including transferring a pattern in photoresist into underlying layers, thinning layers, or thinning lateral dimensions of features already present on the surface. Often it is desirable to have an etch process that etches one material faster than another facilitating, for example, a pattern transfer process or individual material removal. Such an etch process is said to be selective to the first material. As a result of the diversity of materials, circuits, and processes, etch processes have been developed with a selectivity towards a variety of materials.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Etch processes may be termed wet or dry based on the materials used in the process. A wet HF etch preferentially removes silicon oxide over other dielectrics and materials. However, wet processes may have difficulty penetrating some constrained trenches and also may sometimes deform the remaining material. Dry etch processes may penetrate into intricate features and trenches, but may not provide acceptable top-to-bottom profiles. As device sizes continue to shrink in next-generation devices, the ways in which systems deliver precursors into and through a chamber may have an increasing impact. As uniformity of processing conditions continues to increase in importance, chamber designs and system set-ups may have an important role in the quality of devices produced.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, there is a need for improved systems and methods that can be used to produce high quality devices and structures.

Many dry etch operations performed during semiconductor fabrication may involve multiple precursors. When energized and combined in various ways, these etchants may be delivered to a substrate to remove or modify aspects of the substrate. Traditional processing systems may provide precursors, such as for deposition or etching, in multiple ways. One way of providing enhanced precursors is to provide all of the precursors through a remote plasma unit before delivering the precursors through a processing chamber and to a substrate, such as a wafer, for processing. An issue with this process, however, is that the power at which a plasma is ignited may affect the process being performed by the amount of dissociation produced. For example, in some processes a high amount of dissociation for a hydrogen-containing precursor may be beneficial, but a lower amount of dissociation for a fluorine-containing precursor may allow a more controlled etch. Additionally, because of the amount of travel between a remote plasma unit and the substrate, recombination may be an increased challenge.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Traditional processing may also deliver one precursor through a remote plasma device for plasma processing, and may deliver a second precursor directly into a chamber. An issue with this process, however, is that mixing of the precursors may be difficult, may not provide adequate control over etchant generation, and may not provide a uniform etchant at the wafer or substrate. This may cause processes to not be performed uniformly across a surface of a substrate, which may cause device issues as patterning and formation continues.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">An additional process for plasma formation may involve producing a capacitively-coupled plasma within the chamber, such as in a remote region within the chamber, or within the processing volume. A wafer-level plasma may bombard delicate features, and affect chemical etching. Producing a remote plasma within the processing volume may provide a number of benefits. For example, a lower-power plasma may be generated to control ionization, and because the generation is nearer the substrate to be processed, recombination due to travel distance may be less of a challenge. Additionally, plasma species may be distributed radially outward more uniformly than delivery from a remote plasma unit, which may deliver precursors through a centrally located tube. However, producing the plasma within the chamber where certain lid stack components may be grounded, while others may be coupled with a power supply, may increase parasitic plasma formation. As an example discussed further below, because an RPS unit may be operated at lower power frequency than an internal capacitively-coupled plasma, the RPS unit may effectively operate as a ground, which may cause plasma generation upstream of the remote location within the chamber, and which may detrimentally damage components, as well as impact etch uniformity.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present technology may overcome these issues by utilizing components and systems configured to limit or prevent plasma generation outside of desired locations, while providing a chamber configured to provide multiple plasma generation capabilities for increased system flexibility. Systems of the present technology may also include component configurations that control electrical coupling between components, affording multiple plasma generation capabilities.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Although the remaining disclosure will routinely identify specific etching processes utilizing the disclosed technology, it will be readily understood that the systems and methods are equally applicable to deposition and cleaning processes as may occur in the described chambers. Accordingly, the technology should not be considered to be so limited as for use with etching processes or chambers alone. The disclosure will discuss one possible system and chamber that can be used with the present technology before describing component aspects and variations to this system according to embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a top plan view of one embodiment of a processing system <b>100</b> of deposition, etching, baking, and curing chambers according to embodiments. In the figure, a pair of front opening unified pods (FOUPs) <b>102</b> supply substrates of a variety of sizes that are received by robotic arms <b>104</b> and placed into a low pressure holding area <b>106</b> before being placed into one of the substrate processing chambers <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, positioned in tandem sections <b>109</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>. A second robotic arm <b>110</b> may be used to transport the substrate wafers from the holding area <b>106</b> to the substrate processing chambers <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>and back. Each substrate processing chamber <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, can be outfitted to perform a number of substrate processing operations including the dry etch processes described herein in addition to cyclical layer deposition (CLD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), etch, pre-clean, degas, orientation, and other substrate processes.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The substrate processing chambers <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>may include one or more system components for depositing, annealing, curing and/or etching a dielectric film on the substrate wafer. In one configuration, two pairs of the processing chambers, e.g., <b>108</b><i>c</i>-<i>d </i>and <b>108</b><i>e</i>-<i>f</i>, may be used to deposit dielectric material on the substrate, and the third pair of processing chambers, e.g., <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, may be used to etch the deposited dielectric. In another configuration, all three pairs of chambers, e.g., <b>108</b><i>a</i>-<i>f</i>, may be configured to etch a dielectric film on the substrate. Any one or more of the processes described may be carried out in chamber(s) separated from the fabrication system shown in different embodiments. It will be appreciated that additional configurations of deposition, etching, annealing, and curing chambers for dielectric films are contemplated by system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic cross-sectional view of an exemplary processing system <b>200</b> according to embodiments of the present technology. System <b>200</b> may include a processing chamber <b>205</b> and a remote plasma system (&#x201c;RPS&#x201d;) unit <b>210</b>, which is shown partially. The remote plasma unit <b>210</b> may be coupled with processing chamber <b>205</b> with one or more components. The remote plasma unit <b>210</b> may be coupled with one or more of an adapter <b>215</b>, an isolator <b>225</b>, and a mixing manifold <b>230</b>. Mixing manifold <b>230</b> may be coupled with a top of processing chamber <b>205</b>, and may be coupled with an inlet to processing chamber <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Adapter <b>215</b> may be coupled with the RPS unit in embodiments. Adapter <b>215</b> may be characterized by a first end <b>217</b> and a second end <b>218</b> opposite the first end, where RPS unit <b>210</b> is seated on the first end <b>217</b> of the adapter <b>215</b>. Adapter <b>215</b> may define one or more central channels through portions of adapter <b>215</b>. For example, from first end <b>217</b>, central channel <b>219</b>, or a first central channel, may extend at least partially through adapter <b>215</b> towards second end <b>218</b>, and may extend through any length of adapter <b>215</b>. Central channel <b>219</b> may extend more than half of a length through adapter <b>215</b>. As will be explained further below, by configuring adapter <b>215</b> with a first central channel extending greater than <b>50</b>% of a length of the length of the adapter, parasitic plasma formation within the adapter may be limited or prevented.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Adapter <b>215</b> may define a base of first central channel <b>219</b> within the adapter <b>215</b>, which may define a transition from central channel <b>219</b> to a plurality of apertures <b>221</b> that may at least partially extend through adapter <b>215</b>. The transition may occur at a location below a midpoint through the adapter, such as nearer the second end <b>218</b> of the adapter <b>215</b>. For example, apertures <b>221</b> may extend from a base of first central channel <b>219</b> towards second end <b>218</b> of adapter <b>215</b>, and may extend to fluidly couple with a second central channel <b>223</b>. Second central channel <b>223</b> may extend from the plurality of apertures <b>221</b> to the second end <b>218</b> of the adapter <b>215</b>. Second central channel <b>223</b> may extend less than or about <b>50</b>% of a length of adapter <b>215</b> in a direction of flow from the RPS unit, and may extend less than or about 40% of a length of the adapter, less than or about 30% of a length of the adapter, less than or about 20% of a length of the adapter, less than or about 10% of a length of the adapter, or less.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">By limiting a length of the second central channel through the adapter, parasitic plasma formation may be limited within the adapter. Similarly, apertures <b>221</b> may be characterized by a diameter configured to limit plasma formation within the apertures by a hollow cathode effect. For example, in some embodiments, apertures <b>221</b> may be characterized by a cross-sectional diameter of less than or about 50% of a diameter of central channel <b>219</b>, and may be characterized by a diameter less than or about 40%, less than or about 30%, less than or about 20%, less than or about 10%, less than or about 5%, or less of the diameter of central channel <b>219</b>. Second central channel <b>223</b> may be characterized by a similar cross-sectional diameter as the first central channel <b>219</b> in some embodiments, although the diameter may be greater than or less than the diameter of first central channel <b>219</b> in some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Based on plasma powers utilized in the processing system, apertures <b>221</b> may be characterized by a cross-sectional diameter of less than or about 10 mm, and may be characterized by a cross-sectional diameter of less than or about 9 mm, less than or about 8 mm, less than or about 7 mm, less than or about 6 mm, less than or about 5 mm, less than or about 4 mm, or less. This may limit or prevent plasma generation within the apertures, which may control plasma formation upstream of the mixing manifold <b>230</b> in some embodiments. Adapter <b>215</b> may also define a ledge as will be described further below, and on which a system cover or housing <b>220</b> may be seated, as shown. The housing may be coupled with electrical ground as shown, and thus, adapter <b>215</b> may be coupled with electrical ground in some embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Adapter <b>215</b> may be made of a ceramic or insulative material, although in some embodiments, adapter <b>215</b> may be made of or include aluminum, including oxides of aluminum, treated aluminum on one or more surfaces, or some other material, such as nickel, or nickel-plated aluminum. For example, interior surfaces of adapter <b>215</b> may be coated with one or more materials to protect adapter <b>215</b> from damage that may be caused by plasma effluents from remote plasma unit <b>210</b>. Interior surfaces of adapter <b>215</b> may be anodized with a range of materials that may be inert to plasma effluents of fluorine, for example, and which may include yttrium oxide or barium titanate, for example.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Coupled with adapter <b>215</b> may be an isolator <b>225</b>, which may be coupled with second end <b>218</b> of adapter <b>215</b>. Isolator <b>225</b> may be or include a ceramic, and may operate to electrically isolate adapter <b>215</b> from mixing manifold <b>230</b>, which may operate at a different electrical potential than adapter <b>215</b> in some embodiments of the present technology. Isolator <b>225</b> may define a central aperture <b>227</b> through isolator <b>225</b>. Central aperture <b>227</b> may be characterized by a tapered shape through isolator <b>225</b> from a portion proximate second central channel <b>223</b> of adapter <b>215</b> to the opposite side of isolator <b>225</b>. A portion of central aperture <b>227</b> proximate second central channel <b>223</b> may be characterized by a diameter equal to or similar to a diameter of second central channel <b>223</b>. Central aperture <b>227</b> may be characterized by a percentage of taper of greater than or about 10% along a length of isolator <b>225</b>, and may be characterized by a percentage of taper greater than or about 20%, greater than or about 30%, greater than or about 40%, greater than or about 50%, greater than or about 60%, greater than or about 70%, greater than or about 80%, greater than or about 90%, greater than or about 100%, greater than or about 150%, greater than or about 200%, greater than or about 300%, or greater in embodiments.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Mixing manifold <b>230</b> may be coupled with isolator <b>225</b> at a first end <b>232</b> or first surface, and may be coupled with chamber <b>205</b> at a second end <b>234</b> opposite first end <b>232</b>. Mixing manifold <b>230</b> may define a central channel <b>236</b>, which may extend from first end <b>232</b> to second end <b>234</b> and may be configured to deliver precursors into processing chamber <b>205</b>. Mixing manifold <b>230</b> may also be configured to incorporate an additional precursor with the mixed precursors delivered from adapter <b>215</b>. Mixing manifold <b>230</b> may provide a second stage of mixing within the system. Mixing manifold <b>230</b> may define a port along an exterior of mixing manifold <b>230</b>, such as along a side or sidewall of mixing manifold <b>230</b>. Mixing manifold <b>230</b> may also define one or more trenches within first surface <b>232</b> of mixing manifold <b>230</b>, which may provide fluid access from a port to central channel <b>236</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Central channel <b>236</b> may be characterized by a first portion extending from first end <b>232</b> to a flared section. The first portion of central channel <b>236</b> may be characterized by a cylindrical profile, and may be characterized by a diameter similar to or greater than an outlet of central aperture <b>227</b> of isolator <b>225</b>. The flared section may be characterized by a percentage of flare of greater than or about 10%, greater than or about 20%, greater than or about 30%, greater than or about 40%, greater than or about 50%, greater than or about 60%, greater than or about 70%, greater than or about 80%, greater than or about 90%, greater than or about 100%, greater than or about 150%, greater than or about 200%, greater than or about 300%, or greater in embodiments. Mixing manifold <b>230</b> may be made of a similar or different material than adapter <b>215</b> in embodiments. For example, mixing manifold <b>230</b> may include nickel, which may provide adequate protection against the precursors that may all contact portions of the mixing manifold. Unlike conventional technology, because fluorine plasma effluents may already be mixed upstream of the mixing manifold, issues related to recombination may not occur. For example, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, nickel may catalyze the recombination of fluorine radicals into diatomic fluorine, which may contribute to material losses on the substrate in conventional technologies. When the fluorine effluents are mixed prior to delivery into a nickel, nickel plated, or coated component, this process may be limited as the concentration of fluorine effluents may be reduced, further protecting features at the substrate level.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Chamber <b>205</b> may include a number of components in a stacked arrangement. The chamber stack may include a gasbox <b>240</b>, a blocker plate <b>250</b>, a faceplate <b>260</b>, a spacer <b>265</b>, an optional ion suppression element <b>270</b>, a showerhead <b>280</b>, and a lid spacer <b>285</b>. The components may be utilized to distribute a precursor or set of precursors through the chamber to provide a uniform delivery of etchants or other precursors to a substrate <b>293</b> for processing. Substrate <b>293</b> may be seated on a pedestal <b>295</b>, which may be raised or lowered in different embodiments during operation or for particular operations. In embodiments, these distribution components may be stacked plates each at least partially defining an exterior of chamber <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Gasbox <b>240</b> may define a chamber inlet coupled with the mixing manifold <b>230</b>. A central channel <b>242</b> may be defined through gasbox <b>240</b> to deliver precursors into chamber <b>205</b>. The inlet of the gasbox may be sized to be aligned with the outlet of mixing manifold <b>230</b>. For example, the inlet and/or central channel <b>242</b> may be characterized by a similar or greater diameter than the outlet of the mixing manifold in embodiments. Central channel <b>242</b> may extend through gasbox <b>240</b> and be configured to deliver one or more precursors into an interior volume of the processing chamber. Gasbox <b>240</b> may include or be characterized by a first surface <b>243</b>, such as a top surface, and a second surface <b>245</b> opposite the first surface <b>243</b>, such as a bottom surface of gasbox <b>240</b>. Coupled with top surface <b>243</b> may be a heater or weldment defining a channel for receiving a cooled fluid for temperature control.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Second surface <b>245</b> of gasbox <b>240</b> may be coupled with blocker plate <b>250</b>, which may be attached or coupled with the gasbox, for example. Blocker plate <b>250</b> may be characterized by a diameter equal to or similar to a diameter of a protruding portion of gasbox <b>240</b>. Blocker plate <b>250</b> may define a plurality of apertures through blocker plate <b>250</b>, only a sample of which are illustrated, and which may allow distribution of precursors, such as etchants, from the central channel <b>242</b> of the gasbox, and may begin distributing precursors through chamber <b>205</b> for a uniform delivery to a substrate. Faceplate <b>260</b> may include a first surface <b>262</b> and a second surface <b>264</b> opposite the first surface <b>262</b>. Faceplate <b>260</b> may be coupled with gasbox <b>240</b> at first surface <b>262</b>, which may engage an outer annular section of the gasbox. Faceplate <b>260</b> may define a recess <b>263</b> at an interior of first surface <b>262</b>, which may define a volume in which blocker plate <b>250</b> may be disposed, and within which gasbox <b>240</b> and the central channel <b>242</b> may extend.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The blocker plate may remain a distance from the faceplate to allow further distribution subsequent to precursors being distributed through the blocker plate. In some embodiments, one or more of the gasbox, blocker plate, and faceplate components, along with the mixing manifold, may be in direct physical and electrical contact. The components may be coupled electrically with a power supply, such as RF power supply <b>255</b>, which may provide power to the components for generating a plasma within a region defined between the faceplate and other downstream components. To produce a capacitively-coupled plasma between the faceplate and one or more other components, a spacer <b>265</b> may be disposed between the faceplate and other components, which may electrically isolate the faceplate from the other components. Accordingly, spacer <b>265</b> may be a dielectric component, such as a ceramic or other insulating material in some embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Ion suppression element <b>270</b> may be positioned proximate the second surface <b>264</b> of faceplate <b>260</b>, and may be coupled on an opposite side of the spacer <b>265</b>. With faceplate <b>260</b>, and radially defined by spacer <b>265</b>, ion suppression element <b>270</b> may define a remote plasma region <b>267</b> within the processing chamber. The region may be termed remote from the perspective that the substrate to be processed may not be directly exposed to plasma effluents generated in plasma region <b>267</b>. In this way, plasma bombardment of the wafer may be limited or prevented. Additionally, ion suppression element <b>270</b> may be configured to reduce ionic migration into the processing region of chamber <b>205</b> housing a substrate. Ion suppression element <b>270</b> may define a plurality of apertures through the structure. Showerhead <b>280</b> may be disposed adjacent ion suppression element <b>270</b>, and the ion suppression element may be seated on the showerhead <b>280</b>. Although any perforated plate or manifold may be included in embodiments of the present technology, in some embodiments showerhead <b>280</b> may be a dual-channel showerhead as illustrated. The showerhead may include two plates coupled together to define a central volume in which a separate precursor may be flowed, such as from an external port or channel. The lower plate, such as facing the processing region, may define apertures providing fluid access from the volume, although the top plate may prevent access upstream from the upper plate. The upper plate and lower plate may also define axially aligned holes to produce channels extending through the showerhead. In this way, the showerhead may allow precursors to be delivered from upstream through the showerhead, and the precursors may not interact with precursors delivered through the internal volume defined by the showerhead until each of the precursors exit the lower plate of the showerhead into the processing region.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The showerhead <b>280</b> may be seated on a lid spacer <b>285</b>, which may at least partially define a processing region in which substrate <b>293</b> may be disposed for semiconductor processing. Lid spacer <b>286</b> may be an insulating or dielectric material in some embodiments, although in embodiments the component may also be conductive. In some embodiments, one or more of the ion suppression element <b>270</b>, the showerhead <b>280</b>, and the lid spacer <b>285</b> components may be in direct physical and electrical contact. The components may be coupled electrically to electrical ground, which may control the internal plasma formation, and which may limit the formation to remote plasma region <b>267</b> between faceplate <b>260</b>, which may be electrically powered, and ion suppression element <b>270</b>, which may be grounded. Accordingly, system <b>200</b> may include both an RPS unit for remote plasma generation, as well as a region internal to the chamber in which plasma generation may also be performed.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As noted above, mixing manifold <b>230</b> may be electrically coupled with the gasbox <b>240</b> and other components of the powered electrode. However, adapter <b>215</b> may be grounded. In some conventional setups, such a configuration may allow plasma to generate upstream of the gasbox during operation of the powered electrode. This may damage components, and may impact the plasma formation in the remote plasma region <b>267</b>, which may reduce etching and uniformity of processing on the substrate. Additionally, RPS units may often be operated at lower frequency than capacitively coupled plasma power supplies, which can cause back streaming plasma to enter and damage the RPS unit. For example, while power supply <b>255</b> may be operated at any number of higher frequencies, such as 13.56 MHz in one non-limiting example, the RPS unit may be operated at lower frequency, such as a few hundred kilohertz or less. In conventional setups that may not include additional grounding as discussed here, the RPS unit may effectively operate as an additional ground path for the powered electrode due to the discrepancy in frequency of operation. Plasma may then be generated upstream and into the RPS unit, which may damage components. However, the present technology may limit or prevent these effects by the configuration and coupling of the components upstream of the gasbox. By utilizing components according to configurations of embodiments of the present technology, the adapter may be grounded to prevent plasma intrusion to the RPS unit, and the components may be configured to limit or prevent plasma generation.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional view of a portion of exemplary processing system <b>200</b> according to some embodiments of the present technology. The figure may illustrate additional aspects of the components discussed previously, and may include any feature, aspect, or characteristic of any component described above. As discussed previously, RPS unit <b>210</b> may be seated on a first end of adapter <b>215</b>, and adapter <b>215</b> may be coupled with isolator <b>225</b> at a second end of the adapter. Adapter <b>215</b> may also define a ledge <b>305</b> between the first end of the adapter, which may include a mating flange for the RPS unit as illustrated, and the second end of the adapter, which may include a mating flange for the underlying components as will be discussed below. Ledge <b>305</b> may be a recessed ledge from an outer diameter of the adapter, and may be located a distance along a length of the adapter, which may be along a portion through which the first central channel <b>219</b> is defined.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">System housing <b>220</b> may be seated on ledge <b>305</b> as illustrated, and may be coupled with the adapter. As explained previously, the system housing may be grounded, which when coupled with the adapter <b>215</b> may electrically ground the adapter. This may limit or prevent plasma from generating in the RPS unit based on operation of a downstream electrode. The system housing may be directly coupled with adapter <b>215</b>, such as with a connector <b>307</b> as illustrated. This may ensure the components remain in contact. Connector <b>307</b> may be any type of coupling, including a bolt, which may be seated in a bushing as illustrated, although it is to be understood that any coupler or fastener may be used to maintain physical contact between the components. To maintain symmetry for the electrical coupling, in some embodiments, a channel <b>309</b> may be defined about the ledge <b>305</b>. An RF strap or other conductive material may be seated within the channel, and which may provide contact with the housing and along the adapter.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A flange <b>310</b> may be defined at the second end of the adapter <b>215</b>, and may define one or more apertures to allow coupling with additional components. As illustrated, adapter <b>215</b> may be coupled with gasbox <b>240</b>, along with isolator <b>225</b> and mixing manifold <b>230</b>. Elastomeric elements or o-rings may be disposed between the components to fluidly seal the components during operation. However, as explained previously, adapter <b>215</b> may be grounded, while mixing manifold <b>230</b> and gasbox <b>240</b> may be coupled with a power supply to operate as a powered electrode for plasma generation. To limit shorting, in some embodiments of the present technology, the connecting components used for coupling the system components may be electrically isolated from the adapter <b>215</b>. As illustrated, one or more apertures may be defined in each of the components to receive bolts, fasteners, or any other coupling component. However, a bushing <b>212</b> may be seated and recessed as illustrated in each aperture of the adapter <b>215</b>, which may limit or prevent contact or electrical coupling between the bolts and the grounded adapter. Additionally, the apertures defined through the adapter may be characterized by a diameter that may be at least double or more the diameter of the coupling component, which may limit electrical shorting between the materials. In some embodiments the bushing <b>212</b> may extend fully through the apertures in the adapter, and may seat at or within the isolator.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As noted above, because of the grounded adapter, plasma generation upstream of the powered mixing manifold may be a challenge for conventional technology. However, the present technology may include an adapter configured to limit production of plasma within the component. For example, as explained previously, the second central channel <b>223</b> may extend less than or about 50% of a length of adapter <b>215</b> in a direction of flow from the RPS unit, and may extend less than or about 20% of a length of the adapter, less than or about 10% of a length of the adapter, or less, which may control available space for plasma generation. For example, the length of the second section may be maintained at less than or about 5 cm, and may be maintained at less than or about 4 cm, less than or about 3 cm, less than or about 2 cm, less than or about 1 cm, less than or about 9 mm, less than or about 8 mm, less than or about 7 mm, less than or about 6 mm, less than or about 5 mm, less than or about 4 mm, less than or about 3 mm, less than or about 2 mm, or less, where the chamber may be operated at a few dozen Torr or less pressure.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">When conventional technologies utilize adapters with an increased distance for the component in this electrical configuration, the region may provide a hollow cathode effect, which may increase current density within the area. This can lead to increased ionization that can develop plasma generation within the component. The present technology may limit the distance to any of the ranges above, which may limit or prevent plasma generation during operation of the active capacitively-coupled electrode. By reducing the spacing, a mean-free path length may be controlled before collision with the transition section, and which may prevent ionization in the component. Similarly, the apertures <b>221</b> defined at the transition between the first central channel <b>219</b> and the second central channel <b>223</b> may be sized to prevent a hollow cathode effect, and may be sized at any of the ranges listed above, such as less than or about 10 mm, less than or about 9 mm, less than or about 8 mm, less than or about 7 mm, less than or about 6 mm, less than or about 5 mm, less than or about 4 mm, less than or about 3 mm, or less, in some embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Central aperture <b>227</b> of isolator <b>225</b> may also affect a likelihood of plasma generation within the space defined by the central aperture, which may produce a volume between the electrically powered mixing manifold and the grounded adapter. Accordingly, depending on the power being supplied and the pressure at which the chamber may be operated, in some embodiments the central aperture <b>227</b> may be modified to a plurality of apertures. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a cross-sectional view of a portion of exemplary processing system <b>200</b> according to some embodiments of the present technology. The figure may illustrate additional aspects of the components discussed previously, and may include any feature, aspect, or characteristic of any component described above. The figure may illustrate an additional isolator configuration according to some embodiments of the present technology.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Isolator <b>405</b> may include any feature, aspect, or characteristic of isolator <b>225</b> as discussed above, and may include a plurality of channels <b>410</b> instead of a central aperture as previously described. Because the insulative isolator defines space between capacitively-coupled electrodes, plasma generation may develop in a volume defined by the isolator. Although the diameter of a single, centrally defined aperture may be reduced in some embodiments, depending on the operational parameters of the chamber, such as the pressure and plasma electrode power, plasma generation may not be prevented while maintaining adequate flow through the component. By including a plurality of channels <b>410</b>, sufficient flow may be maintained through the isolator, while plasma generation may be prevented. For example, the apertures may be maintained at any of the diameters noted above for the aperture <b>221</b> defined at the transition in the adapter. Additionally, as illustrated, the channels <b>410</b> may be laterally offset from a central axis through any aperture <b>221</b> at the transition in the adapter. Accordingly, in some embodiments, no channel <b>410</b> may be axially aligned with any aperture <b>221</b> of the adapter. This again may limit a mean-free path length in any direction before collision, which may prevent plasma generation between the mixing manifold and the adapter. By utilizing components and configurations according to embodiments of the present technology, an RPS unit and a capacitively-coupled plasma may be utilized for more operational flexibility over conventional systems.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows operations of a method <b>500</b> of performing operations in systems according to some embodiments of the present technology. Method <b>500</b> may be performed in system <b>200</b>, and may allow improved processing flexibility, while protecting components from etchant damage, and limiting upstream plasma generation during capacitively-coupled plasma formation. Method <b>500</b> may include any number of operations for plasma processing, and may describe operations that may be performed in exemplary systems, although the operations may be performed in different orders, and for any number of processes. Although an etch process is being described, it is to be understood that the processing may similarly encompass cleaning or deposition operations as well.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Method <b>500</b> may include forming a plasma in an RPS unit at optional operation <b>505</b>.

The plasma effluents may be flowed through any of the components included between the RPS unit and the chamber, and in some embodiments, additional precursors may be flowed into one or more of the components, such as through a mixing manifold, for example, to be mixed with the plasma effluents. At optional operation <b>515</b>, the plasma effluents and materials may flow through the chamber to perform an operation within the chamber or to a substrate disposed within the processing region of the chamber.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Method <b>500</b> may also include forming a plasma within the processing chamber at operation <b>520</b>, such as between a faceplate and ion suppression element, for example, as previously explained.
