The wrench <b>10</b> is a two-way ratchet wrench whose force application direction can be switched by moving the engaging member <b>14</b> to different positions with a push lever <b>15</b>. The push lever <b>15</b> engages with the engaging member <b>14</b> elastically through a spring <b>151</b> and a steel ball <b>152</b>.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The bottom side of the head portion <b>11</b> is mounted with a cover plate <b>16</b> so that components such as the ratchet wheel <b>13</b> and the engaging member <b>14</b> will not fall out of the receiving chamber <b>12</b>.

The embodiment is applied to a wrench <b>20</b>, typically a ratchet wrench. The wrench <b>20</b> includes a head portion <b>30</b> and a rod <b>32</b>. The head portion <b>30</b> and the rod <b>32</b> of the wrench <b>20</b> may be integrally formed as a single structure or, as shown in the drawings, be pivotally connected together to allow the angle between the head portion <b>30</b> and the rod <b>32</b> to be adjusted. An end surface (e.g., the end surface at the bottom end) of the head portion <b>30</b> is concavely provided with a receiving chamber <b>34</b>. The receiving chamber <b>34</b> is mounted therein with a ratchet wheel <b>36</b>, an arresting member <b>38</b>, a push lever <b>39</b>, an elastic element, and a steel ball. The opening of the receiving chamber <b>34</b> is covered with a cover plate <b>50</b>. The ratchet wheel <b>36</b>, the arresting member <b>38</b>, the push lever <b>39</b>, the elastic element, and the steel ball are respectively identical to the ratchet wheel <b>13</b>, the engaging member <b>14</b>, the push lever <b>15</b>, the elastic element <b>151</b>, and the steel ball <b>152</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, do not constitute the subject matter of the invention, and therefore will not be described in more detail.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The aforesaid end surface (e.g., the end surface at the bottom end) of the head portion <b>30</b> is also concavely provided with a recess <b>40</b> at the opening of the receiving chamber <b>34</b> in order for the cover plate <b>50</b> to be placed in the recess <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the recess <b>40</b> has a diameter (or width) that is greater at the inner end of the recess <b>40</b> than at the outer end of the recess <b>40</b>; that is to say, the diameter/width of the recess <b>40</b> is smaller at the outer opening <b>41</b> of the recess <b>40</b> than inside the recess <b>40</b>. In this embodiment, the peripheral wall <b>42</b> of the recess <b>40</b> is conical and has a diameter/width that is gradually reduced outward. It should be pointed out that the peripheral wall <b>42</b> of the recess <b>40</b> may be a vertical wall and is not required to be inclined. The term &#x201c;diameter&#x201d; or &#x201c;width&#x201d; is used herein to refer to a dimension of the recess <b>40</b> or the cover plate <b>50</b> that extends in a transverse direction.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The diameter/width of the peripheral surface <b>52</b> of the cover plate <b>50</b> is slightly greater than the diameter/width of the recess <b>40</b>. One end of the cover plate <b>50</b> is defined as a guiding end <b>54</b> and has a relatively small diameter/width. The diameter/width of the guiding end <b>54</b> is less than the diameter/width of the recess <b>40</b>. The periphery of the guiding end <b>54</b> forms a guiding peripheral wall <b>56</b>. The guiding peripheral wall <b>56</b> may be an inclined conical surface or a circularly curved conical surface. A through hole <b>58</b> is provided in the cover plate <b>50</b> so that a columnar portion <b>361</b> of the ratchet wheel <b>36</b> can extend out through the through hole <b>58</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the cover plate <b>50</b> is mounted in the recess <b>40</b> of the head portion <b>30</b> to close the receiving chamber <b>34</b>. The mounting process is carried out with the guiding end <b>54</b> of the cover plate <b>50</b> facing the recess <b>40</b>. As the diameter of the guiding end <b>54</b> is less than the diameter of the recess <b>40</b>, the cover plate <b>50</b> can easily have one end (i.e., the guiding end <b>54</b>) extending into the recess <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a pressure or impact force is applied to the cover plate <b>50</b> in order to squeeze the cover plate <b>50</b> into the recess <b>40</b> and thereby couple the cover plate <b>50</b> and the recess <b>40</b> together. When the cover plate <b>50</b> is being squeezed into the recess <b>40</b>, at least one of the peripheral surface <b>52</b> of the cover plate <b>50</b> and the peripheral wall <b>42</b> of the recess <b>40</b> is deformed to form a tight interference fit between the peripheral surface <b>52</b> of the cover plate <b>50</b> and the peripheral wall <b>42</b> of the recess <b>40</b>, thereby fixing the cover plate <b>50</b> in the recess <b>40</b>. Consequently, the cover plate <b>50</b> is kept from separating from the head portion <b>30</b>, and the components in the receiving chamber <b>34</b> are thus prevented from falling out.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this embodiment, the diameter of the recess <b>40</b> is greater at the inner end of the recess <b>40</b> than at the outer end of the recess <b>40</b>, and this configuration is effective in preventing the cover plate <b>50</b> from separating from the recess <b>40</b>. According to the results of tests conducted by the applicant, the cover plate <b>50</b> will not separate from the recess <b>40</b> even after the wrench <b>20</b> is damaged from use.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The head portion <b>30</b> and the cover plate <b>50</b> may be respectively made of materials of different hardnesses. For example, one of the head portion <b>30</b> and the cover plate <b>50</b> is made of iron while the other is made of aluminum or copper (i.e., the metal of which the head portion <b>30</b> is made has a different hardness from that of the metal of which the cover plate <b>50</b> is made); thus, when the cover plate <b>50</b> is squeezed into the recess <b>40</b>, the softer one of the head portion <b>30</b> and the cover plate <b>50</b> will be more easily deformed, producing a tighter coupling effect than if the head portion <b>30</b> and the cover plate <b>50</b> are of the same hardness.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows the covering structure for a wrench head according to the second preferred embodiment of the present invention. The same components in the first and the second preferred embodiments are indicated by the same reference numeral, and the structures of such components in the second preferred embodiment can be known from the first preferred embodiment and therefore will not be described repeatedly.

The peripheral surface <b>52</b> of the cover plate <b>50</b>&#x2032; is adjacent to the peripheral wall <b>42</b> of the recess <b>40</b>&#x2032;. The peripheral wall <b>42</b> of the recess <b>40</b>&#x2032; and the peripheral surface <b>52</b> of the cover plate <b>50</b>&#x2032; may be vertical walls or inclined walls, and in the latter case, the diameter/width of the recess <b>40</b>&#x2032; is greater at the inner end of the recess <b>40</b>&#x2032; than at the outer end of the recess <b>40</b>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the thickness T of the cover plate <b>50</b>&#x2032; is preferably slightly less than the depth H of the recess <b>40</b>&#x2032; such that a gap G is formed between the outer end surface <b>59</b> of the cover plate <b>50</b>&#x2032; (i.e., the bottom surface of the cover plate <b>50</b>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) and the edge of the outer opening <b>41</b> of the recess <b>40</b>&#x2032; after the cover plate <b>50</b>&#x2032; is placed in the recess <b>40</b>&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Once the cover plate <b>50</b>&#x2032; is placed in the recess <b>40</b>&#x2032;, the portion of the peripheral wall <b>42</b> of the recess <b>40</b>&#x2032; that is at the outer opening <b>41</b> is pushed/squeezed with a proper machine or tool in order to reduce the diameter/width of the outer opening <b>41</b> by forming that portion of the peripheral wall <b>42</b> of the recess <b>40</b>&#x2032; into a shoulder rim <b>44</b> that extends inward and lies in the gap G, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.

In the first preferred embodiment, a tight interference fit is formed between the peripheral wall <b>42</b> of the recess <b>40</b> and the peripheral surface <b>52</b> of the cover plate <b>50</b>; in the second preferred embodiment, the shoulder rim <b>44</b> of the peripheral wall <b>42</b> of the recess <b>40</b>&#x2032; is pressed against the outer end surface <b>59</b> of the cover plate <b>50</b>&#x2032;. Thus, the cover plate <b>50</b>, <b>50</b>&#x2032; is mounted in the head portion <b>30</b> of the wrench without using any connecting element and is fixed by the recess <b>40</b>, <b>40</b>&#x2032; of the head portion <b>30</b> of the wrench itself to eliminate the prior art problem that a connecting element may get loose. Moreover, the invention can effectively prevent the cover plate from coming off so that the components mounted in the head portion will not fall out. This helps ensure the safety of the environment in which the wrench is used, lest any equipment that has high safety requirements (e.g., an airplane) be endangered by a detached component. The invention, therefore, has overcome the aforesaid drawbacks of the prior art.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The embodiments disclosed herein serve only to expound, but not to limit, the technical features of the present invention.
