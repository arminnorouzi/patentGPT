For this reason, research and development have been widely conducted to reduce size, weight, friction loss, and the like. For example, it is attempted to use an aluminum alloy with low specific gravity for a cylinder, and to apply a hard carbon coating with a low friction coefficient to an outer peripheral sliding surface of a piston ring.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The hard carbon coating is made of, for example, amorphous carbon called diamond-like carbon (DLC). The structural essential of DLC is a mixture of diamond bonds (sp<sup>3 </sup>bonds) and graphite bonds (sp<sup>2 </sup>bonds) as bonds of carbon. Therefore, DLC is suitable as a protective coating for the piston ring because DLC has hardness, wear resistance, thermal conductivity, and chemical stability similar to diamond, while having solid lubricity similar to graphite.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">On the other hand, some aluminum alloy cylinders have a cast iron liner that is cast into an inner peripheral surface sliding directly with the piston ring, or have an iron-based thermal spray coating formed by spraying iron-based alloy powder onto the inner peripheral surface. In particular, cylinder bore thermal spraying technology is attracting attention because the technology is expected to reduce overall bore temperature and improve uniformity of the bore temperature due to improved heat transfer performance, and to improve wear resistance and scuffing resistance to the piston ring.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent Literature (PTL) 1 describes, &#x201c;to provide a combination of a cylinder bore and a piston ring with high scuffing resistance, high wear resistance, and low friction loss, even under severe sliding conditions due to high loads on an engine, by using cylinder bore thermal spraying technology that enables the use of aluminum alloy casting by ordinary die casting&#x201d;, &#x201c;a combination of a cylinder and a piston ring, the combination comprising a cylinder of an internal combustion engine and a piston ring sliding on an inner peripheral surface of the cylinder, wherein at least a sliding surface side of the cylinder is composed of an aluminum alloy containing 8 mass % or more and 22 mass % or less of Si and one or more types of particles selected from groups of Si, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and SiO<sub>2 </sub>with a particle diameter of 3 &#x3bc;m or more, and at least an outer peripheral surface of the piston ring is coated with a hard carbon coating composed only of hydrogen and carbon&#x201d;.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">CITATION LIST</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Literature</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">PTL 1: WO 2013/137060 A1</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventionally, it is considered that the higher the hardness of a DLC coating formed on an outer peripheral surface of a piston ring, the higher the wear resistance, and the less the DLC coating wears due to sliding on a cylinder bore surface. Therefore, it is common to use a DLC coating with a high hardness of 3000 HV to 4000 HV in Vickers hardness. On the other hand, as a result of further research by the inventor, it is found that when a piston ring in which a DLC coating having elastic deformation capability and a predetermined hardness is formed on an outer peripheral sliding surface is slid on a cylinder made of a material other than aluminum alloys, such as a cylinder with an iron-based thermal spray coating on a bore surface, the amount of wear of the DLC coating increases.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It could be helpful to provide a combination of a cylinder and a piston ring with which the amount of wear of a hard carbon coating that forms an outer peripheral surface of the piston ring can be reduced according to the hardness of an inner peripheral surface of the cylinder, regardless of a material to be applied to the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to solve the above problem, the inventor has made a thorough investigation.

The piston ring <b>20</b> is externally fitted onto a known piston (not shown), and when the piston reciprocates within the cylinder <b>10</b>, an outer peripheral surface <b>22</b> of the piston ring <b>20</b> slides on the inner peripheral surface <b>12</b> of the cylinder <b>10</b>. The piston ring <b>20</b> is composed of a base member <b>20</b>A and a substantially hydrogen-free amorphous carbon coating (DLC coating) <b>28</b>. The piston ring <b>20</b> has the shape of a ring formed by four surfaces, i.e. the outer peripheral surface <b>22</b>, an inner peripheral surface <b>24</b>, and top and bottom surfaces <b>26</b>A and <b>26</b>B. The outer peripheral surface <b>22</b> is formed of the DLC coating <b>28</b>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0022">The base member <b>20</b>A of the piston ring <b>20</b> is not specifically limited, and, for example, silicon chrome steel (JIS SWOSC-V) for compression rings, martensitic stainless steel (JIS SUS440B), or other known or arbitrary materials can be used.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0023">In the present embodiment, the amorphous carbon coating <b>28</b> is assumed to be made only of DLC that is substantially free of hydrogen. In recent years, low-viscosity oil containing MoDTC is frequently used as oil for internal combustion engines. It is known that when this oil is used in a high-temperature and sliding environment, a tribo-coating composed mainly of molybdenum disulfide is formed. The formation of the tribo-coating causes reduction in frictional force between the piston ring <b>20</b> and the inner peripheral surface <b>12</b> of the cylinder. However, when a DLC coating containing hydrogen is used, a MoDTC component attacks the DLC coating containing hydrogen, resulting in increased wear. For this reason, in the present embodiment, a DLC coating that does not contain hydrogen is used. Amorphous carbon can be confirmed by Raman spectral measurement using a Raman spectrophotometer (Ar laser). Herein, &#x201c;substantially hydrogen-free&#x201d; means that a hydrogen content of the amorphous carbon coating is 2 atomic % or less, and the balance substantially consists only of carbon.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Method for Measuring Hydrogen Content of Amorphous Carbon Coating</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0024">The hydrogen content of the amorphous carbon coating is evaluated by Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS)/Hydrogen Forward Scattering Spectrometry (HFS) for the amorphous carbon coating formed on a flat sliding surface or a sliding surface with sufficiently large curvature. In contrast, the hydrogen content is evaluated by a combination of RBS/HFS and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) for the amorphous carbon coating formed on a non-flat sliding surface such as the outer peripheral surface of piston ring. Although RBS/HFS is a known method for analyzing coating composition, RBS/HFS is not applicable to analysis of non-flat surfaces, so RBS/HFS and SIMS are combined in the following way.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0025">First, as a reference specimen with a flat surface, a carbon coating to be a target of measurement of a reference value is formed on a flat mirror-polished specimen (quenched SKH51 disk, &#x3d5; 25&#xd7;thickness of 5 mm, hardness of HRC 60 to 63).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0026">The coating is deposited on the reference specimen by a reactive sputtering method, with a hydrocarbon gas such as methane, Ar, and H<sub>2 </sub>introduced as atmospheric gases. By changing an introduced H<sub>2 </sub>flow rate and/or a hydrocarbon gas flow rate, the amount of hydrogen contained in the carbon coating is adjusted. In this way, carbon coatings that are composed of hydrogen and carbon with different hydrogen contents are formed, and the hydrogen content and carbon content of the carbon coatings are evaluated by RBS/HFS.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0027">Next, the above specimen is analyzed by SIMS to measure the secondary ion intensity of hydrogen and carbon. Here, SIMS analysis can be applied even to a non-flat surface, for example, a coating formed on the outer peripheral surface of the piston ring. Therefore, for the same coating on the reference specimen with the carbon coating, an experimental equation (calibration curve) that indicates the relationship between the hydrogen content and the carbon content (unit: atomic %) obtained by RBS/HFS and the ratio in the secondary ion intensity between hydrogen and carbon obtained by SIMS is obtained. In this way, the hydrogen content and the carbon content can be calculated from the secondary ion intensity of hydrogen and carbon measured by SIMS on the outer peripheral surface of the actual piston ring. Note that, the value of the secondary ion intensity by SIMS is an average value of the secondary ion intensities of individual elements observed at a depth of at least 20 nm or more from a surface of the carbon coating and within a 50 nm square area.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">Cylinder and Piston Ring</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0028">In the present embodiment, it is fundamental that the Vickers hardness Hd of the DLC coating <b>28</b> and the Vickers hardness Hb of the inner peripheral surface <b>12</b> of the cylinder should satisfy Hd+Hb&#x2264;2500 HV, and the ratio ID/IG of the peak intensity of the D band to the peak intensity of the G band in a Raman spectrum obtained by measuring the DLC coating <b>28</b> by Raman spectroscopy should be 0.60 or more and 1.33 or less. This allows to reduce the amount of wear of the DLC coating <b>28</b>, regardless of a material of the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder. Specifically, ID/IG is calculated by separating the Raman spectrum into the D band with a peak near 1350 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>and the G band with a peak near 1550 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>by curve fitting of the Raman spectrum with a Gaussian function, and then obtaining the ratio of the peak intensity of the D band to the peak intensity of the G band. Note that, ID/IG on which we focus attention is the ratio of the peak intensities, and not the ratio of peak areas.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0029">The inventor believes that an action that produces this effect is as follows. That is, one of main causes of wear of the DLC coating and the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder is considered to be wear particles that are generated in no small amount when the piston ring and the cylinder slide. When the DLC coating and the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder slide in the presence of the wear particles, it is thought that the amount of wear increases due to intervening of the wear particles. Furthermore, in recent years, internal combustion engines, especially those for automobile engines, have been equipped with exhaust recirculation devices, turbochargers, or the like to improve thermal efficiency. Both types of the devices improve the thermal efficiency of the internal combustion engine, but on the other hand, introduce a lot of soot produced after combustion into a combustion chamber. Thus, there are a lot of wear particles and soot intervening between the piston ring and the cylinder. In such an environment, the DLC coating of the piston ring and the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder slide against each other, and the soot, the wear particles, and other foreign matter get trapped. This is thought to cause wear of the DLC coating and the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0030">Here, by setting Hd+Hb to 2500 HV or less, plastic deformation performance is considered to be improved between the piston ring and the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder, i.e. contact surfaces. Therefore, when foreign matter such as soot is bitten during sliding, the DLC coating and the cylinder deform appropriately on the contact surfaces to mitigate damage caused by the bitten foreign matter and reduce the wear of the DLC coating. However, even if the contact surfaces have sufficient deformation capability, the damage caused by the bitten foreign matter may cause carbon bonds to break in a part of the DLC coating, causing crystal grains to fall out and wear to progress.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0031">Here, by setting the ratio ID/IG of the peak intensities of the DLC coating to 0.60 or more, crystal grains of the DLC coating become finer, which reduces the volume of the crystal grains that fall out when foreign matter is bitten into the coating, thereby reducing wear.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0032">Therefore, it is important to set Hd+Hb to 2500 HV or less, and the ratio ID/IG of the peak intensities to 0.60 or more. Note that, we set the hardness of the DLC coating to a value that can easily release force of biting soot by plastic deformation, using a hardness index that quantifies the ability of plastic deformation, such as Vickers hardness. In this way, by controlling the ratio ID/IG of the peak intensities and the sum of the Vickers hardness of the DLC coating and the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder, damage caused by scratching by the foreign matter such as soot and wear of the DLC coating can be mitigated. In addition, concave portions are formed on the DLC coating and the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder in which plastic deformation has occurred, and it is thought that these concave portions allow oil to enter the contact surfaces and improve lubrication, and allow the bitten foreign matter such as soot to exit with ease. From the viewpoint of obtaining the aforementioned wear reduction effect more reliably, ID/IG is preferably 0.60 or more and 1.10 or less. ID/IG is more preferably 0.70 or higher, and even more preferably 0.80 or higher. However, when ID/IG exceeds 1.33, the size of the grains becomes excessively small and the strength of the DLC coating itself becomes insufficient, and the amount of wear increases.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0033">A material for the cylinder <b>10</b> is not specifically limited as long as the material for the cylinder <b>10</b> is set so that the Vickers hardness Hb of the inner peripheral surface <b>12</b> satisfies Hd+Hb&#x2264;2500 HV in relation to the Vickers hardness Hd of the DLC coating <b>28</b>. For example, iron-based materials, especially chromium-containing steel, are preferable as the material for the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder. Furthermore, the steel material may be tempered to match mechanical properties required for the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder, as various hardnesses can be obtained by quenching, annealing, tempering, and the like. According to the present embodiment, even if the hardness of the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder is changed in order to obtain mechanical properties other than hardness, wear resistance is less likely to deteriorate. The cylinder may also be made of another material such as a copper alloy, aluminum alloy, magnesium alloy, beryllium alloy, or the like. Furthermore, the structure of the cylinder itself may be made of cast iron or the like, and the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder may be coated with nickel, chrome, copper, or the like by plating. As a matter of course, the inner peripheral surface may also be coated with a thermal spray material. As the thermal spray material, an iron-based material, stainless steel, tungsten carbide, alumina, or the like can be assumed. As a thermal spraying method, wire arc spraying (LDS), which is low cost, wire plasma spraying (PTWA), which produces a dense coating, or the like may be used. The hardness of the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder can be adjusted according to the type of the material selected and its additive components. Taking the thermal spraying method as an example, if an iron-based raw material is used, the hardness can be changed by adjusting the amount of carbon added in the raw material. The hardness range of the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder may be 70 HV to 1000 HV.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0034">Among the above, it is preferable to use a cylinder whose inner peripheral surface has a Vickers hardness Hb of 150 HV or more and 800 HV or less. If Hb is less than 150 HV, scratches and wear are likely to occur on the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder when large foreign matter is bitten thereinto. On the other hand, if Hb exceeds 800 HV, the cylinder becomes excessively hard and tends to have cracking. It also increases aggressiveness to the piston ring.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0035">The Vickers hardness Hd of the DLC coating <b>28</b> is not specifically limited as long as the Vickers hardness Hd of the DLC coating <b>28</b> is set so as to satisfy Hd+Hb&#x2264;2500 HV in relation to the Vickers hardness Hb of the inner peripheral surface <b>12</b> of the cylinder. However, while the inner peripheral surface <b>12</b> of the cylinder is subjected to sliding on a two-dimensional surface, the DLC coating <b>28</b> is subjected to sliding in a one-dimensional line-shaped region and thus receives a large load due to the sliding. Therefore, the Vickers hardness Hd of the DLC coating <b>28</b> is preferably higher than the Vickers hardness Hb of the inner peripheral surface <b>12</b> of the cylinder. Specifically, the Vickers hardness Hd of the DLC coating <b>28</b> is preferably 1000 HV or higher, and more preferably 1500 HV or higher. In addition, the difference, that is, the subtraction of the Vickers hardness Hb of the inner peripheral surface <b>12</b> of the cylinder from the Vickers hardness Hd of the DLC coating <b>28</b> is preferably 1750 HV or less, so that the wear reduction can be demonstrated more stably. In particular, when the ratio ID/IG of the peak intensities of the DLC coating <b>28</b> is 0.70 or higher, it is more preferable that the difference in hardness is 1750 HV or less.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0036">The Vickers hardness Hd of the DLC coating can be measured with a Vickers hardness tester (for example, FLC-50VX produced by FUTURE-TECH CORP.). An indenter is pressed into a surface of the DLC coating and the size of an indentation formed is used to determine the hardness. An indentation load is set so that an indentation depth becomes &#x2155; or less of the thickness of the DLC coating in order to reduce the effect of the hardness of a substrate. In the case of a thin coating of several &#x3bc;m, it is difficult to measure the hardness with the above Vickers hardness tester without being affected by the substrate, so for example, indentation hardness (HIT) is measured with a nanoindentation hardness tester (for example, ENT-1100a produced by ELIONIX INC.) with a load of several mN to several tens of mN so that the indentation depth becomes &#x2155; or less of the coating thickness, and then is converted into the Vickers hardness using a conversion equation HV=HIT (N/mm<sup>2</sup>)&#xd7;0.0945. In a case in which a measurement surface is not smooth, accurate hardness cannot be obtained due to the influence of roughness. Therefore, the measurement surface should be polished with diamond film or the like before measurement.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0037">The Vickers hardness Hb of the inner peripheral surface of the cylinder is measured in accordance with the Vickers hardness test method of the JIS standard (JIS Z 2244) or the ISO standard (ISO 6507-4).</p><p id="p-0037" num="0038">The thickness of the DLC coating <b>28</b> is not specifically limited, but is preferably 1 &#x3bc;m or more and 30 &#x3bc;m or less. If the thickness is less than 1 &#x3bc;m, the coating is excessively thin and wears out. If the coating thickness exceeds 30 &#x3bc;m, the coating has increased internal stress and easily becomes chipped. Note that, the thickness of the DLC coating is measured by the following method. That is, the piston ring with the DLC coating is cut in a thickness direction of the DLC coating, and a cut cross section is smoothed by being polished with a diamond film. The polished surface is then observed under a microscope to measure the thickness of the DLC coating.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0039">In the present embodiment, the DLC coating <b>28</b> may be formed using a PVD method, such as ion plating by vacuum arc discharge using a carbon target, for example. The PVD method can form a DLC coating with excellent wear resistance that contains almost no hydrogen. Note that, it is preferable to use a filtered arc ion plating method in which arc discharge is used in a high vacuum or in an atmosphere with an inert gas such as Ar gas, without introducing a gas containing hydrogen as a constituent element, such as a hydrocarbon gas in a vacuum, and a filter to remove carbon micro-particles, such as a magnetic filter with bending magnetic force lines, is equipped.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0040">Here, the Vickers hardness Hd of the DLC coating <b>28</b> and the ratio ID/IG of the peak intensities in a Raman spectrum of the DLC coating <b>28</b> can be controlled by adjusting a bias voltage applied to the base member of the piston ring during coating deposition and the temperature of the base member during coating deposition.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0041">Specifically, when the bias voltage is increased, the kinetic energy of carbon ions impacting the base member of the piston ring is increased, so carbon is not deposited on a surface of the base member but is repelled from the surface of the base member by sputtering. As a result, a DLC coating formed has a coarse structure, and thus has reduced hardness. When the bias voltage is increased, the impact of ions destroys or disturbs the bonds of carbon in the coating, resulting in a smaller crystal size, which increases the value of ID and makes ID/IG larger.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0042">When the temperature of the base member during coating deposition is increased, three-dimensional carbon bonds decrease due to heat and become easier to take on a stable two-dimensional structure, which decreases connections in a bonding network and reduces hardness. In addition, as the temperature of the base member during coating deposition is increased, a graphite component of the carbon bonds increases. As a result, the value of ID increases and ID/IG becomes larger.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0043">As described above, setting a higher bias voltage and temperature makes it easier to form a DLC coating that satisfies the conditions of the disclosure. As bias application methods, direct current, pulsed, floating potential, and the like can be used, and multiple methods may be combined. In particular, pulse bias and floating potential are suitable bias application methods because these methods do not excessively increase the temperature of the member.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Intermediate Layer</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0044">Note that, the aforementioned embodiment exemplifies the piston ring in which the DLC coating is formed directly on the base member of the piston ring, but the disclosure is not limited to this. For example, a metallic intermediate layer with a thickness of 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 1.0 &#x3bc;m may be formed between the base member of the piston ring and the DLC coating to improve adhesion. A material of the metallic intermediate layer may be one or more elements selected from groups composed of chromium, titanium, and tungsten, or carbides of these elements. Furthermore, to prevent scuffing even in a case in which the DLC coating wears out due to operating environment, a hard metal nitride with high scuffing resistance may be formed with a thickness of 1 &#x3bc;m to 30 &#x3bc;m between the base member of the piston ring and the DLC coating, or between the base member and the metal intermediate layer. The hard metal nitride may be chromium nitride, titanium nitride, or carbides of these materials.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Experimental Example 1</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0045">To form specimens corresponding to the piston rings, columns made of SUJ2 with &#x3d5; 6 mm&#xd7;length of 12 mm were used as base members, and DLC coatings of various levels illustrated in Table 1 were formed on curved surfaces of the base members.
