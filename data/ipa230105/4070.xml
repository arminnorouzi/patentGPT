In general, for power supply and communication as described above, a mount portion called a mount of the image capturing apparatus and that of the accessory are each provided with a plurality of terminals, the plurality of terminals of one of the mounts being electrically connected to those of the other mount when coming into contact with those of the other mount. The plurality of terminals may perform communication independently of one another using different communication systems respectively.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2014-038300 discloses a technique for a terminal arrangement in which, in a case of mounting or dismounting an accessory on or from an image capturing apparatus with a bayonet coupling mechanism, a terminal provided in the image capturing apparatus for detecting mounting of the accessory does not slide on a power-supply-system terminal provided in the accessory.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the enhancement of functionality of image capturing apparatuses and accessories, the amount of data transmitted and received between an image capturing apparatus and an accessory increases. Accordingly, it is desirable to increase the number of terminals of the image capturing apparatus and that of the accessory.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in an image capturing apparatus and an accessory that employ, for example, a bayonet coupling mechanism as described in the technique disclosed by Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2014-038300 described above, the terminals increasingly wear out from mounting and dismounting of the accessory on and from the image capturing apparatus due to an increase in the number of terminals. In this case, wearing out leads to, for example, a decrease in the insulation resistance of the terminals, a short circuit between the terminals, or an increase in the contact resistance of the terminals, resulting in a decrease in reliability in terms of electrical connections between the terminals.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the case of employing, for example, a bayonet coupling mechanism and providing the terminal for detecting mounting as described in the technique disclosed by Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2014-038300 described above, it is desirable to prevent erroneous detection of mounting of an accessory in a state where an electrical connection between corresponding terminals is not established.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a technique for preventing erroneous detection of mounting of an accessory on an image capturing apparatus while suppressing a decrease in reliability in terms of electrical connection.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">An image capturing apparatus according to an aspect of the present invention is an image capturing apparatus on which an accessory including a first mount is mountable, the image capturing apparatus including a second mount configured to allow bayonet coupling to the first mount of the accessory. The second mount includes a plurality of terminals disposed in a circumferential direction of the second mount and configured to be used in electrical connection, and a terminal holder configured to hold the plurality of terminals. Each of the plurality of terminals is electrically connectable to a corresponding one of a plurality of terminals disposed in a circumferential direction of the first mount in the accessory. The terminal holder has a height level difference in a center-axis direction of the second mount. The plurality of terminals of the image capturing apparatus include a first terminal configured to be used to detect mounting of the accessory on the image capturing apparatus. The terminal holder has at least a first stage and a second stage different from the first stage. The first terminal is disposed on the first stage and disposed further in a mount direction of the accessory than the other terminals among the plurality of terminals of the image capturing apparatus that are on the first stage of the terminal holder.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments

The camera mount and the lens mount each include a lock mechanism, a mount holding mechanism, and a plurality of electrical terminals. The details of these mounts will be described below.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the mount portion 1 includes a plurality of terminals that enable electrical connection between the camera body <b>100</b> and the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b>.

The plurality of terminals are formed into a unit as a single component, and the terminals in each mount is connected to a flexible printed board as a single wiring unit.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating the internal structure of the camera mount A of the camera body <b>100</b>. For example, the terminals are electrically connected to one another via a single flexible printed board <b>106</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, and are connected to an internal board (not illustrated) provided within the camera body <b>100</b>. At positions, in the contact holding member <b>105</b>, where the terminals are held, a plurality of holes through which the terminals can be inserted are provided, and terminals <b>1001</b> to <b>1012</b>, which are the camera-side terminals, are inserted into the plurality of holes respectively. In this state, a retaining plate <b>107</b> retains the terminals on an object side in the optical-axis direction (on a mount contact surface side), and screws <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b</i>, and <b>108</b><i>c</i>, which pass through the through holes of the retaining plate <b>107</b>, are tightened into the contact holding member <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this embodiment, the single-unit structure of the camera mount A in the camera body <b>100</b> has been described. In the other mounts described below, at least the same structure in which a plurality of terminals are electrically connected to a single flexible printed board (wiring) is employed.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this structure, the terminals can be collectively disposed at positions away from an aperture provided in front of the image sensor <b>12</b> unlike a case where a group of terminals of each mount is divided into a plurality of units and interspersed in the circumferential direction of the mount. Therefore, for example, in a case where unwanted light is incident on the camera mount in a state where a camera accessory is mounted on the camera body <b>100</b>, an effect of the unwanted light reflected by the terminals formed of a metallic material on image capturing of an object can be reduced. Further, the terminals are formed into a single unit, and therefore, wiring within the image capturing apparatus and the camera accessories becomes less complicated, and the mounts can be easily assembled.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Now, the functions of terminals common to the camera mount A and the lens mount B are described. VDD terminals <b>1001</b> and <b>2001</b> are power supply terminals for supplying communication control power (VDD), which is communication power used mainly in communication control, from the camera body <b>100</b> to a camera accessory (for example, the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b>). The voltage of the power to be supplied to the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> is set to 5.0 V.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">VBAT terminals <b>1002</b> and <b>2002</b> are power supply terminals for supplying driving power (VBAT), which is driving power used in operations of a mechanical drive unit of the actuator used to drive the diaphragm and the focus lens, from the camera to the camera accessory. In other words, the VBAT terminals <b>1002</b> and <b>2002</b> are terminals used to supply power other than the communication power. The voltage of the power to be supplied to the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> is set to 4.5 V. The VDD terminals and the VBAT terminals described above are power-supply-system terminals for supplying power from the camera body <b>100</b> to a camera accessory. The voltage to be applied to the VBAT terminals may be changeable depending on the type of accessory mounted on the camera body <b>100</b>, by changing the output setting of a power supply circuit.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">DGND terminals <b>1012</b> and <b>2012</b> are ground terminals corresponding to the communication control power VDD. That is, the DGND terminals <b>1012</b> and <b>2012</b> are terminals that indicate (the voltage) of a ground level corresponding to the predetermined terminals. In this embodiment, grounding means to set the voltage level of a ground terminal to a level (ground level) substantially equal to the level of the negative pole of a power supply, such as a battery.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">PGND terminals <b>1004</b> and <b>2004</b> are terminals that indicate a ground level corresponding to a terminal of the camera body <b>100</b> and that of a mechanical drive system including a motor (actuator) provided in a camera accessory (for example, the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b>). That is, the PGND terminals are ground terminals corresponding to the driving power VBAT.

The camera controller <b>101</b> detects a voltage level indicated by the MIF terminals to detect mounting or removal of a camera accessory on or from the camera body <b>100</b>. After the camera controller <b>101</b> has detected, for example, mounting of a camera accessory as a result of the detection, the camera controller <b>101</b> performs control to start supplying power to the power-supply-system terminals and to start communication between the camera body <b>100</b> and the camera accessory.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">TYPE terminals <b>1003</b> and <b>2003</b> are terminals for determining the type of camera accessory (for example, the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b>) mounted on the camera body <b>100</b>. The camera controller <b>101</b> detects the voltage value of a signal indicated by the TYPE terminals and determines the type of camera accessory mounted on the camera body <b>100</b> on the basis of the value. In the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b>, the TYPE terminal is pull-down connected to the DGND terminal with a predetermined resistance described below. The resistance differs depending on the type of camera accessory.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Now, terminals for various types of communication between the camera body <b>100</b> and a camera accessory are described. A plurality of communication terminals provided in the mount portion 1 are divided into a plurality of communication systems (groups), and the communication systems can perform communication independently of each other. In this embodiment, LCLK terminals <b>1008</b> and <b>2008</b>, DCL terminals <b>1006</b> and <b>2006</b>, and DLC terminals <b>1007</b> and <b>2007</b> constitute a first communication unit performing first communication.

In this structure, the terminals on the camera mount upper stage can come into contact with only the terminals on the lens mount lower stage, and the terminals on the camera mount lower stage can come into contact with only the terminals on the lens mount upper stage. In the camera mount A, the camera mount lower stage is located on the near side in the direction of rotation relative to the lens mount B (the accessory mount direction), and the camera mount upper stage is located on the far side.

The far side in the lens mount direction is a side on which a terminal of the camera side that comes into contact with a terminal on the lens side last is located in a case of mounting the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> on the camera body <b>100</b>.

On the lens mount upper stage, the MIF terminal <b>2005</b>, the DCL terminal <b>2006</b>, the DLC terminal <b>2007</b>, the LCLK terminal <b>2008</b>, the DLC2 terminal <b>2009</b>, the DCA terminal <b>2010</b>, the CS terminal <b>2011</b>, and the DGND terminal <b>2012</b> are arranged sequentially from the far side in the lens mount direction.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">That is, four terminals are disposed on each of the camera mount upper stage and the lens mount lower stage, and eight terminals are disposed on each of the camera mount lower stage and the lens mount upper stage. The number of terminals (exposed contacts) on the camera mount upper stage and on the lens mount lower stage is smaller than the number of terminals on the camera mount lower stage and the lens mount upper stage.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In a case of rotating the camera mount and the lens mount relative to each other to mount or dismount the camera accessory on or from the image capturing apparatus, as in a bayonet coupling mechanism, terminals provided on one of the mounts slide on terminals provided on the other mount during mounting or dismounting. In general, on a single plane in the optical-axis direction, on the camera mount side, the contact pin present furthest in the lens mount direction does not slide on contact faces on the accessory side that do not correspond to the furthest contact pin when the camera accessory is mounted on or dismounted from the image capturing apparatus. On a single plane in the optical-axis direction, on the lens mount side, the contact face present nearest in the lens mount direction does not slide on contact pins on the camera side that do not correspond to the nearest contact face when the camera accessory is mounted on or dismounted from the image capturing apparatus. Therefore, a contact pin (first contact pin) of the camera mount which is positioned further in the lens mount direction than the other contact pins (e.g. a contact pin located in the furthest lens mount direction) does not contact other contact surfaces of the lens mount, except for a contact surface of the lens mount which contacts the first contact pin when the camera accessory is fully mounted to the image capturing apparatus. Similarly, a contact surface (first contact surface) of the camera mount which is positioned nearer in the lens mount direction than the other contact surfaces (e.g. a contact surface located in the nearest lens mount direction) does not contact other contact pins of the camera mount, except for a contact pin of the camera mount which contacts the first contact surface when the camera accessory is fully mounted to the image capturing apparatus.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">However, terminals other than the above-described terminals wear out as the number of times the lens mount is mounted on and dismounted from the camera mount increases. Specifically, the terminals (contact pins) of the camera mount are movable pins that can be advanced and retreated (projected and retracted) in a direction parallel to the optical-axis, and slide on the terminals (contact faces) of the lens mount at a tip point thereof. Therefore, the contact pins need to be made increasingly durable to sliding.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">The above-described issue becomes more noticeable as the number of terminals disposed in a line on a single plane orthogonal to the optical axis increases, and the number of times the contact pins slide on the contact faces increases. As the contact pins and the contact faces wear out, the contact impedance of the terminals increases, and the voltage significantly drops to a level lower than the allowable operating voltage range of an electric circuit. As a result, for example, a malfunction of the interchangeable lens may occur.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">Accordingly, in this embodiment, in order to decrease the number of times terminals slide on other terminals, the terminals are held at different positions in the optical-axis direction, namely, on the two stages including the upper stage and the lower stage, and the contact pins on the camera side come into contact with the contact faces on the interchangeable lens side at different heights depending on whether the stage is the upper stage or the lower stage. With this structure, for each stage that holds the terminals, wearing out of the terminals can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">Further, in this embodiment, for each mount, the number of terminals held on the upper stage is different from the number of terminals held on the lower stage. Therefore, for example, when terminals of high importance among the plurality of terminals are disposed on the stage having a smaller number of terminals, wearing out of the important terminals can be reduced. Specifically, on each of the camera mount upper stage and the lens mount lower stage having a smaller number of terminals, the power-supply-system terminals (the VDD terminal, the VBAT terminal, and the PGND terminal), which are signal terminals in which an increase in the contact impedance is to be suppressed to the largest extent possible, are arranged. On each of the camera mount lower stage and the lens mount upper stage, terminals that are used mainly in communication and are less likely to be affected by an increase in the impedance (than the power-supply-system terminals) are arranged. This structure enables stable power supply to the accessory and contributes to stable operations (for example, focus control) of the camera accessory.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The DGND terminal <b>1012</b> of the camera mount A is located on the camera mount lower stage and disposed nearest (leading end) in the lens mount direction, and therefore, is located at the most disadvantageous location in terms of durability to sliding of the contact pins on the camera side. However, in order to protect an electric circuit and an element provided in the camera accessory from, for example, static electricity, the DGND terminal needs to physically connect a metal portion formed in the camera mount to ground. In this embodiment, the DGND terminal is arranged nearest in the lens mount direction so as to facilitate processing performed for the above-described reason.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">This embodiment assumes a system in which the level of the value of a current provided to the DGND terminal is lower than that for the PGND terminal. Therefore, in this embodiment, the PGND terminal, for which the level of the value of a current provided to the terminal is higher, is disposed on the camera mount upper stage (and on the lens mount lower stage) on which a smaller number of terminals are disposed and which is advantageous in terms of reducing an increase in the contact impedance.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the camera mount A according to this embodiment, the two power-supply-system contact pins (the VDD terminal <b>1001</b> and the VBAT terminal <b>1002</b>) are disposed on the camera mount upper stage as the first and second terminals when viewed from the far side in the lens mount direction, and the TYPE terminal <b>1003</b> is disposed adjacent to the power-supply-system terminals. In the lens mount B according to this embodiment, the two power-supply-system contact faces (the VDD terminal <b>2001</b> and the VBAT terminal <b>2002</b>) are disposed on the lens mount lower stage as the first and second terminals when viewed from the far side in the lens mount direction, and the TYPE terminal <b>2003</b> is disposed adjacent to the power-supply-system terminals.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">With the above-described structure, in the mount portion 1 according to this embodiment, the two power-supply-system terminals (the VDD terminal and the VBAT terminal) are not adjacent to the PGND terminal. Therefore, the possibility of an inter-terminal short circuit between the PGND terminal and the two power-supply-system terminals can be reduced, and a malfunction or a failure in a power supply circuit provided on the camera side due to the short circuit can be prevented.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">When the TYPE terminal <b>1003</b> arranged between the VBAT terminal <b>1002</b> and the PGND terminal <b>1004</b> is provided with a protective element on the signal line of the TYPE terminal <b>1003</b>, an electric circuit of the camera body <b>100</b> can be protected.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">As in the TYPE terminal <b>1003</b>, when a protective element is added to the signal line of a terminal other than the TYPE terminal, the measure taken for the TYPE terminal can be similarly taken. However, the DCL terminal, the DLC terminal, the LCLK terminal, the DLC2 terminal, the DCA terminal, and the CS terminal are terminals for communication as described above, and addition of a protective element leads to an increase in the wiring capacitance. In this case, an increase in the wiring capacitance may affect communication and, for example, the responsiveness of a rise or a fall of the communication waveform may be compromised. Therefore, it is desirable to provide no protective element in the communication terminals to the extent possible.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the mount portion 1 according to this embodiment, the signal voltage of the TYPE terminal <b>1003</b> is constant, and the signal value does not change in a period during which, for example, the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> is mounted on the camera body <b>100</b>. Therefore, even if a protective element is added to the TYPE terminal <b>1003</b> as in the mount portion 1 according to this embodiment, operations performed by the camera body <b>100</b> and the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> are less affected.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The signal voltage of the MIF terminal <b>1005</b> is constant similarly to the TYPE terminal <b>1003</b>, and therefore, may include a protective element as in the TYPE terminal <b>1003</b>.

In this case, the pitch between the VDD terminal and the VBAT terminal needs to be set by taking into consideration the difference between the basic width and the width of the VDD terminal <b>2001</b> and the VBAT terminal <b>2002</b>. For example, in a case where the width of the VDD terminal <b>2001</b> and the VBAT terminal <b>2002</b> is wider than the basic width in the lens removal direction, the pitch between the VDD terminal and the VBAT terminal needs to be made wider by the difference from the basic width described above.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">The basic pitch described above is the distance between terminals that is set by taking into consideration looseness and a tolerance relating to manufacturing and assembling of the camera body <b>100</b>.

Therefore, a short circuit between adjacent terminals that occurs when a contact pin of the camera mount A comes into contact with a contact face of the lens mount B at two or more locations can be prevented.

As described above, a plurality of contact pins for which the basic pitch is set in the camera mount A do not simultaneously come into contact with one contact face for which the basic width is set. In a state where a camera accessory is mounted, a contact pin of the image capturing apparatus does not come off from a contact face of the camera accessory, namely, the lens mount B, for which the basic width is set as long as the contact pin on the camera side is deformed or, for example, a conductive foreign object is present between contact pins.

If the camera controller <b>101</b> determines in step S<b>616</b> that the MIF_IN terminal does not indicate High (that is, indicates Low), the camera controller <b>101</b> determines that the camera accessory remains mounted on the camera body <b>100</b>, and the flow returns to step S<b>614</b>.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0238">In step S<b>617</b>, the camera controller <b>101</b> stops communication with the camera accessory.

Thereafter, the camera controller <b>101</b> repeatedly performs the processes described above.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0239">Although not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, at a predetermined timing, the camera controller <b>101</b> determines whether driving power (VBAT) is supplied from the camera body <b>100</b> to the camera accessory using the VBAT terminal and supplies VBAT in accordance with the result of determination.</p><heading id="h-0024" level="2">Details of First, Second, and Third Communication</heading><p id="p-0243" num="0240">Now, various types of communication performed between the camera body <b>100</b> and a camera accessory mounted on the camera body <b>100</b> are described. First, a description of first communication is given. As described above, first communication is one type of communication performed between the camera body <b>100</b> and a camera accessory mounted on the camera body <b>100</b>. The first communication unit is a clock synchronous communication system or a start-stop synchronous communication system using the LCLK terminal, the DCL terminal, and the DLC terminal, which correspond to the first communication unit.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0241">In this embodiment, both the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> and the second interchangeable lens <b>300</b> support first communication. However, the communication voltage relating to first communication differs between the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> and the second interchangeable lens <b>300</b> as described above.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0242">First communication is used to transmit a drive instruction for, for example, driving a focus lens, driving a zoom lens, or driving a diaphragm to the camera accessory. In the camera accessory that receives such a drive instruction, an operation corresponding to the drive instruction is performed. First communication is also used to transmit information (state information) regarding the state of the camera accessory, such as the position of a focus lens, the focal length, and the aperture diameter (f-number) of the diaphragm, from the camera accessory to the camera body <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0243">Next, a description of second communication is given. As described above, second communication is one type of communication performed between the camera body <b>100</b> and the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> and is asynchronous communication using the DLC2 terminal, which corresponds to the second communication unit. The second interchangeable lens <b>300</b> does not include the terminal, such as the DLC2 terminal, corresponding to the second communication unit, and therefore, second communication is not performed between the camera body <b>100</b> and the second interchangeable lens <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0244">In second communication, the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> serves as a master unit (master) and transmits a predetermined amount of optical data including the position of a focus lens, the position of a zoom lens, an f-number, and the state of an image stabilizing lens in the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> to the camera body <b>100</b>. In second communication, the camera body <b>100</b> serves as a slave unit (slave). Regarding the types of pieces of data transmitted from the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> to the camera body <b>100</b> and the order in which the pieces of data are transmitted, the camera body <b>100</b> gives an instruction to the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> in first communication described above.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0245">Now, operations in the camera and in the camera accessory in a case of performing second communication are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating operations relating to second communication. In this embodiment, a program corresponding to the flowchart illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is stored in a memory (not illustrated), and the camera controller <b>101</b> and the first lens controller <b>201</b> read the program from the memory and execute the program. Therefore, it is assumed that an operation in each step described below is performed by the camera controller <b>101</b> or the first lens controller <b>201</b>. The operation need not be an operation following the predetermined program, and each unit of the camera body <b>100</b> and the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> may give an instruction to perform an operation in a corresponding step.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0246">Second communication illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> starts at the timing when control of image capturing of an object is started in the camera body <b>100</b>. First, in step S<b>1301</b>, in the camera body <b>100</b>, the camera controller <b>101</b> transmits a request for starting second communication to the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> via first communication. The start request transmitted in step S<b>1301</b> includes a register communication command in which the types of pieces of data intended to be obtained from the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> via second communication and the order in which these pieces of data are received are set in advance.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0247">Next, in step S<b>1311</b>, in the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b>, the first lens controller <b>201</b> receives the start request transmitted from the camera body <b>100</b>, and the flow proceeds to step S<b>1312</b>. In step S<b>1312</b>, in the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b>, the first lens controller <b>201</b> generates various pieces of data based on the register communication command included in the start request in the specified order.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0248">Next, in step S<b>1313</b>, the first lens controller <b>201</b> transmits the pieces of data generated in the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> to the camera body <b>100</b> via second communication. That is, in step S<b>1313</b>, the first lens controller <b>201</b> transmits the pieces of data generated in the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> to the camera body <b>100</b> using the DLC2 terminal <b>2009</b> of the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> and the DLC2 terminal <b>1009</b> of the camera body <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0249">Next, in the camera body <b>100</b>, in the process in step S<b>1302</b>, the camera controller <b>101</b> sequentially receives the pieces of data transmitted from the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> via second communication and ends second communication when reception of the specified pieces of data is completed. In this embodiment, each time control of image capturing of an object is started, the flow illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is performed.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0250">As described above, in a case of performing second communication, a start request is transmitted via first communication; however, communication using an independent communication system different from the communication system of first communication described above can be performed using the terminal corresponding to the second communication unit different from the terminals corresponding to the first communication unit. With this configuration, communication of various pieces of data (for example, optical data) can be performed between the camera body <b>100</b> and the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> as second communication without interfering with communication (for example, a control request to an actuator) performed in first communication. As described above, a request for starting second communication is transmitted from the camera body <b>100</b> to the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> via first communication, and therefore, first communication needs to be established before second communication is performed.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0251">Now, a description of third communication is given. As described above, third communication is one type of communication performed between the camera body <b>100</b> and the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b>, between the camera body <b>100</b> and the adaptor <b>400</b>, and between the camera body <b>100</b> and the intermediate accessory <b>500</b>. Third communication is asynchronous communication using the DCA terminal and the CS terminal, which correspond to the third communication unit. As described above, the second interchangeable lens <b>300</b> does not include the terminals that correspond to the third communication unit, and therefore, third communication is not performed between the camera body <b>100</b> and the second interchangeable lens <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0252">In third communication, the camera body <b>100</b> serves as a master unit (master) in communication, and the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b>, the adaptor <b>400</b>, or the intermediate accessory <b>500</b> that is directly or indirectly mounted on the camera body <b>100</b> serves as a slave unit (slave) in communication.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0253">In the examples described above, the case has been described where one adaptor <b>400</b> or one intermediate accessory <b>500</b> is interposed between the camera body <b>100</b> and a predetermined interchangeable lens, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>; however, the examples are not restrictive. For example, one or more adaptors <b>400</b> and/or one or more intermediate accessories <b>500</b>, namely, two or more camera accessories in total, may be interposed between the camera body <b>100</b> and a predetermined interchangeable lens. Therefore, in third communication, a plurality of slaves may be connected in series to one master involved in communication. Accordingly, third communication allows switching between a broadcast communication mode in which a signal is transmitted from the camera body <b>100</b> to a plurality of camera accessories (slaves) simultaneously and a P2P (peer-to-peer) mode in which a specific camera accessory is specified and communication is performed for the specified camera accessory.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0254">In the broadcast communication mode and in the P2P mode in third communication, the DCA terminal functions as a communication data terminal that allows two-way communication. The CS terminal functions differently in the broadcast communication mode and in the P2P mode. Regarding the details, broadcast communication is first described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a timing chart illustrating broadcast communication in third communication. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> illustrates a case where the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> is mounted on the camera body <b>100</b> with the intermediate accessory <b>500</b> therebetween.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0255">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, in broadcast communication in third communication, communication signals via the CS terminals are illustrated as &#x201c;CS (camera)&#x201d;, &#x201c;CS (lens)&#x201d;, and &#x201c;CS (accessory)&#x201d;.

Hereinafter, a case is described where, in response to broadcast communication from the camera controller <b>101</b> to the first lens controller <b>201</b> and to the accessory controller <b>501</b>, broadcast communication is performed from the accessory controller <b>501</b> to the camera controller <b>101</b> and to the first lens controller <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0256">In a description given below, a signal line connected to the CS terminal is referred to as a signal line CS, and a signal line connected to the DCA terminal is referred to as a signal line DCA. At the timing &#x3c;1&#x3e; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the camera controller <b>101</b> starts Low output to the signal line CS. This operation is an operation for sending a notification of the start of broadcast communication from the camera controller <b>101</b>, which is a communication master, to the first lens controller <b>201</b> and to the accessory controller <b>501</b>, which are communication slaves.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0257">Next, at the timing &#x3c;2&#x3e; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the camera controller <b>101</b> outputs transmission target data to the signal line DCA.

The camera controller <b>101</b> started Low output to the signal line CS at the timing &#x3c;1&#x3e;, and therefore, the signal level of the signal line CS in the camera does not change at the timing &#x3c;3&#x3e;.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0258">Next, when output up to the stop bit SP in the transmission data is completed at the timing &#x3c;4&#x3e; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the camera controller <b>101</b> stops Low output to the signal line CS at the timing &#x3c;5&#x3e;.

Therefore, the signal level of the signal line CS becomes High output when all of the camera controller <b>101</b>, the first lens controller <b>201</b>, and the accessory controller <b>501</b> stop Low output to the signal line CS. That is, each controller (CPU) involved in broadcast communication checks to see that the signal level of the signal line CS becomes High output and determines that the other controllers (CPUs) are ready to perform next communication.

Here, a case is assumed where the MIF terminal <b>1005</b> in the camera mount is disposed at a position so that the MIF terminal <b>1005</b> slides on terminals (contact faces) other than the MIF terminal <b>2005</b> disposed in the lens mount B, or connection of the MIF terminals is completed prior to connection of the DGND terminals and the PGND terminals. In this case, in a state where the lens mount B is not completely mounted on the camera mount A, power is not supplied from the camera body <b>100</b> to the camera accessory. Therefore, when the terminals provided in the lens mount B slide on the terminals in the camera mount A, and the MIF terminal <b>1005</b> comes into contact with a terminal other than the MIF terminal <b>2005</b>, a voltage level indicated by the MIF terminal <b>1005</b> may instantaneously become Low.</p><p id="p-0281" num="0277">In this case, although the terminals of one of the mounts and the corresponding terminals of the other mount are not completely connected to each other, the camera body <b>100</b> erroneously detects mounting of the camera accessory. Therefore, power supply may be started in a state where the camera accessory is not completely mounted on the camera body <b>100</b>, power supply and ground connection might not be electrically stable, and a malfunction or a failure may occur in the camera body <b>100</b> and in the camera accessory. This issue may similarly arise in a case where the MIF terminals are connected to each other prior to connection of the ground terminals.</p><p id="p-0282" num="0278">For the issues described above, in this embodiment, in the camera mount A and in the lens mount B, the MIF terminals <b>1005</b> and <b>2005</b> are disposed on the far side in the lens mount direction on the camera mount lower stage and on the lens mount upper stage respectively. That is, in this embodiment, the terminals are disposed at positions so that the MIF terminal <b>1005</b> of the camera mount A does not slide on any terminals other than the MIF terminal <b>2005</b> of the lens mount B when the lens mount is mounted on or dismounted from the camera mount. With this structure, erroneous detection of mounting of a camera accessory by the camera body <b>100</b> can be prevented. Further, with this structure, power is supplied from the camera body <b>100</b> to the camera accessory in a state where the corresponding power-supply-system terminals are connected to each other and the corresponding ground terminals are connected to each other with certainty. Therefore, in the camera body <b>100</b> and each camera accessory according to this embodiment, the possibility of a malfunction or a failure in the camera body <b>100</b> and in the camera accessory can be reduced.</p><p id="p-0283" num="0279">Next, the arrangement of the DLC terminal, the DCL terminal, and the LCLK terminal, which correspond to the first communication unit, is described. As described above, drive control information and state information are obtained using first communication between the camera body <b>100</b> and the first interchangeable lens <b>200</b> and between the camera body <b>100</b> and the second interchangeable lens <b>300</b>, for example. In other words, main data used in an operation of image capturing of an object using the camera body <b>100</b> is transmitted and received via first communication. Even if terminals slide on other terminals, and the terminals corresponding to the second and third communication units wear out, resulting in unstable electrical connections between the terminals corresponding to the second and third communication units, main drive control for the camera accessory involved in the image capturing operation can be performed as long as first communication is properly performed. Therefore, the terminals corresponding to the first communication unit are more important terminals for performing an image capturing operation than the terminals corresponding to the second and third communication units.</p><p id="p-0284" num="0280">Accordingly, in the camera mount A according to this embodiment, the terminals corresponding to the first communication unit are disposed at positions so that the number of times the terminals slide on other terminals (the number of times the terminals come into contact with other terminals) is smaller than the number of times the terminals corresponding to the second and third communication units slide on other terminals. Specifically, in the camera mount A according to this embodiment, the DLC terminal, the DCL terminal, and the LCLK terminal, which correspond to the first communication unit, are disposed further in the lens mount direction than the DLC2 terminal, the CS terminal, and the DCA terminal. The DLC terminal, the DCL terminal, and the LCLK terminal, in the camera mount A, which correspond to the first communication unit, are disposed at positions so that the number of times the terminals slide on other terminals (the number times the terminals come into contact with other terminals) is smallest next to the MIF terminal.
