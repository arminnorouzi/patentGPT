Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2012-244982 (JP 2012-244982 A) describes a carbon dioxide effective utilization system intended to effectively use carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide effective utilization system described in JP 2012-244982 A includes a fuel production unit that produces fuel from carbon dioxide in exhaust gas by using the photosynthesis of algae. In the fuel production unit, carbon dioxide is taken into algae out of exhaust gas supplied, and hydrocarbon compounds are synthesized in cells of algae by the photosynthesis of the algae. Therefore, fuel made up of hydrocarbon compounds is produced by squeezing out the oil content of the synthesized hydrocarbon compounds from algae in the fuel production unit. In other words, fuel made from carbon dioxide (carbon dioxide-origin fuel) is produced from carbon dioxide in exhaust gas. The carbon dioxide effective utilization system described in JP 2012-244982 A is configured to supply carbon dioxide-origin fuel extracted from algae in the fuel production unit to a fuel usage device, such as a thermal power plant and another power generation facility, and supply exhaust gas emitted from the fuel usage device as a result of burning of carbon dioxide-origin fuel to the fuel production unit again.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the carbon dioxide effective utilization system described in JP 2012-244982 A, carbon dioxide in exhaust gas is recycled in the fuel production unit and is supplied, as carbon dioxide-origin fuel, to the fuel usage device, such as a thermal power plant. At the same time, exhaust gas emitted from the fuel usage device is supplied to the fuel production unit. In other words, carbon dioxide in exhaust gas circulates between the fuel usage device and the fuel production unit. Therefore, with the carbon dioxide effective utilization system described in JP 2012-244982 A, the amount of emission of carbon dioxide is reduced, and emitted carbon dioxide is reused as fuel, so the cost of fuel is reduced.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, when carbon dioxide recovered from exhaust gas is reformed to carbon dioxide-origin fuel to be recycled as in the case of the carbon dioxide effective utilization system described in JP 2012-244982 A, the effect obtained by using carbon dioxide-origin fuel, that is, the fuel cost reduction effect (cost performance), varies depending on when the carbon dioxide-origin fuel is supplied and how much the carbon dioxide-origin fuel is supplied. The above-described carbon dioxide-origin fuel tends to be higher in cost than existing common fuels (for example, fossil fuels, such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas). Therefore, when (at a time or during a period when) the prices of the above-described common fuels are high, cost performance resulting from the usage of carbon dioxide-origin fuel increases. However, if carbon dioxide-origin fuel is used when (at a time or during a period when) the prices of common fuels are low, cost performance resulting from the usage of carbon dioxide-origin fuel decreases. If a storage tank or a storage facility that stores carbon dioxide-origin fuel produced is full, an opportunity to recycle carbon dioxide is missed. For these inconveniences, the carbon dioxide effective utilization system described in JP 2012-244982 A has not specifically taken into consideration to change or adjust a supply time and supply amount of carbon dioxide-origin fuel. Therefore, it may not be possible to supply carbon dioxide-origin fuel in appropriate amount at appropriate time to achieve high cost performance.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides a fuel supply control apparatus capable of supplying carbon dioxide-origin fuel recycled from carbon dioxide in exhaust gas or the atmosphere in appropriate amount at appropriate time.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An aspect of the present disclosure provides a fuel supply control apparatus configured to supply carbon dioxide-origin fuel to a power generation facility configured to generate electric power by at least using the carbon dioxide-origin fuel and a common fuel different from the carbon dioxide-origin fuel.

The fuel supply control apparatus includes an electronic control unit. The electronic control unit is configured to set a supply time and supply amount of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel to be supplied to the power generation facility. The electronic control unit is configured to acquire fuel information on a use fuel including the common fuel and the carbon dioxide-origin fuel to be used in the power generation facility.

The intended power generation facility in the aspect of the present disclosure generates electric power by using the carbon dioxide-origin fuel recycled as described above and a common fuel, such as petroleum, coal, and natural gas, different from the carbon dioxide-origin fuel. The carbon dioxide-origin fuel is produced by recycling and is then stored in a predetermined fuel storage facility. The fuel supply control apparatus according to the aspect of the present disclosure supplies the carbon dioxide-origin fuel stored in the fuel storage facility to the power generation facility in a predetermined supply amount at a predetermined supply time. At this time, the fuel supply control apparatus according to the aspect of the present disclosure variably adjusts and sets each of the supply time and supply amount of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel based on fuel information on a use fuel (the common fuel and the carbon dioxide-origin fuel) in the power generation facility.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">For example, data related to the current price of a common fuel, a crude oil price, or the like is acquired as the fuel information. Alternatively, data related to the stored amount of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel, the production time and production amount of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel, and the like is acquired as the fuel information. Therefore, with the fuel supply control apparatus according to the aspect of the present disclosure, the supply time and supply amount of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel are able to be variably and flexibly set in consideration of the price of the common fuel and the stored amount (remaining amount) of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel. Therefore, the carbon dioxide-origin fuel recycled from exhaust gas or the atmosphere is able to be supplied to the power generation facility in appropriate supply amount at appropriate supply time.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The fuel supply control apparatus according to the aspect of the present disclosure acquires the current price of the common fuel as the fuel information and, when the current price of the common fuel is higher than a predetermined price, increases the supply amount of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel as compared to when the current price of the common fuel is lower than or equal to the predetermined price. In other words, at a time when the current price of the common fuel is higher than a predetermined price, the supply amount of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel is increased as compared to when the current price of the common fuel is lower than or equal to the predetermined price. For example, as the current price of the common fuel increases, the supply amount of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel is increased. Therefore, with the fuel supply control apparatus according to the aspect of the present disclosure, at a time when the current price of the common fuel is high due to, for example, rising crude oil prices or the like, the ratio of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel used in the power generation facility is able to be increased by increasing the supply amount of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel. Therefore, it is possible to increase cost performance resulting from using the carbon dioxide-origin fuel in the power generation facility.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The fuel supply control apparatus according to the aspect of the present disclosure acquires the stored amount (remaining amount) of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel as the fuel information and, when the stored amount of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel is greater than a predetermined amount, increases the supply amount of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel as compared to when the stored amount of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel is less than or equal to the predetermined amount.

In other words, it is possible to provide room in the storable capacity of the fuel storage facility in anticipation that the fuel storage facility becomes full of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel. As a result, it is possible to avoid missing of an opportunity to produce the carbon dioxide-origin fuel due to the fact that the fuel storage facility becomes full of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel, so the carbon dioxide-origin fuel is able to be continuously produced by recycling carbon dioxide.

When the predicted stored amount of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel is greater than a predetermined amount, the supply amount of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel is increased as compared to when the predicted stored amount of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel is less than or equal to the predetermined amount.

In other words, it is possible to provide room in advance in the storable capacity of the fuel storage facility in anticipation that the fuel storage facility becomes full of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel. As a result, it is possible to further reliably avoid missing of an opportunity to produce the carbon dioxide-origin fuel due to the fact that the fuel storage facility becomes full of the carbon dioxide-origin fuel, so the carbon dioxide-origin fuel is able to be continuously produced by recycling carbon dioxide.

The fuel supply control apparatus <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> uses carbon dioxide recovered by a carbon dioxide recovery system <b>2</b>. Carbon dioxide recovered by the carbon dioxide recovery system <b>2</b> is recycled in a carbon dioxide recycling apparatus <b>3</b>, and carbon dioxide-origin fuel is produced. The carbon dioxide-origin fuel produced in the carbon dioxide recycling apparatus <b>3</b> is once stored in a fuel storage facility (fuel tank) <b>4</b>. The fuel supply control apparatus <b>1</b> supplies the carbon dioxide-origin fuel stored in the fuel storage facility <b>4</b> to a power generation facility (power generating plant) <b>5</b>. Specifically, a control unit <b>6</b> that is a component of the fuel supply control apparatus <b>1</b> controls the supply time and supply amount of carbon dioxide-origin fuel to be supplied from the fuel storage facility <b>4</b> to the power generation facility <b>5</b>. The control unit <b>6</b> is an example of an electronic control unit in the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The carbon dioxide recovery system <b>2</b> recovers carbon dioxide emitted when energy is consumed. The carbon dioxide recovery system <b>2</b> recovers or collects carbon dioxide that is emitted when fuel containing carbon is burned, such as carbon dioxide in exhaust gas from a vehicle equipped with an engine or carbon dioxide that is emitted from a space heater, a boiler, or the like. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an image in which the carbon dioxide recovery system <b>2</b> recovers carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) that is emitted in a so-called smart city <b>7</b> and stores the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in a predetermined storage facility (CO<sub>2 </sub>tank <b>8</b>).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The smart city <b>7</b> in this case is, for example, a city or a region defined as &#x201c;a sustainable city or a region operated through management (plan, facility, control, operation) by using a new technology, such as information communication technology (ICT), over issues in the city to achieve total optimization&#x201d; (the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (Japan)) and has been developed for a demonstration experiment and actual use in recent years. Carbon dioxide recovered in the smart city <b>7</b> is, for example, transported through a pipe line (not shown) laid between the smart city <b>7</b> and the CO<sub>2 </sub>tank <b>8</b>. Alternatively, carbon dioxide recovered in the smart city <b>7</b> is transported to the CO<sub>2 </sub>tank <b>8</b> by a transport vehicle or a transport device (not shown) autonomously driven between the smart city <b>7</b> and the CO<sub>2 </sub>tank <b>8</b>, a general transport vehicle (not shown), or the like.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Recovery of carbon dioxide in the carbon dioxide recovery system <b>2</b> is able to be performed by applying known various methods and techniques, for example, &#x201c;physical adsorption&#x201d;, &#x201c;physical absorption&#x201d;, &#x201c;chemical absorption&#x201d;, &#x201c;cryogenic separation&#x201d;, and the like, described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2021-008852 (JP 2021-008852 A). In &#x201c;physical adsorption&#x201d;, for example, carbon dioxide is adsorbed to a solid adsorbent, such as activated carbon and zeolite, by bringing exhaust gas into contact with the solid adsorbent, and the solid adsorbent to which carbon dioxide is adsorbed is heated or decompressed. Thus, carbon dioxide is desorbed from the solid adsorbent to be recovered. In &#x201c;physical absorption&#x201d;, for example, carbon dioxide is physically absorbed into an absorbing solution capable of dissolving carbon dioxide, such as methanol and ethanol, under high-pressure and low-temperature conditions by bringing exhaust gas into contact with the absorbing solution, and the absorbing solution in which carbon dioxide is absorbed is heated or decompressed. Thus, carbon dioxide is recovered from the absorbing solution. In &#x201c;chemical absorption&#x201d;, for example, exhaust gas is brought into contact with an absorbing solution capable of selectively dissolving carbon dioxide, such as amine, carbon dioxide is absorbed into the absorbing solution by chemical reaction that takes place at that time, and the absorbing solution in which carbon dioxide is absorbed is heated. Thus, carbon dioxide is dissociated from the absorbing solution to be recovered. In &#x201c;cryogenic separation&#x201d;, carbon dioxide is liquefied by compressing and cooling exhaust gas, and the liquefied CO<sub>2 </sub>is selectively distilled.
