Particularly, the present patent application relates to a method of treating neuropathic pain in a subject in need thereof by orally administering to the subject a thienopyrimidinedione compound as a TRPA1 antagonist. The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the TRPA1 antagonist, and a process for preparing such a pharmaceutical composition.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Pain is described as a complex constellation of unpleasant sensory, emotional and cognitive experiences provoked by real or perceived tissue damage and is manifested by certain autonomic, psychological and behavioral reactions and is a disease of epidemic proportions. From a neurobiological perspective, pain is believed to be of three different aspects: first, pain that is an early warning physiological protective system, essential to detect and minimize contact with damaging or noxious stimuli and is called &#x2018;nociceptive pain&#x2019;; second, pain that is adaptive and protective, by heightening sensory sensitivity after unavoidable tissue damage, which is mainly caused by activation of the immune system by tissue injury or infection and is normally called &#x2018;inflammatory pain&#x2019;; and the third type is pain which is not protective, but maladaptive resulting from abnormal functioning of the nervous system and generally called as &#x2018;pathological pain&#x2019;. This pathological pain is believed to be not a symptom of some disorder but rather a disease state of the nervous system, can occur after damage to the nervous system (neuropathic pain) or a situation where there is no such damage or inflammation (dysfunctional pain&#x2014;like fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, temporomandibular joint disease, interstitial cystitis and other syndromes where there is substantial pain but no noxious stimulants and minimal/no peripheral inflammatory pathology).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Neuropathic pain is a pain caused by damage or disease that affects the somatosensory system. It may be associated with abnormal sensations called dysesthesia, and pain produced by normally non-painful stimuli (allodynia). Neuropathic pain may result from disorders of the peripheral nervous system or the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). Thus, neuropathic pain may be divided into peripheral neuropathic pain, central neuropathic pain, or mixed (peripheral and central) neuropathic pain. Some treatment options for neuropathic pain include antidepressants (e.g. tricyclics and selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI's)), anticonvulsants (such as pregabalin, gabapentin, carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine and topical lidocaine. Opioid analgesics and tramadol are recognized as useful agents but are generally not recommended as first line treatments.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is believed that TRPA1 is expressed in nociceptive neurons. Nociceptive neurons of the nervous system sense the peripheral damage and transmit pain signals. TRPA1 receptor is activated by a number of irritants that cause pain, including allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) and allicin, the pungent ingredients in mustard and garlic extracts, respectively; as well as &#x3b1;,&#x3b2;-unsaturated aldehydes, such as acrolein. The TRPA1 channel is the primary molecular site through which the pain pathway gets activated through an unusual mechanism involving covalent modification of cysteine and lysine residues within the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the channel protein. Thus, TRPA1 modulators are highly implicated in the alleviation of pain.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">PCT Application Publication Nos. viz., WO 2004/055054, WO 2005/089206, WO 2007/073505, WO 2008/0949099, WO 2009/089082, WO2009/002933 WO 2009/158719, WO 2009/144548, WO 2010/004390, W02010/109287, WO 2010/109334, WO 2010/109329, WO 2010/109328, W02010/125469, WO 2010/004390, WO 2011/043954 and WO 2010/141805 describe various transient receptor potential (&#x201c;TRP&#x201d;) receptor modulators.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Many of the currently available pain therapies are either inadequate or cause uncomfortable to deleterious side effects and limitations. There are only three oral drugs (duloxetine, pregabalin and gabapentin) that have been formally approved in the Europe and the United States for treatment of painful DPN.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Adverse effects of currently available centrally acting DPN therapies and a low responder rate contribute to suboptimal clinical outcomes in a large proportion of subjects resulting in a high unmet need for specific treatments with better safety profile and novel approaches to identify subjects likely to respond to treatment. A need still exists for an effective treatment of neuropathic pain.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention relates to a method of treating neuropathic pain in a subject in need thereof by administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a TRPA1 antagonist.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment the present invention relates to a method of treating neuropathic pain in a subject in need thereof by orally administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a TRPA1 antagonist of formula (A)</p><p id="p-0012" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-C00001" he="44.11mm" wi="72.73mm" file="US20230000872A1-20230105-C00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0013" num="0000">or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof,<br/>wherein</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">R<sup>1 </sup>and R<sup>2 </sup>are methyl;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0012">R<sup>a </sup>is hydrogen;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0013">R<sup>4</sup>, R<sup>5</sup>, R<sup>6 </sup>and R<sup>7 </sup>are independently selected from hydrogen, fluoro, trifluoromethyl or trifluoromethoxy and</p><p id="p-0017" num="0014">R<sup>8 </sup>and R<sup>9 </sup>is hydrogen.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0015">Inter alia, the '930 application discloses a compound N-{4-[2,4-difluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,3-thiazol-2-yl}-2-(1,3-dimethyl-2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno [2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)acetamide (hereinafter designated as &#x201c;Compound I&#x201d;) or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0016">In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of treating neuropathic pain in a subject in need thereof by orally administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of N-{4-[2,4-difluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,3-thiazol-2-yl}-2-(1,3-dimethyl-2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)acetamide or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0017">In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of treating neuropathic pain in a subject in need thereof by orally administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of potassium salt of N-{4-[2,4-difluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,3-thiazol-2-yl}-2-(1,3-dimethyl-2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)acetamide.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0018">The therapeutically effective amount of Compound I or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt to be orally administered per day in context of the present invention is in the range from about 1 mg to about 1000 mg, or preferably from about 30 mg to about 800 mg, or more preferably from about 60 mg to about 600 mg.

With neuropathic pain, the nerve fibers themselves may be damaged, dysfunctional, or injured. These damaged nerve fibers send incorrect signals to other pain centers. The impact of nerve fiber injury includes a change in nerve function both at the site of injury and areas around the injury. This type of pain is caused by a problem with one or more nerves themselves. The function of the nerve is affected in a way that it sends pain messages to the brain. Neuropathic pain is often described as burning, stabbing, shooting, aching, or like an electric shock. Based on its origin neuropathic pain may be divided into peripheral neuropathic pain, central neuropathic pain, or mixed (peripheral and central) neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain includes but is not limited to polyneuropathy pain states (such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy &#x26; chemotherapy induced neuropathy), autonomic neuropathy pain states, peripheral nervous system (PNS) lesion or central nervous system (CNS) lesion or disease related pain states, polyradiculopathies of cervical, lumbar or sciatica type, cauda equina syndrome, piriformis syndrome, paraplegia, quadriplegia, pain states related to various Polyneuritis conditions underlying various infections, chemical injuries, radiation exposure, underlying disease or deficiency conditions (such as beriberi, vitamin deficiencies, hypothyroidism, porphyria, cancer, HIV, autoimmune disease like multiple sclerosis and spinal-cord injury, fibromyalgia, nerve injury, ischemia, neurodegeneration, stroke, post stroke pain, inflammatory disorders, oesophagitis, gastroeosophagal reflux disorder (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, pelvic hypersensitivity, urinary incontinence, cystitis, stomach duodenal ulcer, muscle pain, pain due to colicky, hyperalgesia (such as mechanical hyperalgesia), allodynia (such as cold allodynia).</p><p id="p-0140" num="0166">The term &#x201c;diabetic peripheral neuropathy&#x201d; is synonymous to &#x201c;painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy&#x201d; or &#x201c;painful diabetic neuropathy&#x201d; or &#x201c;DPN&#x201d; or &#x201c;diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0167">The term &#x201c;subject&#x201d; includes mammals like humans and other animals, such as domestic animals (e.g., household pets including cats and dogs) and non- domestic animals (such as wildlife).
