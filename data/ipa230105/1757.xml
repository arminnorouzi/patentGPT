More particularly, the invention relates to a new configuration of a coil spring for use in a MacPherson strut type of vehicle suspension system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A basic vehicle suspension system usually consists of coil springs, axles, shock absorbers, arms rods and ball joints. The main function of the coil springs are to absorb shocks from road and store the shocks in the form of compressed energy which is later dissipated by the shock absorbers. Therefore, the coil springs is one of the important elements in the vehicle suspension system to provide a smooth and comfortable driving experience. A coil spring is made from a single length of metal wire which is heated and wound on a former to product a generally cylindrical body. Such body can be twisted, compressed, or stretched by a load and still return to its original shape when the load is released. The capability of a coil spring in handling different load sizes from different angles or directions are determined by diameter of the wire, overall body diameter of the coil spring, its shape, pitches and coil angles of the coils.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a few existing shapes of coil springs which are known to control and absorb lateral forces caused by the geometric shape of the vehicle suspension system. Nevertheless, these existing shapes has their respective drawbacks as follows: the coil spring in a straight configuration has less capability in handling lateral forces, and it may not meet the requirements of certain vehicles; the C-shape, S shape and L-shape coil springs may enough capability in handling lateral forces but these kinds of complex spring profiles need to be controlled properly along the coil in order to avoid interference between coils and thereby limits the freedom of design of the vehicle suspension system as such coil spring's design occupies more enveloping space.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Patent document U.S. Pat. No. 9,770,957 discloses a suspension coil spring that is to be installed between an upper side pedestal and a lower side pedestal of a strut type suspension for a vehicle includes a coil spring main body such that, in an installation state, an upper coil end is disposed on the upper side pedestal and a lower coil end is disposed on the lower side pedestal, the upper side pedestal and the upper coil end contact at two upper contact points, and the lower side pedestal and the lower coil end contact at one lower contact point. The two upper contact points are separated in a front-to-rear direction of the vehicle. The one lower contact point is disposed at a position that is in a direction toward outside the vehicle from a plane that passes through the two upper contact points and that is parallel to a coil central axis.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another patent document U.S. Ser. No. 10/144,261 discloses a coil spring includes a lower end turn portion which is in contact with a lower spring seat, an upper end turn portion which is in contact with an upper spring seat, and an effective portion between the lower end turn portion and the upper end turn portion. The coil spring is cylindrical about an axis of the effective portion in its free shape which is not compressed. Further, with respect to a coordinate system in which a force line is assumed as a Z-axis, the coil spring is cylindrical with a constant pitch in a direction along the Z-axis in its compressed shape which is compressed to a specified height.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Therefore, it would be desirable to provide an alternative configuration for the coil spring to solve the above mentioned problem. This invention provides such a coil spring.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect of the invention, there is provided a coil spring comprises an elongated body formed by a plurality of continuous coils, and the body includes an upper section and a lower section; wherein pitches and coil angles of the coils in the upper section are generally consistent to form an upright profile for the upper section; and wherein coil angles and pitches of two or more coils at a free end of the lower section is differed from the pitches and the coil angles of the coils in the upper section to form a gradually curved profile for the lower section.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the upper section and lower section can form a generally J-shape body.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the coil angles of the two or more coils at the free end of the lower section can be greater than the coil angles of the coils in the upper section.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, each coil angles of the two or more coils at the free end of the lower section can be differed from each other.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the pitches of the two or more coils at the free end of the lower section can be greater than the pitches of the coils in the upper section.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, each pitch of the two or more coils at the free end of the lower section can be differed from each other.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a front vehicle suspension system comprises a coil spring having an elongated body formed by a plurality of continuous coils, and the body includes an upper section and a lower section; wherein pitches and coil angles of the coils in the upper section are generally consistent to form an upright profile for the upper section; and wherein coil angles and pitches of two or more coils at a free end of the lower section is differed from the pitches and the coil angles of the coils in the upper section to form a gradually curved profile for the lower section.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">One skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the invention is well adapted to carry out the objects and obtain the ends and advantages mentioned, as well as those inherent therein.

The body (<b>10</b>) can be categorized into an upper section (<b>20</b>) having a plurality of helical coils (<b>21</b>) and a lower section (<b>30</b>) having a plurality of helical coils (<b>31</b>). The coil spring can be characterised by the following: (i) pitches (<b>22</b>) and coil angles (<b>23</b>) of the helical coils (<b>21</b>) in the upper section (<b>20</b>) are generally consistent with each other to form an upright profile (<b>24</b>) for the upper section (<b>20</b>); (ii) pitches (<b>32</b>) and coil angles (<b>33</b>) of two or more helical coils (<b>31</b>) at a free end of the lower section (<b>30</b>) is differed from the pitches (<b>22</b>) and the coil angles (<b>23</b>) of the helical coils (<b>21</b>) in the upper section (<b>20</b>) to form a gradually curved profile (<b>34</b>) for the lower section (<b>30</b>). When the upper section and lower section is combined, the body (<b>10</b>) forms a generally J-shape profile.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">By way of example, the pitches (<b>32</b>) and coil angles (<b>33</b>) of the two or more helical coils (<b>31</b>) at the free end of the lower section is respectively greater than the pitches (<b>22</b>) and the coil angles (<b>23</b>) of the helical coils (<b>21</b>) in the upper section (<b>20</b>). In addition to that, the pitches (<b>32</b>) and coil angles (<b>33</b>) of the two or more helical coils in the lower section (<b>20</b>) may gradually increase in a direction towards the free end of the lower section (<b>30</b>) to form the curve profile (<b>34</b>) which gradually moves further away from an axial of the coil spring.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In operation, the coil spring is used in a vehicle suspension system. Preferably, the vehicle suspension system is a MacPherson strut type suspension system for front wheels of a vehicle. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the coil spring can also be applied in any other vehicle suspension systems which absorption of lateral force is required. In the example of the MacPherson strut type suspension system, the coil spring is disposed at a position of a shock absorber that surrounds the shock absorber, and the coil spring is being held in place by a pair of collars on a strut. The strut is angled and thereby giving rise to lateral forces which required to be damped by the shock absorber. The coil spring absorbs the lateral force in the form of compressed energy which is later dissipated by the shock absorber.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Characteristics of the J-shape coil spring in terms of load axis formed by the lateral force generated is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. It produces higher lateral force significantly compare to a conventional spring. The lateral force generated at the lower section (<b>30</b>) is much higher than upper section (<b>20</b>) of the coil spring. Most of the passenger vehicles nowadays require higher lateral force at the lower section due to improvement made on the positioning of the suspension system to fit with the limited enveloping space.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the J-shape coil spring in both compressed state and uncompressed state has an overall width which is almost identical to a coil spring in a straight configuration. As a result, the J-shape coil spring is capable of generating greater lateral force and maintaining even gap between coils especially at the lower section (<b>20</b>). Thus, it does not occupy more space than the conventional coil spring. The helical coils (<b>21</b>, <b>31</b>) in the compressed state are also in even gap and no interference between coils. It is a design rule to avoid such interference during stroke to avoid continuous knocking between coils which will affect the coil spring life.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present disclosure includes as contained in the appended claims, as well as that of the foregoing description.
