which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to an electronic device including a flexible printed circuit board (FPCB).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electronic device may mean a device performing a particular function according to its equipped program, such as a home appliance, an electronic scheduler, a portable multimedia player, a mobile communication terminal, a tablet personal computer (PC), a video/sound device, a desktop PC or laptop computer, a navigation for automobile, etc. For example, electronic devices may output stored information as voices or images. As electronic devices are highly integrated, and high-speed, high-volume wireless communication becomes commonplace, an electronic device, such as a mobile communication terminal, is recently being equipped with various functions. For example, an electronic device comes with the integrated functionality, including an entertainment function, such as playing video games, a multimedia function, such as replaying music/videos, a communication and security function for mobile banking, and a scheduling or e-wallet function. Such electronic devices become compact enough for users to carry in a convenient way.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">As mobile communication services spread up to multimedia services, users may use multimedia services as well as voice calls or text messaging, on their electronic device. To rid the user of any inconvenience in using multimedia services, a trend is to pack an electronic device with a larger display panel. Recently, flexible display panel-equipped foldable electronic devices come along.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above information is presented as background information only to assist with an understanding of the disclosure. No determination has been made, and no assertion is made, as to whether any of the above might be applicable as prior art with regard to the disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An electronic device may include a housing and may include a plurality of inner spaces (e.g., a waterproof area and a non-waterproof area) defined by structures disposed inside the housing. The electronic device may include various electronic components for performing various functions and operations, such as communication, entertainment, multimedia, security, etc., and among these electronic components, important electrical components may be disposed in the waterproof area considering the interface for user convenience, product regulations, and spatial arrangement in electronic devices. Electronic components, such as a printed circuit board (PCB), disposed in the waterproof area may be electrically coupled through at least one flexible printed circuit board (FPCB). A through hole or an opening through which the flexible printed circuit board passes may be formed in at least partial area of the inner walls (e.g., the wall of the housing) surrounding the waterproof area, and a waterproofing member implemented with an elastic material is provided in the insertion portion of the flexible printed circuit board passing through the through hole so that the space between the through hole and the insertion portion of the flexible printed circuit board may be closed and waterproofed by the waterproofing member. However, since the rigidity of the flexible printed circuit board is significant, if external force is applied to the waterproofing member coupled in the through hole, the waterproofing member may be deformed, forming a gap between the through hole and the insertion portion of the flexible printed circuit board and thus causing a fluid (e.g., water) to enter the waterproof area. Further, if the flexible printed circuit board is implemented with several overlapping sheets of flexible printed circuit boards or to include a plurality of conductive layers, the insertion portion of the flexible printed circuit board into the through hole may be bent, causing inter-layer peel-off and resultantly a gap through which a fluid (e.g., water) may be introduced into the waterproof area.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Aspects of the disclosure are to address at least the above-mentioned problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described below. Accordingly, an aspect of the disclosure is to provide an electronic device for providing a flexible printed circuit board including a reinforced portion which is inserted into a through hole with a relatively larger width than other portions of the flexible printed circuit board, thereby providing rigidity to the waterproofing member, which hangs down in the shape of a cantilever, and reducing deformation due to external force to thereby enhance the waterproofness of the waterproof area.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another aspect of the disclosure is to provide an electronic device for providing a reinforced portion of a flexible printed circuit board including a predetermined bonding member between a plurality of layers, reducing inter-layer peel-off and enhancing the rigidity of the reinforced portion by the bonding member, and thus enhancing the waterproofness of the waterproof area.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additional aspects will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the presented embodiments.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with an aspect of the disclosure, an electronic device is provided.

The wiring portion <b>320</b> may be bent with a predetermined curvature and, given the spatial arrangement, the wiring portion <b>320</b> may be disposed, in the bent state, in the electronic device (e.g., the electronic device <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) (e.g., between the hinge structure and flexible display described below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">According to various embodiments, the reinforcement portion <b>330</b> may be formed at a portion of the flexible printed circuit board <b>300</b> which passes through the through hole (e.g., the through hole <b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) (or opening). For example, as described above, in a case where the flexible printed circuit board <b>300</b> is disposed in a plurality of areas (e.g., a waterproof area (e.g., the waterproof area <b>201</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) and a non-waterproof area (e.g., the non-waterproof area <b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>)) of the inner space of the electronic device (e.g., the electronic device <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) through the through hole (e.g., the through hole <b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) of the housing <b>220</b> (or barrier) of the electronic device (e.g., the electronic device <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), the reinforcement portion <b>330</b> may be a portion that passes through the through hole (e.g., the through hole <b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). The number of reinforcement portions <b>330</b> may be determined depending on the number of through holes <b>203</b> formed in the waterproof area (e.g., the waterproof area <b>201</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) implemented in the electronic device <b>200</b> and be formed. For example, the flexible printed circuit board <b>300</b> may include reinforcement portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>and <b>330</b><i>b </i>passing through two through holes. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, a waterproofing member <b>350</b> may be disposed to surround the reinforcement portion <b>330</b> to reduce entry of fluid into the waterproof area (e.g., the waterproof area <b>201</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). The reinforcement portion <b>330</b> may be manufactured in a special manner as compared with the other portions (e.g., the wiring portion <b>320</b>) to reduce deformation (e.g., twist and/or bending) of the waterproofing member <b>350</b> and reduce damage to the plurality of layers <b>301</b> of the reinforcement portion <b>330</b> of the flexible printed circuit board <b>300</b> and/or the portion (e.g., a portion of the wiring portion <b>320</b>) connected to the reinforcement portion <b>330</b>. For example, when the waterproofing member <b>350</b> is inserted into the through hole (e.g., the through hole <b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) and assembled, the waterproofing member <b>350</b> may be twisted or bent by external force, causing assembly difficult. As another example, as the waterproofing member <b>350</b> disposed in the gap between the through hole (e.g., the through hole <b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) and the flexible printed circuit board <b>300</b> sags or bends, the plurality of layers of the portion (e.g., the reinforcement portion <b>330</b>) of the flexible printed circuit board <b>300</b> where the reinforcement portion <b>330</b> is provided and/or the portion (e.g., a portion of the wiring portion <b>320</b>) connected to the reinforcement portion <b>330</b> may be peeled to leave a gap, and fluid may be introduced through the gap into the waterproof area (e.g., the waterproof area <b>201</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). As another example, if the flexible printed circuit board <b>300</b> is bent after the waterproofing member <b>350</b> is assembled into the through hole (e.g., the through hole <b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), some of the plurality of layers <b>301</b> may be bent due to a difference in curvature between the plurality of layers <b>301</b> of the flexible printed circuit board <b>300</b>, and the fluid may flow through the bent gap into the waterproof area (e.g., the waterproof area <b>201</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). Thus, the reinforcement portion <b>330</b> may provide rigidity to reduce deformation of the waterproofing member <b>350</b> and damage (e.g., bending) to the plurality of layers <b>301</b>, thereby enhancing waterproofness of the waterproof area (e.g., the waterproof area <b>201</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>).

The portions (e.g., the body portion <b>351</b> and the coupling portion <b>352</b>) may be integrally configured or be configured to be assemblable. Meanwhile, without limited to those shown, the waterproofing member <b>350</b> may be implemented to include more or less components. For example, without limited to those shown, the waterproofing member <b>350</b> may be implemented to include a body portion <b>351</b> and a single coupling portion connected with the body portion <b>351</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>C</figref>, the body portion <b>351</b> may be implemented in an oval shape whose vertical axis is relatively longer than the horizontal axis. Or, without limited to those described and/or shown, the waterproofing member <b>350</b> may be prepared in a rectangular shape in which case the edges of the waterproofing member <b>350</b> may be rounded. When viewed from above the body portion <b>351</b> (e.g., when observed in the &#x2212;x-axis direction), the area of the body portion <b>351</b> may be implemented to correspond the area of the through hole (e.g., the through hole <b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) of the housing. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, the width (or thickness) (e.g., the length in the Y-axis direction) of the body portion <b>351</b> may be implemented to correspond to the width (e.g., the length in the Y-axis direction) of the through hole (e.g., the through hole <b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) of the housing. As another example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, the length in another direction (e.g., the length in the Z-axis direction) of the body portion <b>351</b> may be implemented to correspond to the length in another direction (e.g., the length in the Z-axis direction) of the through hole (e.g., the through hole <b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) of the housing. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, the height (e.g., the length in the X-axis direction) of the body portion <b>351</b> may be implemented to correspond to the depth (or the thickness of the housing) of the through hole (e.g., the through hole <b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) (or opening) of the housing but, without limited to those described, it may be implemented to be smaller or larger than the depth of the through hole (e.g., the through hole <b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, the area (e.g., the lengths in the Y-axis and Z-axis directions) of the through hole (e.g., the through hole <b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) formed in the body portion <b>351</b> may be implemented to correspond to the area (e.g., the lengths in the Y-axis and Z-axis directions) of the reinforcement portion <b>330</b> so that the reinforcement portion <b>330</b> may be inserted into the through hole of the body portion <b>351</b>. When the reinforcement portion <b>330</b> is inserted, the outer surface of the reinforcement portion <b>330</b> may contact the inner surface of the through hole (e.g., the through hole <b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), reducing the inflow of the fluid. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, as the coupling portions <b>352</b> are implemented to have a predetermined step C from the body portion <b>351</b>, the waterproofing member <b>350</b>, when inserted into the through hole (e.g., the through hole <b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) of the housing, may be tightly coupled by the contact between the side surfaces of the coupling portions <b>352</b> and the inner surface of the through hole (e.g., the through hole <b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>).

For example, when a plurality of flexible printed circuit boards <b>300</b> are arranged, the waterproofing member <b>350</b> may include a plurality of through holes through which the plurality of flexible printed circuit boards <b>300</b> may be disposed. However, without limited to those described, in a case where a plurality of flexible printed circuit boards <b>300</b> are arranged, a single reinforcement portion <b>330</b>, connecting the plurality of flexible printed circuit boards <b>300</b> together, may be formed, and the single reinforcement portion <b>330</b> may be fitted into the single hole of the waterproofing member <b>350</b>, and the plurality of flexible printed circuit boards <b>330</b> may be arranged.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">According to various embodiments, the lateral thickness of the waterproofing member <b>350</b> (e.g., the thickness in the Y-axis direction) may be implemented to be equal to or smaller (or relatively smaller) than the vertical thickness (e.g., the thickness in the Z-axis direction). The lateral thickness may be determined based on the length in the Y-axis direction of the through hole (e.g., the through hole <b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) formed in the housing and the length in the Y-axis direction of the reinforcement portion <b>330</b>. As the lateral thickness is implemented to be equal to or smaller than the vertical thickness, assembly of the flexible printed circuit board <b>300</b> may be easier, and deformation (e.g., bending) of the flexible printed circuit board <b>300</b> due to assembly may be prevented.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">According to various embodiments, the waterproofing member <b>350</b> may be implemented of an elastic material (e.g., at least one, or a combination, of rubber, flexible plastic, dispensing, bonding, or polymer). Accordingly, the waterproofing member <b>350</b> may be inserted and fixed into the through hole <b>203</b>, and the gap (or opening) between the through hole <b>203</b> and the reinforcement portion <b>330</b> may be filled with the waterproofing member <b>350</b> (or the opening may be closed).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">An example of the reinforcement portion <b>330</b> according to various embodiments is described below.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">According to various embodiments, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, the reinforcing portion <b>330</b> may be implemented to have a larger width w<b>1</b> than the width w<b>2</b> of the wiring portion <b>320</b> (e.g., the length in the Y-axis direction) of another flexible printed circuit board.

For example, the bonding member <b>332</b> may include a tape implemented as a predetermined adhesive material (e.g., a high-modulus substance, such as epoxy). Further, without limited to those described, the bonding members <b>332</b> may include a bonding material that fills the gaps between the plurality of layers <b>301</b> while forming predetermined layers. As is described below, the bonding members <b>332</b> may be formed between the plurality of layers <b>301</b> by a thermocompression process. The reinforcement portion <b>330</b>, including the bonding members <b>332</b> between the plurality of layers <b>301</b>, may be rendered to have higher rigidity than the other portions (e.g., the wiring portion <b>320</b>) by the thermocompression (or may be rigidly implemented). The above-described dummy area (e.g., the second area Y<b>2</b>) may be formed by the thermocompression. Further, the reinforcement portion <b>330</b> may further include rigid layers <b>333</b> on the uppermost layer and under the lowermost layer of the plurality of layers <b>301</b>.
