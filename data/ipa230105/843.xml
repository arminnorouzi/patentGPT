Activation of the mTOR pathway is associated with cell proliferation and survival, while inhibition of mTOR signaling leads to inflammation and cell death. Dysregulation of the mTOR signaling pathway has been implicated in an increasing number of human diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. Consequently, mTOR inhibitors have found wide applications in treating diverse pathological conditions such as solid tumors, organ transplantation, restenosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. However, a pressing issue in the application of mTOR inhibitors is the variability of treatment response among different individuals having the same disease or condition. Given the large number of genes involved in the extended signaling network of mTOR, a reliable set of predictive biomarkers is much needed to guide selection of an effective treatment plan for individual patients.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Sirolimus (INN/USAN), also known as rapamycin, is an immunosuppressant drug used to prevent rejection in organ transplantation; it is especially useful in kidney transplants. Sirolimus-eluting stents were approved in the United States to treat coronary restenosis. Additionally, sirolimus has been demonstrated as an effective inhibitor of tumor growth in various cell lines and animal models. Other limus drugs, such as analogs of rapamycin, have been designed to improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of sirolimus. For example, Temsirolimus was approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. Everolimus was approved in the U.S. for treatment of advanced breast cancer, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, advanced renal cell carcinoma, and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with Tuberous Sclerosis. The mode of action of rapamycin is to bind the cytosolic protein FK-binding protein 12 (FKBP12), and the sirolimus-FKBP12 complex in turn inhibits the mTOR pathway by directly binding to the mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the roles of TSC1/2 and mTOR mutations in responding to rapalogs remain controversial. For example, although it has been reported that mutations in TSC1/2 and mTOR are more frequent in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients who respond well to rapalogs, the majority of rapalog responders have no mutations in mTOR pathway. In Kwiatkowski et al, only 2/32 (6.25%) patients with TSC1 mutations or copy number loss and 0% patients with TSC2 mutations or copy number loss that were treated with an mTOR inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus or everolimus) responded. In addition, in another study (Kwiatkowski, NCT02201212) only 2/30 (7%) responses were seen in patients with TSC1 or TSC2 mutations that were treated with everolimus. See Kwiatkowski et al. <i>Clin Cancer Res. </i>2016; 22:2445-52.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, rapalogs usually arrest cell proliferation but do not induce apoptosis.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Despite the initial response, tumors frequently develop resistance to these agents.

TP53, RB1, ATRX, or FAT1). In some embodiments, the individual is selected for treatment on the basis of having an mTOR-activating aberration at TSC1, TSC2, TP53. ATRX, or RPS6. In some embodiments, the individual is selected for treatment on the basis of having an mTOR-activating aberration at TSC2 and RPS6.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The application is at least partly based upon the strikingly advantageous effects shown in a phase II study in which patients with advanced and malignant PEComa (&#x201c;PEComa trial&#x201d;) were treated with ABI-009 (a nanoparticle formulation of sirolimus coated with albumin, i.e., nab-sirolimus). Patients received ABI-009 at a dose of 100 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>for two out of every three weeks a cycle for one or more cycles. Most of the patients had one or more mutations on one or more (such as one, two, three, four, five, or six) genes (such as TSC1, TSC2, PTEN, TP53, RB1, ATRX, or FAT1) and a positive status of phosphorylation of S6. Up to November 2020, the trial has at least achieved a) 90% of the patients achieved a partial response or a stable control; b) disease control (partial response and stable disease) in 71% of the patients; c) an independently assessed overall response rate (ORR) of 39% with durable responses (ongoing 30.7+ median months) and d) acceptable safety profile despite relatively high dose of nab-sirolimus.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Patients with mutation in TSC1, TSC2, TP53 and/or ATRX showed at least partial response to treatment, as well as those that had a positive status of phosphorylation of S6. Strikingly, the majority of patients (about 90%) with TSC2 mutation showed partial response to the treatment, while about 20% of the patients with TSC1 mutation showed partial response. Moreover, 58% of patients with a positive status of phosphorylated S6 (i.e., pS6) showed partial response to the treatment, while none of the patients (zero out of eight) without expression of pS6 showed partial response. Importantly, all patients with a TSC2 mutations and a positive pS6 responded to the treatment, which strongly suggests that cancer patients with aberration at TSC2 and RPS6 are particularly suitable for a treatment that comprise the administration of the nanoparticle composition described herein.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Moreover, the excellent responses observed in PEComa trial is not limited only to PEComa patients.

However, because of their history of a hyperplasia (e.g. cancer, restenosis, or pulmonary hypertension), these individuals are considered at risk of development of the disease. Treatment or administration in the &#x201c;adjuvant setting&#x201d; refers to a subsequent mode of treatment. The degree of risk (e.g., when an individual in the adjuvant setting is considered as &#x201c;high risk&#x201d; or &#x201c;low risk&#x201d;) depends upon several factors, most usually the extent of disease when first treated.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">&#x201c;Neoadjuvant setting&#x201d; refers to a clinical setting in which the method is carried out before the primary/definitive therapy.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As used herein, &#x201c;delaying&#x201d; the development of a cancer means to defer, hinder, slow, retard, stabilize, and/or postpone development of the disease. This delay can be of varying lengths of time, depending on the history of the disease and/or individual being treated. As is evident to one skilled in the art, a sufficient or significant delay can, in effect, encompass prevention, in that the individual does not develop the disease. A method that &#x201c;delays&#x201d; development of a cancer is a method that reduces probability of disease development in a given time frame and/or reduces the extent of the disease in a given time frame, when compared to not using the method. Such comparisons are typically based on clinical studies, using a statistically significant number of subjects. Cancer development can be detectable using standard methods, including, but not limited to, computerized axial tomography (CAT Scan), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), abdominal ultrasound, clotting tests, arteriography, or biopsy.

In some embodiments, the presence of a genetic aberration (such as a mutation or a copy number variation) in one or more mTOR-associated genes as compared to a control indicates that (a) the individual is more likely to respond to treatment or (b) the individual is selected for treatment. In some embodiments, the absence of a genetic aberration at an mTOR-associated gene, or a wild-type mTOR-associated gene compared to a control, indicates that (a) the individual is less likely to respond to treatment or (b) the individual is not selected for treatment. In some embodiments, an aberrant level (such as expression level or activity level, including phosphorylation level of a protein) of one or more mTOR-associated genes is correlated with the likelihood of the individual to respond to treatment. For example, a larger deviation of the level (e.g. expression or activity level, including phosphorylation level of a protein) of one or more mTOR-associated genes in the direction of hyperactivating the mTOR signaling pathway indicates that the individual is more likely to respond to treatment.

Since HSA is freely soluble in water, nab-rapamycin can be reconstituted in a wide range of concentrations ranging from dilute (0.1 mg/ml rapamycin or a derivative thereof) to concentrated (e.g., 50 mg/ml rapamycin or a derivative thereof), including for example about 2 mg/ml to about 8 mg/ml, or about 5 mg/ml.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0249">Methods of making nanoparticle compositions are known in the art. For example, nanoparticles containing an mTOR inhibitor (such as a limus drug, e.g., rapamycin or a derivative thereof) and an albumin (such as human serum albumin or human albumin) can be prepared under conditions of high shear forces (e.g., sonication, high pressure homogenization, or the like).

(2002). Cell 110: 163-75; Fang et al. (2001). Science 294 (5548): 1942-5). mTORC1 integrates four major signal inputs: nutrients (such as amino acids and phosphatidic acid), growth factors (insulin), energy and stress (such as hypoxia and DNA damage). Amino acid availability is signaled to mTORC1 via a pathway involving the Rag and Ragulator (LAMTOR1-3) Growth factors and hormones (e.g., insulin) signal to mTORC1 via Akt, which inactivates TSC2 to prevent inhibition of mTORC1. Alternatively, low ATP levels lead to the AMPK-dependent activation of TSC2 and phosphorylation of raptor to reduce mTORC1 signaling proteins.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0255">Active mTORC1 has a number of downstream biological effects including translation of mRNA via the phosphorylation of downstream targets (4E-BP1 and p70 S6 Kinase), suppression of autophagy (Atg13, ULK1), ribosome biogenesis, and activation of transcription leading to mitochondrial metabolism or adipogenesis. Accordingly, mTORC1 activity promotes either cellular growth when conditions are favorable or catabolic processes during stress or when conditions are unfavorable.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0256">mTORC2 is composed of mTOR, rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (RICTOR), G&#x3b2;L, and mammalian stress-activated protein kinase interacting protein 1 (mSIN1). In contrast to mTORC1, for which many upstream signals and cellular functions have been defined (see above), relatively little is known about mTORC2 biology. mTORC2 regulates cytoskeletal organization through its stimulation of F-actin stress fibers, paxillin, RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, and protein kinase C &#x3b1; (PKC&#x3b1;). It had been observed that knocking down mTORC2 components affects actin polymerization and perturbs cell morphology (Jacinto el al. (2004). <i>Nat. Cell Biol. </i>6, 1122-1128; Sarbassov et al. (2004). <i>Curr. Biol. </i>14, 1296-1302). This suggests that mTORC2 controls the actin cytoskeleton by promoting protein kinase C&#x3b1; (PKC&#x3b1;) phosphorylation, phosphorylation of paxillin and its relocalization to focal adhesions, and the GTP loading of RhoA and Rac1. The molecular mechanism by which mTORC2 regulates these processes has not been determined.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0257">In some embodiments, the mTOR inhibitor (such as a limus drug, e.g., sirolimus or a derivative thereof) is an inhibitor of mTORC1.

Specifically, 43% evaluable patients with uterine primary PEComa, a hard to treat subset, had a partial response. No new safety signals were observed despite relatively high doses of nab-sirolimus compared to other mTOR inhibitors. Additionally, 92% (28/31) patients had a best response of PR or SD.</p><p id="p-0447" num="0445">Individual responses and various parameters were listed in Table 9 and analyzed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref>.

Median DOR has not been reached (range [5.6-33.2+ months] and 50% of the responders have a response duration that is 15.3 months or longer; the median time to response was 1.4 months (95% CI: 1.3, 2.7).</p><p id="p-0449" num="0447">Median PFS is 8.9 months (95% CI: 5.5, -), PFS rate at 3 months (PFS3) is 79%, PFS6 is 70%, and 26% (9/34) of all patients enrolled remain on treatment. For reference, per a meta-analysis of 10 years of phase 2 trials in advanced soft tissue sarcomas (STS) published by the EORTC STS and Bone Sarcoma Group (Wagner et al. 2010. J Clin Oncol 28(5): 835-840), the PFS3 and PFS6 are widely accepted as a meaningful measure of activity of drugs in STS and may be utilized to determine acceptable criteria of benefit. Drugs yielding a PFS rate of &#x2265;40% at 3 months and &#x3e;14% at 6 months are considered to be &#x2018;potentially active&#x2019; in advanced STS (Penel et al. 2011. Ann Oncol 22(6): 1266-1272.)</p><p id="p-0450" num="0448">Mutational status of the suspect genes TSC1 or TSC2 in the mTOR pathway were analyzed for association with patient response outcomes. See Table 7. Mutation or deletion of TSC1 or TSC2 (no overlap) occurred in 5 (20%) and 9 (36%) patients respectively, while 11 (44%) patients had no alterations in TSC1 or TSC2. Specifically, patients with TSC mutations have a) deletions in 4999A and 5002T; b) deletion in 3521G and a mutation in 2743C&#x3e;G; c) a deletion from 1405C to 1409C; d) deletion in 5208C; e) a mutation in 4949A&#x3e;G; f) a mutation in 707T&#x3e;C; g) a deletion from 1960G to 1970A; h) a mutation from 1513C&#x3e;T. Responses occurred in 9/9 (100%, 8 confirmed responses (89%), 1 unconfirmed response (11%)) patients with TSC2 mutations, 1/5 (20/%) patients with TSC1 mutations and 1/11 (9%) of patients with no mutations in TSC1 or TSC2. Moreover, as shown in Table 8, phosphorylated S6 expression by IHC was significantly associated with response, while absence of phosphorylated S6 was associated with no response.</p><p id="p-0451" num="0449">Eleven patients with TSC1 or TSC2 mutations were analyzable for pS6 expression status. Ten out of eleven patients (91%) expressed pS6. In contrast, only 5/11 (45%) without TSC1 or TSC2 mutation expressed pS6. All patients with a TSC2 mutations and a positive pS6 responded to the treatment, which suggests patients with TSC2 mutation and a positive pS6 status are particularly suitable for the treatment.</p><p id="p-0452" num="0450">Additionally, TFE3 translocation (2/22, both patients SD) was infrequent, and was not associated with pS6 status. Mutations in TP53 were present in a) those that showed at least a partial response (3/10, 30%), b) those that showed a stable disease or a progression of disease (9/15, 6(%).</p><p id="p-0453" num="0451">In conclusion, TSC2 mutations were significantly associated with response (89% of patients) to nab-sirolimus in this cohort of 31 efficacy evaluable patients with PEComa. Responses were also seen in patients with TSC1 mutations (20%) or no TSC1/TSC2 mutations (9%) although at much lower frequency than for TSC2 mutations indicating nab-sirolimus is active regardless of mutational status. Lack of pS6 expression was a negative predictor of response. The first prospective study in advanced malignant PEComa suggests that nab-sirolimus may offer an important benefit in a rare and aggressive sarcoma for which there are no approved therapies. A prospective tumor agnostic trial of nab-sirolimus for patients with tumor mutations in TSC2 is warranted.</p><p id="p-0454" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00006" num="00006"><table frame="none"

The albumin contained the stabilizers sodium caprylate (0.08 mM/g) and N-acetyltryptophanate (0.08 mM/g). The aqueous solution and various organic solutions were mixed at a 96:4 ratio of aqueous solution:organic solution in a high-shear homogenizer to form the crude emulsion. Crude emulsions were fed into a high-pressure homogenizer coupled to a wiped film evaporator. The post-evaporate (PE) suspension was pooled and held at about 2&#xb0; C. to about 8&#xb0; C. After holding and pooling, the PE was assayed for rapamycin (by RP-HPLC) and HA (by SEC-UV). Based on assay values, the PE suspension was diluted with a 20% HA solution to yield a rapamycin concentration of about 7 mg/ml rapamycin and 56 mg/ml albumin. The different preparation conditions were assayed for particle size (before and after 0.2 &#x3bc;m filtration) and for filterability through a 0.2 &#x3bc;m filter.
