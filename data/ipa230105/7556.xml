This signaling connection may enable NAS (Non-access stratum) signaling exchange between the UE and the core network, comprising a signaling connection between the UE and the (R)AN and the N2 connection for this UE between the (R)AN and the AMF. The (R)AN can communicate with the UPF over the reference point N3. The UE can establish a packet data unit (PDU) session to the DN (data network, e.g. an operator network or Internet) through the UPF over the reference point N6.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the exemplary system architecture also contains the service-based interfaces such as Nnrf, Nnef, Nausf, Nudm, Npcf, Namf and Nsmf exhibited by NFs such as the NRF, the NEF, the AUSF, the UDM, the PCF, the AMF and the SMF. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also shows some reference points such as N1, N2, N3, N4, N6 and N9, which can support the interactions between NF services in the NFs.

Then after the normal handover procedures concludes, upon receiving the request for voice QoS flows setup, the target NR will trigger handover or redirection procedure to move the UE to target EPS or target E-UTRA connected to 5GC. In this case, the problem is that the normal intra NR handover is useless and the IMS voice call setup time is increased much.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">To overcome or mitigate at least one above mentioned problems or other problems or provide a useful solution, the embodiments of the present disclosure propose an improved context resume solution.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a first aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a method in a source Next Generation-Radio Access Network, NG-RAN, base station in a wireless communication network, for handling handover of a User Equipment, UE.

It should be understood that these embodiments are discussed only for the purpose of enabling those skilled persons in the art to better understand and thus implement the present disclosure, rather than suggesting any limitations on the scope of the present disclosure. Reference throughout this specification to features, advantages, or similar language does not imply that all of the features and advantages that may be realized with the present disclosure should be or are in any single embodiment of the disclosure. Rather, language referring to the features and advantages is understood to mean that a specific feature, advantage, or characteristic described in connection with an embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the present disclosure. Furthermore, the described features, advantages, and characteristics of the disclosure may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments. One skilled in the relevant art will recognize that the disclosure may be practiced without one or more of the specific features or advantages of a particular embodiment. In other instances, additional features and advantages may be recognized in certain embodiments that may not be present in all embodiments of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As used herein, the term &#x201c;network&#x201d; refers to a network following any suitable communication standards such as new radio (NR). In the following description, the terms &#x201c;network&#x201d; and &#x201c;system&#x201d; can be used interchangeably. Furthermore, the communications between two devices in the network may be performed according to any suitable communication protocols, including, but not limited to, the communication protocols as defined by a standard organization such as 3GPP. For example, the communication protocols as may comprise the 5G communication protocols, and/or any other protocols either currently known or to be developed in the future.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The term &#x201c;network entity&#x201d; can be implemented in a physical network node, or in a virtual network node which perform a function by logical resources in more than one physical network node. The &#x201c;network entity&#x201d; can be implemented in a centralized way, or in a distributed way. The &#x201c;network entity&#x201d; can also be implemented in the cloud.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The term &#x201c;network function (NF)&#x201d; refers to any suitable function which can be implemented in a network node (physical or virtual) of a communication network. For example, the 5G system (5GS) may comprise a plurality of NFs such as AMF, SMF, AUSF, UDM, PCF, AF, NEF, UPF and NRF, (R)AN, SCP, etc. In other embodiments, the network function may comprise different types of NFs for example depending on a specific type of network.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The UE may be, for example, a Subscriber Station (SS), a Portable Subscriber Station, a Mobile Station (MS), or an Access Terminal (AT). The terminal device may include, but not limited to, a portable computer, an image capture terminal device such as a digital camera, a gaming terminal device, a music storage and a playback appliance, a mobile phone, a cellular phone, a smart phone, a voice over IP (VoIP) phone, a wireless local loop phone, a tablet, a wearable device, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a portable computer, a desktop computer, a wearable terminal device, a vehicle-mounted wireless terminal device, a wireless endpoint, a mobile station, a laptop-embedded equipment (LEE), a laptop-mounted equipment (LME), a USB dongle, a smart device, a wireless customer-premises equipment (CPE) and the like. In the following description, the terms &#x201c;terminal device&#x201d;, &#x201c;terminal&#x201d;, &#x201c;user equipment&#x201d; and &#x201c;UE&#x201d; may be used interchangeably. As one example, a terminal device may represent a UE configured for communication in accordance with one or more communication standards promulgated by the 3GPP, such as 3GPP&#x2032; LTE standard or NR standard. As used herein, a &#x201c;user equipment&#x201d; or &#x201c;UE&#x201d; may not necessarily have a &#x201c;user&#x201d; in the sense of a human user who owns and/or operates the relevant device. In some embodiments, a terminal device may be configured to transmit and/or receive information without direct human interaction. For instance, a terminal device may be designed to transmit information to a network on a predetermined schedule, when triggered by an internal or external event, or in response to requests from the communication network. Instead, a UE may represent a device that is intended for sale to, or operation by, a human user but that may not initially be associated with a specific human user.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">As yet another example, in an Internet of Things (IOT) scenario, a terminal device may represent a machine or other device that performs monitoring and/or measurements, and transmits the results of such monitoring and/or measurements to another terminal device and/or network equipment. The terminal device may in this case be a machine-to-machine (M2M) device, which may in a 3GPP context be referred to as a machine-type communication (MTC) device. As one particular example, the terminal device may be a UE implementing the 3GPP narrow band internet of things (NB-IoT) standard. Particular examples of such machines or devices are sensors, metering devices such as power meters, industrial machinery, or home or personal appliances, for example refrigerators, televisions, personal wearables such as watches etc. In other scenarios, a terminal device may represent a vehicle or other equipment that is capable of monitoring and/or reporting on its operational status or other functions associated with its operation.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">References in the specification to &#x201c;one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;an example embodiment,&#x201d; and the like indicate that the embodiment described may include a particular feature, structure, or characteristic, but it is not necessary that every embodiment includes the particular feature, structure, or characteristic. Moreover, such phrases are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Further, when a particular feature, structure, or characteristic is described in connection with an embodiment, it is submitted that it is within the knowledge of one skilled in the art to affect such feature, structure, or characteristic in connection with other embodiments whether or not explicitly described.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">It shall be understood that although the terms &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. For example, a first element could be termed a second element, and similarly, a second element could be termed a first element, without departing from the scope of example embodiments.

As such, the apparatus may provide means or module for accomplishing various parts of the method <b>300</b> as well as means or module for accomplishing other processes in conjunction with other components.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The present solution is to have NR (NG-RAN) be aware of the IMS voice call initiation so that in case of EPS fallback or inter RAT fallback being applicable, NR will change the handover policy to prioritize handover/redirection to EPS or E-UTRA connected to 5GC. When NR is aware of IMS voice call initiation, NR can also solicitate the measurement report from UE for the neighboring E-UTRA cells.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">As used herein, the NR-RAN base station may be gNB (Next generation NodeB) in 5G.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">At block <b>302</b>, NR-RAN base station may obtain an indication information which indicates the IP Multimedia Subsystem, IMS, voice call initiation.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The NR can get ware of the IMS voice call initiation through this step. Before this step, the UE already camps on NG-RAN in 5GS (5G System). And there are various ways to have NR aware of the IMS voice call initiation.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one embodiment, the source NG-RAN base station can determine the indication information by itself. For example, for MO call, when UE initiates IMS voice call during IDLE status and sets the RRC establishment cause to be &#x201c;mo-VoiceCall&#x201d;, and upon receiving the RRC message, the NG-RAN base station detects the cause is &#x201c;mo-VoiceCall&#x201d;, it decides that the IMS voice call is initiated. In another example, the source NG-RAN base station can perform packet inspection or classification to check whether SIP Invite is received. For example, when NG-RAN base station receives the uplink data (e.g., from UE) or downlink data (e.g., form UPF), it will perform the inspection/classification for packets of specific QoS flows, e.g., QoS flow with 5QI=5. When NG-RAN base station performs the classification, it will classify the data into different categories. If the data is classified as a &#x201c;SIP INVITE&#x201d; category, NG-RAN knows that IMS voice call is initiated. The classification may be implemented by deriving the actual SIP message content, or by separating &#x201c;SIP INVITE&#x201d; from other SIP messages e.g. by the size of the massages.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In another embodiment, the NG-RAN base station doesn't determine the indication information which indicates the IMS voice call initiation by itself, it receives the indication information directly from the UE. In this embodiment, the UE additionally indicates the IMS voice call initiation in a message. For example, UE adds the indication information in SDAP (Service Data Adaptation Protocol) header or PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) header. If SDP (Session Description Protocol) header is applicable for the radio bearer associated with IMS signaling QoS flow (e.g., QoS flow with 5QI=5), when UE sends SIP INVITE (for MO call) or 183 SDP (for MT call), UE additionally indicates the IMS voice call initiation in SDAP header; if SDP header is not applicable, UE will additionally indicate the IMS voice call initiation in PDCP header.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In another embodiment, the NG-RAN base station doesn't determine the indication information which indicates the IMS voice call initiation by itself, it receives the indication information directly from the UPF. In this embodiment, the UPF additionally indicates the IMS voice call initiation in a message. There are various ways for UPF about how to obtain the indication information. In one embodiment, UPF performs packet inspection/classification to check whether SIP Invite is received. The inspection/classification is performed for packets of specific QoS flows, e.g., QoS flow with 5QI=5. The packet inspection/classification may be done according the request from another network entity, e.g., SMF. Alternatively, an agreed packet marking from IMS is used, for example, using a dedicated DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) for SIP messages that are for signalling and to be prioritized for handover e.g. SIP INVITE.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In another embodiment, the NG-RAN base station doesn't determine the indication information which indicates the IMS voice call initiation by itself, it receives the indication information directly from the AMF. In this embodiment, the AMF receives the indication information form another network entity. In one example, the AMF receives the indication information from SMF; in another example, the AMF receives the indication information from P-CSCF.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the scenario that AMF receives the indication information from P-CSCF: the AMF may make a subscription for receiving EventExposure events for indication information which indicates the IMS voice call initiation from P-CSCF, and as P-CSCF knows the indication information, P-CSCF sends the indication information to the AMF.

In another example, the SMF installs rules for enabling the UPF to perform inspection/classification to get the indication information, the UPF will perform inspection/classification to get the indication information as described above, and then UPF will send a report message including the indication information to the SMF.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">At block <b>304</b>, NG-RAN base station performs a handover policy to prioritize handover or redirection to an Evolved-Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network, E-UTRAN, base station over handover to a target NG-RAN base station.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">When NG-RAN base station is aware that IMS voice call is initiated form the indication information, if there is a handover to a new target NG-RAN base station is ongoing, the NG-RAN base station (herein the source NG-RAN base station) may react to the indication information in two ways: firstly, if the ongoing handover to a new target NG-RAN base station is in preparation phase (e.g., handover command is not sent to UE yet), the source NG-RAN base station may decide to cancel the ongoing handover procedure and prepare for handover or redirection to target E-UTRAN base station; secondly, if the ongoing handover to the new target NG-RAN base station is already in execution phase (e.g., the handover command is already sent to UE), then source NG-RAN base station may decide to continue the ongoing handover procedure to the new target NG-RAN base station.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a flowchart of a method according to an embodiment of the present disclosure, which may be performed by an apparatus implemented in or at a first network entity or communicatively coupled to a first network entity.
