Further, filter clogging may reduce the life of pump seals, valves, and process equipment.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure relates, in some embodiments to methods, systems, and apparatuses for treating, dewatering, and/or decontaminating contaminated liquid mixtures. For example, methods, systems, apparatuses, and controllers may be used in treating and/or decontaminating liquid mixtures, and more specifically, for use in the dewatering of solids and/or solid particles contained in contaminated liquid mixtures.

Accordingly, the manner of carrying out the disclosure as shown and described is to be construed as illustrative only.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Persons skilled in the art may make various changes in the shape, size, number, and/or arrangement of parts without departing from the scope of the instant disclosure. For example, the position and number of inlets, apertures, filters, gaskets, valves, pumps, containers, sensors, controllers, and/or outlets may be varied. In some embodiments, filters, seal gaskets, and/or filtration assemblies may be interchangeable. Interchangeability may allow the size and/or kind of contaminates to be custom adjusted (e.g., by varying or selecting the pore size and/or kind of filter used). In addition, the size of a device and/or system may be scaled up (e.g., to be used for high throughput commercial or municipal fluid filtration applications) or down (e.g., to be used for lower throughput household or research applications) to suit the needs and/or desires of a practitioner. Each disclosed method and method step may be performed in association with any other disclosed method or method step and in any order according to some embodiments. Where the verb &#x201c;may&#x201d; appears, it is intended to convey an optional and/or permissive condition, but its use is not intended to suggest any lack of operability unless otherwise indicated.

An air actuated diaphragm pump was included to pull a vacuum. Suspended solids consisted of coagulated tannins and lignins from groundwater. The flat sheet membrane was placed into the bucket with the suspended solid mixture and the vacuum pump was turned on. After 1-2 minutes, the flat sheet membrane was removed from the bucket, and held in the air. The vacuum pump continued to pump for nominally 10-12 seconds, at which point the cake on the membrane dewatered further (slightly), and water from the permeate (inside membrane) was exhausted out. After this was performed, the vacuum was stopped by isolating a valve, and then a shockwave was applied. The shockwave was nominally 0.5-1 second in duration with a pressure of 10 psi.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">When the shockwave was applied, the solids fell off the membrane from the top down. As it dropped, it accumulated together on each side finally creating a large mass of solids as the total solids fell off the membrane. The dewatered mass had a consistency similar to cattle manure.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
