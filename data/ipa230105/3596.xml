Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In JP-A-2018-72024 (Document 1), there is disclosed a robot having a gripping device provided with a pressure sensor as an industrial robot used in a manufacturing line or the like. The pressure sensor is a sensor for outputting pressure as an electric signal.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The gripping device is provided with a pair of gripping sections which are openable and closable, and the pressure sensor provided to the gripping sections. When a gripping target article is gripped by the gripping sections, the pressure sensor makes contact with the gripping target article to thereby deform, and thus, a voltage signal is output from the pressure sensor. A control device of the robot controls gripping force of the gripping device based on the voltage signal.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This pressure sensor has a first electrode, a second electrode, and an intermediate layer as a piezoelectric body which is disposed between the first electrode and the second electrode, and generates electricity due to a deformation. Between each of the electrodes and the intermediate layer, there is caused a change in capacitance, and thus, the electricity is generated. By detecting an amount of the generation of the electricity and presence or absence of the generation of the electricity, the pressure sensor functions.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the pressure sensor described in Document 1, the electricity is generated when the intermediate layer deforms, but even when the intermediate layer deforms in deformation modes different from each other, it is unachievable to distinguish the deformation modes from each other. For example, when the pressure sensor is pressed by the gripping target article, compressive force is applied to the intermediate layer. In contrast, when the gripping target article is lifted by the robot in a state in which the gripping device grips the gripping target article, thrust force derived from gravitational force caused in the gripping target article is applied to the intermediate layer of the pressure sensor together with the compressive force described above.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, it is unachievable for the pressure sensor described in Document 1 to distinguish the compressive force and the thrust force from each other. Therefore, in the control device for the robot, there is a problem that it is unachievable to distinguish between the state in which the gripping target article is simply gripped and the state in which the gripping target article is lifted while being gripped.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A piezoelectric sensor according to an application example

Each of the axes is represented by an arrow, and a tip side is defined as a &#x201c;positive&#x201d; side, and a base end side is defined as a &#x201c;negative&#x201d; side. In the following description, an &#x201c;X-axis direction,&#x201d; for example, includes both of the positive direction and the negative direction in the X axis. Further, in the following description, the description will be presented defining the positive side in the Z axis is referred to as an &#x201c;upper side,&#x201d; and the negative side in the Z axis is referred to as a &#x201c;lower side&#x201d; in some cases.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">A robot hand <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is provided with a pair of finger parts <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>. By changing a distance between the finger part <b>14</b> and the finger part <b>15</b>, it is possible to pinch an object W from both sides to grip the object W, and release the object W having once been gripped.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The robot hand <b>10</b> has a base <b>11</b>, a pair of sliders <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, the finger parts <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, motors <b>16</b>, <b>17</b>, and piezoelectric sensors <b>1</b>, wherein the pair of sliders <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> slide with respect to the base <b>11</b>, the finger parts <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> are respectively fixed to the sliders <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and the motors <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> respectively slide the sliders <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>.

Further, the motor <b>16</b> is coupled to the slider <b>12</b>, and the slider <b>12</b> slides due to the drive by the motor <b>16</b>.

Thus, it is possible to grip the object W with the finger parts <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>, and to release the object W having once been gripped.

When pinching the object W between the gripping surface <b>141</b> and the gripping surface <b>151</b>, the piezoelectric sensors <b>1</b> respectively intervene between the gripping surfaces <b>141</b>, <b>151</b> and the object W. Therefore, each of the piezoelectric sensors <b>1</b> receives reactive force from the object W, and then outputs a voltage corresponding to the reactive force.
