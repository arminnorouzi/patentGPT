Above all, the development of displays of smartphones has influenced changes in design as well as performance of smartphones. In particular, displays having flexibility enable curved displays and lead various changes in smartphone design. Accordingly, technologies for double edge bended displays have been developed, and many smartphone manufacturers have produced double edge bended smartphones.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">With the development of performance and design of smartphones, the change in displays is accompanied by change in methods for making displays. A display panel is not simply a single product that is completed by laminating various core materials in the form of a film. For example, one display may be configured by laminating an organic light emitting diode (OLED), a polarizer, a touch sensor, and the like, and laminating a cover window on top. However, in order to complete the display, not only providing various materials in the form of a film is required, but also firmly bonding between the materials is required. An optical clear adhesive (OCA) is widely used as an adhesive to bond various materials constituting the display. In addition, a liner film may also be used to guide the OCA to be bonded to the cover window.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A quad edge bended display which has four edges bended in addition to both edges is suggested, and efforts to develop technology for the quad edge bended display have been made. However, there are various problems in developing the technology for the quad edge bended display.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An example of these problems is that the OCA may wrinkle due to a tension of the liner film when the OCA is bonded to the cover window, or air bubbles may be generated between the OCA and the cover window. The air bubbles may reduce adhesiveness between the cover window and the OCA, and may cause reflection or refraction of light between the OCA and the cover window, resulting in a blurred image on the display.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To solve the above-described problems, a method for manufacturing an OCA by using a polypropylene film having a higher elongation than a PET film which is widely used as a liner film has been suggested. In addition, recently, there is an increasing need for a polypropylene film which can prevent air bubbles from being generated between an OCA and cover glass by reducing a tension of a film with a high elongation, and also, can prevent wrinkles on the OCA, and provide increases a production rate.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the present disclosure are invented by considering the above, and providing an adhesive film which can minimize wrinkles generated on an adhesive layer when the adhesive layer is attached to a material, and can prevent air bubbles from being generated between the adhesive layer and the material.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an adhesive film including: a guide film comprising a first area and a second area surrounding the first area, and an adhesive layer disposed on the first area. The first area has a shape corresponding to a shape of the adhesive layer, and a cut-out portion is provided within a circumference of the second area and positioned adjacent to the adhesive layer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, the present disclosure provides the adhesive film, wherein the adhesive layer includes a corner portion, and the cut-out portion is disposed on a position adjacent to the corner portion.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to embodiments of the present disclosure, there are effects that, when the adhesive layer is attached to a material, wrinkles on the adhesive layer are minimized, and air bubbles are not generated between the adhesive layer and the material.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, there are effects that wrinkles on the adhesive layer are minimized, air bubbles are not generated between the adhesive layer and a material, and also, a production rate is increased.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present disclosure also provides an adhesive film laminating method for laminating an adhesive film on a cover window, the adhesive film having a guide film and an adhesive layer disposed on one side of the guide film, the cover window having a planar portion and a plurality of bending edge portions positioned around the planar portion. The method comprises bringing the adhesive film and the cover window into contact with each other to bond the adhesive layer to the cover window, and removing the guide film from the adhesive layer.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, the present disclosure provides an adhesive film fabrication method comprising providing a guide film, placing an adhesive layer on the guide film, and forming a cut-out portion to be disposed on a position adjacent to a corner portion of the adhesive layer.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a top view of an adhesive film according to an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an exploited perspective view of the adhesive film of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the adhesive film of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, taken along the line X-X&#x2032;;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a top view of a guide film of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a top view of an adhesive film according to a second embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a top view of an adhesive film according to a variation of the second embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a front view of the adhesive film of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a perspective view showing an adhesive film which is disposed on a stage before being laminated on a cover window according to an embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a front view illustrating the stage of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> which is moved up toward the cover window;</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a sequence diagram schematically illustrating an adhesive film manufacturing method which laminates an adhesive film on a cover window according to embodiments of the present disclosure; and</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a sequence diagram schematically illustrating a method for fabricating an adhesive film according to embodiments of the present disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Hereinafter, specific embodiments for implementing the concept of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further, in explaining the present disclosure, any specific explanation on a well-known related configuration or function deemed to obscure the gist of the present disclosure will be omitted.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In addition, it should be understood that, when a certain element is referred to as being &#x201c;connected to,&#x201d; &#x201c;bonded to,&#x201d; &#x201c;disposed on,&#x201d; or &#x201c;in contact with&#x201d; another element, the certain element can be directly connected to, bonded to, disposed on, or in contact with another element, but there may be an intervening element therebetween.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The terms used herein are only for describing certain exemplary embodiments, and not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure.
