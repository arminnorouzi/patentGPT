No. 2021-110808, which was filed on Jul. 2, 2021, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The following disclosure relates to a steer-by-wire steering system for vehicles.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">From the viewpoint of failsafe, it has been proposed to provide a steer-by-wire steering system with a backup power source as described in Patent Document 1 (Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2020-138554), and it has been proposed to provide the steer-by-wire steering system with redundancy, namely, it has been proposed to duplex the system, as disclosed in Patent Document 2 (WO2017/115411).</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a case where the steering system employs the backup power source, the utility of the steering system is enhanced by constructing the steering system with consideration given to the fact that the backup power source has a relatively small capacity. In a case where the steering system is duplexed, the utility of the steer-by-wire steering system is enhanced by constructing the steering system with consideration given to a connection configuration of the backup power source in a redundant system. Accordingly, an aspect of the present disclosure is directed to a steer-by-wire steering system with high utility.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect of the present disclosure, a first steer-by-wire steering system of the present disclosure includes:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">a main power source and a backup power source;</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">a steering device including a dual-system steering motor including a main system and a sub system and configured to steer a wheel by a force generated by the steering motor; and</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">a controller configured to control the main system and the sub system of the steering motor so as to control the steering device based on a steering request,</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">wherein a power supply to the main system of the steering motor is conducted selectively by the main power source and the backup power source, and a power supply to the sub system of the steering motor is conducted by only the main power source,</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">wherein, in a normal power-supply situation in which the power supply to the main system of the steering motor and the power supply to the sub system of the steering motor are conducted by the main power source, the controller controls the sub system of the steering motor to operate in accordance with the main system of the steering motor, and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">wherein, in a backup power-supply situation in which the power supply to the main system of the steering motor is conducted by the backup power source, the controller controls the main system of the steering motor not to operate or to operate while limiting the power supply to the main system and the controller controls the sub system of the steering motor independently of the main system.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect of the present disclosure, a second steer-by-wire steering system according to the present disclosure includes:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">a main power source and a backup power source;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">a steering device including a steering motor and configured to steer a wheel by a force generated by the steering motor; and</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">a controller configured to control the steering motor so as to control the steering device based on a steering request,</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">wherein the controller limits a current to be supplied to the steering motor when a power supply to the steering motor by the main power source is switched to a power supply to the steering motor by the backup power source.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The backup power source is intended for emergency use, for instance. Thus, the backup power source with a relatively small capacity, i.e., a relatively small charging capacity, is employed in the steering system. In the first steering system according to the present disclosure in which the steering device has redundancy, the backup power source supplies a current to only the main system of the steering motor, instead of the main power source. (The main system of the steering motor will be hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;steering main system&#x201d; where appropriate.) In view of the small capacity of the backup power source, the first steering system according to the present disclosure is configured such that, in the backup power-supply situation, i) the power supply to the steering main system is limited or ii) the power supply to the steering main system is not conducted to stop the steering main system from operating in a case where the current is suppliable from the main power source to the sub system of the steering motor. (The sub system of the steering motor will be hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;steering sub system&#x201d; where appropriate).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the first steering system according to the present disclosure, in the normal power-supply situation, namely, in a situation in which the current is supplied from the main power source to both the steering main system and the steering sub system, the steering sub system is operated in accordance with the steering main system for a smooth operation of the steering device. That is, what is called coordinated control is executed. If the coordinated control were executed in the backup power-supply situation, however, the steering sub system would experience limitation to the current supplied thereto or the steering sub system would stop operating, like the steering main system. Thus, the first steering system according to the present disclosure is configured such that, in the backup power-supply situation, the steering sub system is not operated under the coordinated control but is operated independently of the steering main system, namely, the steering sub system is operated in a fashion similar to that in the normal power-supply situation, so as to ensure a force for steering the wheel (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;steering force&#x201d; where appropriate).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The second steering system according to the present disclosure is configured such that the current supplied to the steering motor is limited when the power supply to the steering motor by the main power source is switched to the power supply to the steering motor by the backup power source. With this configuration, the steering system can be operated for a relatively long length of time even by the backup power source with a relatively small capacity.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Various Forms</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the first steering system according to the present disclosure, whether to operate the steering main system with limited power supply in the backup power-supply situation or not to operate the steering main system in the backup power-supply situation may be determined or selected based on a design of the vehicle, a condition in which the vehicle is placed, a state of the power supply to the steering sub system by the main power source, etc. In most situations, in other words, typically, the steering device can generate a larger steering force when the steering main system is operated with limited power supply (i.e., a power-supply-limited operation) than when the steering main system is not operated (i.e., a non-operation). As later described, when the steering motor is rotated at a high speed in the power-supply-limited operation, the steering main system operates in what is called regenerative region, causing a resistance to the steering motion of the wheel. In view of this, the steering main system may be rendered inactive in the backup power-supply situation in a case where the power supply to the steering sub system is appropriately conducted by the main power source.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">When the power supply to the steering sub system is not appropriately conducted by the main power source in the backup power-supply situation, it is desirable not to operate the steering sub system. In this instance, it is desirable to operate the steering main system with limited power supply for ensuring the steering force regardless of whether the steering main system is determined to operate with limited power supply or the steering main system is determined not to operate in a case where the power supply to the steering sub system is appropriately conducted by the main power source. In other words, the steering main system may basically operate with limited power supply when the power supply to the steering sub system is not appropriately conducted by the main power source in the backup power-supply situation. In this respect, the steering main system may operate with limited power supply also when the power supply to the steering sub system is appropriately conducted by the main power source. Further, the steering main system may be rendered inactive when the power supply to the steering sub system is appropriately conducted by the main power source. As described above, the operation of the steering main system may be switched between the power-supply-limited operation and the non-operation depending upon whether the operation of the steering main system causes a resistance to the steering motion of the wheel.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">As to the coordinated control of the steering main system and the steering sub system, it is desirable to control the operations of the steering main system and the steering sub system such that the steering main system and the steering sub system generate mutually the same force in the normal power-supply situation in a case where the steering main system and the steering sub system are identical in construction.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The controller may be configured to include two systems, i.e., a main system and a sub system, so as to correspond to the main system and the sub system of the steering motor. The main system of the controller (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;control main system&#x201d; where appropriate) and the sub system of the controller (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;control sub system&#x201d; where appropriate) may be configured to have mutually the same function. Specifically, the control main system and the control sub system may be configured to be capable of respectively determining currents to be supplied to the corresponding steering main system and steering sub system based on the steering request and to be capable of controlling the power supply to the corresponding steering main system and steering sub system to be conducted based on the respectively determined currents. In these arrangements, in the normal power-supply situation, the control sub system may control the power supply to the steering sub system by the main power source based on the supply current to the steering main system determined by the control main system, so as to execute the coordinated control. In the backup power-supply situation, the control sub system may determine the supply current to the steering sub system and control the power supply to the steering sub system by the main power source based on the determined supply current without depending on the supply current to the steering main system determined by the control main system.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The main power source may include a storage battery, and the backup power source may be a capacitor. In the normal power-supply situation, the backup power source may be charged with electric energy received from the main power source. In the backup power-supply situation, the power supply to the steering main system by the backup power source may be conducted in dependence on the charged electric energy.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The objects, features, advantages, and technical and industrial significance of the present disclosure will be better understood by reading the following detailed description of an embodiment, when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, in which:</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a view schematically illustrating an overall configuration of a steering system according to one embodiment of the present disclosure;</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic view illustrating a layout of power sources in the steering system;</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a flowchart of a basic steering program and a flowchart of a dependent steering program executed in the steering system according to the embodiment;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a graph illustrating a characteristic of a steering motor;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a graph illustrating a characteristic of one system of the steering motor in a case where a steering current is not limited;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a graph illustrating a characteristic of one system of the steering motor in a case where the steering current is limited;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> is a graph illustrating an overall characteristic of the steering motor in a normal power-supply situation;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref> is a graph illustrating an overall characteristic of the steering motor in a case where a coordinated steering control is executed in a backup power-supply situation;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref> is a graph illustrating an overall characteristic of the steering motor in a case where an independent steering control is executed in the backup power-supply situation;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flowchart of an operation switching program executed in the steering system according to the embodiment; and</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a flowchart of a reaction force application program executed in the steering system according to the embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to the drawings, there will be described below in detail a steering system according to one embodiment of the present disclosure.
