Wet lung and plasma leakage are main factors of the decrease in performance. It is possible to recover the gas exchange performance of a wet lung by blowing air at high pressure to remove dew condensation from hollow fiber membranes. In contrast, plasma leakage causes an irreversible decrease in performance of an oxygenator. Finding a solution to the problem caused by plasma leakage is a requirement for long-term use of oxygenators, and many studies have been made so far. In order to improve anti-plasma leakage properties, the following approaches have been employed in the studies: an approach for closing micropores in hollow fiber membranes, and an approach for making micropores in hollow fiber membranes ultrafine.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, according to JP 2002-035116A, a silicone coating applied to an outer surface of polypropylene porous hollow fiber membranes reduces the chance of plasma leakage and enables long-term use.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, in the technique disclosed in JP 2002-035116A, the silicone coating is applied by moving a continuous line of the hollow fiber membranes at a rate of 0.5 to 50 m/min in a silicone monomer gas during plasma discharge in a high vacuum and by polymerizing silicone monomers on the outer surface of the hollow fiber membranes. For this reason, the coating in this technique requires intricate equipment and long periods of time.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An object of the invention is to provide an oxygenator having anti-plasma leakage properties by a simpler technique.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The inventors have found that bringing a coating solution prepared by dissolving a silicone compound in a specific organic solvent into contact with an inner surface of hollow fiber membranes under a specific negative pressure makes it possible to form a silicone compound-containing coating layer on the inner surface.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In other words, the object is achieved by the following method for manufacturing an oxygenator having a plurality of porous hollow fiber membranes for gas exchange, the method involving: dissolving a silicone compound in an organic solvent having a surface tension of less than 70 dyn/cm to prepare a coating solution;

and bringing an inner surface of the hollow fiber membranes into contact with the coating solution under a negative pressure of 50 hPa or more and 150 hPa or less to form a coating layer containing a silicone compound (a silicone compound used for preparing the coating solution and/or a crosslinked product of the silicone compound) on the inner surface.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The method for manufacturing an oxygenator according to the invention offers an oxygenator having anti-plasma leakage properties by a technique simpler than one employed in the manufacturing method disclosed in JP 2002-035116A. The method according to the invention uses an organic solvent having a surface tension of less than 70 dyn/cm, which allows easy passage of a coating solution through lumina of hollow fiber membranes. However, the studies of the inventors have revealed that the coating solution is prone to leak to an outer surface of the hollow fiber membranes through pores of the hollow fiber membranes with a reduction in surface tension of the organic solvent. The inventors have also found that evacuating the lumina of the hollow fiber membranes to a negative pressure in a range of 50 hPa to 150 hPa not only prevents leakage of the coating solution but also successfully forms a silicone compound-containing coating layer on the inner surface.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the manufacturing method disclosed in JP 2002-035116A, a silicone compound-containing coating layer is formed on an outer surface of hollow fiber membranes. In contrast, in the method according to the invention, a silicone compound-containing coating layer is formed on an inner surface of hollow fiber membranes. This makes it possible to simultaneously improve anti-plasma leakage properties by providing an oxygenator with a coat containing a water-soluble antithrombotic polymer compound (such as polymethoxyethyl acrylate (PMEA)). A coat containing a water-soluble antithrombotic polymer compound is typically formed in the following manner. The antithrombotic polymer compound is dispersed in an aqueous solvent containing water (preferably 85 mass % or more of water) to prepare an aqueous coating solution, and the coating solution is brought into contact with an inner surface or an outer surface of hollow fiber membranes. However, in a case where a silicone compound-containing coating layer is formed on the outer surface of the hollow fiber membranes by the manufacturing method disclosed in JP 2002-035116A, stacking the coat on top of the silicone compound-containing coating layer on the outer surface poses a challenge. The silicone compound-containing coating layer repels the aqueous coating solution due to its water repellency and inhibits the formation of the coat. Furthermore, in a case where the coat is formed on the inner surface where the silicone compound-containing coating layer is not formed, part of the silicone compound-containing coating layer on the outer surface is peeled off when the aqueous coating solution is allowed to pass through the lumina at a negative pressure. For these reasons, applying the technique of JP 2002-035116A to an oxygenator having a coating layer containing a water-soluble antithrombotic polymer compound does not ensure desired antithrombogenicity or anti-plasma leakage properties. According to the manufacturing method of the invention, a silicone compound-containing coating layer is formed on an inner surface of hollow fiber membranes, and a coat containing a water-soluble antithrombotic polymer compound is formed on an outer surface of the hollow fiber membranes. Therefore, it is possible to provide an oxygenator having both desired antithrombogenicity and anti-plasma leakage properties.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the invention will be described.
