EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0010">One aspect of the present invention relates to a method of producing perfluoro(2,4-dimethyl-2-fluoroformyl-1,3-dioxolane) (hereinafter, also referred to simply as &#x201c;the production method&#x201d;). The above production method has a dimer reaction step of reacting the trifluoropyruvic acid fluoride dimer with hexafluoropropylene oxide in an organic solvent in the presence of one or more fluorides selected from the group consisting of potassium fluoride and sodium fluoride to obtain perfluoro(dimethyl-2-oxo-1,4-dioxane).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">The above production method is a method of producing perfluoro(2,4-dimethyl-2-fluoroformyl-1,3-dioxolane). In the present invention and the present description, perfluoro(2,4-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-2-carboxylic acid) or alkali metal salts thereof are considered to be equivalent to perfluoro(2,4-dimethyl-2-fluoroformyl-1,3-dioxolane). In one embodiment, a product of the above production method mentioned above is perfluoro(2,4-dimethyl-2-fluoroformyl-1,3-dioxolane), perfluoro(2,4-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-2-carboxylic acid), an alkali metal salt of perfluoro(2,4-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-2-carboxylic acid), or a mixture of two of these or three or more of these.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0012">The above production method will be explained in greater detail below.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0013">In the above production method, perfluoro(dimethyl-2-oxo-1,4-dioxane), which is an intermediate used for producing perfluoro(2,4-dimethyl-2-fluoroformyl-1,3-dioxolane), can be obtained by, for example, charging a pressure-resistant vessel with the trifluoropyruvic acid fluoride dimer, an organic solvent and potassium fluoride and/or sodium fluoride, cooling, and then adding and reacting hexafluoropropylene oxide. Next, perfluoro(2,4-dimethyl-2-fluoroformyl-1,3-dioxolane) can be obtained by, for example, increasing the temperature and subjecting the compound to an isomerization step. In addition, it is possible to subject the perfluoro(dimethyl-2-oxo-1,4-dioxane), which is an intermediate used for producing perfluoro(2,4-dimethyl-2-fluoroformyl-1,3-dioxolane), to a dimer reaction step, separating by means of a separation procedure such as extraction separation or distillation separation, and then carry out the isomerization step. The fluoride used in the dimer reaction step is one or more fluorides selected from the group consisting of potassium fluoride and sodium fluoride. Potassium fluoride and sodium fluoride are industrially inexpensive and can be easily procured. Meanwhile, it has been said that potassium fluoride and sodium fluoride are less reactive in reactions than cesium fluoride, as described in, for example, Organic Letters, 2010, 12, 3740 to 3743, and the like. On the contrary, as a result of diligent research, the present inventors discovered a new reaction system in which potassium fluoride and/or sodium fluoride, which had lower activity in conventional reactions, had high activity. This matter is discussed later. The one or more fluorides selected from the group consisting of potassium fluoride and sodium fluoride may be only potassium fluoride, only sodium fluoride, or a combination of potassium fluoride and sodium fluoride. In the present description, &#x201c;potassium fluoride and/or sodium fluoride&#x201d; means any of only potassium fluoride, only sodium fluoride or a combination of potassium fluoride and sodium fluoride.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0014">The trifluoropyruvic acid fluoride dimer used in the above production method can be obtained at a high yield from hexafluoropropylene oxide by using conditions disclosed in, for example, the specification of UK Patent No. 1051647 (PTL 3).

Examples of the organic solvent include aromatic solvents such as toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene and mesitylene; and ether-based solvents such as ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether (also known as diglyme), triethylene glycol dimethyl ether and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether. It is possible to use only one organic solvent or two or more organic solvents mixed at arbitrary proportions. From the perspective of solubility of the potassium fluoride and/or sodium fluoride used, the organic solvent is preferably an ether-based solvent such as ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, triethylene glycol dimethyl ether and tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether, or two or more of the ether-based solvents mixed at arbitrary proportions, with diethylene glycol dimethyl ether being particularly preferred. The usage quantity of the organic solvent in the dimer reaction step is not particularly limited, and the organic solvent can generally be used at a quantity corresponding to 0.3 to 5.0 times the mass of the trifluoropyruvic acid fluoride dimer to be subjected to the reaction. It is preferable for the amount of moisture in the reaction system to be low in order for the reaction to progress favorably. Specifically, the amount of moisture in the reaction system in the dimer reaction step is preferably 500 ppm or less, more preferably 100 ppm or less, and further preferably 50 ppm or less. Units mentioned in the present description (ppm) are on a mass basis.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0017">In the above production method, the potassium fluoride and sodium fluoride can be commercially available anhydrous products, spray dried products or hydrates. In addition, these may be used in a form obtained by supporting on calcium fluoride or the like. From the perspective of improving yield, use of potassium fluoride is preferred, and use of anhydrous or spray dried potassium fluoride is more preferred.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0018">The usage quantity of the fluoride in the dimer reaction step can fall within the range of, for example, 0.05 to 1.5 times the molar quantity of the trifluoropyruvic acid fluoride dimer to be subjected to the reaction. The reaction progresses slowly if this usage quantity is too low, and the yield may decrease, which is not economically advantageous, if this usage quantity is high. From the perspectives mentioned above, the usage quantity of the above fluoride in the dimer reaction step, in one embodiment, is preferably 0.05 to 1.2 times the molar quantity of the trifluoropyruvic acid fluoride dimer to be subjected to the reaction, more preferably 0.05 to 0.8 times this molar quantity, further preferably 0.05 to 0.5 times this molar quantity, further preferably 0.07 to 0.4 times this molar quantity, and particularly preferably 0.08 to 0.3 times this molar quantity. In addition, the usage quantity of the above fluoride in the dimer reaction step can be, in one embodiment, 0.1 to 1.2 times this molar quantity or 0.1 to 0.8 times this molar quantity. In a case where potassium fluoride and sodium fluoride are used as fluorides, the usage quantity of the above fluorides is the total usage quantity thereof. This is also true for other quantities relating to the above fluorides in the present invention and the present description. Use of potassium fluoride as the fluoride is preferred in the dimer reaction step, and in this case, the quantity of potassium fluoride used is such that a molar quantity relative to the trifluoropyruvic acid dimer can be used as a preferred usage quantity.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0019">The usage quantity of hexafluoropropylene oxide in the dimer reaction step can theoretically be a quantity corresponding to 2.0 times or more the molar quantity of the trifluoropyruvic acid fluoride dimer to be subjected to the reaction, and from the perspective of improving the yield, it is generally preferable for this usage quantity to be 1.9 to 2.8 times this molar quantity. In addition, a quantity corresponding to 1.9 to 2.5 times this molar quantity can be used in one aspect.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0020">An example of a manner of addition of components in the dimer reaction step involves adding a mixture of the trifluoropyruvic acid fluoride dimer, potassium fluoride and/or sodium fluoride and an organic solvent at a temperature within the range &#x2212;30&#xb0; C. to 60&#xb0; C. After the addition of the hexafluoropropylene oxide, a temperature within this range may be maintained for a period of 2 hours to 48 hours in order to complete the production of perfluoro(dimethyl-2-oxo-1,4-dioxane) in the dimer reaction step. The temperature mentioned in the present description is the temperature of the reaction liquid unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0021">In the above production method, it is possible to produce the perfluoro(dimethyl-2-oxo-1,4-dioxane), which is an intermediate used for producing perfluoro(2,4-dimethyl-2-fluoroformyl-1,3-dioxolane), by carrying out the dimer reaction step. After the dimer reaction step, the above production method may have an isomerization step of isomerizing the obtained perfluoro(dimethyl-2-oxo-1,4-dioxane) into perfluoro(2,4-dimethyl-2-fluoroformyl-1,3-dioxolane). For example, in the isomerization step, the reaction liquid after the dimer reaction step is reacted for a period of 4 hours to 72 hours at a temperature of 100&#xb0; C. to 150&#xb0; C. so as to enable the isomerization reaction to progress and complete. The isomerization reaction is preferably carried out in a pressure-resistant vessel.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0022">The one or more fluorides selected from the group consisting of potassium fluoride and sodium fluoride may also be added in the isomerization step. In this case, the quantity of above fluoride added in the dimer reaction step and the isomerization step is, in one embodiment, preferably a quantity corresponding to 0.1 to 2.0 times the molar quantity of trifluoropyruvic acid fluoride dimer (specifically, the quantity of trifluoropyruvic acid fluoride dimer charged in the dimer reaction step), more preferably 0.5 to 1.8 times this molar quantity, and further preferably 1.0 to 1.6 times this molar quantity. In addition, the quantity of the above fluoride added in the dimer reaction step and the isomerization step can be, in one embodiment, a quantity corresponding to 0.05 to 0.7 times the molar quantity of the trifluoropyruvic acid fluoride dimer (specifically, the quantity of the trifluoropyruvic acid fluoride dimer charged in the dimer reaction step). By adding the above fluoride in multiple portions in this way, the yield of perfluoro(2,4-dimethyl-2-fluoroformyl-1,3-dioxolane) may be improved. In addition, the fluoride that is further added in the isomerization step is more preferably potassium fluoride from the perspective of achieving a high perfluoro(2,4-dimethyl-2-fluoroformyl-1,3-dioxolane) yield.
