The DC relay is also called a magnetic switch and generally classified as an electrical circuit switching device.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A DC relay includes a fixed contact and a movable contact. The fixed contact is electrically connected to an external power supply and a load. The fixed contact and the movable contact may be brought into contact with or separated from each other.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">By the contact and separation between the fixed contact and the movable contact, electrical connection or disconnection through the DC relay is achieved. Such movement like the contact or separation is made by a drive unit that applies driving force.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the fixed contact and the movable contact are separated from each other, an arc is generated between the fixed contact and the movable contact. The arc is a flow of high-pressure and high-temperature current. Accordingly, the generated arc must be rapidly discharged from the DC relay through a preset path.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An arc discharge path is formed by magnets provided in the DC relay. The magnets produce magnetic fields in a space where the fixed contact and the movable contact are in contact with each other. The arc discharge path may be formed by the formed magnetic fields and electromagnetic force generated by a flow of current.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a space in which fixed contacts <b>1100</b> and a movable contact <b>1200</b> provided in a DC relay <b>1000</b> according to the prior art are to in contact with each other is shown. As described above, permanent magnets <b>1300</b> are provided in the space.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The permanent magnets <b>1300</b> include a first permanent magnet <b>1310</b> disposed at an upper side and a second permanent magnet <b>1320</b> disposed at a lower side. A lower side of the first permanent magnet <b>1310</b> is magnetized to an N pole, and an upper side of the second permanent magnet <b>1320</b> is magnetized to an S pole. Accordingly, a magnetic field is generated in a direction from the upper side to the lower side.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">(a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a state in which current flows in through the left fixed contact <b>1100</b> and flows out through the right fixed contact <b>1100</b>. According to the Fleming's left-hand rule, electromagnetic force is formed outward as indicated with a hatched arrow. Accordingly, a generated arc can be discharged to outside along the direction of the electromagnetic force.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">On the other hand, (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a state in which current flows in through the right fixed contact <b>1100</b> and flows out through the left fixed contact <b>1100</b>. According to the Fleming's left-hand rule, electromagnetic force is formed inward as indicated with a hatched arrow. Accordingly, a generated arc moves inward along the direction of the electromagnetic force.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Several members for driving the movable contact <b>1200</b> to be moved up and down (in a vertical direction) are provided in a center region of the DC relay <b>1000</b>, that is, in a space between the fixed contacts <b>1100</b>. For example, a shaft, a spring member inserted through the shaft, etc. are provided at the position.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, when an arc generated as illustrated in (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is moved toward the center region, there is a risk that various members provided at to the position may be damaged by energy of the arc.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a direction of electromagnetic force formed inside the related art DC relay <b>1000</b> depends on a direction of current flowing through the fixed contacts <b>1200</b>. Therefore, current preferably flows only in a preset direction, namely, in a direction illustrated in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In other words, a user must consider the direction of the current whenever using the DC relay. This may cause inconvenience to the use of the DC relay. In addition, regardless of the user's intention, a situation in which a flowing direction of current applied to the DC relay is changed due to an inexperienced operation or the like cannot be excluded.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this case, the members disposed in the center region of the DC relay may be damaged by the generated arc. This may be likely to reduce the lifespan of the DC relay and cause a safety accident.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Korean Registration Application No. 10-1696952 discloses a DC relay. Specifically, a DC relay having a structure capable of preventing movement of a movable contact using a plurality of permanent magnets is disclosed.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The DC relay having the structure can prevent the movement of the movable contact by using the plurality of permanent magnets, but there is a limitation in that any method for controlling a direction of an arc discharge path is not considered.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Korean Registration Application No. 10-1216824 discloses a DC relay.

The magnetic field may generate electromagnetic force, together with current flowing through fixed contactors and movable contactors. The electromagnetic force may be generated in a direction away from a center of the arc chamber.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Accordingly, a generated arc can be moved in the same direction as the electromagnetic force to be away from the center of the arc chamber. This can prevent the generated arc from being moved to a center region of the arc chamber.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, magnets disposed on surfaces facing each other may have the same polarity on sides thereof facing each other. Similarly, one side of another magnet that is disposed on another surface and faces the magnets may have the same polarity as that of the sides of the magnets facing each other.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">That is, the electromagnetic force generated in the vicinity of each fixed contactor may be produced in a direction away from the center region, irrespective of a current-flowing direction.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In another implementation, magnets disposed on surfaces facing each other may have the same polarity on sides thereof facing each other. One side of another magnet that is disposed on another surface and faces the magnets may have a different polarity from that of the sides of the magnets facing each other.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Accordingly, electromagnetic force generated in the vicinity of each fixed contactor may be produced in a direction away from the center region, irrespective of a current-flowing direction.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Also, as described above, the generated arc can be moved in the direction away from the center part of the arc chamber.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Accordingly, various components located at the center region can be prevented from being damaged due to the generated arc.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition, the generated arc can extend toward an outside of the fixed contactor, which is a wider space, other than toward the center of a magnet frame, which is a narrow space, i.e., toward a space between the fixed contactors.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Accordingly, the arc can be sufficiently extinguished while moving along a long path.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Also, the formed arc paths may extend in a direction away from each other. That is, the arc paths formed near fixed contacts may not extend toward each other.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Accordingly, the arcs flowing along the arc paths formed by the electromagnetic force may not overlap each other. This can minimize damages to the DC relay due to the generated arc.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">The arc path formation unit may include a plurality of magnets. The magnets may produce a main magnetic field with each other. Each magnet may produce a sub magnetic field by itself. The sub magnetic field can strengthen the main magnetic field.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">This can result in increasing strength of the electromagnetic force generated by the main magnetic field. Accordingly, an arc discharge path can be effectively formed.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Also, each magnet can generate the electromagnetic force in various directions simply by changing an arrangement method and a polarity. At this time, a magnet frame having the magnets does not have to be changed in structure and shape.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Therefore, an arc discharge direction can be easily changed even without excessively changing an entire structure of the arc path formation unit. This may result in improving user convenience.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a conceptual view illustrating movement paths on which an arc is generated in a DC relay according to the related art.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of a DC relay in accordance with an implementation.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the DC relay of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating the partially-open DC relay of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating the partially-open DC relay of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a conceptual view illustrating an arc path formation unit in accordance with one implementation.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a conceptual view illustrating an arc path formation unit in accordance with a modified example of the implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a conceptual view illustrating an arc path formation unit in accordance with another implementation.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a conceptual view illustrating an arc path formation unit to in accordance with a modified example of the implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a conceptual view illustrating an arc path formed by the arc path formation unit according to the implementation of (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a conceptual view illustrating an arc path formed by the arc path formation unit according to the implementation of (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a conceptual view illustrating an arc path formed by the arc path formation unit according to the implementation of (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a conceptual view illustrating an arc path formed by the arc path formation unit according to the implementation of (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a conceptual view illustrating an arc path formed by the arc path formation unit according to the implementation of (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a conceptual view illustrating an arc path formed by the arc path formation unit according to the implementation of (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a conceptual view illustrating an arc path formed by the arc path formation unit according to the implementation of (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a conceptual view illustrating an arc path formed by the arc path formation unit according to the implementation of (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0008" level="1">MODE FOR THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Hereinafter, an arc path formation unit <b>500</b>, <b>600</b> and a DC relay <b>10</b> including the same according to implementations of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">In the following description, descriptions of some components may be omitted to help understanding of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">1.
