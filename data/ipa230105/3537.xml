The voice guidance system includes a vehicle Ve and a voice guidance device <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The voice guidance device <b>1</b> moves with the vehicle Ve, and performs a route guidance mainly by voice so that the vehicle Ve travels along the route to be guided (also referred to as &#x201c;guide route&#x201d;). Incidentally, the &#x201c;route guidance mainly by voice&#x201d; refers to a route guidance in which the user can obtain information necessary for driving the vehicle Ve along the guide route at least from the voice only, and it does not intend to exclude that the voice guidance device <b>1</b> supplementarily displays the map around the current position. In this embodiment, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> outputs at least information relating to a point (also referred to as a &#x201c;guiding point&#x201d;) on a route where guidance is necessary by voice. Here, for example, the guiding point includes intersections with the right/left turn of the vehicle Ve, and other important passing points for the vehicle Ve to travel along the guide route. For example, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> performs voice guidance related to the guiding point, such as the distance from the vehicle Ve to the next guiding point and the traveling direction at the guiding point. Hereafter, the voice related to the guidance of the guidance route is also referred to as &#x201c;route voice guidance&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Incidentally, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> may be an on-vehicle device mounted or attached to the vehicle Ve, or may be a portable terminal to be brought and utilized in a vehicle such as a smartphone. In yet another example, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> may be incorporated into the vehicle Ve. The voice guidance device <b>1</b> is an example of an &#x201c;information processing device&#x201d;. Further, the vehicle Ve is an example of a &#x201c;mobile body&#x201d;.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Device Configuration</heading><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an example of a schematic configuration of a voice guidance device <b>1</b>. The voice guidance device <b>1</b> mainly includes a communication unit <b>11</b>, a storage unit <b>12</b>, an input unit <b>13</b>, a control unit <b>14</b>, a sensor group <b>15</b>, a display unit <b>16</b>, and a voice output unit <b>17</b>. Each element in the voice guidance device <b>1</b> is connected to each other via a bus line <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The communication unit <b>11</b> performs data communication with the other terminals based on the control of the control unit <b>14</b>. For example, the communication unit <b>11</b> may receive map data for updating the map DB (DataBase) <b>4</b> to be described later from a map management server (not shown).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The storage unit <b>12</b> is composed of various memories such as a RAM (Random Access Memory), a ROM (Read Only Memory), and a non-volatile memory (including a hard disk drive, a flash memory, and the like). The storage unit <b>12</b> stores a program for the voice guidance device <b>1</b> to execute a predetermined process. The above-described program may include an application program for performing the route guidance by voice, an application program for playing music, an application program for outputting content other than music (such as a TV), and the like. The storage unit <b>12</b> is also used as a work memory of the control unit <b>14</b>. The program to be executed by the voice guidance device <b>1</b> may be stored in a storage medium other than the storage unit <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further, the storage unit <b>12</b> stores the map DB <b>4</b>. The map DB <b>4</b> records various types of data required for the route guidance. The map DB <b>4</b> is a database that includes, for example, road data representing a road network by a combination of nodes and links, and facility data representing facilities that are candidates for a destination, stopover points, or landmarks. The map DB <b>4</b> may be updated based on the map information that the communication unit <b>11</b> receives from the map management server, under the control of the control unit <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The input unit <b>13</b> is a button, a touch panel, a remote controller, a voice input device, or the like for the user to operate. The display unit <b>16</b> is a display or the like for performing display under the control of the control unit <b>14</b>. The voice output unit <b>17</b> is a speaker or the like for outputting sound under the control of the control unit <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The sensor group <b>15</b> includes an external sensor <b>18</b> and an internal sensor <b>19</b>. The external sensor <b>18</b> may be one or more sensors for recognizing the surrounding environment of the vehicle Ve such as a camera, a lidar, a radar, an ultrasonic sensor, an infrared sensor, a sonar, and the like. The internal sensor <b>19</b> is a sensor for positioning the vehicle Ve, for example, a GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receiver, a gyroscopic sensor, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), a vehicle speed sensor, or a combination thereof. The sensor group <b>15</b> may have a sensor by which the control unit <b>14</b> can directly or indirectly (i.e., by performing the estimation process) derive the position of the vehicle Ve from the output of the sensor group <b>15</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The control unit <b>14</b> includes a CPU (Central Processing Unit), a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), and the like, and controls the entire voice guidance device <b>1</b>. For example, based on the output of one or more sensors of the sensor group <b>15</b>, the control unit <b>14</b> estimates the position of the vehicle Ve (including the direction of the traveling direction). Further, when the destination is designated by the input unit <b>13</b>, the control unit <b>14</b> generates a route information indicating a guide route to the destination, and performs the route guidance based on the route information, the position information of the estimated vehicle Ve, and the map DB <b>4</b>. In this case, the control unit <b>14</b> controls the voice output unit <b>17</b> to output the route voice guidance. Further, the control unit <b>14</b> controls the display unit <b>16</b> to display the information of the music being played, the video content, or as a map around the current position.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the above configuration, the input unit <b>13</b> is an example of a reception unit, and the control unit <b>14</b> is an example of a load determination unit.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Incidentally, the processing executed by the control unit <b>14</b> is not limited to be realized by software by a program, and it may be realized by any combination of hardware, firmware, and software. The process executed by the control unit <b>14</b> may be realized by an integrated circuit that can be programmed by the user, for example, a FPGA (field-programmable gate array) or a microcomputer. In this case, a program that the control unit <b>14</b> implements in this embodiment may be realized by the integrated circuit. Thus, the control unit <b>14</b> may be realized by hardware other than the processor.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The configuration of the voice guidance device <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is merely an example, and various changes may be made to the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. For example, instead of storing the map DB <b>4</b> in the storage unit <b>12</b>, the control unit <b>14</b> may receive information required for the route guidance through the communication unit <b>11</b> from the map management server (not shown). In another example, instead of providing the voice output unit <b>17</b>, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> may be connected, electrically or by known communication means, to a different voice output unit <b>17</b> which is configured separately from the voice guidance device <b>1</b>, and the different voice output unit <b>17</b> may output the sound. In this case, the different voice output unit <b>17</b> may be a speaker provided in the vehicle Ve. In yet another example, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> may not include a display unit <b>16</b>. In this case, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> may not perform any control relating to the display. Alternatively, by electrically connecting to the display unit provided in the vehicle Ve or the like by a wired or wireless connection, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> may make the display unit execute a predetermined display. Similarly, instead of including the sensor group <b>15</b>, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> may acquire information outputted by the sensors attached to the vehicle Ve from the vehicle Ve, based on a communication protocol such as CAN (Controller Area Network).</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Request for Information</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this embodiment, the user operates the input unit <b>13</b> to request information on the guide route. For example, the user presses a button constituting the input unit <b>13</b>, and then makes an information request by voice input. Incidentally, the &#x201c;user&#x201d; here may be a driver of the vehicle Ve, or may be a passenger. The information request is intended to request information on the guide route. Specifically, the information request includes &#x201c;actions to be performed next,&#x201d; &#x201c;schedule of arrival at the destination,&#x201d; and &#x201c;location of the destination.&#x201d; Incidentally, other information requests may be performed.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The voice guidance device <b>1</b> responds to the information request as described above by making the voice output of the guidance information from the voice output unit <b>17</b>. Here, in this embodiment, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> changes the amount of information of the guidance information to be outputted, in accordance with the driver's driving load at the time when the information request is made. Specifically, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> outputs only the basic information when the driver's driving load is large, and outputs additional information in addition to the basic information when the driver's driving load is small. This is because the amount of information should be minimized so as not to impair the driver's attention when the driving load is large. On the other hand, since there is room for the driver when the driving load is small, the additional information is provided. The contents of the basic information and the additional information depend on the contents of the information request by the user.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows examples of guidance information for a user's information request.

On the other hand, when the driving load is small, e.g., when the vehicle is parking outside the intersection or stopping, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> outputs the information of the next guiding point as the basic information, and further outputs the information of the further next (i.e., second) guiding point as the additional information. Incidentally, among the case where the driving load is large, when the vehicle has entered the intersection of the guiding point, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> outputs the information of the guiding point ahead (i.e., the second guiding point) as the basic information. That is, when the vehicle has already entered the intersection of the guiding point, since it is meaningless to output the information of the guiding point, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> outputs the information of the next guiding point as the basic information.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">(2) Schedule to Arrive at the Destination</heading><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The user's information request about the schedule to arrive at the destination is, for example, &#x201c;How long does it take to arrive?&#x201d; When the driving load is large, e.g., when the vehicle is traveling, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> outputs at least one of the remaining distance and the arrival time to the destination as the basic information, and does not output the additional information. On the other hand, when the driving load is small, e.g., when the vehicle is parking outside the intersection or stopping, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> outputs at least one of the remaining distance and the arrival time to the destination as the basic information, and further outputs information as to whether or not the toll road is used or the information of the next interchange (IC) as the additional information.</p><heading id="h-0017" level="1">(3) Location of Destination</heading><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The user's information request regarding the location of the destination is, for example, &#x201c;Which direction is the destination?&#x201d; or the like.

When the voice guidance device <b>1</b> acquires the information request of the user through the input unit <b>13</b> (Step S<b>11</b>), the voice guidance device <b>1</b> determines whether or not the information request is related to the location of the destination (Step S<b>12</b>).

Specifically, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> determines the driving load based on the traveling state, according to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Then, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> determines whether or not the driving load is large (step S<b>15</b>). If the driving load is large (step S<b>15</b>: Yes), the voice guidance device <b>1</b> outputs only the basic information (step S<b>17</b>). That is, if the information request relates to the next action to be taken, the voice guidance device <b>1</b> outputs only the next guiding point.
