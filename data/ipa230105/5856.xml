The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations), and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">As used herein, the term &#x201c;layer&#x201d; refers to a material portion including a region with a thickness. A layer can extend over the entirety of an underlying or overlying structure or may have an extent less than the extent of an underlying or overlying structure. Further, a layer can be a region of a homogeneous or inhomogeneous continuous structure that has a thickness less than the thickness of the continuous structure. For example, a layer can be located between any pair of horizontal planes between, or at, a top surface and a bottom surface of the continuous structure. A layer can extend horizontally, vertically, and/or along a tapered surface. A substrate can be a layer, can include one or more layers therein, and/or can have one or more layers thereupon, thereabove, and/or therebelow. A layer can include multiple layers. For example, an interconnect layer can include one or more conductors and contact layers (in which interconnect lines and/or vertical interconnect access (via) contacts are formed) and one or more dielectric layers.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">With the development of 3D memory devices, such as 3D NAND Flash memory devices, the more stacked layers (e.g., more word lines and the resulting more memory cells) require more peripheral circuits (and the components, e.g., transistors, forming the peripheral circuits) for operating the 3D memory devices. For example, the number and/or size of page buffers needs to increase to match the increased number of memory cells. In another example, the number of string drivers in the word line driver is proportional to the number of word lines in the 3D NAND Flash memory. Thus, the continuous increase of the word lines also increases the area occupied by the word line driver, as well as the complexity of metal routings, sometimes even the number of metal layers. Moreover, in some 3D memory devices in which the memory cell array and peripheral circuits are fabricated on different substrates and bonded together, the continuous increase of peripheral circuits' areas makes it the bottleneck for reducing the total chip size since the memory cell array can be scaled up vertically by increasing the number of levels instead of increasing the planar size.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Thus, it is desirable to reduce the planar areas occupied by the peripheral circuits of the 3D memory devices with the increased numbers of peripheral circuits and the transistors thereof. However, scaling down the transistor size of the peripheral circuits following the advanced complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology node trend used for the logic devices would cause a significant cost increase and higher leakage current, which are undesirable for memory devices. Moreover, because the 3D NAND Flash memory devices require a relatively high voltage (e.g., above 5 V) in certain memory operations, such as program and erase, unlike logic devices, which can reduce its working voltage as the CMOS technology node advances, the voltage provided to the memory peripheral circuits cannot be reduced. As a result, scaling down the memory peripheral circuit sizes by following the trend for advancing the CMOS technology nodes, like the normal logic devices, becomes infeasible.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">To address one or more of the aforementioned issues, the present disclosure introduces various solutions in which the peripheral circuits of a memory device are disposed in different planes (levels, tiers) in the vertical direction, i.e., stacked over one another, to reduce the planar chip size of the peripheral circuits, as well as the total chip size of the memory device. In some implementations, the memory cell array (e.g., NAND memory strings), the memory peripheral circuits provided with a relatively high voltage (e.g., above 5 V), and the memory peripheral circuits provided with a relatively low voltage (e.g., below 1.3 V) are disposed in different planes in the vertical direction, i.e., stacked over one another, to further reduce the chip size. The 3D memory device architectures and fabrication processes disclosed in the present disclosure can be easily scaled up vertically to stack more peripheral circuits in different planes to further reduce the chip size.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The peripheral circuits can be separated into different planes in the vertical direction based on different performance requirements, for example, the voltages applied to the transistors thereof, which affect the dimensions of the transistors (e.g., gate dielectric thickness), dimensions of the substrates in which the transistors are formed (e.g., substrate thickness), and thermal budgets (e.g., the interconnect material). Thus, peripheral circuits with different dimension requirements (e.g., gate dielectric thickness and substrate thickness) and thermal budgets can be fabricated in different processes to reduce the design and process constraints from each other, thereby improving the device performance and fabrication complexity.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to some aspects of the present disclosure, the memory cell array and various peripheral circuits with different performance and dimension requirements can be fabricated in parallel on different substrates and then stacked over one another using various joining technologies, such as hybrid bonding, transfer bonding, etc. As a result, the fabrication cycle of the memory device can be further reduced. Moreover, since the thermal budgets of the different devices become independent to each other, interconnect materials with desirable electric performance but low thermal budget, such as copper, can be used in interconnecting the memory cells and transistors of the peripheral circuits, thereby further improving the device performance. Bonding technologies can introduce additional benefits as well. In some implementations, hybrid bonding in a face-to-face manner achieves millions of parallel short interconnects between the bonded semiconductor structures to increase the throughput and input/output (I/O) speed of the memory devices. In some implementations, transfer bonding re-uses a single wafer to transfer thin semiconductor layers thereof onto different memory devices for forming transistors thereon, which can reduce the cost of the memory devices.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The 3D memory device architectures and fabrication processes disclosed in the present disclosure have the flexibility to allow various substrate materials suitable for different memory cell array designs, such as NAND memory strings suitable for gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) erase operations or P-type bulk erase operations. In some implementations, single crystalline silicon (a.k.a. single-crystal silicon or monocrystalline silicon) with superior carrier electronic properties&#x2014;the lack of grain boundaries allows better charge carrier flow and prevents electron recombination&#x2014;is used as the substrate material of the NAND memory string array to achieve faster memory operations. In some implementations, polysilicon (a.k.a. polycrystalline silicon) is used as the substrate material of the NAND memory string array for GIDL erase operations.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">The 3D memory device architectures and fabrication processes disclosed in the present disclosure also have the flexibility to allow various device pad-out schemes to meet different needs and different designs of the memory cell array. In some implementations, the pad-out interconnect layer is formed from the side of the semiconductor structure that has the peripheral circuits to shorten the interconnect distance between the pad-out interconnect layer and the transistors of the peripheral circuits to reduce the parasitic capacitance from the interconnects and improve the electric performance. In some implementations, the pad-out interconnect layer is formed on a thinned substrate in which the memory cell array is formed to enable inter-layer vias (LLVs, e.g., submicron-level) for pad-out interconnects with high I/O throughput and low fabrication complicity.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a schematic view of a cross-section of a 3D memory device <b>100</b>, according to some aspects of the present disclosure. 3D memory device <b>100</b> represents an example of a bonded chip.
