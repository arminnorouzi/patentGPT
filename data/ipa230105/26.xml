CA rooms typically include systems for monitoring and controlling temperature and atmospheric conditions (e.g. oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen levels) in a gastight space. The atmospheric control systems often operate by repeatedly sampling gas levels within the CA room and adding or removing gases to maintain the atmosphere at one or more desired set points.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to use as storage spaces, CA rooms can also be used in the preparation of plant products. For example, CA rooms in the form of greenhouses are used to germinate and cultivate many different varieties of plants, especially those not suitable for growth in a normal climate. Such specialized CA rooms are often used to maintain a compact growing area, preserve natural resources, minimize human resources, decrease crop loss from climate fluctuations and/or disease, etc. CA rooms are also used as dry rooms to cure certain foodstuffs, such as meats and cheeses, where the rate of moisture loss is important due to the drying process requiring the loss of free water from within the product. In particular, if available water is removed from a product too rapidly (e.g. from vapor pressure in the dry room being too low compared to a vapor pressure within the product), the outer layer of the product may become too dry, in turn reducing the rate at the moisture can leave the center of the product, or trapping moisture in the center of the product all together. As such, CA rooms provide a benefit over traditional dry rooms in terms of the selective atmospheric control offered, which allows for increased control in balancing the product vapor pressure and room vapor pressure and, ultimately, the rate at which moisture is removed from a product.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Unfortunately, conventional CA rooms are limited with regard to certain conditions that may be employed, especially in CA rooms equipped for housing live plants. For example, while ventilation systems including blowers and fans are frequently employed in CA rooms, and may provide negative pressure atmospheres, conventional CA rooms are not suitable to achieve low-pressure environments. This is not surprising, as controlled low-pressure (i.e., &#x201c;hypobaric&#x201d;) environments are not present in terrestrial ecosystems. In fact, most plants cannot survive in natural low-pressure environments, which only occur at high elevations (e.g. above &#x2dc;8,000 feet above sea level), as evidenced by the &#x201c;tree line&#x201d; found on many mountains or other raised landforms. Conventional CA are also not generally suitable for cultivating plants in a prolonged low-oxygen (i.e., &#x201c;hypoxic&#x201d;) environment. This is also not surprising, as although some CA rooms utilize temporary hypoxic conditions in sterilization protocols (e.g. to inhibit microbial growth), hypoxic and anoxic conditions are stressors known to inhibit critical plant functions such as nutrient and water uptake. Complicating matters further, it has been reported that a reduced partial pressure of oxygen (e.g. hypoxia) is a major contributor to plant stress in in hypobaric conditions.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method of preparing a flowering plant product in a hypobaric and hypoxic atmosphere (the &#x201c;preparation method&#x201d;) is provided. The preparation method includes providing a controlled atmosphere (CA) room, which defines an interior chamber containing a microclimate and has a microclimate control system operatively coupled thereto. The microclimate control system is configured to establish and maintain within the chamber a simulated high-altitude environment having an oxygen (O2) partial pressure of less than 20 kPa, and optionally an overall pressure of less than 97 kPa. The preparation method also includes disposing a flowering plant on a plant support structure within the chamber, and exposing the flowering plant to the simulated high-altitude environment.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The flowering plant product prepared by the preparation method may be a live flowering plant or a post-harvest product prepared from a flowering plant. For example, in some embodiments, a flowering plant seedling is disposed in the chamber and exposed to the simulated high-altitude environment during a growth phase, to provide a live flowering plant as the product. In particular embodiments, a harvested flowering plant, or a portion thereof, is disposed in the chamber and exposed to the simulated high-altitude environment during a drying phase. In specific embodiments, a dried harvested flowering plant is disposed in the chamber and exposed to the simulated high-altitude environment during a curing phase.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A simulated high-altitude controlled atmosphere (SHACA) room for cultivating and processing flowering plants in a hypobaric and hypoxic atmosphere is also provided, and may be utilized in the preparation method. The SHACA room includes a gastight enclosure defining a chamber, and a plant support structure disposed within the chamber for supporting a flowering plant. The SHACA room also includes a pump for changing and removing air from the chamber, a gas supply for selectively supplying nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and/or carbon dioxide (CO2) to the chamber, and an active microclimate control operatively coupled to the pump and the gas supply. The active microclimate control includes at least one sensor operable to sense microclimate conditions within the chamber, including the pressure, oxygen (O2) content, and carbon dioxide (CO2) content therein. The microclimate control also includes a controller, which is configured to establish and maintain a simulated high-altitude environment within the chamber, based at least in part on one or more sensed microclimate conditions provided by the at least one sensor. In particular, the simulated high-altitude environment comprises a nitrogen (N2) environment having an oxygen (O2) partial pressure of less than 20 kPa, and optionally an overall pressure of less than 97 kPa.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">These and other features and advantages of the present disclosure will become apparent from the following description of particular embodiments, when viewed in accordance with the accompanying drawings and appended claims.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Before the embodiments of the invention are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the details of operation or to the details of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings.

The microclimate control system is operable to establish and maintain within the chamber a simulated high-altitude environment having an oxygen (O2) partial pressure of less than 20 kPa, and optionally an overall pressure of less than 97 kPa. The preparation method also includes disposing a flowering plant on the plant support structure, and exposing the flowering plant to the simulated high-altitude environment within the chamber via the microclimate control system.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Flowering plants suitable for use in the preparation method are not particularly limited and may include, for example, plants of the genus <i>Cannabis</i>, including species of <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica</i>, and <i>Cannabis ruderalis</i>, as well as derivatives, variants, and combinations thereof. Other flowering plants may also be utilized, such as those from which one or more secondary metabolites may be extracted.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As will be appreciated from the description below, exposing the flowering plant to the particular high-altitude environmental conditions for a sufficient treatment period may be used to regulate or otherwise influence certain metabolic processes within the plant (i.e., as compared to a substantially similar flowering plant not exposed to the high-altitude environmental conditions), allowing for the preparation of flowering plant products in greater yields, shorter production periods, and/or with compositions not otherwise attainable via conventional preparation processes.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The preparation method utilizes a controlled atmosphere (CA) room and, in particular, a CA room configured to simulate a high-altitude atmosphere with respect to one or more particular environmental conditions (e.g. pressure, gas content, humidity, etc.). A particular such CA room, designated herein as a simulated high-altitude controlled atmosphere (SHACA) room, is provided and described further below as one aspect of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In particular, with reference to the Figures, where like numerals indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views, an exemplary SHACA room suitable for use in the preparation method is illustrated and generally designated at <b>10</b>. As shown in the exemplary embodiments, the SHACA room <b>10</b> includes an enclosure <b>12</b> that defines an interior chamber. The enclosure <b>12</b> is configured to be operable in an airtight configuration to increase the efficiency and control of the various systems described below. As such, while the enclosure <b>12</b> may comprise any number of ports or other openings, such openings are typically hermetically sealed, or sealable via a closure or covering, such as a door <b>14</b> as shown in the exemplary embodiments. The SHACA room <b>10</b> also includes a computer-controlled microclimate control system <b>16</b> (hereinafter, the &#x201c;control system <b>16</b>&#x201d;), which is connected to an input/output (I/O) device, such as a workstation or a tablet <b>18</b>, and is described in further detail below. In certain embodiments, the SHACA room <b>10</b> is but one room among a series of SHACA rooms of a facility (not shown). In such embodiments, each SHACA room <b>10</b> may be independently configured and controlled and thus include a unique enclosure <b>12</b>, microclimate control system <b>16</b>, etc. However, in some such embodiments, a central controller <b>20</b> may be utilized, e.g. to monitor the status of the individual SHACA rooms <b>10</b>, prioritize processing/utilization of contents from among the various SHACA rooms <b>10</b>, collectively control certain parameters of multiple SHACA rooms <b>10</b> or the facility as a whole, etc. In addition to the particular components, systems, and configurations described herein, the SHACA room <b>10</b> and certain components thereof (e.g. the enclosure <b>12</b>, the control system <b>16</b>, etc.) may include one or more of the systems and/or configurations disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,551,215, 10,143,210, and 10,184,580 to Schaefer et al., the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. Likewise, the SHACA room <b>10</b> may comprise other systems and components, such as a self-contained cooling and ventilation (HVAC) system including one or more air moving/circulation devices (e.g. fans, blowers, etc.), conduits (e.g. tubes, ducts, etc.), conditioners (e.g. humidifiers, dehumidifiers, heaters, coolers, etc.), filters (e.g. carbon filters, HEPA filters, etc.), sensors (e.g. sensors for odor, humidity, temperature, pressure, oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), ethylene, etc.), and/or a lighting system for artificial illumination including one or more lamps (e.g. grow lamps, UV lights, etc.), optionally coupled to a timer for operating the lamps in on/off cycles to simulate daylight hours.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The SHACA room <b>10</b> includes a plant support structure <b>22</b> (hereinafter, the &#x201c;support structure <b>22</b>&#x201d;) disposed within the chamber of the enclosure <b>12</b>. The support structure <b>22</b> is adapted for supporting a flowering plant, or a plurality of flowering plants, as shown and designated at <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>. The support structure <b>22</b> may include a table, rack, shelf, or combinations thereof, for example to support growing containers (e.g. pots, trays, troughs, etc.), drying containers (e.g. baskets, perforated bins, etc.), hangers, and the like. For example, in the exemplary embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, the support structure <b>22</b> is implemented as a tray or trough to support a growth media <b>26</b> (e.g. soil, water, etc.) in which the roots of the plants <b>24</b> are disposed. In these embodiments, the growth media <b>26</b> may be supplied to the support structure <b>22</b> from a media supply <b>28</b> (e.g. a tank, hose, reservoir, etc.), for example via hose or tubing <b>30</b>. As such, the support structure <b>22</b> may comprise, or be adapted for use with, a growth support or nutrient management system <b>32</b>, such as a hydroponic, aeroponic, and/or irrigation system. In other embodiments, such as those exemplified by the SHACA room <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the support structure <b>22</b> comprises a series of drying racks comprising vents or outlets <b>34</b> coupled to a blower <b>36</b> of an air circulation system <b>38</b>, as described in further detail below.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As introduced above, the SHACA room <b>10</b> includes the control system <b>16</b>. The control system <b>16</b> is adapted to control (i.e., establish, adjust, maintain, etc.) the atmosphere within the enclosure <b>12</b>, and is operable to simulate a high-altitude environment with respect to one or more particular conditions (e.g. pressure, gas content, etc.). In the illustrated embodiment, the control system <b>16</b> is adapted to adjust the overall pressure and the oxygen (O2) content (i.e., partial pressure of oxygen (pO2)) within the enclosure <b>12</b> to create a simulated high-altitude environment having an oxygen (O2) partial pressure of less than 20 kPa, and optionally an overall pressure of less than 97 kPa. As such, the control system <b>16</b> may include sensors, gas analyzers, scrubbers (e.g. a carbon dioxide (CO2) scrubber), and other components that allow for monitoring and adjusting the gas composition and pressure within the chamber of the enclosure <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the exemplary embodiments, the control system <b>16</b> includes a pump <b>40</b> for changing and removing air from the chamber of the enclosure <b>12</b>, a pressure sensor <b>42</b> for determining the air pressure in the chamber, and a controller <b>44</b> configured to control the overall pressure within the chamber, based at least in part on a sensed pressure provided by the pressure sensor <b>42</b>. The control system <b>16</b> also includes a gas supply <b>46</b> for supplying one or more gases to the enclosure <b>12</b>. In use, the controller <b>44</b> monitors the internal pressure within the chamber using the pressure sensor <b>42</b>. If the internal pressure greater than a designated value (e.g. greater than 97 kPa), the controller <b>44</b> operates the pump <b>40</b> to decrease the overall pressure within the enclosure <b>12</b> until the designated pressure value is achieved. Alternatively, if the internal pressure is less than a designated value, the controller <b>44</b> operates the gas supply <b>46</b> to introduce air into the chamber and increase the overall pressure within the enclosure <b>12</b> until the designated pressure value is achieved.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the control system <b>16</b> is operatively coupled to a gas manifold <b>48</b> for selectively distributing gases to the enclosure <b>12</b> from the gas supply <b>46</b>, which may include one or more sources of nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), or other gases (e.g. tanks, generators, etc.), in isolated (i.e., substantially pure/neat) or mixed form. The gas manifold <b>48</b> may be a generally conventional manifold, e.g. comprising a plurality of ports and a plurality of two-way solenoids to selectively allow nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), and/or carbon dioxide (CO2) to be supplied to the enclosure <b>12</b>. For example, a nitrogen (N2) source <b>50</b>, an oxygen (O2) source <b>52</b>, and a carbon dioxide (CO2) source <b>54</b> may be connected to three different ports on the gas manifold <b>48</b>, and a gas supply line <b>56</b> connected to a fourth port. The control system <b>16</b> may actuate any or all of the solenoids to connect the nitrogen (N2) source <b>50</b>, oxygen (O2) source <b>52</b>, and/or carbon dioxide (CO2) source <b>54</b> to the supply line <b>56</b>, thereby selectively supplying one or more of the gasses to the enclosure <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the control system <b>16</b> includes oxygen (O2) analyzer <b>58</b> and carbon dioxide (CO2) analyzer <b>60</b>, which are operable to determine the oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) content, respectively, of the air in the chamber of the enclosure <b>12</b>. As the enclosure <b>12</b> is typically under reduced pressure, the control system <b>16</b> may include a sampling pump <b>62</b> for moving a sample of air from within the chamber of the enclosure <b>12</b> to the analyzers <b>58</b>, <b>60</b> (e.g. when the analyzers are housed outside of the enclosure <b>12</b>). For example, a sample line <b>63</b> (e.g. poly tubing, copper tubing, etc.) is coupled between the enclosure <b>12</b> and the sampling pump <b>62</b>, which may be actuated by the controller <b>44</b> to provide a sample of air from the enclosure <b>12</b> to the analyzers <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>. While not shown, a return sample line may also be utilized, i.e., when desirable to return sampled air to the enclosure <b>12</b>. In use, the controller <b>44</b> monitors the oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) content of the air in the chamber of the enclosure <b>12</b> using the analyzers <b>58</b>, <b>60</b>. Alternatively, or additionally, stand-alone oxygen (O2) and/or carbon dioxide (CO2) sensors can be mounted inside chamber <b>12</b>, e.g. for real-time display of gas content within the chamber <b>12</b>, as shown generally at <b>43</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. If the content of one or both gasses is greater than a designated value (e.g. pO2 is greater than 20 kPa), the controller <b>44</b> may actuate one or more of the solenoids of the gas manifold <b>48</b>, e.g. to connect the nitrogen (N2) source <b>50</b> to the supply line <b>56</b> and thereby supply nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) gas into to the enclosure <b>12</b> to reduce the relative concentration of oxygen (O2) in the air therein.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the illustrated embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the control system <b>16</b> further includes a blower <b>37</b>, providing for additional control of the gas composition and pressure within the chamber of the enclosure <b>12</b>. In particular, the blower <b>37</b> is configured to selectively operate (i.e., when activated by the control system <b>16</b>, e.g. in response to one or more gasses approaching or reaching a designated setpoint) to remove air from the chamber. As such, it will be appreciated that the blower <b>37</b> may be implemented in conjunction with the blower <b>36</b> and/or pump <b>40</b>, as a replacement for pump <b>40</b>, in isolation (i.e., separate from the blower <b>36</b>, if present), etc. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the blower <b>37</b> may be implemented with a pressure relief system <b>39</b>, such as the system disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 10,184,580 to Schaefer et al. The pressure relief system <b>39</b> typically includes a relief valve (not shown) for selectively allowing atmospheric air from outside of the enclosure <b>12</b> to enter the chamber, and thus may include a filter <b>61</b>, e.g. to treat, filter, screen, and/or condition the atmospheric air prior to entering the chamber. In use, the controller <b>44</b> monitors the partial pressure and/or content of one or more gasses (e.g. oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), etc.) within the chamber using the sensor <b>43</b>, or one or more of the additional sensors/analyzers described above. If the sensed gas content/pressure is greater than, or approaching, a designated value, the controller <b>44</b> activates the blower <b>37</b> to decrease the overall pressure within the chamber of the enclosure <b>12</b>, which may be allowed to open the relief valve of the pressure relief system <b>39</b> to draw atmospheric air into the chamber and alter the gas composition thereof. In a particular application, the control system <b>16</b> may be operated in preparation for a human to enter and/or occupy the chamber of the enclosure <b>12</b>. In such instance, the blower <b>37</b> and pressure relief system <b>39</b> may be operated to alter the gas composition within the chamber (e.g. with respect carbon dioxide (CO2) content, oxygen (O2) content, etc.) to levels safe for human respiration and/or exposure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The control system <b>16</b> may also be adapted to adjust various other conditions within the enclosure <b>12</b> aside from pressure and gas content, such as temperature, moisture content (e.g. relative humidity), and light exposure, depending on the particular components and systems composing the SHACA room <b>10</b>. For example, in the exemplary embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the control system <b>16</b> includes a temperature sensor <b>64</b> and a temperature regulator <b>65</b>, which are each operatively coupled to the controller <b>44</b>. In such embodiments, the controller <b>44</b> monitors the temperature within the chamber of the enclosure <b>12</b> via the temperature sensor <b>64</b> and operates the temperature regulator (e.g. implemented as a heater and/or cooler) to establish and maintain a desired temperature within the enclosure <b>12</b>. The control system <b>16</b> also includes a moisture/humidity sensor <b>66</b> and an air conditioner <b>68</b>, which are also operatively coupled to the controller <b>44</b>. The controller <b>44</b> is thus also adapted to measure the moisture content (e.g. relative and/or absolute humidity) within the chamber via the moisture/humidity sensor <b>66</b>, and to operate the air conditioner <b>68</b> (e.g. implemented as a humidifier and/or a dehumidifier) to establish and maintain a desired moisture content within the enclosure <b>12</b>. The control system <b>16</b> also includes one or more lamps <b>70</b> (e.g. LED grow lights) and a light sensor <b>72</b> each operatively coupled to the controller <b>44</b>, which may be configured to operate the lamps <b>70</b> to provide light to the plants <b>24</b> at a particular level and/or over a given period of time. For example, the control system <b>16</b> may be adapted to operate the lamps <b>70</b> in an on/off cycle (i.e., a light/no-light cycle), to simulate day and night times, respectively. The control system <b>16</b> may also be adapted to provide an amount of light to the plants <b>24</b> based on a condition of the plants <b>24</b>, such as a plant maturity phase, growth time, growth start height (e.g. as measured for a seedling plant from the base of the growth media <b>26</b> to the top of the plant), seedling stress time, growth maturity height (e.g. as measured for a mature plant from the base of growth media <b>26</b> to the top of the plant), etc.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">While not shown, the various sensors described above may each independently be implemented as single point-sensors or as a plurality of sensors disposed in different portions around the chamber to monitor conditions throughout the enclosure <b>12</b>. Moreover, the various sensors described above (i.e., interior/internal sensors for sensing conditions within the enclosure <b>12</b>) may be paired with one or more external sensors, such as control sensor <b>74</b> shown generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, which are adapted to measure one or more conditions outside of the enclosure <b>12</b> (e.g. ambient conditions surrounding the SHACA room <b>10</b>). For example, while not shown, the SHACA room <b>10</b> may include a sampling enclosure adapted to preview the effects of changes in air composition (e.g. oxygen (O2) and/or carbon dioxide (CO2) levels), pressure, temperature, and/or relative humidity with regard to a particular process such as plant growth, drying rate, cure time, etc. An exemplary sampling enclosure <b>20</b> can be as described in U.S. Pat. No. 10,143,210 to Schaefer, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety, also available commercially as the SAFEPOD SYSTEM by Storage Control Systems, Inc. of Sparta, Mich. For example, the sampling enclosure may also be coupled to the control system <b>16</b>. In use, the sampling enclosure <b>20</b> is generally maintained in atmospheric communication with the chamber of the enclosure <b>12</b>, such that the sample lot shares environmental conditions with the chamber. At select times, the sampling enclosure is isolated from the chamber (e.g. via a control valve), and changes in environmental conditions are previewed on the sample lot.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The SHACA room <b>10</b> and the control system <b>16</b> may be adapted to maintain substantially homogenous conditions throughout the enclosure <b>12</b> or, alternatively, to achieve a gradient across portions of the chamber. For example, the control system <b>16</b> may be configured to establish a temperature and/or relative humidity gradient between a lower portion of the enclosure <b>12</b> (e.g. proximal the plants <b>24</b>) and the upper portion of the growth chamber (e.g. distal the plants <b>24</b>), such as when the SHACA room <b>10</b> is configured to maintain the plants <b>24</b> within a localized optimal temperature and/or relative humidity without particular regard to conditions elsewhere in the enclosure <b>12</b>. The control system <b>16</b> may comprise one or more fans, blowers, circulators, or other devices for homogenizing certain conditions within the enclosure <b>12</b>, establishing additional gradients therein, or simply to improve airflow within the chamber. For example, in the exemplary embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the vents <b>34</b> are disposed proximal the base of the plants <b>24</b> allowing for selective control of a localized temperature gradient, as well as for increased air circulation for improved drying, improved lateral plant stress to stimulate stalk fiber growth and reduce wilting, reduced mold/mildew growth, etc.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the illustrated embodiments described above, the controller <b>44</b> of the control system <b>16</b> is implemented as a single controller configured to integrate with the various systems and components of the SHACA room <b>10</b> (i.e., programmed to control operation of the SHACA room <b>10</b>, as well as to monitor and adjust for the pressure, gas content, etc. within the enclosure <b>12</b> via the control system <b>16</b>). However, the control functions of the SHACA room <b>10</b> and the control system <b>16</b> may be implemented using a single controller or a plurality of controllers. For example, control of the SHACA room <b>10</b> and the control system <b>16</b> may be distributed across a plurality of controllers, which may each operate independently of each other or be coupled for coordinated operation (e.g. by a communication bus or network). The controller <b>44</b> may be any microcontroller, or plurality of such controllers, capable of individually or collectively providing the functionality described herein. Particular example of a suitable controller include a SCS integrated controller available from Storage Control Systems, Inc. The controller <b>44</b> may be programmed to automatically adjust parameters of the control system <b>16</b> (e.g. in response to input data provided by one or more of the sensors) to accommodate changing conditions in the SHACA room <b>10</b>, the enclosure <b>12</b>, the facility, and the local climate surrounding the same. Moreover, the controller <b>44</b> may be programmed to vary conditions within the chamber of the enclosure <b>12</b> based on a growth phase of the plants <b>24</b> being utilized.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As introduced above, the preparation method includes exposing a flowering plant to the environment having an oxygen (O2) partial pressure of less than 20 kPa and, optionally, an overall pressure of less than 97 kPa, i.e., an atmosphere having hypoxic and optionally hypobaric conditions similar to that found at high altitudes (e.g. greater than 6,000, alternatively greater than 8,000 feet above sea level). These high-altitude conditions are utilized in the preparation method in combination with one or more environmental conditions, which are not naturally present at high altitudes. As such, the environment utilized in the preparation method (e.g. as established and maintained using the SHACA room <b>10</b> described above) may be designated or otherwise described as a simulated high-altitude environment.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In general, the simulated high-altitude environment is a nitrogen (N2) environment, i.e., comprises a predominant amount of nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) gas in the air. In certain embodiments, the simulated high-altitude environment comprises an overall pressure of from 20 to less than 97 kPa, such as from 20 to 90, alternatively from 20 to 80, alternatively from 20 to 70, alternatively from 20 to 60, alternatively from 20 to 50, alternatively from 30 to 50 kPa. In these or other embodiments, the simulated high-altitude environment comprises an oxygen (O2) partial pressure of from 5 to less than 20 kPa, such as from 5 to 15 kPa, alternatively of from 8 to 14 kPa, alternatively of from 10 to 14 kPa. It will be appreciated that the hypoxic conditions may be alternatively described in terms of oxygen (O2) content in the air, with the simulated high-altitude environment having an oxygen (O2) content of less than 21% (i.e., average ambient atmospheric oxygen (O2) content), alternatively less than 20%, alternatively less than 15%. In certain embodiments, the simulated high-altitude environment has an oxygen (O2) content of from greater than 0 to 20%, such as from 1 to less than 20, alternatively from 2 to less than 20, alternatively from 5 to less than 20, alternatively from 5 to 18, alternatively from 5 to 16, alternatively from 10 to 15%, based on total gas content in the air within the chamber. In these or other embodiments, the simulated high-altitude environment comprises a carbon dioxide (CO2) content of less than 3500 ppm, such as from 600 to 3000, alternatively from 600 to 2000, alternatively from 600 to 1500 ppm. In these or other embodiments, the simulated high-altitude environment comprises a relative humidity of from 40 to 80%, such as from 50 to 80, alternatively from 60 to 80, alternatively from 65 to 75%. In these or other embodiments, the simulated high-altitude environment comprises a temperature of from 10 to 30&#xb0; C., such as from 12 to 30, alternatively from 12 to 25, alternatively from 15 to 25, alternatively from 15 to 22&#xb0; C. As described above, the SHACA room <b>10</b> is configured to dynamically monitor and control the various conditions in the chamber of the enclosure <b>12</b> to establish and maintain the simulated high-altitude environment therein. As such, the values and ranges above may describe target values/set points or average values, and not absolute values during the duration of plant exposure.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The flowering plant may be exposed to the simulated high-altitude environment during any or all phases of cultivation, harvest, and post-harvest processing. For example, the preparation method may comprise exposing the flowering plant to the simulated high-altitude environment in a live immature form (e.g. in the form of a seed, seedling, cutting, etc.), a live mature form, a freshly-harvested form, a post-harvest partially processed form, or any combination thereof. As such, the preparation method may include germinating, growing, harvesting, drying, curing, and/or processing the flowering plant in the simulated high-altitude environment. Likewise, the flowering plant product prepared by the preparation may be a live flowering plant, a harvested flowering plant, or a processed form thereof. In particular embodiments, for example, the preparation method includes extracting one or more components from the flowering plant after the exposure to the simulated high-altitude environment, as described in additional detail below.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The treatment period during which the flowering plant is exposed to the simulated high-altitude environment is not particularly limited, and will be independently selected, for example, based on the type of plant utilized, the growth phase of the plant, a desired growth sequence to be carried out during the exposure, a desired processing step being carried out (e.g. drying, curing, etc.). Typically, the flowering plant is exposed to the simulated high-altitude environment for a treatment period of at least 24, alternatively at least 48, alternatively at least 72 hours. However, longer treatment periods may also be utilized, such as a period of from 5 days to 6 months, alternatively from 1 week to 3 months, alternatively from 10 days to 3 months, alternatively from 2 weeks to 2 months. In certain embodiments, the treatment period includes a growth phase of the plant, alternatively substantially all of a growth phase of the plant, alternatively most of a growth phase of the plant.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In certain embodiments, the simulated high-altitude environment is implemented in two or more sets of conditions, such as a day condition set and a night condition set, which may be alternatingly cycled, i.e., to simulate day and night. For example, the simulated high-altitude environment may include a day period (e.g. a period of light exposure, i.e., exposure to a light condition) of from 6 to 18 hours, such as from 8 to 16, alternatively from 8 to 14, alternatively from 8 to 12, alternatively from 10 to 12 consecutive hours in each 24 hour period, during which time the day condition set is implemented. In the remaining hours in the 24 hour period, the night condition set is implemented, e.g. exposing the plant to a no-light condition). For example, the day conditions may include constant or near constant light exposure and a temperature of from 12 to 30&#xb0; C., such as from 22 to 24&#xb0; C., and the night conditions may include no light exposure and a temperature of from 10 to 26&#xb0; C., such as from 16 to 20&#xb0; C. Additional condition sets corresponding to particular growth/processing phases of the flowering plant may also be utilized. For example, the relative humidity values above are typically utilized in a growth phase of the flowering plant, whereas a drying and/or curing processing phase will include minimal humidity as water is being removed from the flowering plant.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In particular embodiments, the method includes operating the grow light in an on/off cycle to selectively expose the flowering plant to the light and the no-light condition, respectively, during a single cycle period. The on/off cycle may include any number of cycle periods, such as at least 1, alternatively at least 7, alternatively at least 28, alternatively at least 84, alternatively at least 168 cycle periods, with each including at least one of the light conditions and one of the no-light conditions. In some embodiments, the number of cycle periods is selected based on the flowering plant utilized. For example, the number of cycle periods may be selected to cycle the growth lights for an entire growth phase of the plant. While a cycle period of 24 hours (e.g. to simulate a single day), in certain embodiments a cycle period less than 24 hours may be utilized. For example, the method may include cycling the growth lights on and off over a cycle period of less than 24 hours, such as from 16 to less than 24, alternatively from 16 to 22, alternatively from 18 to 22, alternatively of 20 hours. In such embodiments, the day period may be the same as described above, e.g. from 6 to 18 hours, with the higher end of the range selected only when the cycle period is greater than 18 hours total (i.e., such that a night period may still be included). In particular embodiments, the method includes exposing the flowering plant to the light condition for a consecutive period of from 8 to 14 hours, alternatively from 8 to 12, alternatively from 9 to 12, alternatively from 10 to 12, alternatively from 10 to 11, alternatively of 10 hours, in a cycle period of 20 hours.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The preparation method may be utilized to prepare a flowering plant having an increased content of one or more secondary metabolites compared to a substantially similar flowering plant not exposed to the simulated high-altitude environment. For example, exposing the flowering plant to the simulated high-altitude environment may stimulate, upregulate, or otherwise increase the bioproduction of a secondary metabolite by the flowering plant, or suppress, downregulate, or otherwise decrease the bioproduction of other compounds within the plant to increase the relative proportion of the secondary metabolite. Examples of such secondary metabolites include terpenes and terpenoids, phenolics, glycosides, alkaloids, polyketides, flavonoids, as well as hybrids thereof. For example, in embodiments where a flowering plant the genus <i>Cannabis </i>(i.e., a &#x201c;<i>Cannabis </i>plant&#x201d;) is utilized, the preparation method may include increasing the bioproduction of a phytocannabinoid, such as cannabidiol (CBD), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabinol (CBN), tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), cannabicyclol (CBL), cannabivarin (CBV), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), cannabidivarin (CBDV), cannabichromevarin (CBCV), cannabigerovarin (CBGV), cannabigerol monomethyl ether (CBGM), cannabielsoin (CBE), cannabicitran (CBT), or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">As will be appreciated from the description above, depending on the materials, equipment, and parameters employed, the preparation method provides for numerous advantageous over conventional plant growing/cultivation methods, such as increased bioproduction and/or relative concentration of one or more plant secondary metabolites, increased plant vigor, increased/improved crop yield (e.g. by biomass), increased growth rates, improved pest control and/or reduced pesticide requirements, and reduced nutrient requirements. The preparation method may also provide numerous advantageous over conventional processing methods (e.g. post-harvest processing methods), including faster drying times, more efficient/homogenous drying, reduced spoliation, reduced cure times, and even reduced need for cure (e.g. due to increased bioproduction and/or relative concentration of one or more target plant secondary metabolites, decreased production of undesired secondary metabolites, increased oxidation and/or degradation of certain compounds in the plant, etc.). Moreover, the preparation method may be utilized to both cultivate and process (e.g. post-harvesting) a flowering plant to prepare one or more products therefrom, and thus further provides for increased efficiency and decreased labor, energy, and storage needs over conventional pre- and post-harvesting production methods. In certain embodiments, the method prepares a plant at an increased mass as compared to conventional cultivation techniques.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">It will be appreciated that particular low-oxygen levels, e.g. for preparing and/or facilitating the simulated high-altitude environment, may be selected based on a natural locations of varying altitudes and oxygen levels.

A fluorescent T5 grow light is utilized in conjunction with a Clone X nutrient solution (Hydrodynamics International, Lansing Mich., USA) to grow roots within 2 weeks.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0048">Vegetative Stage: After 2 weeks in the humidity dome, the root cubes are placed into a 1-gallon pot of Dairy Doo organic soil to grow into bigger plants. LED lights are timed using a KiloWatch control system to create 18 hours on/6 hours off light cycle. As the plants grow, 9LB plants were up-potted again into 7-gallon fabric pots. The vegetative stage lasts 4 weeks.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0049">Flowering Stage: After the plants grow to a desirable size, the light cycle is changed to 12 hours on/12 hours off to induce flower and/or bud production. As the use of the organic soil makes the plant less dependent on constant nutrient feed, drip feed was used to water the plants, and a flower boost is fed to each plant weekly. The flowering stage lasts &#x2dc;60 days.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0050">Harvest: After flowering until maturity, each plant is harvested via being chopped from the base and hung upside down to dry. Maturity is determined by evaluating trichome production on the buds. After most of the trichomes are milky and at least 50% amber in color (e.g. via visual inspection), the plants are concluded to be finished/mature. After a plant is harvested, it begins to release CO2. Wet whole-plant mass is recorded at this stage.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0051">Dry: Each plant is hung in a dry room to dry for 7 days with venting to remove CO2 production from the harvested plants during drying. After the 7 days, the buds are ready to be trimmed. Dry whole-plant mass is recorded at this stage.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0052">Trim: Each bud cluster is cut and trimmed from the whole plant and placed into a labeled plastic bin. Dry trimmed bud weight is recorded at this stage.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0053">Cure: Each bin of trimmed buds is placed and kept in a dark, humidity-controlled chamber to allow for further off-gassing (e.g. CO2 release) and cure.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 1 and Comparative Example 1</heading><p id="p-0057" num="0054">Two growth cycles are performed using the controlled atmosphere room, according to General Procedure 1 as outlined above, to give plant products of Example 1 and Comparative Example 1. More specifically, Comparative Example 1 is carried out using ambient oxygen levels (i.e., &#x2dc;21% O2) during the flowering stage of the plant, and Example 1 is carried out at the same stage of plant cultivation but with decreased O2 levels (e.g. i.e., &#x3c;21% O2, via displacement of oxygen from the room).
