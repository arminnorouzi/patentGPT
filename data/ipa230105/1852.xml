whole, a car provided with two front wheels <b>2</b> and two rear drive wheels <b>3</b>, which receive the torque from a an electric motor <b>4</b> arranged in a rear position. The car <b>1</b> is provided with a passenger compartment <b>5</b> which is designed to house the driver and possible passengers. In other embodiments, the electric motor <b>4</b> can obviously be arranged in a front position.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the car <b>1</b> comprises an acoustic system <b>6</b>, which has the function of generating a sound through the electric motor <b>4</b>, so that the sound perceived by the people seating in the passenger compartment <b>5</b> of the car <b>1</b> is &#x201c;pleasant&#x201d;, namely corresponds to the desires/expectations of the occupants of the passenger compartment <b>5</b> of the car <b>1</b>, and/or is useful while driving in order to understand the conditions of the motor.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The acoustic system <b>6</b> comprises at least one reproduction device <b>7</b>, which generates the sound that can be associated with the electric motor <b>4</b> and diffuses the sound itself towards the passenger compartment <b>5</b> and/or out of the vehicle <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Therefore, the acoustic system <b>6</b> comprises the electric motor <b>4</b>, which is mechanically connected to the reproduction device <b>7</b> so as to be able to excite a resonant frequency thereof.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Furthermore, the acoustic system <b>6</b> comprises a control unit <b>8</b> configured to control the electric motor <b>4</b> so as to inject at least one sonority current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS </sub>(direct and in quadrature) or voltage V<sub>qS</sub>, V<sub>dS </sub>(hereinafter also simply referred to as sonority signal, for the sake of brevity), as an input, into the electric motor <b>4</b> (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). In particular, the sonority signal (namely, the sonority current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS</sub>) excites a frequency, which determines a vibration of the reproduction device <b>7</b>, which emits, due to the vibration, in the form of acoustic waves, a sound S as a function of the injected sonority current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS </sub>or voltage V<sub>qS</sub>, V<sub>dS</sub>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In particular, the generated sound can be associated with the electric motor <b>4</b>. More in particular, the generated sound S is such that it can be perceived from the outside and from the inside of the vehicle <b>1</b> as deriving from the dynamics of the electric motor <b>4</b> (so as to recall the sensation generated by the dynamics of an internal combustion engine).</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The features indicated below relating to the sonority current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS </sub>also apply to the sonority voltage V<sub>qS</sub>, V<sub>dS</sub>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In particular, the reproduction device <b>7</b> is determined by a mechanical resonant element <b>9</b>, preferably already present on board the road vehicle <b>1</b>. More in particular, the mechanical resonant element <b>9</b> is any element of an electric transmission comprising the electric motor <b>4</b>, namely mechanically connected to the stator of the electric motor <b>4</b> or the stator itself. For example, the mechanical element <b>9</b> is an axle, a gearbox, a differential, a rim of a wheel, a lid of a cable raceway, a support, a plug of an axle, a fixing bar, etcetera. In this way, no additional components have to be installed.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Advantageously, though not necessarily, the resonant element <b>9</b> is a metal element.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Is some non-limiting cases, the resonant element <b>9</b> is an element made of a plastic or composite material.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the non-limiting embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b> or <b>2</b></figref>, the electric motor <b>4</b> is configured to cause the rotation of the rear drive wheels <b>3</b>. In other non-limiting cases, the vehicle <b>1</b> comprises two electric motors <b>4</b>, one for each drive wheel.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In other non-limiting embodiments, the motor <b>4</b> is an additional motor added to the one needed to move the road vehicle <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Advantageously, though not necessarily, therefore, the control unit <b>8</b> injects, simultaneously with the sonority current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS</sub>, a current I<sub>qT</sub>, I<sub>dT </sub>of movement (namely, the reference currents shown in the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), which determines the rotation of a rotor <b>10</b> of the electric motor <b>4</b> and, hence, of the drive wheels <b>3</b> connected thereto, thus controlling the movement of the vehicle <b>1</b>. Alternatively, the control unit <b>8</b> injects, simultaneously with the sonority voltage V<sub>qS</sub>, V<sub>dS</sub>, a voltage V<sub>qT</sub>, V<sub>dT </sub>of movement (namely, the reference voltages shown downstream of a PI controller, for example a proportional-integral controller, in the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), which determines the rotation of the rotor <b>10</b> of the electric motor <b>4</b> and, hence, of the drive wheels <b>3</b> connected thereto, thus controlling the movement of the vehicle <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to some preferred, though non-limiting embodiments, the sonority current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS </sub>has a frequency such that it does not interact with a magnetic flux of the electric motor <b>4</b>, thereby avoiding generating movements of the rotor <b>10</b> and, hence, of the drive wheels <b>3</b>. In this way, the injection of the harmonics of current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS </sub>that give a sound contribution is independent of the speed of the motor <b>4</b>. In other words, the control unit <b>8</b> is capable of controlling the electric motor <b>4</b> so as to emit the sound S even when the motor <b>4</b> is still or the rotor <b>10</b> has a constant speed. Therefore, in these cases, the injection of the sonority current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS </sub>added to (overlapping) the current I<sub>qT</sub>, I<sub>dT </sub>of movement only allows the electric machine to make a sound, without determining movements or error in the movement of the road vehicle <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to some non-limiting embodiments, the sonority current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS </sub>comprises (is) a harmonic signal with a square waveform or with a non-sinusoidal form.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to other preferred non-limiting embodiments, the sonority current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS </sub>comprises (is) a sinusoidal harmonic signal. In particular, the sinusoidal form of the harmonic current signal provides the resonant element <b>9</b> with a greater resonance stimulus, allowing, at the same time, the sound S to gain a better quality compared to harmonics with a square waveform.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Advantageously, though not necessarily, the sonority current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS </sub>comprises a plurality of harmonics with different order and/or amplitude and/or frequency. In this way, a polyphonic sound S can be generated, determining the vibration of different resonant elements <b>9</b>. In particular, by injecting sonority currents I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS </sub>in a plurality of harmonics of different order, it is possible to excite the resonant frequencies of different elements <b>9</b>, which, by vibrating, generate different sounds S (in particular, notes). By so doing, chords can be generated, thus enriching the sounds S. Hence, in other words, the control unit <b>8</b>, through the electric motor <b>4</b>, is capable of exciting different orders overlapping different harmonics within the sonority signals I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS</sub>, thus obtaining a polyphony. Therefore, the vehicle <b>1</b> is able to generate, through the motor <b>4</b>, multi-frequency/multi-amplitude signals, which simultaneously excite different orders of harmonics.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">According t some preferred non-limiting embodiments, the control unit <b>8</b> is configured to vary the sonority current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS </sub>as a function of vehicular conditions, for example road roughness and/or open or closed sunroof. In other words, the control unit <b>8</b> is configured to change the order, the amplitude or the frequency of the harmonic of the sonority current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS</sub>, emitting a different sound as the conditions of the vehicle change.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to a possible embodiment, the control unit <b>8</b> is configured to vary the sonority current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS </sub>as a function of driving parameters.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some non-limiting cases, the control unit <b>8</b> is configured to detect the driving style of a driver according to known techniques, which, therefore, are not discussed in detail below; in particular, the control unit <b>8</b> is configured to vary the sonority signal I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS </sub>as a function of the driving style of the driver.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In particular, as a function of the aforesaid driving parameters or vehicular conditions, the sonority signals can be varied so as to best adjust the sound reproduction that can be associated with the electric motor <b>4</b> to the driving situation themselves. For instance, the sonority signal could change as a function of the engaged gear (lower gears correspond to a more intense and low-frequency sound that can be associated with the electric motor <b>4</b>), the position of the accelerator pedal (the more the accelerator pedal is pressed, the more intense the sound that can associated with the electric motor <b>4</b> is), the driving mode chosen through the suitable selector (commonly called &#x201c;hand lever&#x201d;, a sports/racing driving mode corresponding to a more intense sound that can be associated with the electric motor <b>4</b>), the position of a possible sunroof (the sound that can be associated with motor <b>4</b> is more intense when the sunroof is open), the first time derivative of the speed of rotation of the electric motor <b>4</b> (the sound that can be associated with the electric motor <b>4</b> becomes more intense as the derivative increases).</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Advantageously, though not necessarily, the sonority current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS </sub>is configured to excite the reproduction device <b>7</b> to generate an increasing or decreasing sonic ramp. In particular, the sonic ramp is adjusted as a function at least of the acceleration of the road vehicle. In this way, in accordance with the acceleration, the sound S is more intense and acute as the acceleration of the vehicle increases, and vice versa.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some non-limiting cases, the control unit <b>8</b> is configured to stimulate the resonances of the element <b>9</b> through the direct sonority component I<sub>qS</sub>. Alternatively or in addition, the control unit <b>8</b> is configured to select the order within the structural resonance.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for the realization of a sound S that can be associated with an electric motor <b>4</b> in the road vehicle <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In particular, the method comprises the steps of:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0041">injecting the sonority current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS</sub>, as an input, into the electric motor; wherein the sonority current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS</sub>, excites a frequency resulting in a vibration the mechanical resonant element <b>9</b> already present on board the road vehicle; wherein the resonant element <b>9</b> emits, due to the vibration, in the form of acoustic waves, a sound S as a function of the injected sonority current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS</sub>.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0042" num="0042">Furthermore, the method preferably entails preliminarily defining (in a designing phase) the resonance orders of the components of the electric transmission system, so as to accordingly calculate the orders of the harmonics that, through resonance, can emit given notes, exciting, through vibration, the aforesaid components.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0043">In particular, the harmonic order needed to emit a given sound S depends on the type of electric motor and on the structure connected to the latter (for example, the electric transmission system).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0044">Advantageously, though not necessarily, the method further entails experimentally carrying out a &#x201c;tuning&#x201d; of the sonority current I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS </sub>so as to centre the resonance bands as a function of the electric transmission system.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0045">In particular, to sum up, the control unit <b>8</b> is configured to control (for example, by means of a known inverter) the electric motor <b>4</b> so as to apply voltages at the ends of the inverter, which generate sinusoidal current forms according to the description above. More in particular, sinusoidal harmonics are caused to overlap the currents I<sub>qT</sub>, I<sub>dT </sub>of movement and said sinusoidal harmonics excite the structural resonances of the electric transmission system or of the electric motor <b>4</b> itself. Said harmonics are further modulated in amplitude and frequency to generate the sound S. Preferably, these harmonics have a frequency such that they do not interact with a magnetic flux of the electric motor <b>4</b>, thus being filtered by the latter. In particular, said harmonics belong to a different order than the harmonics of movement.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0046">The non-limiting embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic representation of the control diagram used to control the electric motor <b>4</b> so as to emit the sound S.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0047">In particular, a sonority generation block FGS adds, to the currents I<sub>qT</sub>, I<sub>dT </sub>of movement, the sonority currents I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS </sub>inputted to a proportional-integral controller PI, which processes the voltage signals V<sub>d</sub>, V<sub>q </sub>(direct and in quadrature), which are total voltage signals (or, in some embodiments, signals of sole movement). In any case, the sonority voltage signals V<sub>dS</sub>, V<sub>qS </sub>are added to the signals of movement and are subsequently sent to the electric motor <b>4</b> according to a known diagram, which is partly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, wherein PT and IPT indicate Park transform and the inverse transform thereof, respectively, CT indicates Clarke transform, RES indicates a resolver and, therefore, &#x3b8; indicates the position of the rotor. In particular, block SVM indicates an example of modulation, in this case the space vector modulation (namely, the known algorithm used to control the PWM of an electric motor), which receives, as an input, a reference V<sub>DC </sub>for the modulated discretization of the input signal. Finally, the feedback currents I<sub>dM</sub>, I<sub>qM </sub>indicate the measured stator currents.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0048">Advantageously, though not necessarily, as the speeds of the rotor <b>10</b> of the electric motor <b>4</b> change, the orders of the harmonics used for the sonority currents I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS </sub>change as well (namely, are changed by the control unit <b>8</b>). In particular, though not in a limiting manner, as the speed of the rotor <b>10</b> of the electric motor <b>4</b> increases, the orders of the harmonics used for the sonority currents I<sub>qS</sub>, I<sub>dS </sub>decrease and/or vice versa. In this way, the quality of the sound emitted by the resonant element <b>9</b> is better, avoiding disturbances relating to the speed of the motor <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows examples of the results obtained by the vehicle or by the method according to the invention.
