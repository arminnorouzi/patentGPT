For example, it may be difficult for a user to identify a desired content item using a keyword because many content items, including both the desired content item and undesired content items, may share or otherwise be associated with the same keyword.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application describes an improved system and method for searching for content items in an application executing on or otherwise associated with a computing device. In order to increase the efficiency of the search, the present disclosure provides a refiner that is used to filter or otherwise refine search results. The refiner is user-specific and/or tenant/entity-specific. The refiner may be based on long-term aggregated data and/or contextual information associated with the user of the computing device.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, the present application describes a method for filtering search results. In an example, the method includes receiving a search term from a computing device and performing a search using the search term to identify search results. The search results may include one or more content items. A refiner from a plurality of user-specific refiners is identified. In an example, the refiner is identified, based at least in part, on contextual information associated with a user that provided the search term to the computing device. The search results and the refiner are provided to the computing device. When the refiner is selected, the search results are filtered using the refiner and the filtered search results are provided to the computing device.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present application also describes a system that includes processor and a memory coupled to the processor and storing instructions that, when executed by the processor, perform operations. In an example, the operations include analyzing content of content items associated with a user and generating a plurality of user-specific refiners based, at least in part, on the analyzing. A search term, provided in a user interface of an electronic messaging application, is received and used to identify search results. A refiner from the plurality of user-specific refiners is identified. The refiner and the search results are provided to the user interface of the electronic messaging application.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also described is a method for refining search results. In an example the method includes receiving a search term in a user interface of an electronic messaging application and identifying search results based, at least in part, on the search term. A topic-based refiner is identified from a plurality of user-specific topic-based refiners. In an example, the topic-based refiner is identified based, at least in part, on contextual information associated with a user. Search results and the topic-based refiner are provided in the user interface of the electronic messaging application. Based on receiving a selection of the topic-based refiner, the search results are filtered.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

These aspects may be combined, other aspects may be utilized, and structural changes may be made without departing from the present disclosure. Examples may be practiced as methods, systems, or devices. Accordingly, examples may take the form of a hardware implementation, an entirely software implementation, or an implementation combining software and hardware aspects. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present disclosure is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The present application describes the generation, identification, and/or use of a refiner that enables a user to conduct efficient searches for content items that are stored in a data storage system. The data storage system may be a local data storage system or a remote data storage system. The content items and the refiners described herein may be used across or otherwise be associated with a number of different applications and/or platforms. For example, the content item may be a message, for example, an email message, in a messaging application, for example, an email application, and the refiner may be associated with a topic of the message. In another example, the content item may be a document in a collaborative workspace environment and the refiner may be associated with an individual that created the document or most recently edited the document.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As indicated above, the refiner enables more efficient searches for content items to be conducted when compared with a simple keyword search. For example, when searching for an email message in an email application, a user typically provides a search term in a user interface and subsequently scrolls through a list of search results to find the specific message she is looking for. This is time consuming and can be frustrating for the user.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In order to address the above, the present application describes the generation, identification, and use of refiners. Refiners may be used to filter search results that are received by a computing device in response to the user submitting a search query.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Continuing with the example above, when searching for an email message in an email application, the user provides a search term in a user interface and receives a number of search results and one or more refiners. In this example, each refiner is associated with a particular topic. A topic may be identified based on subject matter contained within or otherwise associated with the search results. For example, rather than mining each email in the search results for keywords or key phrases, the system described herein analyzes the content of the emails (and/or other content items) the user interacts with over a period of time to identify subject matter and/or topics that are significant to the user. Once the topics are identified, topic-based refiners are generated and may be associated with various emails and other content items. Thus, when search results are received, the search results, along with any associated topic-based refiners, may be provided to the user.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Upon selection of one of the provided refiners, the search results are filtered such that only email messages that are associated with the topic are provided in the user interface. In an example, the one or more refiners may be arranged in a hierarchy. Thus, in response to a selection of a first refiner associated with the first topic, additional refiners associated with sub-topics of the first topic (or topics associated with the first topic) may be provided in the user interface. Selection of one of the additional refiners may further filter the search results. Although the example above discloses use of topic refiners, other refiners may be used. These include, but are not limited to, dynamically determined time/date refiners, dynamically determined person/people refiners, and/or dynamically determined keyword refiners.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The refiners that are generated, identified, and/or used may be specific to a particular user. For example, in the case of topic refiners, topics may be generated, determined, and/or identified using long-term aggregated data based off a semantic model associated with a particular user. Thus, topics that are truly significant to the user may be identified. In another example, a refiner may be associated with a particular entity. For example, the entity may provide a service and/or products. In such an example, a keyword or phrase may identify the service and/or products and a refiner may be associated with the keyword or phrase and/or generated using the keyword or phrase.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In yet another example, recent interactions between the user and one or more content items may be identified. The topic of the content item(s) may be identified or determined and subsequently used to determine a topic that is currently (or recently) relevant to the user.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a plurality of technical benefits including but not limited to: generating and ranking multiple refiners for a search query, leveraging a wide range of knowledge during a query to understand topics and/or people that are currently relevant to a particular user, providing improved search results using various machine learning or artificial intelligence systems that understand and learn what a user is interested in and/or working on based on historical, recent, and/or current interactions with various content items, and using user responses to improve refiner selection and generation, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">These and other examples will be described in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates an example system <b>100</b> for refining search results according to an example. The system <b>100</b> may be used to generate, identify, and/or use one or more refiners to filter search results of a search query. The system <b>100</b> may generate, identify, and/or use a number of different types of refiners&#x2014;either alone or in combination, to filter search results. For example, the refiners may include topic refiners, keyword refiners, people refiners, and property refiners. Likewise, the received query, and subsequent search results, may be associated with various content items (e.g., email messages, text messages, posts, documents, audio and/or video files, meeting requests, and images). Additionally, the search request may be provided in and/or across any number of different applications such as, for example, email applications, collaborative workspace environments, productivity applications, and the like.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The system <b>100</b> generates, identifies, and uses refiners that are specific to a particular user. In an example, a user of a computing device <b>110</b> may create, interact with, or otherwise be associated with a number of different content items. For example, the user may receive various email messages via an email application, may post and/or interact with particular content on social networking application, may collaborate on a document or file with other individuals via a collaborative workspace environment, may set up meetings with various individuals and/or be notified about events via a calendaring application, or may send and/or receive messages via a messaging application. As the user interacts with the various content items described above, the system may generate candidate refiners. The candidate refiners may subsequently be used to filter search results that are received by the computing device <b>110</b> in response to the user of the computing device <b>110</b> submitting a search query (e.g., search query <b>175</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>)).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each candidate refiner may be based on content provided in or otherwise associated with a content item <b>115</b>.

In another example, the content item <b>115</b> may be a document, a file, a post, an image, and/or an audio/video file that is received and/or accessed by the computing device <b>110</b>. In an example, the content item <b>115</b> may be accessed by the computing device <b>110</b> via a collaborative workspace environment or a social media application or site.

The analysis system <b>155</b> analyzes content contained in each content item <b>115</b>. In an example, the analysis system <b>155</b> analyzes content of the content item <b>115</b> when a content item <b>115</b> is received by the computing device <b>110</b>. For example, the content item <b>115</b> may be an email received or sent by the computing device <b>110</b> via an email application. As the email is sent and/or received by the computing device <b>110</b>, the analysis system <b>155</b> analyzes the content of the email in order to learn the subject matter, topics, projects, people, etc., the user of the computing device <b>110</b> is involved in and/or interacting with.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As part of the analysis, the analysis system <b>155</b> may extract or otherwise identify one or more keywords or phrases associated with the content item <b>155</b>.

For example, the analysis system <b>155</b> may utilize data (collected over a period of time) from a semantic model to determine the meaning of content in various content items <b>115</b> and/or to determine relationships between various content items. The analysis system <b>155</b> may periodically, continuously, or substantially continuously analyze various content items <b>115</b> to help ensure the search refiner system <b>135</b> is consistently learning the topics, projects, people, etc., the user is interacting with.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In another example, the analysis system <b>155</b> may identify metadata associated with the content item <b>115</b>. The metadata may include a content item identifier (e.g., email identifier or conversation identifier), a message sender identifier, a message recipient identifier, a content item identifier, date and/or time information, a content creator identifier, message status indicators (read/unread, high importance), message attachment indicators, and so on. The metadata may also be used to determine the various projects, topics, people, etc. the user of the computing device <b>110</b> is engaged with/in.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In an example, the metadata may be combined or otherwise associated with the projects, topics, and/or people the user interacts with. Thus, metadata may be used to dynamically generate and/or identify one or more refiners to be displayed with search results. For example, if the user performs a search in an email application for a particular individual (e.g., John Jones), the analysis system <b>155</b> may determine that emails to and/or from John Jones typically include attachments. The analysis system <b>155</b> may also determine that emails to and/or from John Jones include content that is related to or is otherwise wise associated with a particular project (e.g., Project X). Accordingly, the refiners that are ultimately presented to the user (discussed in more detail below) may include a &#x201c;Has Attachment&#x201d; refiner and/or a &#x201c;Project X&#x201d; refiner.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Continuing with the example above, the metadata may also include information that emails to and/or from John Jones, typically include John Stewart and/or occurred during a particular time frame (e.g., June 2021). Accordingly, a &#x201c;John Stewart&#x201d; refiner and/or a &#x201c;June 2021&#x201d; may be provided to the user via the user interface along with the &#x201c;Has Attachment&#x201d; refiner and/or the &#x201c;Project X&#x201d; refiner.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The search refiner system <b>135</b> may also include a content tagging system <b>160</b>. The content tagging system <b>160</b> may tag the various content items <b>115</b> with identifiers based on the analysis performed by the analysis system <b>155</b>. For example, if the analysis system <b>155</b> determines that a topic of a particular content item <b>115</b> relates to Project X, the content tagging system <b>160</b> may tag the content item with a &#x201c;Project X&#x201d; topic tag. In another example, the content tagging system <b>160</b> may determine that the content of a content item <b>155</b> relates to patents associated with Project X. Accordingly, the content item <b>115</b> may be tagged with a &#x201c;patents&#x201d; tag, a &#x201c;Project X&#x201d; tag, or a &#x201c;Project X patents&#x201d; tag.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another example, if the analysis system <b>155</b> determines that a particular content item <b>115</b> was sent or created by a particular individual (e.g., John Jones), the content tagging system <b>160</b> may tag that content item <b>115</b> with a people/person tag that identifies the particular individual. In an example, a content item <b>115</b> may have a single tag or multiple tags.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In another example, a content item <b>115</b> may be associated with a keyword <b>130</b>. The keyword <b>130</b> may be generated or otherwise identified by the analysis system <b>155</b>. For example, the analysis system <b>155</b> may analyze the content item <b>115</b> and identify, based on the content in the content item <b>115</b>, a keyword or keywords that are associated with the content item <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In another example, the computing device <b>110</b> and/or the search refiner system <b>135</b> may be associated with a particular entity <b>125</b>. For example, a user of the computing device <b>110</b> may be an employee of the entity <b>125</b>. The entity <b>125</b> may offer particular goods and/or services and the keyword <b>130</b> may identify those goods and/or services.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, the analysis system <b>155</b> may identify the keywords <b>130</b> associated with the entity <b>125</b> and/or receive the various keywords <b>130</b> from the entity <b>125</b>. The analysis system <b>155</b> and/or the content tagging system <b>160</b> may use the keywords <b>130</b> as part of the analysis and/or tagging process described above. Accordingly, the search refiner system <b>135</b> may generate the candidate list of user-specific refiners, entity-specific refiners, or a combination thereof using the various tags and keywords <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For example, as content items <b>115</b> are analyzed and tagged, a refiner generation system <b>140</b> may generate a list of candidate refiners. Each refiner in the list of candidate refiners may include or otherwise be associated with information and/or metadata that is used to identify the refiner and/or used to determine how the refiner would filter search results should the refiner be selected. The information may include the subject matter and/or topic associated with the refiner, a person identified by the refiner, a date or range of dates associated with the refiner, an entity associated with the refiner, and so on.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">However, as additional content items <b>115</b> are received, the refiner generation system <b>140</b>, using various machine learning algorithms and/or artificial intelligence, may update (e.g., add, delete, modify) the various refiners (and the information/metadata associated with the various refiners) based on metadata, analyzed content of content items, and/or tags associated with the content items. Thus, the search refiner system <b>135</b> may dynamically determine the most up-to-date topics, people, projects, etc., the user of the computing device <b>110</b> is working on or is otherwise associated with.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The search refiner system <b>135</b> may also include an action system <b>165</b>. The action system <b>165</b> may receive contextual information (represented as actions <b>170</b>) associated with the user of the computing device <b>110</b>. The actions <b>170</b> may include interactions between the user and a content item <b>115</b>. The interactions may be reading a content item <b>115</b>, opening a content item <b>115</b>, deleting a content item <b>115</b>, editing a content item <b>115</b>, selecting at least a portion of a content item <b>115</b>, creating a content item <b>115</b>, and so on. The actions <b>170</b> may be used to provide additional information on the content items <b>115</b>, topics, people, etc., that are relevant to the user of the computing device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, as the actions <b>170</b> are received by the action system <b>165</b>, the action system <b>165</b> may identify or otherwise provide context associated with the action <b>170</b> and the content item <b>115</b>. This information may then be provided to the refiner generation system <b>140</b> which may generate, edit, and/or update the user-specific refiners, the entity-specific refiners, or a combination of user-specific and entity-specific refiners.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an example, the search refiner system <b>135</b> may also include a refiner selection system <b>145</b>. The refiner selection system <b>145</b> may select one or more refiners based on a rank or score associated with each of the candidate refiners. In an example, the candidate refiners may be ranked and presented to a user based on a ranking algorithm or process. For example, the ranking algorithm determine contextual information associated with a refiner (described in more detail below) and provide a score to the refiner based on the contextual information. The scores of each of the refiners may be compared against each other to determine the rank.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The score and/or the rank of each refiner may be dynamic. Additionally, the score and/or the rank of each refiner may be associated with a particular user and/or a particular search term. For example, a first user may be associated with a first set of ranked refiners while a second user may be associated with a second, different set of ranked refiners. In another example, a first set of search results may be associated with a first set of refiners while a second set of search results may be associated with a second, different set of ranked refiners. As such, each user that accesses the search refiner system <b>135</b> can be presented with the most relevant and/or useful candidate refiners with minimal effort.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an example, the ranking algorithm may consider various factors when determining a rank or score of a refiner. For example, the factors to be considered may include one or more of: top ranked content items (e.g., top ranked emails, messages, documents), a date and/or timestamp associated with the content item, relevance of a content item with respect to a particular keyword or topic, past engagements with a particular refiner, a recency of engagement, type of engagement with respect to different types of refiners (e.g., topic refiners or people refiners), people associated or involved with the content item, a number of times the particular content items have been revisited, additional content items associated with the content item (e.g., whether an email includes an attachment), and so on.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In other examples, the factors that may be considered when ranking the refiners may include a frequency of use of a refiner, a frequency of a keyword associated with a refiner, a frequency of topics/content in a content item, information gain, query types (e.g., whether the query is for a topic, a person, or an entity), entropy minimization, statistical information, and so on. In an example, the ranking of each refiner may be dynamically updated in real-time or substantially real-time based, at least in part, on identified actions <b>170</b>. Additionally, the ranking of each refiner may be updated in real-time or substantially real-time based on received search queries <b>175</b> and/or user selection such as will be described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The search refiner system <b>135</b> may also include a storage system <b>150</b>. The storage system <b>150</b> may store various content items <b>115</b>, the candidate refiners and/or the rank of each candidate refiner. As content items <b>115</b> are created, received, edited, opened, or otherwise interacted with, the storage system <b>150</b> may store any associated updates to the content items <b>115</b>. Likewise, the storage system <b>150</b> may update the list of candidate refiners and/or the rank of each candidate refiner.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates the example system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> in which a search query <b>175</b> is provided to the search refiner system <b>135</b> according to an example. The search query <b>175</b> may be a query for one or more content items <b>115</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) stored by the storage system <b>150</b> of the search refiner system <b>135</b>. Although the storage system <b>150</b> is shown as being part of the search refiner system <b>125</b>, the storage system <b>150</b> may be a remote storage system (e.g., a cloud storage system) or a local storage system (e.g., a storage system of the computing device <b>110</b>).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">To initiate a search, the user of the computing device <b>110</b> may provide a search term for a particular content item <b>115</b> in a user interface of the computing device <b>110</b>. For example, the user may provide a search term in order to locate an email in a messaging application. Accordingly, the user may access a user interface of the messaging application (e.g., the user interface <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>)) and provide the search query <b>175</b>. Upon receipt of the search query <b>175</b>, the computing device <b>110</b> provides the search query <b>175</b>, via the network <b>120</b>, to the search refiner system <b>135</b>. In an example, the search query <b>175</b> is a keyword, a phrase, a person, a topic, a title, a time and/or date, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Upon the receipt of the search query <b>175</b>, the search refiner system <b>135</b> may identify and return one or more results <b>180</b>. In an example, the results <b>180</b> may be identified based on matching the keyword of the search query <b>175</b> with the same or a similar keyword contained in or otherwise associated with the content item <b>115</b>. Although a specific example has been given, the results <b>180</b> may be identified using other techniques.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The content items contained in the results <b>180</b> may be ranked. In an example, the content items in the results <b>180</b> may be ranked based on a time and/or date associated with the content item. For example, if the search query <b>175</b> includes a keyword search for a particular email, the emails in the results <b>180</b> may be ranked and/or presented in a user interface of the computing device <b>110</b> based on when the user received the email. In another example, if the search query <b>175</b> is a search for a particular document in a collaborative workspace environment, the documents in the results <b>180</b> may ranked and/or presented to the user based on when the user last accessed the document (e.g., the document the user accessed most recently would be presented first).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In another example, the content items in the results <b>180</b> may be ranked based on a determined relevance of the content items with respect to the search query <b>175</b>. For example, when the search query <b>175</b> is received, the analysis system <b>155</b> may use various machine learning algorithms or artificial intelligence to identify content items that include content that is related to or otherwise associated with the search query <b>175</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition to returning the results <b>180</b>, the search refiner system <b>135</b> may also return a refiner <b>185</b> to the computing device <b>110</b>. The refiner <b>185</b> may be selected by the refiner selection system <b>145</b> and may be based on what the search refiner system <b>135</b> knows about the user of the computing device <b>110</b>. For example, the returned refiner <b>185</b> may be dynamically identified based on topics that are relevant to the user, documents that are relevant to the user, people that the user interacts with, projects that the user is involved with, dates of interactions with particular content items, projects and/or individuals, and so on. This information may be collected over a long period of time or recent interactions such as described above.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, the action system <b>165</b> may track or otherwise receive information corresponding to the user's interactions with various content items. As such, the action system <b>165</b>, either alone or in combination with the analysis system <b>155</b>, may determine what topics, documents, people, and/or projects are currently relevant to the user. The interactions may range from recent interactions (e.g., within the last thirty seconds) to historical interactions (e.g., within the last thirty days).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Continuing with the example above, if the user interacts with a particular content item that is identified as being related to or otherwise corresponding to a particular topic (e.g., patents), a refiner <b>185</b> that corresponds to patents, or is otherwise related to patents, may be identified. In another example, if the user had a meeting with a particular individual (e.g., John Jones) about a particular project (e.g., Project X), the name of the individual and/or the name of the particular project may be identified as a refiner <b>185</b>. In yet another example, a refiner <b>185</b> may be selected by the refiner selection system <b>145</b> based on a determined similarity between tags associated with the content items in the results <b>180</b> and information and/or metadata (e.g., a name, topic, subject matter, date, etc.) associated with a refiner. In another example, a refiner <b>185</b> may be selected by the refiner selection system <b>145</b> based on a determined similarity between tags associated with the content items in the results <b>180</b> and the keywords in the search query <b>175</b>. In another example, the refiner <b>185</b> may be selected based on the keyword <b>130</b> associated with the entity <b>125</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Candidate refiners may be generated by the refiner generation system <b>140</b> based on content items <b>115</b> the user of the computing device <b>110</b> has interacted with. As such, the refiner selection system <b>145</b> may select one or more refiners <b>185</b> based on a determined similarity score between one or more candidate refiners and the content of the content items associated with the results <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In an example, the refiner selection system <b>145</b> may identify a number of different candidate refiners that are associated with the results <b>180</b>. The refiner selection system <b>145</b> may then select a predetermined number of refiners to provide to the computing device <b>110</b> along with the results <b>180</b>. The predetermined number may be based on user preference, type of computing device, or size of the user interface provided on the computing device <b>110</b>. For example, the user may indicate that she wants to see three to five refiners <b>185</b> when results <b>180</b> are received. In another example, the search refiner system <b>135</b> may determine (based on information provided by the computing device <b>110</b>) that the user interface of the computing device has a limited amount of space to display multiple refiners <b>185</b>. Accordingly, the refiner selection system <b>145</b> may select two refiners <b>185</b> to display in the user interface.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another example, the refiner generation system <b>140</b>, either alone or in combination with the various other systems, may determine that additional refiners should be generated and provided to the computing device <b>110</b> based on a received search query <b>175</b>. For example, the refiner selection system <b>145</b> may determine that some or all available candidate refiners <b>185</b> will not provide desired coverage and/or diversity to meet required or recommended coverage and/or diversity thresholds with respect to the search query <b>175</b>. Accordingly, the refiner generation system <b>140</b> may dynamically generate new candidate refiners and provide the candidate refiners to the refiner selection system <b>145</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As indicated above, each candidate refiner may be dynamically ranked based on contextual information associated with the user, the results <b>180</b>, the search query <b>175</b> and/or topics, people, time/date information, and so on. In another example, the ranking may be based on an information gain associated with each refiner <b>185</b>. The information gain may be analyzed in view of the user of the computing device <b>110</b>, the search query <b>175</b>, and/or the results <b>180</b>. In an example, refiners <b>185</b> with a higher information gain may be ranked higher than refiners with a lower information gain.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">As used herein, information gain is a difference in entropy between a feature that is being used and one that is not. In this example, the feature is a refiner. As such, the information gain of a particular refiner or various candidate refiners measure the entropy difference before and after refinement. For example, a refiner with a high information gain is one that splits the results <b>180</b> into two different sets. For example, a topic refiner may split the results <b>180</b> into a first set (e.g., a set in which content items relate to or are otherwise associated with the topic) and a second set (e.g., a set in which content items do not relate to or are not otherwise associated with the topic).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In an example, the information gain may be associated with an information gain threshold. For example, in order for a refiner to be ranked or otherwise selected for a particular search query <b>175</b>, the information gain may need to be over a threshold. The information gain threshold may be based on the number of results <b>180</b>. For example, if the results <b>180</b> include twenty content items, the information gain threshold may be one in which seven to ten content items would be filtered out from the results <b>180</b> should the refiner be applied to the results <b>180</b>. Although specific numbers have been specified, this is for example purposes only. In an example, the information gain may be one in which an optimal point or range of points in a parabolic curve is detected.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In another example, the ranking of the refiner <b>185</b> may be based on whether the search query <b>175</b> is a topic-based query or a person-based query. For example, a person-based query may be weighted more heavily when compared to a topic-based query. As such, a refiner <b>185</b> associated with a person may be ranked higher than a refiner <b>185</b> associated with a topic.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In another example, past behavior of the user may influence the ranking of a refiner <b>185</b>. For example, the refiner selection system <b>145</b> and/or the action system <b>165</b> may track the number of times a particular refiner <b>185</b> has been selected by the user of the computing device <b>110</b>. This ranking may also be associated with the search query <b>175</b>. For example, the user may select a particular refiner or set of refiners when a first search query is executed and select a second, different refiner or set of refiners when a second, different search query is executed. In another example, a similarity score between the content of the content items in the results <b>180</b> and the content/topic of the refiner <b>185</b> may influence the ranking of refiners <b>185</b>. Although specific examples are given, the refiner selection system <b>145</b> may use various machine learning algorithms and/or artificial intelligence to determine and/or update the ranking of the various refiners.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In yet another example, a refiner <b>185</b> may be selected and/or ranked based on a determined coverage of the refiner <b>185</b> and/or a diversity of a refiner <b>185</b>. The refiner selection system <b>145</b> may help ensure that the suggested refiners <b>185</b> (e.g., the highest ranked refiners of the candidate refiners) cover a diverse set of results. For example, the refiner selection system <b>145</b>, either alone or in combination with the analysis system <b>155</b>, may analyze content items in the results <b>180</b> in view of a first refiner and a second refiner to help ensure that there is little to no overlap of content items associated with each refiner.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, the results <b>180</b> may include twenty content items that are associated with the search query <b>175</b>. In this example, the first refiner may identify fifteen content items as being relevant to the user. Likewise, the second refiner may identify thirteen content items as being relevant to the user. Additionally, of the fifteen content items identified by the first refiner as being relevant to the user and the thirteen content items identified by the second refiner as being relevant to the user, ten content items may overlap (e.g., the same ten content items are included in the fifteen content items identified by the first refiner and in the thirteen content items identified by the second refiner). As such, the diversity of content items provided by the first refiner and the second refiner may not exceed a diversity threshold. Accordingly, the refiner selection system <b>145</b> would provide only one of the first refiner or the second refiner to the computing device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In another example, a coverage of identified refiners may be required to exceed a coverage threshold. For example, the identified refiners should cover as may content items as possible to help ensure that content items that are original to the search query <b>175</b> are not discarded. For example, the results <b>180</b> may include twenty content items that are associated with the search query <b>175</b>. In this example, selection of a first refiner may cause eight content items to be filtered from the results <b>180</b> while leaving twelve content items remaining. Likewise, selection of a second refiner may cause the twelve content items to be filtered from the results <b>180</b> while the other eight content items remain. Thus, although content items are filtered out based on the selection of either the first refiner or the second refiner, all of the content items associated with the original search query <b>175</b> are represented by either the first refiner or the second refiner.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Although specific examples are given, the coverage may be associated with a particular coverage threshold. For example, if twenty content items are included in the results <b>180</b>, eighteen of the results may need to be represented by any combination of refiners (e.g., a first refiner is associated with six results, a second refiner is associated with five results and a third refiner is associated with seven results).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In an example, the refiner selection system <b>145</b>, either alone or in combination with the analysis system <b>155</b>, may use machine learning algorithms and/or artificial intelligence to determine the coverage associated with the various refiners <b>185</b> with respect to the results <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, once the refiners are ranked and the highest ranked refiners are provided to the computing device <b>110</b>, the user may select one or more refiners (shown as refiner selection <b>190</b>). Upon selection of the refiner, the refiner may be appended to or otherwise associated with the initial search query <b>175</b> and a filtered set of content items (represented as filtered results <b>195</b>) is provided to the computing device <b>110</b>. Although the filtered results <b>195</b> are shown as being provided by the search refiner system <b>135</b>, the computing device <b>110</b> may be configured to locally filter the content items that are part of the results <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates an example user interface <b>200</b> of a messaging application that may use a refiner to filter search results <b>220</b> according to an example.

The method <b>300</b> may be executed by a search refiner system, or various systems of a search refiner system such as, for example, the search refiner system <b>135</b> shown and described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">Method <b>300</b> begins when the search refiner system monitors (<b>310</b>) user interactions with various content items. The monitored interactions may include receipt of a content item, creation of a content item, editing a content item, and so on.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Based on the monitored interaction, the search refiner system may generate (<b>320</b>) one or more candidate refiners. The candidate refiners may be generated based on analyzing content and/or data provided in or otherwise associated with the content items. For example, a refiner may be generated based on a topic associated with a content item. In another example, a refiner may be generated based on a creator or sender of a content item. In yet another example, a refiner may be generated based on a date and/or timestamp associated with the content item. In another example, a refiner may be generated based on one or more keywords associated with an entity.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The search refiner system may receive (<b>330</b>) a search request. The search request may include a keyword that identifies one or more content items. In response to receiving the search request, one or more search results may be identified (<b>340</b>). The search results may be identified based on a similarity between the keyword and the content of the various content items.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In addition to identifying search results, the search refiner system identifies (<b>350</b>) one or more refiners that may be used to filter the identified search results. In an example, the one or more refiners are identified from the generated refiners from operation <b>320</b>. The identified refiners may be ranked based at least in part, on various factors. These factors may include, one or more of the following: one or more keywords in the search request, the content of content items provided in the search results, metadata associated with the content items in the search results, historical user interaction with content items, historical user interaction with one or more refiners, a determined information gain (e.g., whether an information gain threshold has been met or exceeded), a determined diversity threshold, a determined coverage threshold, and so on.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">Once the refiners are identified, the search refiner system may rank (<b>360</b>) the identified refiners. In an example, the identifiers may be ranked using contextual information and/or history-based information/features. For example, identifiers that may be associated with the context of the search results may be ranked higher than those that are not associated with the context of the search results. In another example, refiners that have been previously selected in other search queries/results may be ranked higher than other refiners that have not been selected or have not been recently selected. In some examples, the ranking of the refiners may be updated in real-time or substantially real-time. For example, as refiners are selected (e.g., such as in operation <b>380</b> below), the ranking of refiners may be updated to reflect recent selections/input. Accordingly, the search refiner system may dynamically determine what content items are relevant to a user at a given time.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">The ranked refiners, along with the search results, are provided (<b>370</b>) to a user interface of a computing device. Once the refiners are provided to the user interface, the search refiner system may receive (<b>380</b>) a user selection of the one or more of the refiners. In response to receiving the selection, the search results may be filtered (<b>390</b>) using the refiner. In an example, the search results are filtered by appending the refiner to the search term that was provided in the search request.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a system diagram of a computing device <b>400</b> according to an example.
