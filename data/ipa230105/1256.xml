In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure such that one skilled in the art will be enabled to make and use the present invention. It may be evident, however, that the present disclosure may be practiced without some of these specific details. For the purpose of clarity, technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the present invention has not been described in detail so that the present invention is not unnecessarily obscured.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Broadly, an exercise device in accordance with the present invention may include: a base, an extension tube, and a connecting assembly. The extension tube is pivotally connected to the base at an attachment point and configured to connect to weightlifting equipment at an end of the extension tube opposite the attachment point. The extension tube defines a longitudinal axis. The connecting assembly forms the attachment point and has a first connecting member coupled to the base and a second connecting member coupled to the extension tube. The connecting assembly permits 360-degree rotation of the extension tube relative to the longitudinal axis. In other words, the connecting assembly has three rotational degrees of freedom between its connected components. In certain embodiments, the connecting assembly is a ball joint assembly.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present invention solves rehab movement problems with proper training movement. Embodiments of the present invention allow for 360-degree bar movement, safer benching, pressing, squatting, deadlifting, and most other functional movements. Machine movements allow for the freedom and feel of Olympic or CrossFit weight training. It is safe to use for all ages and in any physical condition.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, a modular exercise device and system (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>9</b></figref>) is disclosed. The subject of the present disclosure is a connecting assembly <b>100</b>. By way of example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the connecting assembly <b>100</b> couples exercise equipment <b>300</b> to a base <b>200</b> (e.g., an exercise equipment wall mount). The exercise equipment may be embodied in various forms, with an extension tube operably coupling the connecting assembly <b>100</b> to interchangeable exercise components (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>9</b></figref> for exemplary configurations). In certain embodiments, the exercise components may include a weight bar and a handlebar and/or shoulder support, but those with skill in the art will appreciate that the present invention offers countless exercise types with varying structures.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the connecting assembly <b>100</b> is generally embodied as a ball joint assembly that permits a wider range of motion for exercise equipment than previously possible. Various lateral and vertical movements can be safely achieved with the present invention, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>9</b></figref> and described in greater detail below. The present invention allows for unrestricted 360-degree swivel rotation/movement. To achieve this functionality, the connecting assembly <b>100</b> generally includes a ball joint linkage <b>110</b>, a ball joint <b>120</b>, and a ball joint arm <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The ball joint linkage <b>110</b> functions as a housing for the ball joint <b>120</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;linkage&#x201d; is to be understood by its plain and ordinary meaning. Specifically, &#x201c;linkage&#x201d; refers to a component that connects one part with another. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the linkage <b>110</b> has a pair of openings <b>111</b> to permit swiveling action (described in greater detail below). The linkage <b>110</b> defines a central opening <b>112</b> with a ball joint ledge <b>113</b> to receive and engage the ball joint <b>120</b>. Laterally spaced from the ball joint ledge is a capture plate ledge <b>114</b> for engaging a capture plate <b>130</b> when the ball joint <b>120</b> is inserted in the ball joint linkage <b>110</b>. The capture plate <b>130</b> defines a plurality of holes that align with a plurality of holes in the ball joint linkage <b>110</b>, with fasteners <b>132</b> extending therethrough to couple the plate <b>130</b> to the linkage <b>110</b>. The capture plate <b>130</b> also has a central aperture <b>133</b> through which the ball joint arm <b>140</b> extends.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the ball joint <b>120</b> may include a socket <b>121</b> that rotatably receives a ball <b>122</b>. In certain embodiments, the ball <b>122</b> may define a ball joint arm hole <b>140</b> for receiving the ball joint arm <b>140</b>. In certain embodiments, the ball <b>122</b> and ball joint arm <b>140</b> may be integrally formed. The ball joint <b>120</b> facilitates the aforementioned 360-degree swivel action of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The ball joint arm <b>140</b> is generally elongated in form, with one side engaging or integral with the ball <b>122</b>, and an opposite side defining a ball joint arm opening <b>141</b>. The ball joint arm <b>140</b> functions as a bar adapter to connect to, as mentioned above, various types of exercise equipment. As those with skill in the art will appreciate, the opening <b>141</b> may be used in conjunction with a pin-type connector to detachably couple the connecting assembly <b>100</b> to the exercise equipment to quickly switch between exercises.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, when assembled, the ball joint <b>120</b> nests within the central opening <b>112</b> and the capture plate <b>130</b> abuts the capture plate ledge <b>114</b> and an outer edge of the ball joint <b>120</b>, with the ball joint arm extending therefrom, to form a compact connecting assembly <b>100</b>. The ball <b>122</b> permits unrestricted swiveling (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>8</b></figref>) and twisting (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) movement of the ball joint arm <b>140</b> and, consequently, the exercise equipment coupled thereto. Thus, three degrees of rotational freedom (i.e., twisting about a Z-axis, and rotation about X and Y axes) is achieved between the ball joint arm <b>140</b> and the ball joint linkage <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">To further increase the versatility of the present invention, the ball joint linkage <b>110</b> may be rotatably mounted to the base <b>200</b>. This can be achieved in various ways. In the illustrated embodiment, fasteners <b>150</b> are threaded into the openings <b>111</b> of the ball joint linkage <b>110</b>, with a base bracket <b>210</b> clamped between the fastener <b>150</b> and the ball joint linkage <b>110</b>. The tightness of the fasteners <b>150</b> can be adjusted to increase or decrease resistance to rotation of the ball joint linkage <b>1110</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Several examples of exercises are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, but additional configurations are within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, first exercise equipment <b>300</b> may be used in a substantially vertical movement. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, second exercise equipment <b>400</b> may be used that incorporates vertical and horizontal movement. Likewise, third exercise equipment <b>500</b> may incorporate similar directional movement, as demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, but with different exercise/weight equipment used. Fourth exercise equipment <b>600</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, may be utilized like the previously described embodiments. As a final example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates fifth exercise equipment <b>700</b> that employs the torsional aspect of the connecting assembly, as denoted by the clockwise and counterclockwise directional arrows. In all of these configurations, the ball joint linkage <b>110</b> can also rotate (in the illustrated embodiments, about a horizontal axis), further increasing the range of motion. Thus, multiple exercise types with varying starting and finishing positions can be achieved with a single device.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The modular components of the present invention can be assembled in a variety of ways to allow the user to perform different exercises including, but not limited to: front squat, squat clean, squat snatch, military, standing and bench presses. Embodiments of the present invention also allow for any pulls like deadlift, high pulls, power clean and more. The present invention may be used as a home, garage gym, or in a commercial gym. Due to its configuration, it can easily be transported and provides a safe way to use free weights.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The ball joint employed advantageously gives a user more freedom in movement than previously possible. Because of the horizontal movement allowed by the ball joint, if a person cannot lift the weight because muscles have become fatigued, the T-bar can be dumped to either side of the user to keep the bar from crashing onto the user. Thus, safety while exercising is improved upon compared to a conventionally hinged apparatus.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">While methods of making the present invention would be readily apparent from the foregoing disclosure and the figures, a further may include the following. The connecting assembly may be formed, for example, via machining. Certain components, such as the ball joint and the ball joint arm, are commodity items that are required from respective manufacturers, provided that they have the proper specifications to operate in the manner described.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">While one or more preferred embodiments are disclosed, many other implementations will occur to one of ordinary skill in the art and are all within the scope of the invention. Each of the various embodiments described above may be combined with other described embodiments in order to provide multiple features.
