The gasification process uses a catalyst that allows the conversion of coke into by-products of higher added value (hydrogen-rich syngas).</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention also relates to the process of obtaining said catalyst to be applied in the catalytic conversion process of petroleum coke and to the catalyst itself.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF THE ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is common knowledge that oil is largely responsible for the industrial development of the early 19<sup>th </sup>century, being the main source of energy on the planet until the present day. The fact that it is an exhaustible resource, allied to its important economic value, makes this fuel an element that causes major geopolitical and socioeconomic changes around the world.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, it is possible to describe petroleum as an oily and flammable substance, found underground at various depths. It consists mainly of a complex combination of hydrocarbons, mostly aliphatic, acyclic, alicyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the way it is extracted from the deposits, it has practically no application, making it useful only after being subjected to a process of fractionation or separation of its components, which is done in refineries, for the maximum use of its energy potential.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">From oil refining, hydrocarbons are separated by distillation, and their impurities are removed in other processes, so that various products can be extracted, including: diesel, gasoline, naphtha, kerosene, asphalt, lubricants, paraffins, liquefied petroleum gas, solvents, plastics and polymers in general, tar and coke, more precisely petroleum coke, the main target of the catalyst described in this patent.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Petroleum coke consists of polymer chains with high molecular weights and high concentrations of carbon. Although the coke product is considered a low added value by-product, it can have some value, depending on its degree of purity, with a distinction between Metallurgical Grade Coke, used in iron and steel metallurgy, and Anode Grade, used as raw material in the manufacture of anodes for the production of aluminum or titanium dioxide.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Currently, the petroleum coke produced in the world is consumed in the form of fuel, and the main consumers are the oil refineries themselves, which preferentially use a fuel of low commercial value internally in their furnaces, maximizing the production and commercialization of other higher value products.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The petroleum coke, considered a solid fuel, has a high calorific value, a low ash content, low acquisition cost, low volatile material content, high sulfur content, ash containing heavy metals and low combustion efficiency.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It should be emphasized that petroleum coke comes from delayed coking, which is a process of thermal cracking of low added value oil streams (high density, rich in sulfur and impurities). The property of the coke generated depends on the origin of the oil and the operating conditions, and may present, in its final composition, a high amount of sulfur, low volatile content, in addition to increased viscosity.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, due to its particular characteristics, petroleum coke is considered an interesting alternative to the use of coal. Its wide availability in oil refineries makes it a viable and low-cost substitute, which gives rise to the production of gas, hydrogen, methane and electricity by means of its gasification.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In turn, the gasification can be defined as the conversion of organic matter into gaseous products, by means of thermochemical reactions, involving steam, air, or oxygen, in amounts lower than the stoichiometric one (theoretical minimum for combustion).</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Regardless of the nature of the load, the main elements that make up the mixture of hydrocarbons, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and sulfur, are converted into the thermodynamically stable species that are: carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, water, methane, hydrogen sulfide and carbonyl sulfide, whose proportions vary according to process conditions, particularly whether it is air or oxygen that is used in the oxidation.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thus, the gasification allows converting hydrocarbons that cannot be vaporized, with the rupture of carbon-carbon bonds, which gives rise to the presence of a single resulting hydrocarbon, methane.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The most common raw materials for the gasification process are coal, oil and its residues, natural gas, biomass or mixtures of the same. The products obtained from the syngas are used in various applications such as, for example, power generation, hydrogen production, methanol production and liquid fuel synthesis.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In this way, the syngas obtained from the gasification of coal, of petroleum coke, of refinery residues normally presents in its composition 25-30% H<sub>2 </sub>(v/v), 30-60% CO (v/v), 5-15% CO<sub>2 </sub>(v/v) and 2-3% H<sub>2</sub>O (v/v).

Below 900&#xb0; C., the proximity to equilibrium is only reached with long residence times or with the use of a catalyst. The use of catalyst is not commercially applied due to soot formation.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0023">Thus, oil residues and in particular petroleum coke have become a promising raw material for the gasification process, mainly due to its wide availability in oil refineries. As main characteristics, petroleum coke, when compared to coal, is less reactive, has lower amounts of carbon and low amounts of volatile materials, which leads to the need for high temperatures so that it can be gasified, between 1400 and 1500&#xb0; C. Furthermore, due to the high sulfur contents, it is necessary to take an extra step to remove unwanted compounds, such as H<sub>2</sub>S, COS and S<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0024">In order to improve and optimize the gasification process, there are several strategies to be considered, among which it is possible to mention: air separation via membranes, new gasifier configurations, hot gas purification, new solvents, membranes to increase conversion in the shift reaction, hydrogen separation and application of catalysts in the process. Following this line of reasoning, the search for new catalysts may allow operation in milder conditions and/or with less formation of by-products, even reducing the temperature and energy consumption of the reaction, which results in an increase in the efficiency of the process.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0025">Related literature describes that increasing the operating temperature increases the conversion of coke with CO<sub>2 </sub>being the gasifying agent and leads to a reduction in the reaction time. Thus, the higher the temperature, the shorter the time required for the conversion of petroleum coke into gaseous products. Furthermore, the conversion rate increases with the increase in conversion, followed by a decrease.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0026">Such reaction behavior observed in the gasification of coke with CO<sub>2 </sub>is due to the fact that the temperature influences the graphitization process of petroleum coke during the gasification. In this context, it is worth to note that coke has high crystallinity and high structural organization when compared to coal, which are the ideal conditions for the formation of graphitic carbon as the temperature is increased.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0027">Another point described in the specialized literature addresses to the influence of lignin on the gasification of petroleum coke. Lignin has high reactivity, which is due to the presence of alkaline species and high surface area. Said description points to the fact that the mixture of coke with lignin provides an optimization in the reactivity of coke, since in the grinding step it promotes an intimate contact between the species and, thus, the proximity of the alkaline species present in the lignin would be able to accelerate the gasification of petroleum coke.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0028">With regard to patent literature, document US20150299588 describes the gasification reaction of coke with a catalyst impregnated in coal, in the presence of steam. The proposed catalyst consists of coal and potassium which, in a 1:1 ratio with coke, present a conversion of 88.4%.

The elimination of the mentioned step refers to the fact that it is not necessary to mix the catalyst with coke or previously impregnate the catalyst in the same. It should further be emphasized that the process described in the present application gives rise to a high added value syngas, with a high concentration of hydrogen at very low processing costs, compared to the processes currently described.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0040" num="0037">The present invention relates to a catalyst for the conversion of organic matter, in particular petroleum coke, into gaseous products (gasification) by means of thermochemical reactions, involving steam, air or oxygen in amounts lower than the stoichiometric one.

The use of the catalyst provides milder conditions for processing the mentioned loads. Furthermore, the catalyst required in the present invention can be supplied together with the material to be processed, without the need for an impregnation step in the coke or previous mixing with coke or other materials.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0045">The catalytic gasification process proposed in the present invention is carried out by means of the following steps:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0046">a) loading the reactor with a catalyst, an inert material or a mixture of both;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0047">b) fluidizing the bed loaded in step (a), at room temperature, in an air flow rate of 10 Nl&#xb7;min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0048">c) heating the bed fluidized in step (b), from room temperature to 800&#xb0; C., at a rate of 20&#xb0; C.&#xb7;min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0049">d) starting the intake of steam to the system heated in step (c);</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0050">e) starting the intake of petroleum coke after reaching the gasification temperature, the stabilization of the temperature of the bed and the system;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0051">f) injecting the gas coming from the gasifier from step (e) into the chromatograph;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0052">g) cooling the system under an air stream;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0053">h) unloading the bed;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0054">i) weighing the bed unloaded in step (h), the cyclones and the filters;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0055">j) carrying out the mass balance of the unit.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0049" num="0056">In one aspect of the invention, the reactor bed is loaded with 1 kg of silica and 1 kg of catalyst, to carry out the catalytic gasification process of petroleum coke or coal. On the contrary, in a thermal gasification, the reactor would be loaded with 2 kg of silica, this material being inert.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0057">In another aspect of the invention, it should be emphasized that, after fluidizing the bed, the temperature of 500&#xb0; C. is reached, starting the intake of steam to the system, in which the liquid pump is calibrated for a supply of 5 ml&#xb7;min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0058">In another aspect, when the gasification temperature in the system is reached, there occurs the bed stabilization and the intake of petroleum coke at a rate of 0.366 kg&#xb7;h<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0059">Still in an additional aspect, it should be emphasized that, five minutes after the start of solids supply, the gas from the gasifier was injected into the in-line chromatograph in order to determine its composition. Samples of the gas stream were injected every thirty minutes. Once the entire coke mass was supplied, the injections continued until the presence of CO and H<sub>2 </sub>products was no longer detected, indicating the end of gasification.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0060">When the gasification is ended and the room temperature reached, the bed is unloaded, followed by weighing the unloaded bed, the cyclones and the filters. Weighing is performed to determine whether there is a drag of particles from the bed, from petroleum coke or coal, depending on the case.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0061">Regarding the aspect of the catalytic gasification process, it should be emphasized that said process gives rise to a hydrogen-rich syngas.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0062">In yet another aspect of the catalytic gasification process, said process allows the reaction to occur under mild conditions and with higher conversion rates.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0063">In addition to said aspect, the catalyst is supplied to the system without the need for impregnation in coke, coal or other similar material and without previous mixing with the load.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0064">The second variation of the present invention addresses to a process for preparing a catalyst for catalytic gasification, described in several related aspects, among which the following preparation steps are included:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0065">a) weighing 100 g of the support (quartz sand);</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0066">b) weighing the iron salt so as to have a desired iron content % (w/w);</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0067">c) adding 150 ml of water to the iron salt;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0068">d) adding the prepared solution to the quartz sand;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0069">e) allowing to stand for 16 hours;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0070">f) evaporating the solution slowly;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0007" num="0071">g) drying in an oven at 100&#xb0; C./16 hours;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0008" num="0072">h) calcinating at 550&#xb0; C./5 hours.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0058" num="0073">In this variation, the catalysts were prepared by the slurry method, in which a determined mass of support, together with a solution, which makes up a desired concentration of the metal, are mixed forming a suspension. The solution with the suspension formed is allowed to stand and then dried and calcined.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0074">In all variations of the present invention, the raw material used to obtain a hydrogen-rich syngas is, preferably, petroleum coke, in a maximum particle size of 177 &#x3bc;m. However, it is possible that the catalyst is used for the gasification of coal.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0075">The catalyst mentioned in the previous variations of this invention is also required as an innovative product. In this way, the obtained catalyst for catalytic gasification comprises:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0076">a) a support, preferably quartz sand;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0077">b) a transition metal of group VIII;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0078">c) the calcination of the narrated compounds at 550&#xb0; C./5 hours.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0061" num="0079">It should be emphasized that, in this third variation of the invention, the catalyst for catalytic gasification comprises a transition metal of group VIII, namely iron. There are three forms of catalyst required in this invention, FeSiO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;Cl, FeSiO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;NO<sub>3 </sub>and the third species, FeSiO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;SO<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0080">Among the species mentioned, FeSiO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;Cl showed a reduction in time for conversion and increased the levels of CO<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2 </sub>in the reaction, compared to the thermal conversion. Thus, the catalyst for catalytic gasification FeSiO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;Cl allows catalytic gasification to occur under milder conditions and with higher rates of conversion of petroleum coke and by similarity to coal.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0081">In another way, the catalyst for catalytic gasification further has an additional advantage, since it is supplied to the system without the need for impregnation in coke, coal or other similar material and without the need for previous mixing with the load, reducing the processing steps, the processing time and the energy expenditure.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0082">Therefore, the use of the catalyst for catalytic gasification, optimizes and improves the catalytic gasification process of petroleum coke or coal, giving rise to a hydrogen-rich syngas and of high added value. Additionally, it is a low-cost catalyst due to the materials used and the preparation method.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Examples</heading><p id="p-0065" num="0083">As can be seen in the performed tests, the catalysts were prepared by the slurry method, which consists of adding a solution to a determined support mass with a desired concentration of the metal.

For comparative purposes, the coke conversion curve obtained for thermal gasification, without the presence of catalyst, was included.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0094">Blank tests and tests performed to test the conversion effectiveness of each catalyst were carried out by testing the following protocol:<ul id="ul0009" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0009-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0010" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0010-0001" num="0095">a) Loading of the reactor bed, which may consist of 2 kg of silica (thermal gasification test) or 1 kg of silica and 1 kg of catalyst (catalytic gasification test);</li>        <li id="ul0010-0002" num="0096">b) Fluidization of the bed, at room temperature, using an air flow rate of 10 Nl&#xb7;min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>;</li>        <li id="ul0010-0003" num="0097">c) Heating of the bed, from room temperature to 800&#xb0; C. using a rate of 20&#xb0; C.&#xb7;min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>;</li>        <li id="ul0010-0004" num="0098">d) When the temperature of 500&#xb0; C. was reached, the intake of steam to the system was started, and the liquid pump was calibrated for a supply of 5 mL&#xb7;min<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>;</li>        <li id="ul0010-0005" num="0099">e) When the desired gasification temperature was reached, the stabilization was awaited.

This result can be explained if it is considered that the content of iron incorporated into the silica, when sulfate was used as a source of the metal, was below the others. Such information can be corroborated by Table 1.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0103">In the case of the catalyst prepared using nitrate as a source of iron, the incorporated content was above the other two, but also in this case, there was no significant improvement in the conversion of petroleum coke, compared to thermal gasification. In particular, the catalyst prepared from the nitrate showed a similar performance to the catalyst prepared from the sulfate until about 100 minutes, when a decrease in performance started, even with respect to thermal gasification.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0104">The use of the Fe/SiO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;Cl catalyst seems to have influenced the gasification kinetics of petroleum coke, since the total conversion was reached in 4 hours of reaction, compared to the 6 hours necessary in the thermal gasification and in the reactions carried out by using Fe/SiO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;NO<sub>3 </sub>and Fe/SiO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;SO<sub>4 </sub>catalysts.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the molar composition of the gasifier output stream (on a water and nitrogen-free basis) in the test conducted at 800&#xb0; C. with the FeSiO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;Cl catalyst. In the experiment using the Fe/SiO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;Cl catalyst, higher contents of CO<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2 </sub>were obtained, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. This result suggests that, in addition to being effective in reducing the total gasification time, this catalyst greatly promoted the reaction of gas-water displacement, thus increasing the production of hydrogen.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0106">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, there is the molar composition of the gasifier output stream (on a water and nitrogen-free basis) in the test conducted at 800, 750 and 700&#xb0; C.
