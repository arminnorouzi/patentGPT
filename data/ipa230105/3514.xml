However, the spatial resolution of such non-linear optical spectroscopy techniques generally is limited by the diffraction limit as governed by the wavelength of light and/or the Nyquist sampling theorem. This diffraction limit is on the order of 1 micrometer, and it may be desirable to visualize objects that are several orders of magnitude smaller (e.g., on the order of 1 nm).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Detecting, identifying, and/or visualizing objects significantly smaller than 1 micrometer generally requires that electron-scattering techniques be utilized. However, electron-scattering techniques must be performed in ultrahigh vacuum environments, thus limiting their utility for many industrial applications. As an example, it may be costly, time-consuming, and/or simply not feasible to establish an ultrahigh vacuum environment around certain objects, thereby precluding scanning of these objects via electron-scattering techniques. In addition, electrons may alter the physical state of the surface instead of being purely, or largely, diagnostic in nature.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Alternatively, and in certain systems, such as biological systems, a photoactivatable label, or tag, may be added to known locations within an object to be visualized. In such a configuration, the photoactivatable label may be &#x201c;turned on&#x201d; or &#x201c;turned off,&#x201d; thereby providing additional contrast between the object to be visualized and the background, or noise, that inherently is present, preventing bleeding and/or contamination between adjacent elements of the object, and/or reducing signal aliasing. While such photoactivatable labels may improve resolution in certain systems, they may be difficult to add to and/or may contaminate other systems.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As discussed above, known systems and methods for detecting, identifying, and/or visualizing objects on a surface may not be amenable to all systems. Thus there exists a need for improved surface sensing systems and methods for imaging a scanned surface of a sample.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Surface sensing systems and methods for imaging a scanned surface of a sample via sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy are disclosed herein. The systems include a sample holder, a visible light source configured to direct a visible light beam incident upon a sampled location of the scanned surface and a tunable IR source configured to direct a tunable IR beam coincident with the visible light beam upon the sampled location. The tunable IR source is configured to selectively vary, or scan, a wavelength of the tunable IR beam, thereby permitting the tunable IR beam to selectively induce resonance within an imaged structure that is positioned on the scanned surface. The systems also include a scanning structure configured to scan the visible light beam and the tunable IR beam across the scanned surface, and a light filter configured to receive an emitted beam from the scanned surface and to filter the emitted beam to generate a filtered light beam. The emitted light beam includes a sum frequency signal, which propagates at an angle, between the specularly reflected visible light beam and the tunable IR beam, and is emitted from the scanned surface responsive to both the visible light beam and the tunable IR beam being incident on the scanned surface. The systems further include a light detection system configured to receive the filtered light beam, and an alignment structure.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The methods include methods of imaging the scanned surface of the sample. The methods include directing the visible light beam and the tunable IR beam coincident upon the sampled location of the scanned surface. The methods also include tuning the tunable IR beam to induce optical resonance within an imaged structure that extends at least partially within the sampled location of the scanned surface. Tuning the tunable IR beam also may be referred to herein as varying the wavelength of the tunable IR beam and/or as scanning a spectrum of the tunable IR beam. The methods further include receiving at least a portion of the emitted light beam from the sampled location of the scanned surface with a light detection system and scanning the visible light beam and the tunable IR beam across the scanned portion of the scanned surface.

Responsive to receipt of both visible light beam <b>42</b> and tunable IR beam <b>52</b>, sampled location <b>34</b> may produce, generate, and/or emit emitted light beam <b>38</b>. Emitted light beam <b>38</b> may be filtered by light filter <b>70</b> to produce and/or generate filtered light beam <b>72</b>, which may be received by light detection system <b>80</b>. Light detection system <b>80</b> then may quantify at least one property of filtered light beam <b>72</b>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Then, tunable IR source <b>50</b> may be tuned, such as by varying a wavelength, a frequency, or both the wavelength and the frequency of tunable IR beam <b>52</b>, to a wavelength and/or frequency that produces and/or generates optical resonance within an imaged structure <b>35</b> that extends at least partially, or even completely, within sampled location <b>34</b> of scanned surface <b>32</b>. Tunable IR source <b>50</b> may be configured to selectively vary, or scan, the wavelength and/or the frequency of the tunable IR beam <b>52</b>, with this selective variation being utilized to selectively induce resonance within the imaged structure. This resonance causes the imaged structure to absorb the tunable IR beam <b>52</b> that is incident thereupon. In contrast, a remainder of sampled location <b>34</b> and/or of scanned surface <b>32</b>, which is not in resonance with tunable IR beam <b>52</b>, does not absorb tunable IR beam <b>52</b>. Thus, the optical resonance within imaged structure <b>35</b> provides optical contrast between imaged structure <b>35</b> and scanned surface <b>32</b> (e.g. a background). Subsequently, visible light beam <b>42</b> and tunable IR beam <b>52</b> may be scanned across scanned surface <b>32</b> to produce and/or generate an image of scanned portion <b>36</b> of scanned surface <b>32</b>. This image may correlate and/or display a value of at least one property of filtered light beam <b>72</b> as a function of location within scanned portion <b>36</b> of scanned surface <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Prior art systems rely upon a photoactive label and/or tag to distinguish an imaged structure from a remainder of a scanned surface. However, systems <b>10</b>, which are disclosed herein, utilize tunable IR beam <b>52</b> to induce optical resonance within chemical compounds that are native to, or naturally present within, imaged structure <b>35</b>. As such, systems <b>10</b> may permit imaging of imaged structure <b>35</b> and/or may provide optical contrast between imaged structure <b>35</b> and a background, or remainder, of scanned surface <b>32</b> without the need to introduce a foreign material, or contaminant, such as the photoactive label, into sample <b>30</b>. Such a configuration may permit systems <b>10</b>, which are disclosed herein, to image samples <b>30</b> that may be damaged, altered, and/or otherwise affected through introduction of a photoactive label.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Subsequent to collection of the above-described image, system <b>10</b> may be utilized to collect a plurality, or sequence, of additional, or subsequent, images of scanned portion <b>36</b> of scanned surface <b>32</b>. This process, which is discussed in more detail herein with reference to methods <b>10</b>, may be referred to herein as oversampling, and may be utilized to produce and/or generate a super-resolution image of imaged structure <b>35</b>. As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;super-resolution image&#x201d; includes an image, such as of imaged structure <b>35</b>, that has a higher resolution that what may be obtained from a single observance, or image, of imaged structure <b>35</b>. As used herein, the word &#x201c;oversampling&#x201d; may refer to collection of the plurality, or sequence, of images, and each of these images also may be referred to herein as an &#x201c;undersampled&#x201d; image.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">As an example, a single scan of scanned portion <b>36</b> of scanned surface <b>32</b> by systems <b>10</b> may produce and/or generate an image with a resolution of approximately 1 micrometer due to the diffraction-limited nature of optical imaging techniques. Systems <b>10</b> may be able to resolve, or focus upon, an imaged structure <b>35</b> that is 1 micrometer in size, or larger, when imaged structure <b>35</b> is imaged by a single scan of scanned portion <b>36</b> of scanned surface <b>32</b>. A minimum spot size of visible light beam <b>42</b> and/or of tunable IR beam <b>52</b> on scanned surface <b>32</b> is limited, approximately, to the wavelength of the corresponding beam due to diffraction effects. Thus, systems <b>10</b> generally cannot resolve imaged structures <b>35</b> that are less than 1 micrometer in size in a single scan.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">However, the oversampling may permit systems <b>10</b> to produce super-resolution images that resolve imaged structure <b>35</b> to a resolution of less than 1 micrometer. As examples, the super-resolution images may resolve imaged structure <b>35</b> to a resolution of less than 500 nanometers, less than 250 nanometers, less than 200 nanometers, less than 100 nanometers, less than 75 nanometers, less than 50 nanometers, less than 25 nanometers, or less than 10 nanometers. In general, the resolution of the super-resolution image may be improved by increasing the number of images that are combined to generate the super-resolution image and/or by tuning tunable IR beam <b>52</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Activating non-linear resonance of naturally occurring surface features, via systems <b>10</b> and/or methods <b>100</b>, may provide improved surface sensing and enables super-resolution images to be generated in the context of a non-linear optical system. Prior art systems instead rely upon photoactive tags and/or labels to provide the contrast needed for collection of super-resolution images; however, and as discussed, such photoactive tags and/or labels modify the system being imaged and therefore may not be utilized in certain circumstances.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">This may enable second order surface sensing (e.g., via the non-linear optical system) as well as third order material, interface, structure, and compositional sensing. Stated another way, systems <b>10</b> and/or methods <b>100</b> are configured to utilize non-linear optical techniques to image a surface, such as scanned surface <b>32</b>, and/or to characterize the surface based upon a second and/or a third order susceptibility of the surface. Examples of the second order surface sensing include second harmonic generation, sum-frequency generation, and/or difference-frequency generation. Examples of third order sensing include stimulated Raman scattering, stimulated Brillion scattering, <b>4</b>-wave mixing, and optical phase conjugation. The response of the surface to these second and third order surface sensing techniques is governed by susceptibility, which becomes a second or third order susceptibility tensor for second or third order sensing techniques, respectively.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Visible light source <b>40</b> may include any suitable structure that may be adapted, configured, designed, and/or constructed to generate visible light beam <b>42</b> and/or to direct visible light beam <b>42</b> incident upon sampled location <b>34</b> of scanned surface <b>32</b>.

In other words, the phrases &#x201c;at least one,&#x201d; &#x201c;one or more,&#x201d; and &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; are open-ended expressions that are both conjunctive and disjunctive in operation. For example, each of the expressions &#x201c;at least one of A, B and C,&#x201d; &#x201c;at least one of A, B, or C,&#x201d; &#x201c;one or more of A, B, and C,&#x201d; &#x201c;one or more of A, B, or C&#x201d; and &#x201c;A, B, and/or C&#x201d; may mean A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together, B and C together, A, B and C together, and optionally any of the above in combination with at least one other entity.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0073">The various disclosed elements of systems and steps of methods disclosed herein are not required to all systems and methods according to the present disclosure, and the present disclosure includes all novel and non-obvious combinations and subcombinations of the various elements and steps disclosed herein.
