includes a bulb shell, a bulb base, two conductive supports, a stem, two supporting arms, and an LED filament. The bulb base is connected with the bulb shell. The two conductive supports are disposed in the bulb shell. The stem extends from the bulb base to inside of the bulb shell. The two supporting arms are disposed in the bulb shell. The LED filament includes a plurality of LED chips arranged in an array and two conductive electrodes respectively disposed at two ends of the LED filament and connected to the LED chips. The two conductive electrodes are respectively connected to the two conductive supports. A direction of a first highest curved portion of the LED filament and a direction of a second highest curved portion of the LED filament are substantially opposite to a direction of a lower curved portion of the LED filament.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="234.95mm" wi="88.48mm" file="US20230003349A1-20230105-D00000.TIF"

However, incandescent light bulbs are generally inefficient in terms of energy use and are subject to frequent replacement due to their limited lifetime (about 1,000 hours). Approximately 90% of the energy input is emitted as heat. These lamps are gradually being replaced by other, more efficient types of electric light such as fluorescent lamps, high-intensity discharge lamps, light emitting diodes (LEDs), etc. LED lamp is one of the most spectacular illumination technologies among all of these electric light types. LED lamps have the advantages of long service life, small size and environmental protection, etc., so their applications are increasing more and more.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, LED light bulbs each of which has an LED filament for emitting light are commercially available. The LED filament includes a substrate plate and several LEDs on the substrate plate. The effect of illumination of the LED light bulb has room for improvement. A traditional light bulb having a tungsten filament can create the effect of even illumination light because of the nature of the tungsten filament; however, the LED filament is hard to generate the effect of even illumination light. There are some reasons as to why the LED filament is hard to create the effect of even illumination light. One reason is that the substrate plate blocks light rays emitted from the LEDs. Another reason is that the LED generates point source of light, which leads to the concentration of light rays. Even distribution of light rays result in even light effect; on the other hand, concentration of light rays result in uneven, concentrated light effect.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an embodiment of the instant disclosure, an LED light bulb comprises a bulb shell, a bulb base, two conductive supports, a stem, two supporting arms, and an LED filament.

A lighting face of the whole LED filament <b>100</b> may be oriented to face towards the same orientation substantially to ensure that the lighting face of the LED filament <b>100</b> is visually identical. The LED filament <b>100</b> comprises a main lighting face Lm and a subordinate lighting face Ls corresponding to the LED chips. If the LED chips in the LED filament <b>100</b> are wire bonded and are aligned in line, a face of the top layer <b>420</b><i>a </i>away from the base layer <b>420</b><i>b </i>is the main lighting face Lm, and a face of the base layer <b>420</b><i>b </i>away from the top layer <b>420</b><i>a </i>is the subordinate lighting face Ls.

According to different authority or countries, LED light bulbs alleged that can provide omnidirectional light may be required to comply with different standards. The definition of the omnidirectional light may be, but not limited to, the following example. Page 24 of Eligibility Criteria version 1.0 of US Energy Star Program Requirements for Lamps (Light Bulbs) defines omnidirectional lamp in base-up position requires that light emitted from the zone of 135 degree to 180 degree should be at least 5% of total flux (lm), and 90% of the measured intensity values may vary by no more than 25% from the average of all measured values in all planes (luminous intensity (cd) is measured within each vertical plane at a 5 degree vertical angle increment (maximum) from 0 degree to 135 degree). JEL 801 of Japan regulates the flux from the zone within 120 degrees along the light axis should be not less than 70% of total flux of the bulb. Based upon the configuration of the LED filaments of the above embodiments which have the symmetry characteristic, the LED light bulbs with the LED filaments can comply with different standards of the omnidirectional lamps.</p><p id="p-0160" num="0159">It should be understood that the above described embodiments are merely preferred embodiments of the invention, but not intended to limit the invention.
