The first filtration layer (<b>110</b>) is located adjacent to the blood inlet port (<b>5</b>) and is formed of a polymer mesh, such as a nylon mesh. Pores in the polymer mesh of the first filtration layer (<b>110</b>) act as a capillary, enabling whole blood to flush evenly across the filter (<b>100</b>). The second filtration layer (<b>120</b>) is located beneath the first layer (<b>110</b>) and is formed of a glass fibre mesh, such as an LF1 membrane.

The broad end of the second filtration layer (<b>120</b>) is shaped and sized to allow all the blood from the first filtration layer (<b>110</b>) to be transferred to the second filtration layer (<b>120</b>). The tapered part (<b>150</b>) at the second end is shaped to constrict the blood cells in the glass fibre mesh and concentrate blood plasma at the tip of the taper, where it is then transferred onto the transfer element (<b>200</b>) via the inlet (<b>10</b>). As is described in more detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, various angles of taper can be employed.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, an embodiment of the transfer element (<b>200</b>) will be described. The transfer element (<b>200</b>) is substantially planar and formed of a material which allows capillary flow of blood plasma, such as a nitrocellulose membrane.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">As described above, an inlet (<b>10</b>) enables a flow of blood plasma into the transfer element (<b>200</b>) from the filter (<b>100</b>). The transfer element (<b>200</b>) comprises first, second, and third elongate channels (<b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>) configured to effect capillary flow of blood plasma from the inlet (<b>10</b>) to each of the first, second, and third test regions (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>). The transfer element (<b>200</b>) has hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions which define the channels and test regions (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>), with the hydrophilic regions forming said channels and test regions (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The arrangement of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions can be formed by additive methods or removal methods. For example, hydrophobic regions can be formed additively by applying a hydrophobic material, such as a wax or hydrophobic ink, which may for example be melted or sprayed onto the nitrocellulose membrane. Alternatively, removal methods include, for example, selective laser ablation of nitrocellulose material from the surface of the membrane. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the channels have been formed by selective laser ablation.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Each of the channels (<b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>) is defined by first and second opposing walls, each channel having a first end proximate the inlet (<b>10</b>) and a second end proximate the respective test region (<b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Each of the channels (<b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>) has a different degree of tortuousness, thereby differently affecting the flow of blood plasma therethrough. The second channel (<b>220</b>) is substantially straight. The path of the first channel (<b>210</b>) includes a single corner (that is, the opposing walls of the first channel together comprise a matching pair of corners). The third channel (<b>230</b>) is more tortuous than each of the first and second channels (<b>210</b>, <b>220</b>), comprising an abundance or multiplicity of corners (<b>235</b>).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The third channel (<b>230</b>) is also longer than each of the first and second channels (<b>210</b>, <b>220</b>) in order to increase the time taken for blood plasma to reach the third test region (<b>3</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates the dimensions of a typical embodiment of the transfer element (<b>200</b>). For the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a volume of 3.5 &#x3bc;L of blood plasma is required to wick through the entire hydrophilic region of the transfer element (<b>200</b>).</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The tortuousness of the third channel (<b>230</b>) also slows down capillary flow of the blood plasma to the third test region (<b>3</b>) by comparison with the flow through the first and second channels. More importantly, however, as is described in detail below, the corners (<b>235</b>) of the third channel (<b>230</b>) also increase mixing of the capillary flow of blood plasma so as to promote the reaction of the plasma with a reactant located in the channel.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The plasma sample contains low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL). To determine accurately the amount of HDL in the sample, the LDL from the plasma has to be prevented from reaching the HDL testing region. A reactant (i.e. one or more precipitation agents for example dextran sulphate, phosphotungistic acid, magnesium sulphate, magnesium chloride, or a combination thereof) is therefore located in the third channel (<b>230</b>) and reacts with low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, thereby preventing it from reaching the third test region (<b>3</b>).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The reactant is dispensed in matrix blocks or occupies micro-pores in the nitrocellulose membrane in the channel (<b>230</b>). The presence of the reactant affects the capillary flow through the membrane. Where the pores are occupied, the capillary flow avoids the pores containing precipitation agents by meandering around them or having a delayed flow into the regions containing the precipitation agent. This can lead to incomplete and irregular precipitation of LDL from the plasma, prejudicing the accuracy of the test.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Flow inside the nitrocellulose membrane can be directional and occurs due to capillary forces. The flow profile is therefore also somewhat parabolic, with the liquid wicking faster along the middle of the hydrophilic region than along the edges (near the walls). This can also lead to incomplete and irregular precipitation of LDL from the plasma, prejudicing the accuracy of the test.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">The corners (<b>235</b>) are distributed along the walls of the third channel (<b>230</b>), defining a zigzag profile. The zigzag profile redirects capillary flow of blood plasma at the walls of the channel toward the middle of the width of the channel. In this way, the capillary flow of plasma is &#x201c;kneaded&#x201d; inward in the channel such that slower flow near the walls is brought into the middle of the channel, increasing exposure of the LDL cholesterol in the plasma sample to the reactant. That is, the corners (<b>235</b>) promote mixing between the slow moving liquid along the edges and the faster moving liquid in the middle of the hydrophilic regions. The corners thereby also guide the plasma to flow into the areas of dispensed reactant in the channel, promoting precipitation of the LDL.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Each corner (<b>235</b>) is an angular vertex in a wall of the channel. Ideally, each of the corners (<b>235</b>) is right-angled. However, due to manufacturing tolerances at the microscale of the corners, this is not always achievable with precision. In practice, inward corners may have angles from 70-90 degrees and outward corners may have angles from 90-140 degrees. For example, in the embodiments shown, it has been observed that inward corners (<b>237</b>) of the zigzag have angles from 70-80 degrees and outward corners (<b>238</b>) of the zigzag have angles from 130-140 degrees, measured at the interior of the channel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows, by way of example, observed dimensions of two inward corners (<b>237</b>) and two outward corners (<b>238</b>) in an embodiment of the transfer element (<b>200</b>). In this example, two of the inward corners have angles of 77.60 and 72.61 degrees, respectively, and two of the outward corners have angles of 139.88 and 136.46 degrees, respectively. As is described above, the corners (<b>235</b>) define a zigzag profile which promotes the reaction of plasma with the reactant in the channel. The density of corners present in the channel significantly affects the level of mixing in the channel and therefore the efficiency of precipitation. The density of corners means the number of corners per unit length of the channel for a given width and depth of the channel.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> has a density of corners that has been found to enable at least substantially complete precipitation of the LDL cholesterol in the volume of blood plasma that reaches the third test region (<b>3</b>) by travelling along the channel.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Complete precipitation means precipitation of all the LDL cholesterol from the volume of blood plasma that reaches the test region. Substantially complete precipitation means at least near enough to complete precipitation of the LDL cholesterol in the volume of blood that any remainder, if present, will not (significantly) prejudice the accuracy or outcome of the test at the test region. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) provides that a clinically acceptable margin of error in HDL measurement is 12%. Therefore, substantially complete precipitation may be removal of 88% or more of the LDL cholesterol in the volume of plasma that reaches third test region.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the preferred embodiment, the multiplicity of corners includes a total of 16 corners, eight corners being disposed in each wall, the third channel having a length of 7-8 mm. The channel in this embodiment therefore has a density of corners of about two corners for each mm of the length of the channel, the channel having a depth of 100 &#x3bc;m, an average width of 1.45 mm, a minimum width of 0.75 mm, and a maximum width of 2.73 mm. In this embodiment, the volume of plasma that fills the third channel is 1-2 &#x3bc;L, 1-1.2 &#x3bc;L of which is required to fill up the test region.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The length of the channel is measured along the middle of the channel, following the path of the channel, from the first end to the second end. The width of the channel means the distance between opposing first and second walls of the channel, measured in an axis transverse to the path of the channel. The width of the third channel is preferably not uniform along its length. In particular, corners of the multiplicity variously constrict and expand the width of the third channel. Therefore, the average width, the minimum width, and the maximum width of the channel are relevant. The depth of the channel means the depth of the hydrophilic region in the channel, through which capillary flow travels.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The improved efficiency of precipitation obtained at this number of corners per unit length is preserved when scaled (to channels of varying lengths), provided the relative cross-sectional dimensions of the channel are maintained (and, of course, that the dimensions are also practicable for performing the test). Therefore, the density of corners can be given as a number of corners for each mm of the length of the channel for a given ratio of cross-sectional dimensions of the channel. For example, the density of corners of the preferred embodiment is 2 corners per mm of length of the channel, wherein the average width of the channel is from 18% to 21% of the length of the channel, the maximum width of the channel does not exceed 1.9 times the average width, the minimum width of the channel is not less than 48% of the average width, and the depth of the channel is about 7% of the average width.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further dimensions of the preferred embodiment of the transfer element (<b>200</b>) are provided at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a series of transfer elements having various numbers of corners in the third channel. The different designs are denoted by the number of corners present in each wall of the third channel: NC0 has a straight channel with no corners; NC1 has a channel with a single corner in each wall; NC2 has a channel with a pair of corners in each wall; NC4 has four corners in each wall; and, NC8 has eight corners in each wall. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates the flow regimes of capillary flow of blood plasma in each of these channels. In general, mixing of the capillary flow is increased with increasing number of corners in the channel, according to the mechanism described above.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">HDL tests were performed using the device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in combination, in turn, with each of the transfer elements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. A chart of the HDL readings obtained at the test region is provided at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, which shows a comparison of the HDL measured at each test region with that known to be present in the sample. The chart indicates (as a vertical red bar) the amount of cholesterol (both LDL and HDL) detected at the test region for each variant, and (as a horizontal golden bar) the true amount of HDL in the sample. A further vertical bar TC indicates the total cholesterol (HDL and LDL) present in the deposited samples. The discrepancy between the red and golden bars for each variant indicates the proportion of LDL that was not precipitated in the channel.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Having no corners in the channel leading to the HDL test region does precipitate a certain amount of LDL but not all. Increasing the number of corners increases the precipitation efficiency (up to a limit). The preferred embodiment of the device presented here uses 16 corners to achieve the desired precipitation. Channels containing 12 or fewer corners demonstrated incomplete precipitation of the LDL. Further variants denoted NC5 (having 10 corners, five of which on each wall) and NC6 (having 12 corners, six of which on each wall) showed precipitation but the measured values were 40% and 20% higher than the actual HDL values. This indicates that not all the LDL from the blood sample was precipitated. There was no particular trend noticed in the intervening cases between NC0 (having no corners) to NC6. A variant designated NC7 (having 14 corners, seven of which on each wall) provided HDL values 13-15% higher than the actual value, indicating incomplete precipitation of LDL from the sample but close to the clinically acceptable margin of error. As described above, NC8 (having a zigzag with a total of 16 corners, eight of which are disposed on each wall) has been found to provide complete precipitation of the LDL in the plasma at the test region.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">At higher numbers of corners still, greater volumes of blood plasma become necessary to complete the test. A transfer element (designated NC16) with 32 corners in the channel, 16 of which are disposed on each wall, failed to produce results for the given volume and the conditions of the tests.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Intuitively, the distribution of corners along the channel is also influential. That is, if corners are grouped only at the start of the channel or only toward the end of the channel, then the utility of the corners is lessened (as there is less opportunity for flow redirected at the corners to interact with the reactant). In channel variants where the corners were grouped in this way (rather than being distributed along substantially the length of the channel), the accuracy of the HDL test at the test region was found to be compromised. The latter case (where the corners are grouped only at the entrance to the test region) in fact showed little to no precipitation of LDL. This appears to happen due to the fast moving liquid in the middle reaching the test sites delivering the LDL and HDL molecules for the enzymatic reactions in the test sites. The multiplicity of corners is therefore preferably distributed along the channel, more preferably along substantially the whole length of the channel.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">It will be appreciated, however, that the multiplicity of corners (<b>235</b>) is not necessarily distributed evenly on both walls of the channel. In the preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, for example, the third channel (<b>230</b>) provides an arc from its first end to its second end. The corners on the wall at the interior of the curve are therefore more closely grouped than are the corners on the opposing wall. Some of the corners (<b>235</b>) are mirrored or duplicated by a corresponding corner on the opposing wall of the channel. Some of the corners are staggered between the opposing walls of the channel.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the embodiments shown, the multiplicity of corners (<b>235</b>) includes corners in both of first and second opposing walls of the third channel (<b>230</b>). With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, for example, the first and second walls in this preferred embodiment have an equal number of corners, each having eight corners. However, in other embodiments, there can be more corners on one wall than on the other wall. Optionally, there can be corners along only one wall of the channel.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">A channel with corners on only one wall, the opposing wall being smooth, has been found to achieve some precipitation, but a lesser amount than is achieved by a channel with the same number of corners distributed between both walls.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">The influence of a number of further modifications (relative to the preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) has been investigated. When the channel is halved in width and doubled in length the device does not produce any results for HDL. This is probably due to a combination of thin channels, and the precipitated lipoprotein blocking the flow of liquid. Dispensing of chemicals in such a small arm width also becomes problematic. When the channel is doubled in width and halved in length, it becomes difficult for the capillary flow to reach the test region for the same volume of blood plasma. Reducing the length of the HDL channel while increasing the width cuts off the test sites from communicating with the inlet of the device. On further increasing the length of the channel to connect to the HDL site, the volume of the sample required increases.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, variants of the blood separation filter (<b>100</b>) are described.

The best combination of effective plasma separation along with a desirable time for the test regions to be filled was achieved with angles close to 90 degrees.

The deposited whole blood is quickly spread over a circular area (&#xd8;6 mm) of the first filtration layer (<b>110</b>), which comprises a high-porosity nylon mesh membrane, and descends by gravity and capillary forces onto the second filtration layer (<b>120</b>), which comprises an LF1 glass fibre membrane. Red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are then separated from the whole blood as the blood starts moving laterally across the second filtration layer (<b>120</b>). From the 20 &#x3bc;L of whole blood deposited at the inlet, 7-8 &#x3bc;L of plasma is extracted.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0095">Step 3. The tip of the tapered part (<b>150</b>) of the second filtration layer (<b>120</b>) is in communication with the transfer element (<b>200</b>), which comprises a nitrocellulose membrane, via inlet (<b>10</b>). Blood plasma (i.e. whole blood depleted of blood cells and platelets), continues flowing on the transfer element (<b>200</b>) by capillary forces on the nitrocellulose membrane and the flow is split into three channels (<b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>). 1-1.2 &#x3bc;L of blood plasma reaches and fills each test region.

The reactant reacts with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood plasma, thereby preventing it from reaching the third test region (<b>3</b>). Therefore, only high-density lipoproteins (HDL) continue flowing to the test region (<b>3</b>), enabling the detection of the HDL portion of the blood sample at the third test region (<b>3</b>).</p><p id="p-0097" num="0099">Step 7.
