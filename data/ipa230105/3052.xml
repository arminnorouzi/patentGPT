The lock mechanism includes a bolt mounted within a first component composed of a first material and displaceable between retracted and extended positions to interengage with a second component when the first and second components are in a predetermined position relative to each other and the bolt is extended, and a magnetically-releasable latch mechanism positioned to latch the bolt in a retracted position, the latch mechanism including a first magnet and mounted for movement between a biased latch engaging position and a latch releasing position. A support collar composed of a second material having higher strength than that of the first material is disposed around the bolt between an inner casing and outer casing of the first component and is spaced from the bolt to allow for sliding movement of the bolt through the support collar as the bolt moves between the extended and retracted positions. The support collar absorbs and distributes to the inner and/or outer casing a load generated from the bolt as the bolt moves to the extended position through the support collar. A second magnet is positioned to displace the latch mechanism to the latch releasing position when the first component is in the predetermined position relative to the second

id="description"><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to a lever action operator and triggered bolt assembly for engaging two relatively movable components. More specifically, the present invention relates to a concealed lever mechanism for driving a magnetically-triggered bolt assembly for engaging a window or door with a strike or frame to prevent access to the interior of an enclosure.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Bolt assemblies are a well-known means for preventing access to the interior of an enclosure or structure. Known bolt assemblies comprise two components, one of which is connected to one component of an enclosure, such as a door or window frame, and the other connected to the other component, such as a door. The first component typically includes a bolt displaceable between engaged and disengaged positions, and the second component comprises a socket into which the bolt may be extended when the two components are in an appropriate position relative to each other and the bolt is moved to the engaged position. The position of the bolt may be controlled manually by manipulation of a key or by energizing an interlock circuit so as to prevent opening of the enclosure except in predetermined safe conditions.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, known bolt assemblies have disadvantages. For example, in bolt assemblies including a key, if the key is actuated to extend the bolt in circumstances where it is presumed that the two components of the bolt assembly are interengaged by the bolt but in fact the two components are not interengaged, unsafe conditions may prevail despite the bolt being extended. In a two component bolt assembly, it is not sufficient to ensure simply that the bolt is extended, as it may be that the bolt when extended has not engaged the other component of the assembly.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, there is a need for an improved bolt assembly which ensures that the bolt will not be triggered and extended until the two components are in the appropriate position relative to each other.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Bearing in mind the problems and deficiencies of the prior art, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved concealed lever operator for applying a tension force to one or more pliable connectors.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved concealed lever operator for a bolt assembly which utilizes a lever on a two bar linkage to drive a series of rack and pinion gears to create a mechanical advantage to retract and/or extend shoot bolts.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A further object of the invention is to provide an improved concealed lever operator for a bolt assembly which may be configured with additional mechanisms to allow locking and unlocking from the interior, operation from the exterior, locking and unlocking from the exterior, and any other combination of mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved triggered bolt assembly for preventing access to the interior of an enclosure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is still another object of the present invention to provide an improved bolt assembly which ensures that the bolt is extended only after the two components are in the appropriate position relative to each other.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A further object of the present invention is to provide a magnetically-triggered bolt assembly which ensures that the bolt is extended only after the two components are in the appropriate position relative to each other.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a magnetically-triggered bolt assembly including an anti-tampering back drive prevention subassembly.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a magnetically-triggered bolt assembly including a collapsible or adjustable strike.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Still another object of the present invention is to provide an improved bolt assembly including a support collar for absorbing and distributing load generated from the bolt as the bolt moves to the extended position through the support collar.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method for operating a magnetically-triggered bolt assembly.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a method for assembling a lock mechanism in a door or window panel.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Still other objects and advantages of the invention will in part be obvious and will in part be apparent from the specification.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The above and other objects, which will be apparent to those skilled in the art, are achieved in the present invention which is directed, in a first aspect, to a magnetically-triggered lock mechanism for interengaging two relatively movable components. The lock mechanism comprises a bolt displaceable between extended and retracted positions, the bolt mounted within a first component and interengageable with a second component when the first and second components are in a predetermined position relative to each other and the bolt is extended, and a magnetically-releasable latch mechanism positioned to latch the bolt in a retracted position, the latch mechanism including a first magnet and mounted for movement between a biased latch engaging position and a latch releasing position in a non-common direction of movement of the bolt. The lock mechanism further comprises a second magnet positioned to displace the latch mechanism to the latch releasing position when the first component is in the predetermined position relative to the second component. The first and second magnets may be positioned to displace the latch mechanism to the latch releasing position as a result of magnetic repulsion when the first component is in the predetermined position relative to the second component.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The magnetically-releasable latch mechanism may comprise a locking shuttle in communication with a trigger housing and the first magnet may be positioned within the trigger housing. The locking shuttle is adapted to move in a direction perpendicular to the movement of the trigger housing as the latch mechanism moves between the biased latch engaging position and the latch releasing position. The trigger housing may include at least one angled surface for mating with an angled surface of the locking shuttle, wherein the mating angled surfaces of the trigger housing and locking shuttle translate vertical movement of the trigger housing into horizontal movement of the locking shuttle when the first component is in the predetermined position relative to the second component and the first and second magnets are positioned to displace the latch mechanism to the latch releasing position. The locking shuttle may further comprise a projection and the bolt may further comprise an aperture for receiving the locking shuttle projection when the latch mechanism is in the biased latch engaging position.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, the first component may be a door or window panel, and the second component may be a frame associated with the door or window panel, and the second magnet may be at least partially located within a recess in the frame.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The bolt may be normally biased toward the extended position, and the lock mechanism may further include an outer housing comprising a channel in an inner surface thereof, wherein the bolt translates vertically within the channel as the bolt moves between extended and retracted positions.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a door or window assembly comprising a door or window panel moveable relative to an associated frame, and a magnetically-triggered lock mechanism for interengaging the panel and the frame. The lock mechanism comprises a bolt displaceable between extended and retracted positions, the bolt mounted within the door or window panel and interengageable with the frame when the door or window panel and frame are in a predetermined position relative to each other and the bolt is extended, and a magnetically-releasable latch mechanism positioned to latch the bolt in a retracted position, the latch mechanism including a first magnet and mounted for movement between a biased latch engaging position and a latch releasing position in a non-common direction of movement of the bolt. The lock mechanism further includes a second magnet positioned to displace the latch mechanism to the latch releasing position when the door or window panel is in the predetermined position relative to the frame. The first and second magnets may be positioned to displace the latch mechanism to the latch releasing position as a result of magnetic repulsion when the door or window panel is in the predetermined position relative to the frame.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In still another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of interengaging two relatively movable components to prevent access to an interior of an enclosure. The method comprises the steps of providing a bolt displaceable between extended and retracted positions, the bolt mounted within a first component and interengageable with a second component when the first and second components are in a predetermined position relative to each other and the bolt is extended; providing a magnetically-releasable latch mechanism positioned to latch the bolt in a retracted position, the latch mechanism including a first magnet and mounted for movement between a biased latch engaging position and a latch releasing position in a non-common direction of movement of the bolt; and providing a second magnet positioned to displace the latch mechanism to the latch releasing position when the first component is in the predetermined position relative to the second component.

The lock mechanism includes a magnetically-triggered bolt mounted, for example, within a door panel movable between an open position and a closed position, and a strike positioned in the base of a door frame for receiving the triggered bolt when the door is in the locked position. It should be understood by those skilled in the art that the lock mechanism of the present invention is not limited to enclosures secured by a door, and may also be used to interengage other relatively movable components, such as a window frame and sill. Magnets secured in the strike and trigger mechanism for the bolt, respectively, are oriented and positioned such that they repel one another when in alignment, overcoming the forces of friction and trigger spring normally biasing the trigger in a downward direction, and pulling a locking shuttle away from the bolt, thereby allowing a compressed bolt spring to release and fire the bolt downward into the pocket of the strike.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, one embodiment of a magnetically-triggered lock mechanism <b>100</b> of the present invention is shown mounted in a door panel <b>140</b>, to secure the door panel to a door frame <b>150</b> to prevent access to the interior of an enclosure when bolt <b>60</b> is extended into an opening in a strike <b>30</b> in the bottom of the door frame. It should be understood by those skilled in the art that in other embodiments, door panel <b>140</b> may instead be a window frame and door frame <b>150</b> may be a window sill, or other such similar enclosure for which preventing access is required. When door panel <b>140</b> is in a locked state, bolt <b>60</b> is biased downward by a bolt spring exerting vertical force on a bolt spring carrier and an internal housing, thereby securing bolt <b>60</b> in the pocket of the strike <b>30</b>, preventing opening of the door panel <b>140</b>. Magnets <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> are oriented and secured in the strike <b>30</b> and bolt trigger mechanism <b>40</b>, respectively, such that the magnets repel each other when in vertical alignment, as shown. As magnets <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> align as the door panel <b>140</b> moves into a closed position, the repelling force becomes great enough to overcome the forces of friction as well as a trigger spring normally biasing the trigger <b>40</b> downward (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The magnetic repulsion force thus moves trigger <b>40</b> upward into the firing mechanism (comprising the trigger housing, a locking shuttle, bolt and bolt carrier, and associated springs), pulling the locking shuttle away from the bolt <b>60</b> and allowing bolt <b>60</b> to be fired into the pocket of the strike <b>40</b> by the release of the compressed bolt spring. The door panel is held closed by the interaction of bolt <b>60</b> and strike <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows an exploded view of the magnetically-triggered lock mechanism <b>100</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The door panel and frame have been removed for clarity. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, lock mechanism <b>100</b> comprises a magnetically-triggered bolt assembly held within an outer housing having sides <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b</i>. A permanent magnet <b>10</b> is mounted within opening <b>31</b> in strike <b>30</b>, whereby strike <b>30</b> may be positioned, for example, in the bottom of a door or window frame as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Strike <b>30</b> further includes an opening or pocket <b>32</b> for receiving the triggered bolt <b>60</b>, which translates vertically within a channel <b>112</b> on the inner surface of outer housing <b>110</b><i>a</i>. A corresponding permanent magnet <b>20</b> is oriented and mounted within trigger housing <b>40</b> such that the adjacent surfaces of magnets <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> have the same polarity and repel each other when in vertical alignment. Trigger housing <b>40</b> further comprises at least one angled surface <b>41</b> for mating with a correspondingly angled surface <b>51</b> on a face of locking shuttle <b>50</b>. Trigger housing <b>40</b>, magnet <b>20</b>, and locking shuttle <b>50</b> collectively comprise a magnetically-releasable latch mechanism <b>200</b>, which latches bolt <b>60</b> in a retracted position. Latch mechanism <b>200</b> is mounted for movement between a biased latch engaging position and a latch releasing position in a non-common direction of movement of the bolt <b>60</b>. In the embodiment shown, the latch mechanism translates between latched and unlatched positions in a direction perpendicular to the movement of bolt <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a bolt spring carrier <b>70</b> engages the top portion of bolt <b>60</b> at aperture <b>61</b> via projection <b>71</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>9</b></figref>) and translates vertically within a channel <b>121</b> on surface <b>122</b> of inner casing or inner housing <b>120</b>. Bolt <b>60</b> is normally biased downward toward an extended position by a bolt spring within carrier <b>70</b>; however when the door or window is open, bolt <b>60</b> is maintained in a retracted position by locking shuttle <b>50</b>. When the latching mechanism <b>200</b> is in the latched position, projection <b>52</b> on locking shuttle <b>50</b> extends within aperture <b>62</b> of bolt <b>60</b> to lock the bolt in position relative to the firing mechanism and prevent vertical movement of the bolt <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>8</b></figref>). When the latch is released, i.e., when locking shuttle projection <b>52</b> is retracted from bolt aperture <b>62</b> by translation of the locking shuttle, the bolt is permitted to fire downward into an opening <b>32</b> in the strike (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>, <b>9</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>7</b></figref> show the lock mechanism transitioning from an unlocked state to a locked state, thereby interengaging the two relatively moveable components, such as a door or window panel and associated frame, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the locking mechanism <b>100</b> in a fully unlocked state. Force has been applied upwards to the bolt spring carrier <b>70</b>, compressing the bolt spring and pulling bolt <b>60</b> out of the pocket or opening <b>32</b> of the strike <b>30</b>, allowing the door panel to move to an open position. Generally, as the firing mechanism (comprising the trigger <b>40</b>, locking shuttle <b>50</b>, bolt <b>60</b> and bolt carrier <b>70</b>, and associated springs) moves away from the strike assembly <b>30</b>, the repelling force between magnets <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> decreases, allowing the trigger spring to decompress, and force the trigger housing <b>40</b> towards the outside of the firing mechanism. As the trigger <b>40</b> moves to the outside of the firing mechanism, shuttle <b>50</b> is biased towards bolt <b>60</b> by a shuttle spring, locking the bolt <b>60</b> in a latched position relative to the firing mechanism and preventing vertical movement of the bolt <b>60</b> as the door is opened.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows locking mechanism <b>100</b> in a fully unlocked state, with a portion of the outer housing <b>110</b><i>a </i>removed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, bolt <b>60</b> in a retracted position and the locking shuttle <b>50</b> is in a biased latch engaging position. More specifically, a shuttle spring is normally biasing shuttle <b>50</b> in the direction of bolt <b>60</b>, such that locking shuttle projection <b>52</b> is extended within bolt aperture <b>62</b> to maintain the bolt <b>60</b> in a retracted position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, when the locking shuttle is in the biased latch engaging position, the locking shuttle is approximately at a top portion of the angled mating surface of the trigger <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, as the firing mechanism approaches the strike assembly <b>30</b> during movement of the door panel to a closed position, magnets <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> begin to repel one another and the repelling force between the magnets becomes great enough to overcome the forces of friction and the trigger spring. The magnetic repulsion between magnets <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> urges trigger housing <b>40</b> upwards, into the firing mechanism. The angled mating surfaces <b>41</b>, <b>51</b> of the trigger housing <b>40</b> and shuttle <b>50</b>, respectively, convert the vertical motion of the trigger <b>40</b> (which houses magnet <b>20</b>) into horizontal motion of the shuttle <b>50</b>. As shown in the transition between <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the magnetic repulsion between magnets <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> compresses the trigger spring and moves the trigger housing <b>40</b> and magnet <b>20</b> into the firing mechanism, pulling the shuttle <b>50</b> away from the bolt <b>60</b> and compressing the shuttle spring, which normally biases the shuttle towards the bolt <b>60</b>. Shuttle projection <b>52</b> is thus retracted from bolt aperture <b>62</b> by translation of shuttle <b>50</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. As the bolt <b>60</b> is now free to move vertically, the compressed bolt spring is released, pushing the bolt spring carrier <b>70</b> and bolt <b>60</b> outward and firing the bolt into the pocket <b>32</b> of the strike <b>30</b>, thereby preventing movement of the door panel, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. It should be understood by those skilled in the art that, in operation, the locking steps as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> to <b>7</b></figref> are happening near-simultaneously; however, the steps are being shown as discrete actions to more clearly depict the motion.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows locking mechanism <b>100</b> in a fully locked state, with a portion of the outer housing <b>110</b><i>a </i>removed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, bolt <b>60</b> in an extended position and the locking shuttle <b>50</b> is in the latch releasing position. The magnetic repulsion between magnets <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> has urged trigger housing <b>40</b> upwards (as compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, for example), into the firing mechanism, and the angled mating surfaces of the trigger housing <b>40</b> and shuttle <b>50</b>, respectively, have converted the vertical motion of the trigger <b>40</b> into horizontal motion of the shuttle <b>50</b>, moving the shuttle into the latch releasing position and retracted locking shuttle projection <b>52</b> from bolt aperture <b>62</b>, such that the bolt has been permitted to fire downward into opening <b>32</b> in strike <b>30</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, when the locking shuttle <b>50</b> is in the latch releasing position, the locking shuttle is located near a bottom portion of the angled mating surface of the trigger <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">To return to an unlocked state, force may be applied upwards to the bolt spring carrier <b>70</b>, such as by rotating a door handle, compressing the bolt spring in bolt spring carrier <b>70</b> and pulling bolt <b>60</b> out of the pocket of the strike <b>30</b>. As the door panel (including the firing mechanism) moves away from the strike assembly <b>30</b> during opening of the door, the repelling force between magnets <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> decreases, allowing the trigger spring to decompress and biasing the trigger housing <b>40</b> towards the outside of the firing mechanism. As the trigger <b>40</b> moves to the outside of the firing mechanism, shuttle <b>50</b> is biased towards bolt <b>60</b> by the shuttle spring, latching the bolt in a retracted position relative to the firing mechanism by the re-engagement of locking shuttle projection <b>52</b> with bolt aperture <b>62</b>, as described above.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">It should be understood by those skilled in the art that the configuration of the lock mechanism of the present invention as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, inclusive, and in particular the configuration of the bolt, locking shuttle and trigger, is shown as configured for exemplary purposes only, and that other configurations are within the intended scope of the present invention, so long as the magnetic repulsion between the magnets located in the first and second components, respectively, causes the magnetically-releasable latch mechanism to move from a biased latch engaging position to a latch releasing position via the interaction between the locking shuttle and the trigger to allow the bolt to fire to interengage the first and second components.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0099">In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>26</b></figref>, the lock mechanism or shoot bolt assembly may further include a back drive prevention subassembly that allows for the bolt to freely extend out of the housing in the extended position but prevents the bolt from being retracted without releasing the subassembly. The back drive prevention subassembly may include a linear actuator in the form of a rack and pinion, wherein the subassembly may be installed in a recess <b>124</b> in housing <b>120</b>&#x2032;. In conventional use, the teeth of a circular gear known as the pinion engage teeth on a linear gear bar known as the rack, such that rotational motion applied to the pinion causes the rack to move relative to the pinion, thereby translating the rotational motion of the pinion into linear motion. However, in the present invention, the rack and pinion are used to prevent linear motion between the component on which the pinion is mounted and the component on which the rack is mounted. In the embodiment shown, rack <b>132</b> is disposed vertically along length of an inner surface of inner housing <b>120</b>&#x2032; secured within the door panel. Bolt carrier <b>70</b>&#x2032; is slideable up and down within inner housing <b>120</b>&#x2032; and secures bolt <b>60</b>&#x2032; at a lower end by a set screw. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, bolt spring <b>170</b> is disposed within channel <b>172</b> in bolt carrier <b>70</b>&#x2032;. The upper end of bolt spring <b>170</b> is connected to a flange <b>171</b> extending from inner housing <b>120</b>&#x2032; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>), while the lower end of the bolt spring bears against the lower end of channel <b>172</b>. Bolt spring <b>170</b> biases bolt carrier <b>70</b>&#x2032; and bolt <b>60</b>&#x2032; downward toward the extended position, but may be compressed by movement of bolt carrier <b>70</b>&#x2032; and bolt <b>60</b>&#x2032; upward into the retracted position.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>15</b> and <b>25</b>-<b>26</b></figref> depict one embodiment of a back drive prevention subassembly <b>130</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, and more particularly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>13</b></figref>, subassembly <b>130</b> comprises a backing plate <b>139</b>, rack <b>132</b>, a pair of gears <b>134</b><i>a </i>and <b>134</b><i>b</i>, a pawl <b>138</b>, and a slack block <b>136</b> housed within bolt spring carrier <b>70</b>&#x2032; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, pinion gear <b>134</b><i>a </i>engages rack <b>132</b> and gear <b>134</b><i>b </i>is engageable with pawl <b>138</b>. The teeth of pinion gear <b>134</b><i>a </i>engage with the teeth of rack <b>132</b>. Pinion gear <b>134</b><i>a </i>is mounted on a shaft along with gear <b>134</b><i>b</i>, and spaced therefrom. The shaft is mounted on the upper end of bolt spring carrier <b>70</b>&#x2032;, and bolt <b>60</b>&#x2032; is secured by a set screw to the lower end of bolt spring carrier <b>70</b>&#x2032; and extends downward. Pawl <b>138</b> is normally biased by torsion spring <b>133</b> to engage gear <b>134</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). Gears <b>134</b><i>a,b </i>are synchronized such that rotation of one gear causes the other gear to rotate in the same direction.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Slack block <b>136</b> is permitted to translate up and down within bolt spring carrier <b>70</b>&#x2032; from a first, upward position to a second, downward position in a rack and pinion manner by converting rotational motion of gear <b>134</b><i>a </i>into linear motion along rack <b>132</b>, and is normally biased in a downward direction by compression spring <b>131</b>. Slack block <b>136</b> limits and controls the range of movement of pawl <b>138</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref>, and more clearly <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b> and <b>26</b></figref>, show the limits of movement of slack block <b>136</b>. Slack block <b>136</b> is free to move within a slot <b>182</b> within bolt carrier <b>70</b>&#x2032; and biased by spring <b>131</b> into the engaged position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>. When slack block <b>136</b> is in the down position, pawl <b>138</b> engages gear <b>134</b><i>b </i>and allows for rotation of gears <b>134</b><i>a,b </i>in only one direction (counterclockwise as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>). More specifically, when pawl <b>138</b> is engaged, gears <b>134</b><i>a,b </i>are prevented from rotating in a direction allowing for retraction of the bolt (clockwise, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>). The pinion gear teeth are non-symmetric to permit the finger at the distal end of pawl <b>138</b>, which is biased by torsion spring <b>133</b> toward the pinion gear <b>134</b><i>b</i>, to permit the pawl to move against the bias and slide along the surface on one side of the tooth and permit rotation of the pinion gear in one direction, i.e., the direction in which it would move if the bolt spring carrier <b>70</b>&#x2032; and bolt <b>60</b>&#x2032; were moved downwards into the extended locked position and into engagement with the door frame strike. However, if an attempt were made to move the bolt spring carrier <b>70</b>&#x2032; and bolt <b>60</b>&#x2032; upwards out of engagement with the strike, the pawl <b>138</b> finger would engage the pinion gear tooth surface and prevent rotation of the pinion gear in the opposite direction, thereby preventing linear motion of the pinion gear <b>134</b><i>a </i>with respect to rack <b>132</b>, and movement of the bolt spring carrier <b>70</b>&#x2032; and bolt <b>60</b>&#x2032; on which the pinion gear is disposed. It should be understood by those skilled in the art that in another embodiment, pinion gear <b>134</b><i>a </i>may instead be a pawl which is normally biased towards and engages/disengages the teeth of rack <b>132</b>, similar to the bindings of a snowboard, for example.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">Slack block <b>136</b> is attached to a flexible connector or cable <b>160</b> which extends through a concealed channel in the door or window panel and is secured to the shoot bolt mechanism and to slack block <b>136</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, cable <b>160</b> may be locked to slack block <b>136</b> by a set screw or grub screw <b>137</b>; however, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that other fastening methods may also be employed to secure the cable to the slack block after the cable has been fed through the mechanism. As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, when cable <b>160</b> is tensioned and pulled upward, slack block <b>136</b> moves to disengage pawl <b>138</b> from gear <b>134</b><i>b</i>, allowing for free rotation of gears <b>134</b><i>a,b </i>in either direction. Cable <b>160</b> is also connected to bolt <b>60</b>&#x2032;, so when cable <b>160</b> is pulled upward, it also retracts bolt spring carrier <b>70</b>&#x2032; and bolt <b>60</b>&#x2032; upwards along rack <b>132</b> in the direction of arrow <b>184</b> and out of engagement with the strike (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>). It should be understood by those skilled in the art that in an embodiment where the pinion gear is replaced with a pawl normally biased towards rack <b>132</b>, the movement of slack block <b>136</b> acts to disengage the pawl from the rack prior to movement of the bolt. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>-<b>26</b></figref>, sash block <b>136</b> moves independently within slot <b>182</b> in the direction of arrow <b>180</b> before contacting bolt carrier <b>70</b>&#x2032;, at which point both move upwards together. In an embodiment, slack block <b>136</b> may move upward approximately 2 mm as established by the length of slot <b>182</b> to disengage pawl <b>138</b> from gear <b>134</b><i>b</i>, before contacting the end of the slot in bolt carrier <b>70</b>&#x2032; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>). Back drive subassembly <b>130</b> acts as a tamper prevention feature, in that bolt <b>60</b> or <b>60</b>&#x2032; is prevented from being manually forced into a retracted position by a user able to directly access the bolt without actuation of the handle or lever, as will be described below, thereby permitting the door or window panel to be moved into an unlocked and/or open position relative to the door frame or window sill.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>11</b></figref>, the shoot bolt assembly may further include a collar or support ring <b>140</b> attached to inner housing <b>120</b> for absorbing and distributing load from bolt <b>60</b>&#x2032;. Collar <b>140</b> is preferably made of a material having a higher tensile strength and/or compressive strength than that of the housing, such as steel, for example. Collar <b>140</b> is disposed around bolt <b>60</b> or <b>60</b>&#x2032; and is spaced from the bolt to allow for sliding movement of the bolt through the support collar. As bolt <b>60</b>&#x2032; moves from the retracted to the extended position, bolt <b>60</b>&#x2032; extends through collar <b>140</b> and the load is distributed to the casing, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. In an embodiment, collar <b>140</b> may be fully captured between inner casing <b>120</b> and outer casing halves <b>110</b><i>a,b </i>and attached by known means, such as using screws, rivets or other fasteners. The load distribution afforded by collar <b>140</b> allows for use of a material having weaker strength for the casing for the lock mechanism, which reduces cost of materials.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>-<b>20</b></figref> show the lock mechanism or shoot bolt assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>11</b></figref> transitioning from an unlocked state to a locked state.

Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>-<b>20</b></figref>, as the firing mechanism approaches the strike assembly <b>30</b>&#x2032; during movement of the door panel to a closed position, magnets <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> begin to repel one another and the repelling force between the magnets becomes great enough to overcome the forces of friction and the trigger spring <b>170</b>. The magnetic repulsion between magnets <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> urges trigger housing <b>40</b>&#x2032; upwards, into the firing mechanism. The angled mating surfaces <b>41</b>, <b>51</b> of the trigger housing <b>40</b>&#x2032; and shuttle <b>50</b>, respectively, convert the vertical motion of the trigger <b>40</b>&#x2032; into horizontal motion of the shuttle <b>50</b>. As shown in the transition between <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>-<b>19</b></figref>, the magnetic repulsion between magnets <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> compresses the trigger spring <b>170</b> and moves the trigger housing <b>40</b>&#x2032; and magnet <b>20</b> into the firing mechanism, pulling the shuttle <b>50</b> away from the bolt <b>60</b>&#x2032; and compressing the shuttle spring, which normally biases the shuttle towards the bolt <b>60</b>&#x2032;. Shuttle projection <b>52</b> (not shown) is thus retracted from aperture <b>62</b>&#x2032; (not shown) in bolt carrier <b>70</b>&#x2032; by translation of shuttle <b>50</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>. As the bolt <b>60</b>&#x2032; is now free to move vertically, the compressed bolt spring is released, pushing the bolt spring carrier <b>70</b>&#x2032; and bolt <b>60</b>&#x2032; outward and firing the bolt into the strike <b>30</b>&#x2032;, thereby preventing movement of the door panel, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>. It should be understood by those skilled in the art that, in operation, the locking steps as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>-<b>20</b></figref> are happening near-simultaneously; however, the steps are being shown as discrete actions to more clearly depict the motion.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, and as more particularly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>23</b></figref>, the shoot bolt assembly may further include an adjustable or collapsible strike <b>30</b>&#x2032; in the bottom of the door or window frame for retaining magnet <b>10</b> and receiving the triggered bolt <b>60</b> or <b>60</b>&#x2032;. Strike <b>30</b>&#x2032; is comprised of a strike top <b>33</b> and base <b>34</b>.

An actuator, such as a concealed lever or handle, is then installed into the actuator recess formed in the panel (step <b>102</b>).

The actuator or shoot bolt retractor assembly may be received and concealed in a recess formed in the door or window panel, or a component thereof, such as by forming a cutout of an aluminum or other material hollow extrusion used as a stile for the panel. A pliable connector such as a cable, wire, or rope (or multiple cables) which can receive a tension force, and can transmit a compression force, is then passed through a concealed channel in the stile or other route interior to the panel. The pliable connector or cable (or multiple cables), being accessible at the extent of the concealed channel or stile, is inserted into a shoot bolt mechanism, which may be installed into a second formed recess in the panel.

It should be understood by those skilled in the art that the concealed lever or handle disclosed herein and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b> and <b>29</b></figref> is only one example of an actuator that may be used in connection with the locking mechanism of the present invention, and that other now known or later developed types of actuators are contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b>-<b>33</b>C</figref> depict an exemplary embodiment of the concealed actuator or lever operator assembly of the present invention. A handle is used to operate and retract shoot bolts on a pivot panel, folding panel, or end panel. The operator utilizes a lever on a two bar linkage to drive a series of rack and pinion gears to create a mechanical advantage to retract and/or extend shoot bolts, as described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>26</b></figref>, for example. For operating magnetically-triggered shoot bolts, such as those described herein, a spring automatically retracts the operator mechanism to the starting position, optionally with the assistance of gravity. For operating traditional shoot bolts, the lever will remain in the down (i.e., retracted) position when the shoot bolts are extended (locked) and in the upright position when the shoot bolts are retracted (unlocked). In an embodiment for a daily door, the lever or handle is used to open and close the daily door and operates a latch adjacent to the handle. In one or more embodiments, the system may be configured with additional mechanisms to allow locking and unlocking from the interior, operation from the exterior, locking and unlocking from the exterior, and any other combination of mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In one embodiment, the operator of the present invention may be used with a mechanical shoot bolt. The lever may be a configurable handle that drives an upper and lower shoot bolt by retracting a cable, or shoot bolts. The primary action is a lever that opens along the same plane as the glass in a door or window system. Integrated in the handle is a latch that is triggered by its proximity to a magnet mounted in the door jamb or an adjacent door, in the case of French-style doors.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In at least one embodiment, the primary mechanism can be configured to not have the locking feature present, such as when the exterior portion of the handle is not present, the locking function is not needed, or the handle is used to unlatch folding panels. The primary handle may be reversible for either left or right hand door systems.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">In other embodiments, an exterior handle also utilizes a lever to unlatch the system, and may be restrained with a configurable lock cylinder. It can also have a fixed or retractable handle to assist in closing the door toward the operator. For an inswing door, the handle will be on the outside, whereas for an outswing door the handle will be on the inside. The exterior handle transfers the force via a sliding mechanism that can be utilized from either side of the primary handle.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In at least one embodiment, there may be a push button above the primary interior handle that can be depressed to lock the system. The system can then be unlocked by lifting the primary lever.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The concealed actuator or shoot bolt retractor assembly <b>200</b> of the present invention may include a linear actuator in the form of a rack and pinion. In conventional use, the teeth of a circular gear known as the pinion engage teeth on a linear gear bar known as the rack, such that rotational motion applied to the pinion causes the rack to move relative to the pinion, thereby translating the rotational motion of the pinion into linear motion. A lever, optionally restrained by a restrictor, drives a first rack which meshes with a pinion gear, causing the gear to rotate. At the same time, the first rack pulls on a cable attached, for example, to an automatic shoot bolt assembly as described herein. In other embodiments, the cable could be replaced by a mechanical shoot bolt assembly rigidly attached to the drive rack. As the first rack pulls on the cable, the pinion gear meshes with a second (driven) rack, which retracts the cable in a direction opposite of the movement of the first rack, thus retracting the bolt into the panel. In one or more embodiments, during translation of the driven rack, an optional compression spring may be compressed.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b>-<b>32</b></figref>, in the embodiment shown, a first (drive) rack or slider <b>520</b> is disposed vertically along the length of an inner surface of outer housing or casing <b>250</b> secured within the door panel. A concealed lever or handle <b>10</b> is pivotally connected to the first rack or slider <b>520</b> and casing <b>250</b>, respectively, via a two bar linkage, such that actuation of the lever will translate rack or slider <b>520</b> between a first position and a second, tensioned position along a straight vertical path. Handle <b>510</b> is pivotable within longitudinal slot <b>252</b> in the sidewall of casing <b>250</b>, such that when in a closed position, handle <b>510</b> is substantially flush with the casing profile. In contrast to operator assemblies of the prior art, handle <b>510</b> is not directly connected to, nor does it pivot directly about, casing <b>250</b> during translation of the first rack <b>520</b>. Rather, the handle pivots about a hinge point which is offset from the housing or casing.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> depicts the positioning of the two-bar linkage as lever <b>510</b> pivots from a concealed or low profile position, to a fully open position, respectively. Housing or casing <b>250</b> is not shown, for clarity. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>, hinge or pivot pin A is the pivotal junction of first linkage <b>300</b> and first rack <b>520</b>, fixed hinge or pivot pin B is the pivotal junction of second linkage <b>302</b> and housing or casing <b>250</b>, and hinge or pivot pin C is the pivotal junction of the opposite end of linkage <b>302</b> and lever <b>510</b>, such that each linkage bar is permitted to move relative to the other linkage bar. The relationship between the hinged points interplays with the translation of the motion of the handle <b>510</b> and rack components <b>520</b>, <b>550</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>B</figref>, pivot pin A is positioned proximate a first end <b>512</b> of handle <b>510</b> at a free end of angled, fixed linkage <b>300</b> and pivot pin C is preferably positioned at an intermediate point on handle <b>510</b> between the handle endpoints at a distance closer to casing <b>250</b> than the handle's grip portion end <b>514</b>. This allows for greater mechanical leverage by a user when pulling handle <b>510</b> upwards or pushing handle <b>510</b> downwards. Fixed pivot pin B pivotally joins linkage <b>302</b> to casing <b>250</b> at a point below pivot pins A and C along a vertical axis when handle <b>510</b> is in the concealed or closed position. Each pivot pin may be a rivet or other rotatable, pivoting attachment. Linkage <b>300</b> is fixed at an angle relative to handle first end <b>512</b>, while linkage <b>302</b> is permitted to pivot at each end thereof (hinges B and C). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>A-<b>33</b>C</figref>, collectively, the two-bar linkage allows handle or lever <b>510</b> to move over a wide operating angle and return to a concealed flush or low profile position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>A</figref>). As handle <b>510</b> moves to either end of its travel, the two-bar linkage design moves hinges A and C relative to fixed pivot point B.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>A</figref>, when handle <b>510</b> is in the concealed or closed position, hinge A is at its furthest point from fixed pivot pin B along a vertical axis, and hinge C is offset transversely from a vertical line of action between hinges A and B. As handle <b>510</b> moves to the open position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>33</b>B and <b>33</b>C</figref>, hinge C shifts transversely from the vertical over the handle's length of travel as hinge A is gradually drawn closer to fixed pivot pin B, causing rack <b>520</b> to shift longitudinally downward within slot <b>252</b> along casing <b>250</b>, perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the handle <b>510</b>, as the handle rotates from a concealed to an open position. This allows handle <b>510</b> &#x201c;clearance&#x201d; to rotate about its pivot points without requiring extra depth to the casing, and in fact, reducing the depth of the casing, making the actuator assembly more flush with the panel.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>33</b>A-<b>33</b>C</figref>, and in contrast to the prior art, handle <b>510</b> is not directly connected to, nor does it pivot directly about, casing <b>250</b> during translation of the first rack <b>520</b>, rather the handle pivots about hinge C which is offset from the casing via the two-bar linkage. This contributes to the concealed or low profile design of the actuator mechanism.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b>-<b>32</b></figref>, rack <b>520</b> meshes with pinion gear <b>530</b>, thereby causing the pinion gear to rotate. At the same time, rack <b>520</b> pulls on cable <b>160</b>, which extends through a concealed channel or stile in the panel and is attached to automatic shoot bolt assembly <b>100</b> or <b>100</b>&#x2032;. Pinion gear <b>530</b> further meshes with a second (driven) rack or slider <b>550</b>, which retracts and applies tension to cable <b>160</b> in a direction opposite of the movement of rack <b>520</b>. In other embodiments, pinion gear <b>530</b> may be, but is not limited to, a helical gear, a Bevel gear, a Miter gear, a double helical gear, or any other gear that couples the drive rack <b>520</b> to the driven rack <b>550</b>. It should be understood by those skilled in the art that a single pinion gear, as shown in the Figures, is sufficient to provide the desired motion; however, the addition of more pinion gears would distribute the load across more teeth on the racks, providing an increased working load.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">As described herein, cable <b>160</b> may be attached to an automatic shoot bolt assembly, such as assembly <b>100</b> or <b>100</b>&#x2032;, such that manual retraction of the shoot bolt via rotation of handle or lever <b>510</b> is permitted. Rack <b>550</b> travels along a straight vertical path in a direction opposite the direction of travel of rack <b>520</b>, and is coupled to rack <b>520</b> via pinion <b>530</b> such that rack <b>550</b> moves in a second direction as rack or slider <b>520</b> moves. During translation of the second rack <b>550</b> in an upward direction, spring <b>560</b> is compressed, resisting the rotational motion of lever <b>510</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>). When the lever is released, spring <b>560</b> is allowed to extend and causes the shoot bolt retractor assembly, and therefore lever <b>510</b>, to return to its initial position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">Spring <b>560</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> connected to a bottom end of rack or slider <b>550</b>, causing rack <b>550</b> to return to its initial position when the spring is extended upon release of handle <b>510</b>; however, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that the spring may also be connected to any moving component in the shoot bolt retractor assembly to produce the same returning effect. In an embodiment, spring <b>560</b> may be a constant force spring, a torsion spring, a clock spring, a power spring, a gas spring or other mechanism that provides a force to oppose the rotational force of lever or handle <b>510</b> and return the lever to its initial concealed position upon release.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">The direction of travel of racks or sliders <b>520</b>, <b>550</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b>-<b>32</b></figref> as being parallel and in opposing directions; however, it should be understood by those skilled in the art that in other embodiments, the direction of travel of either or both racks may be along any plane that lays on the rotational axis of pinion <b>530</b>.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">Moreover, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, pinion <b>530</b> is shown having a rotational axis that is parallel to the pivotal axis of handle or lever <b>510</b>, such that actuation of handle causes rack <b>520</b> to travel linearly in a vertical direction via linkage <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>. It should be understood by those skilled in the art that in other embodiments, the axis of pinion <b>530</b> may not be oriented in a parallel direction, and may instead be oriented in a direction perpendicular to the axis of rotation of handle <b>510</b>.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b>-<b>32</b></figref>, the shoot bolt retractor assembly <b>200</b> may further include a damper <b>570</b> for reducing the speed with which handle or lever <b>510</b> closes. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, damper <b>570</b> may be a linear damper adjacent spring <b>560</b> and connected to rack <b>550</b>. In conventional use, a linear damper (whether hydraulic or pneumatic) is used when a load is in constant contact with the damper and the operator wants a smooth deceleration in either the compression or tension direction. Here, the load generated by the second rack or slider <b>550</b> as spring <b>560</b> is compressed is in constant contact with damper <b>570</b>, and as lever or handle <b>510</b> is released to return the bolt retractor or actuator to its initial position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>), damper <b>570</b> provides a force to oppose the closing force of spring <b>560</b> which is proportional to the closing velocity of the lever <b>510</b>, thus reducing the closing speed. It should be understood by those skilled in the art that a linear damper connected to rack <b>550</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b>-<b>32</b></figref> is only one means of reducing the closing speed of the handle or lever, and that in other embodiments, a damper may be connected to any moving component in the system to produce the same or similar damping effect, such as a rotary damper connected to the pinion <b>530</b>, linkage <b>300</b>, <b>302</b> or handle <b>510</b>.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In another embodiment, the shoot bolt retractor assembly may include only one rack or slider which applies tension to one or more cables. In such a configuration, the cable or cables may be run through a pulley to produce motion in a direction other than the direction of travel of the rack or slider.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In still another embodiment, the shoot bolt retractor assembly may include one or more linkages coupling the opposing first and second racks or sliders <b>520</b>, <b>550</b> instead of a pinion gear <b>530</b>.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In still yet another embodiment, the housing or casing may include a pair of slots allowing for a shoot bolt or other rigid connector to move independently from the housing or casing to put the connector in tension but not allowing for the connector to be placed under compression. In this embodiment, no pliable connector such as a cable or cables is required, and the shoot bolt retractor assembly is connected directly to the shoot bolt or other rigid connector.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">Thus, the present invention achieves one or more of the following advantages. The magnetically-triggered bolt assembly provides an improved means for preventing access to the interior of an enclosure and ensures that the bolt is extended only after the two components, such as a window frame and sill, are in the appropriate position relative to each other. Magnets secured in the strike and trigger mechanism for the bolt, respectively, are oriented and positioned such that they repel one another when in alignment, overcoming the force of a trigger spring which normally biases the trigger in a downward direction, and pulling a locking shuttle away from the bolt, thereby allowing a compressed bolt spring to release and fire the bolt downward into the pocket of the strike. The bolt assembly further includes an adjustable or collapsible strike, allowing for magnets in the strike and trigger mechanism to remain in close proximity no matter the adjustment of the door or window panel, and a support collar for distributing load from the bolt to the casing, allowing for lower cost of materials during manufacture. The bolt assembly further provides improved protection against tampering by preventing back driving of the bolt during operation. The present invention further provides an improved concealed lever operator for a bolt assembly which utilizes a lever on a two bar linkage to drive a series of rack and pinion gears to create a mechanical advantage to retract and/or extend shoot bolts.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">While the present invention has been particularly described, in conjunction with specific embodiments, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. It is therefore contemplated that the appended claims will embrace any such alternatives, modifications and variations as falling within the true scope and spirit of the present invention.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>Thus, having described the invention, what is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
