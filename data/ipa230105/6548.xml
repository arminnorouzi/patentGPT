headings provided herein, if any, are for convenience only and do not necessarily affect the scope or meaning of the claimed invention.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In many radio-frequency (RF) applications, MOSFET devices implemented as silicon-on-insulator (SOI) devices are utilized as switches to provide, for example, high isolation, low insertion loss and high RF power handling properties. Control of such switches typically involves a high turn on voltage and a low turn off voltage. The high turn on voltage improves the on resistance while the low turn off voltage reduces the parasitic capacitance. For example, a 3V voltage can be provided from a control circuitry to turn on an RF switch with reasonably low insertion loss in a 0.18 &#x3bc;m CMOS SOI device. Such a control circuitry can also provide a low turn off voltage, typically 2V, to turn off the RF switch and provide good isolation performance.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The foregoing example control circuitry typically includes a positive charge pump, a negative charge pump, and level shifters. The level shifters translate decoder outputs to either positive turn on voltage or negative turn off voltage. These level shifters can present potential risks to positive and negative charge pumps during level transition period due to large transient currents inside them. The high current loads not only degrade the charge pump transient response time but can also jeopardize their normal operations. Moreover, the corresponding RF switch performance can also be vulnerable to the slowly settled turn on/turn off control voltages.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an example of a conventional control system <b>10</b> for controlling an RF switching circuit <b>20</b>. Such a control system typically uses positive (<b>12</b>) and negative (<b>14</b>) charge pumps directly to power level shifters <b>16</b>. Hence, the charge pumps <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are loaded with level shifters all the time. The positive and negative charge pumps <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> need to transfer a quantity of charges to the level shifters <b>16</b> during startup. Thus, the startup time is substantially deteriorated. In addition, when the level shifters <b>16</b> input signals change, the transition currents inside level shifters <b>16</b> are loading the charge pumps and causing or increasing the likelihood of potential failure.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows that in some embodiments, a control system <b>100</b> can include a voltage feedback circuit configured to track a positive output from a positive charge pump <b>120</b>. A scaled charge pump output voltage can be compared with a reference voltage (e.g., by a comparator <b>126</b>) to determine if a load connection switch is turned on or turned off. A level shifter <b>128</b> can be utilized to lift an output voltage of the comparator output voltage to the positive charge pump level. The control system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is also referred to herein as a charge pump system <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Configured in the foregoing manner, the control system <b>100</b> can provides a charge pump circuitry a no-load fast startup, and also provide the charge pump circuitry with a prompt transient response performance even for high-load current events from level shifters. Additionally, an interleaved charge pump configuration as described herein can result in much smaller output voltage ripples which in turn can help with reduction of switching noise coupling associated with RF switches <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the control system <b>100</b> is also shown to include a negative charge pump <b>122</b>. An oscillator <b>124</b> is shown to provide respective signals to the positive charge pump <b>120</b> and the negative charge pump <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The control system <b>100</b> is shown to further include a positive/negative level shifter group <b>130</b> in communication with each of the positive charge pump <b>120</b> and the negative charge pump <b>122</b>. The positive/negative level shifter group <b>130</b> is further shown to be provided with control signals from an RF switch decoder <b>134</b> that decodes control signals received through, for example, MIPI control ports of an MIPI core <b>132</b>. The positive/negative level shifter group <b>130</b> is shown to provide switch control signals to RF switches <b>110</b> to turn a series switch <b>136</b> ON or OFF. It is noted that when the series switch <b>136</b> is turned ON or OFF, a corresponding shunt switch <b>138</b> is typically turned OFF or ON, respectively.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows more specific examples of the positive charge pump <b>120</b>, the negative charge pump <b>122</b> and the oscillator <b>124</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows that in some embodiments, each of the positive and negative charge pumps <b>120</b>, <b>122</b> can be implemented as a multiple-phase interleaved charge pump. In the various examples provided herein, such a multiple-phase is described in the context of a 5-phase configuration; however, it will be understood that other numbers of phases can also be utilized.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the oscillator <b>124</b> is shown to be implemented as a ring oscillator having five outputs (clock1, clock2, clock3, clock4, clock5) resulting from five phase shifts (e.g., 36 deg, 72 deg, 108 deg, 144 deg, 180 deg phase shifts).
