No. 16/997,414 entitled &#x201c;WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY MANAGEMENT AND HANDOFF CONTROL,&#x201d; (Attorney Docket No. CHTR-2020-106), filed on Aug. 19, 2020, the entire teachings of which are incorporated herein by this reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, Wi-Fi&#x2122; is the name of a wireless standards group that decides implementations of the wireless Ethernet standards IEEE802.11. Such technology is defined by multiple different specifications from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE) 802.11 standards.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a so-called Wi-Fi&#x2122; network, each of multiple communication devices (typically mobile) communicate with a wireless access point to access a remote network such as the Internet. In certain instances, each of the communication devices share the same one or more communication channels (same range of frequencies).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Wi-Fi&#x2122; is a contention based communication system as multiple communication devices compete to use the same wireless channel. For example, Wi-Fi&#x2122; uses a protocol called carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA). In general, the communications include (1) listen before transmitting, (2) if a collision is detected by transmitting at the same time as another wireless station, wait a random time before trying to communicate again.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The devices compute random wait times to reduce collisions. For example, the wait time of a device is the number of idle time slots it must wait before transmitting, counted D seconds after then end of the previous transmission. The device must add D seconds to its wait time whenever that wait time is interrupted by a transmission.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Because devices compute different random wait times after a collision, they typically do not interfere with each other after attempting channel access again. If the channel is busy at the end of a wait time, the device computes a new random wait time and starts waiting again before transmitting.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Unlike cellular telecommunication technologies however, Wi-Fi&#x2122; does not have any specified handoff intelligence or protocols. This is because Wi-Fi&#x2122; generally is not designed to be or meant to be a mobility technology.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments herein include supporting handoffs in a wireless network environment to ensure continuous wireless connectivity with a communication management system.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">More specifically, a communication management resource (such as hardware, software, combination of hardware and software) controls connectivity of one or more communication devices in a network environment. For example, the communication management resource initially receives performance information indicating wireless connectivity performance between a first communication device and a set of one or more candidate wireless access points. Assume that the first communication device is in communication with a first wireless access point over a wireless link. Based on analysis of the performance information, the communication management resource selects a candidate wireless access point from the set. The communication management resource then notifies the communication device to handoff the wireless link from the first wireless access point to the selected candidate wireless access point.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, each of the first wireless access point and the selected candidate wireless access point provide the communication device connectivity to a controller resource (such as communication management hardware) that controls operation of the communication device. The handoff of the communication device from the first wireless access point to a second wireless access point ensures continued connectivity with the controller resource or a respective network.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further embodiments herein include, via the controller (a.k.a., communication management hardware), communicating a first notification from a controller to the communication device. The first notification indicates a decision to handoff the wireless link from the first wireless access point to the second wireless access point. Additionally, in accordance with further example embodiments, the controller communicates a second notification from the controller to the communication device. The second notification indicates results of pre-authenticating the communication device with the selected wireless access point.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In still further example embodiments, prior to communicating the second notification of pre-authentication results or other information to the communication device, the controller communicates an authentication request from the controller to the selected wireless access point, the authentication request pre-authenticating the communication device with the selected wireless access point. In response to communicating the authentication request to the wireless access point, the controller receives an authentication response from the selected wireless access point.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, a further response from the controller to the communication device includes security information (such as results of pre-authenticating the communication device with the selected wireless access point) facilitating secured connectivity of the communication device with the selected wireless access point.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Further embodiments herein include, via the controller, communicating an identity of the selected wireless access point to the communication device. Accordingly, the communication device is informed of the selected wireless access point in which to perform a handoff of the wireless link. As a response to communicating the identity of the selected wireless access point to the communication device, the controller receives an acknowledgement message from the communication device. In one embodiment, the acknowledgement message from the communication device confirms an operation of the communication device initiating the handoff from the first wireless access point to the selected candidate wireless access point.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In still further example embodiments, the handoff notification (a command) to the communication device to handoff the wireless link from the first wireless access point to the selected candidate wireless access point causes a so-called FT or fast transfer (such as in accordance with standard 802.11 or a Wi-Fi&#x2122; protocol) of the communication device from the first wireless access point to the selected candidate wireless access point.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Still further embodiments herein include, via the controller, receiving an acknowledgement message from the communication device. In one embodiment, the acknowledgement is a response to the controller notifying the communication device to handoff the wireless link from the first wireless access point to the selected wireless access point. In one embodiment, the acknowledgement message confirms that the communication device has received the handoff message indicating/including the instruction to handoff the communication link from the first wireless access point to the selected candidate wireless access point.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Note that the performance information can be any suitable information. In one embodiment, the controller receives first performance information originating from the communication device; the first performance information indicates performance of the communication device receiving first wireless communication from the first wireless access point. The controller receives second performance information originating from the first wireless access point; the second performance information indicates performance of the first wireless access point receiving second wireless communications from the communication device. The controller receives third performance information originating from the candidate wireless access point; the third performance information indicates performance of the candidate wireless access point receiving third wireless communications from the communication device.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Still further embodiments herein include, via the controller, notifying a first communication device to handoff the wireless link from the first wireless access point to the selected candidate wireless access point in response to a second communication device blocking wireless signals between the first communication device and the first wireless access point.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Additionally, or alternatively, the controller monitors anticipated motion of a second communication device along a path in a network environment. In one embodiment, the controller notifies the first communication device to handoff the wireless link from the first wireless access point to the selected candidate wireless access point in response to detecting the anticipated motion of the second communication device blocking wireless signals between the first communication device and the first wireless access point at a particular time.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In yet further example embodiments, wireless 802.11 LAN (Local Area Network) systems as described herein provide network connectivity for client stations from one or more access points to which the clients are registered. If a client station moves from the coverage zone of a first wireless access point in the network and detects the signal from another wireless access point in the same network, then the client station can initiate a handoff of a respective connection from the first wireless access point to the second wireless access point. According to certain embodiments herein, this is known as reassociation and usually takes on the order of a few seconds to occur once the client station has made the decision to switch access points.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">At higher frequencies (e.g. 60 GHz), the access point coverage zones become typically smaller due to the RF (Radio Frequency) propagation characteristics. In such an instance, faster moving client stations (such as mobile robots or other type of device) not only spend less time in each access point zone, the few seconds it takes to re-associate itself to the new wireless access point can severely impact the quality of service received by the client station.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Additionally, it should be noted that moving objects present in a wireless LAN deployment environment can block the signal path of stationary clients (communication devices) and impact their qualities of service as well. In general, the conventional wireless protocol 802.11r defines a fast transition (a.k.a., FT) functionality that reduces the amount of time for the client station to switch from handing off from one access point to another. A limitation of this FT amendment is that the decision to make the transition is based solely on the client station. In a typical Industrial Automation deployment scenario, there will be a multi-edge compute (MEC) system that will be required for enabling many of the target use cases. In general, Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), is an ETSI-defined network architecture concept that enables cloud computing capabilities and an IT (Internet Technology) service environment at the edge of the cellular network and, more generally at the edge of any network. The enhanced MEC system as described herein is deployed to help facilitate reassociations of mobile clients as well as stationary clients that require a very high quality of service. This can be done with additional application software in the access points and the client stations and can make use of existing 802.11 messages and mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">These and additional embodiments are further discussed below.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Note that any of the resources as discussed herein can include one or more computerized devices, mobile communication devices, servers, base stations, wireless communication equipment, communication management systems, workstations, user equipment, handheld or laptop computers, or the like to carry out and/or support any or all of the method operations disclosed herein.

The drawings are not necessarily to scale, with emphasis instead being placed upon illustrating the embodiments, principles, concepts, etc.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to one embodiment, a communication management system (such as hardware and/or executed software) receives performance information indicating wireless connectivity performance between a communication device and a set of candidate wireless access points. The communication device is in communication with a first wireless access point over a wireless link. Based on the performance information, the communication management system selects a candidate wireless access point from the set in which to perform a handoff. The communication management hardware notifies the communication device to handoff the wireless link from the first wireless access point to the selected candidate wireless access point.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Overview</heading><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As more specifically discussed herein, wireless LAN (Local Area Network) systems (such as based on 802.11 or other wireless communication protocol) provide network connectivity for client stations from one or more wireless access points to which the clients are registered. If a client station moves from the coverage zone of a first access point in the network and detects the signal from a second access point in the same network, the client station has an ability to change its wireless connection from the first access point to the second access point. This is known as reassociation and usually takes on the order of a few seconds to occur once the client station has made the decision to switch access points.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">At higher frequencies (e.g., such as greater than 10 GHz or around 60 GHz) the access point coverage zones in a wireless network become typically smaller due to the RF propagation/attenuation characteristics at such high frequencies. This disclosure includes the observation that, at higher frequencies, faster moving client stations, such as mobile robots, not only spend less time in each access point zone, the few seconds it takes to re-associate to the new access point can severely impact the quality of service received by the client station. Additionally, it is noted that moving objects in a wireless LAN deployment environment can block the signal path of stationary clients and impact their qualities of service as well. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref> below and corresponding discussion for an illustration of these events.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Conventional 802.11r wireless communication protocol defines a fast transition (FT) functionality that reduces the amount of time for a client station to switch from handing off a wireless communication link from one access point to another. One limitation of this amendment is that the decision to make a transition is based solely on the client station. In a typical Industrial Automation deployment scenario there will be a multi-edge compute (MEC) system (control system) that will be required for enabling many of the target use cases. This MEC system can therefore be employed to help facilitate reassociations of mobile clients as well as stationary clients that require a very high quality of service. As described herein, this can be implemented via additional application software in the access points and the client stations and can make use of existing 802.11 messages and mechanisms.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Entity Roles and Functions</heading><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Embodiments herein include wireless access points, client stations (such as wireless stations), and a MEC system (a.k.a., a control system).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">A.
