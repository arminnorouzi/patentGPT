These systems may be capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (e.g., time, frequency, and power). Examples of such multiple-access systems include fourth generation (4G) systems such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems, LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) systems, or LTE-A Pro systems, and fifth generation (5G) systems which may be referred to as New Radio (NR) systems. These systems may employ technologies such as code division multiple access (CDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA), orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA), or discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DFT-S-OFDM). A wireless multiple-access communications system may include one or more base stations or one or more network access nodes, each simultaneously supporting communication for multiple communication devices, which may be otherwise known as user equipment (UE).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some wireless communication systems may use various techniques for saving power at a UE. In some cases, however, some power-saving techniques may prevent the UE from saving power relatively quickly when communicating with another device, and such techniques may instead delay power-savings until some amount of time after a message is received.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The described techniques relate to improved methods, systems, devices, and apparatuses that support wideband micro sleep techniques. Generally, the described techniques provide for a user equipment (UE) to use wideband micro-sleep in, for  example, a New Radio (NR) cellular vehicle-to-everything (CV2X) system. In some examples, a UE may reduce power consumption by shutting down a radio frequency (RF) chain and skipping modem processing from the beginning of a message after determining that a beginning of the message lacks relevant data (e.g., a valid signal intended for the UE). For instance, the UE may receive the first two symbols of a message, where the first two symbols include a duplicated wideband signal. The UE may calculate a correlation between the signals received in the first two symbols, and the UE may determine whether the message includes a valid signal based on comparing the correlation to a threshold. If the correlation is below the threshold, for example, then it may be determined that the first two symbols lack the relevant data (e.g., control information, a physical sidelink control channel (PSCCH)), and the UE may therefore power down one or more RF chains and modem processing for a remainder of the message (e.g., for a remaining duration of a subframe) to save power. In some cases, the described techniques may be combined with a demodulation reference signal (DMRS)-based approach, where the UE may identify a frequency-domain DMRS pattern associated with the message that the UE may use to further determine whether the message includes valid data for the UE.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A method for wireless communication at a first UE is described. The method may include receiving, via a set of one or more antennas, a message from a second UE, where a first symbol period and a second symbol period of the message include a duplicated signal, the first symbol period being immediately prior to the second symbol period in a time domain, calculating, for each antenna of the set of one or more antennas, a correlation between first data included in the first symbol period and second data included in the second symbol period of the message, and powering down at least one RF chain based on calculating the correlation between the first symbol period and the second symbol period, where the at least one RF chain is powered down based on a result of the calculated correlation satisfying a threshold value.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">An apparatus for wireless communication at a first UE is described.

description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Some wireless communication systems may support communication between one or more wireless devices. For example, a wireless communications system may support sidelinks for communications between multiple user equipments (UEs). A sidelink may refer to any communication link between similar wireless devices (e.g., a communication link between UEs). It is noted that while various examples provided herein are discussed for UE sidelink devices, such sidelink techniques may be used for any type of wireless devices that use sidelink communications. For example, a sidelink may support one or more of device-to-device (D2D) communications, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) or vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, cellular V2X (CV2X) communications, message relaying, discovery signaling, beacon signaling, or other signals transmitted over-the-air from one UE to one or more other UEs. </p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some systems, power consumption may cause a chip in a UE to overheat. Further, a modem may shut down due to overheating if the modem is placed in a relatively high temperature environment (e.g., in a vehicle). Radio frequency (RF) processing (e.g., by various components of an RF chain) may also contribute to chip power consumption, and therefore, may further contribute to overheating. As such, techniques that provide enhanced power savings through the reduction of RF processing may assist a UE in avoiding shutting down a modem due to excess power consumption and the resultant heat.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some cases, to reduce power consumption, a UE may use micro-sleep procedures for temporarily saving power when not communicating with another device and enabling relatively reduced power consumption when in a sleep state. In one example, the UE may use a per-subchannel micro-sleep approach based on a demodulation reference signal (DMRS) correlation, where the UE may shut off modem processing for a subframe after determining that a subframe lacks relevant data. However, some power-saving techniques may lack applicability to wideband signals. Additionally or alternatively, some power-saving techniques may cause the UE to process or estimate multiple symbol periods of a subframe, thereby preventing the UE from entering micro-sleep relatively sooner (e.g., after receiving the subframe).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Techniques described herein enable the UE to use wideband micro-sleep in a wireless communications system (e.g., a New Radio (NR) CV2X system). In some examples, the UE may reduce power consumption by shutting down an RF chain and skipping modem processing from the beginning of a message upon determining that a beginning of the message excludes relevant data (e.g., for a valid signal). In particular, the UE may receive a first symbol period and a second symbol period of the message (e.g., the first two symbol periods of the message), where the first symbol period and the second symbol period may include a duplicated wideband signal. The UE may calculate a correlation between respective signals received in the two symbol periods, and the UE may decide whether the message contains a valid signal based on comparing the correlation to a predetermined threshold. If the correlation is below the threshold, for example, then the UE may determine that the first two symbols lack relevant data (e.g., control information, a physical sidelink control channel (PSCCH)), and the UE may, as a result, power down one or more RF chains and/or modem processing for the  remainder of the subframe to save power. Such techniques may enable the UE to enter into micro-sleep relatively quickly (e.g., relatively shortly after receiving the message, relatively shortly after the second symbol period of the message), enabling enhanced power savings at the UE. In some cases, the described techniques may be combined with a DMRS-based approach, where the UE may identify a DMRS pattern (e.g., a frequency-domain DMRS pattern) associated with the message that the UE may use to further determine whether the message includes valid data for the UE. In some cases, the use of the DMRS pattern may enable an additional degree of accuracy in determining whether the wideband message includes valid data for the UE.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Particular aspects of the subject matter described herein may be implemented to realize one or more advantages. The described techniques may support improvements in wideband micro-sleep. For example, the UE may power down RF chains and modem processing based on a correlation between received signals, which may reduce the amount of modem processing and subsequent power consumption and overheating at the UE, therefore improving the overall quality of communications between wireless devices. As such, supported techniques may include improved network operations, and, in some examples, may promote network efficiencies, among other benefits.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Aspects of the disclosure are initially described in the context of wireless communications systems.

The term &#x201c;carrier&#x201d; may refer to a set of RF spectrum resources having a defined physical layer structure for supporting the communication links <b>125</b>. For example, a carrier used for a communication link <b>125</b> may include a portion of an RF spectrum band (e.g., a bandwidth part (BWP)) that is operated according to one or more physical layer channels for a given radio access technology (e.g., LTE, LTE-A, LTE-A Pro, NR). Each physical layer channel may carry acquisition signaling (e.g., synchronization signals, system information), control signaling that coordinates operation for the carrier, user data, or other signaling. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support communication with a UE <b>115</b> using carrier aggregation or multi-carrier operation. A UE <b>115</b> may be configured with multiple downlink component carriers and one or more uplink component carriers according to a carrier aggregation configuration. Carrier aggregation may be used with both frequency division duplexing (FDD) and time division duplexing (TDD) component carriers.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some examples (e.g., in a carrier aggregation configuration), a carrier may also have acquisition signaling or control signaling that coordinates operations for other carriers. A carrier may be associated with a frequency channel (e.g., an evolved universal mobile telecommunication system terrestrial radio access (E-UTRA) absolute RF channel number (EARFCN)) and may be positioned according to a channel raster  for discovery by the UEs <b>115</b>. A carrier may be operated in a standalone mode where initial acquisition and connection may be conducted by the UEs <b>115</b> via the carrier, or the carrier may be operated in a non-standalone mode where a connection is anchored using a different carrier (e.g., of the same or a different radio access technology).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The communication links <b>125</b> shown in the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include uplink transmissions from a UE <b>115</b> to a base station <b>105</b>, or downlink transmissions from a base station <b>105</b> to a UE <b>115</b>. Carriers may carry downlink or uplink communications (e.g., in an FDD mode) or may be configured to carry downlink and uplink communications (e.g., in a TDD mode).</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A carrier may be associated with a particular bandwidth of the RF spectrum, and in some examples the carrier bandwidth may be referred to as a &#x201c;system bandwidth&#x201d; of the carrier or the wireless communications system <b>100</b>. For example, the carrier bandwidth may be one of a number of determined bandwidths for carriers of a particular radio access technology (e.g., 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, or 80 megahertz (MHz)). Devices of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> (e.g., the base stations <b>105</b>, the UEs <b>115</b>, or both) may have hardware configurations that support communications over a particular carrier bandwidth or may be configurable to support communications over one of a set of carrier bandwidths. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include base stations <b>105</b> or UEs <b>115</b> that support simultaneous communications via carriers associated with multiple carrier bandwidths. In some examples, each served UE <b>115</b> may be configured for operating over portions (e.g., a sub-band, a BWP) or all of a carrier bandwidth.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Signal waveforms transmitted over a carrier may be made up of multiple subcarriers (e.g., using multi-carrier modulation (MCM) techniques such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) or discrete Fourier transform spread OFDM (DFT-S-OFDM)). In a system employing MCM techniques, a resource element may consist of one symbol period (e.g., a duration of one modulation symbol) and one subcarrier, where the symbol period and subcarrier spacing are inversely related. The number of bits carried by each resource element may depend on the modulation scheme (e.g., the order of the modulation scheme, the coding rate of the modulation scheme, or both). Thus, the more resource elements that a UE <b>115</b> receives and the higher the order of the modulation scheme, the higher the data rate may be for the UE <b>115</b>. A wireless  communications resource may refer to a combination of an RF spectrum resource, a time resource, and a spatial resource (e.g., spatial layers or beams), and the use of multiple spatial layers may further increase the data rate or data integrity for communications with a UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">One or more numerologies for a carrier may be supported, where a numerology may include a subcarrier spacing (&#x394;f) and a cyclic prefix. A carrier may be divided into one or more BWPs having the same or different numerologies. In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may be configured with multiple BWPs. In some examples, a single BWP for a carrier may be active at a given time and communications for the UE <b>115</b> may be restricted to one or more active BWPs.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The time intervals for the base stations <b>105</b> or the UEs <b>115</b> may be expressed in multiples of a basic time unit which may, for example, refer to a sampling period of T<sub>S</sub>=1/(&#x394;f<sub>max</sub>&#xb7;N<sub>f</sub>) seconds, where &#x394;f<sub>max </sub>may represent the maximum supported subcarrier spacing, and N<sub>f </sub>may represent the maximum supported discrete Fourier transform (DFT) size. Time intervals of a communications resource may be organized according to radio frames each having a specified duration (e.g., 10 milliseconds (ms)). Each radio frame may be identified by a system frame number (SFN) (e.g., ranging from 0 to 1023).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Each frame may include multiple consecutively numbered subframes or slots, and each subframe or slot may have the same duration. In some examples, a frame may be divided (e.g., in the time domain) into subframes, and each subframe may be further divided into a number of slots. Alternatively, each frame may include a variable number of slots, and the number of slots may depend on subcarrier spacing. Each slot may include a number of symbol periods (e.g., depending on the length of the cyclic prefix prepended to each symbol period). In some wireless communications systems <b>100</b>, a slot may further be divided into multiple mini-slots containing one or more symbols. Excluding the cyclic prefix, each symbol period may contain one or more (e.g., N<sub>f</sub>) sampling periods. The duration of a symbol period may depend on the subcarrier spacing or frequency band of operation.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">A subframe, a slot, a mini-slot, or a symbol may be the smallest scheduling unit (e.g., in the time domain) of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> and may be  referred to as a transmission time interval (TTI). In some examples, the TTI duration (e.g., the number of symbol periods in a TTI) may be variable. Additionally or alternatively, the smallest scheduling unit of the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be dynamically selected (e.g., in bursts of shortened TTIs (sTTIs)).</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Physical channels may be multiplexed on a carrier according to various techniques. A physical control channel and a physical data channel may be multiplexed on a downlink carrier, for example, using one or more of time division multiplexing (TDM) techniques, frequency division multiplexing (FDM) techniques, or hybrid TDM-FDM techniques. A control region (e.g., a control resource set (CORESET)) for a physical control channel may be defined by a number of symbol periods and may extend across the system bandwidth or a subset of the system bandwidth of the carrier. One or more control regions (e.g., CORESETs) may be configured for a set of the UEs <b>115</b>. For example, one or more of the UEs <b>115</b> may monitor or search control regions for control information according to one or more search space sets, and each search space set may include one or multiple control channel candidates in one or more aggregation levels arranged in a cascaded manner. An aggregation level for a control channel candidate may refer to a number of control channel resources (e.g., control channel elements (CCEs)) associated with encoded information for a control information format having a given payload size. Search space sets may include common search space sets configured for sending control information to multiple UEs <b>115</b> and UE-specific search space sets for sending control information to a specific UE <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Each base station <b>105</b> may provide communication coverage via one or more cells, for example a macro cell, a small cell, a hot spot, or other types of cells, or any combination thereof. The term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; may refer to a logical communication entity used for communication with a base station <b>105</b> (e.g., over a carrier) and may be associated with an identifier for distinguishing neighboring cells (e.g., a physical cell identifier (PCID), a virtual cell identifier (VCID), or others). In some examples, a cell may also refer to a geographic coverage area <b>110</b> or a portion of a geographic coverage area <b>110</b> (e.g., a sector) over which the logical communication entity operates. Such cells may range from smaller areas (e.g., a structure, a subset of structure) to larger areas depending on various factors such as the capabilities of the base station <b>105</b>. For  example, a cell may be or include a building, a subset of a building, or exterior spaces between or overlapping with geographic coverage areas <b>110</b>, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some examples, a base station <b>105</b> may be movable and therefore provide communication coverage for a moving geographic coverage area <b>110</b>. In some examples, different geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> associated with different technologies may overlap, but the different geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> may be supported by the same base station <b>105</b>. In other examples, the overlapping geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> associated with different technologies may be supported by different base stations <b>105</b>. The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may include, for example, a heterogeneous network in which different types of the base stations <b>105</b> provide coverage for various geographic coverage areas <b>110</b> using the same or different radio access technologies.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support synchronous or asynchronous operation. For synchronous operation, the base stations <b>105</b> may have similar frame timings, and transmissions from different base stations <b>105</b> may be approximately aligned in time. For asynchronous operation, the base stations <b>105</b> may have different frame timings, and transmissions from different base stations <b>105</b> may, in some examples, not be aligned in time. The techniques described herein may be used for either synchronous or asynchronous operations.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Some UEs <b>115</b>, such as MTC or IoT devices, may be low cost or low complexity devices and may provide for automated communication between machines (e.g., via Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication). M2M communication or MTC may refer to data communication technologies that allow devices to communicate with one another or a base station <b>105</b> without human intervention. In some examples, M2M communication or MTC may include communications from devices that integrate sensors or meters to measure or capture information and relay such information to a central server or application program that makes use of the information or presents the information to humans interacting with the application program. Some UEs <b>115</b> may be designed to collect information or enable automated behavior of machines or other devices. Examples of applications for MTC devices include smart metering, inventory monitoring, water level monitoring, equipment monitoring, healthcare monitoring, wildlife monitoring, weather and geological event monitoring, fleet management and  tracking, remote security sensing, physical access control, and transaction-based business charging.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Some UEs <b>115</b> may be configured to employ operating modes that reduce power consumption, such as half-duplex communications (e.g., a mode that supports one-way communication via transmission or reception, but not transmission and reception simultaneously). In some examples, half-duplex communications may be performed at a reduced peak rate. Other power conservation techniques for the UEs <b>115</b> include entering a power saving deep sleep mode when not engaging in active communications, operating over a limited bandwidth (e.g., according to narrowband communications), or a combination of these techniques. For example, some UEs <b>115</b> may be configured for operation using a narrowband protocol type that is associated with a defined portion or range (e.g., set of subcarriers or resource blocks (RBs)) within a carrier, within a guard-band of a carrier, or outside of a carrier.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be configured to support ultra-reliable communications or low-latency communications, or various combinations thereof. For example, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be configured to support ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) or mission critical communications. The UEs <b>115</b> may be designed to support ultra-reliable, low-latency, or critical functions (e.g., mission critical functions). Ultra-reliable communications may include private communication or group communication and may be supported by one or more mission critical services such as mission critical push-to-talk (MCPTT), mission critical video (MCVideo), or mission critical data (MCData). Support for mission critical functions may include prioritization of services, and mission critical services may be used for public safety or general commercial applications. The terms ultra-reliable, low-latency, mission critical, and ultra-reliable low-latency may be used interchangeably herein.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some examples, a UE <b>115</b> may also be able to communicate directly with other UEs <b>115</b> over a D2D communication link <b>135</b> (e.g., using a peer-to-peer (P<b>2</b>P) or D2D protocol). One or more UEs <b>115</b> utilizing D2D communications may be within the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a base station <b>105</b>. Other UEs <b>115</b> in such a group may be outside the geographic coverage area <b>110</b> of a base station <b>105</b> or be otherwise unable to receive transmissions from a base station <b>105</b>. In some examples, groups of  the UEs <b>115</b> communicating via D2D communications may utilize a one-to-many (1:M) system in which each UE <b>115</b> transmits to every other UE <b>115</b> in the group. In some examples, a base station <b>105</b> facilitates the scheduling of resources for D2D communications. In other cases, D2D communications are carried out between the UEs <b>115</b> without the involvement of a base station <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some systems, the D2D communication link <b>135</b> may be an example of a communication channel, such as a sidelink communication channel, between vehicles (e.g., UEs <b>115</b>). In some examples, vehicles may communicate using V2X communications, V2V communications, or some combination of these. A vehicle may signal information related to traffic conditions, signal scheduling, weather, safety, emergencies, or any other information relevant to a V2X system. In some examples, vehicles in a V2X system may communicate with roadside infrastructure, such as roadside units, or with the network via one or more network nodes (e.g., base stations <b>105</b>) using vehicle-to-network (V2N) communications, or with both.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The core network <b>130</b> may provide user authentication, access authorization, tracking, Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity, and other access, routing, or mobility functions. The core network <b>130</b> may be an evolved packet core (EPC) or 5G core (5GC), which may include at least one control plane entity that manages access and mobility (e.g., a mobility management entity (MME), an access and mobility management function (AMF)) and at least one user plane entity that routes packets or interconnects to external networks (e.g., a serving gateway (S-GW), a Packet Data Network (PDN) gateway (P-GW), or a user plane function (UPF)). The control plane entity may manage non-access stratum (NAS) functions such as mobility, authentication, and bearer management for the UEs <b>115</b> served by the base stations <b>105</b> associated with the core network <b>130</b>. User IP packets may be transferred through the user plane entity, which may provide IP address allocation as well as other functions. The user plane entity may be connected to IP services <b>150</b> for one or more network operators. The IP services <b>150</b> may include access to the Internet, Intranet(s), an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), or a Packet-Switched Streaming Service.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Some of the network devices, such as a base station <b>105</b>, may include subcomponents such as an access network entity <b>140</b>, which may be an example of an access node controller (ANC). Each access network entity <b>140</b> may communicate with  the UEs <b>115</b> through one or more other access network transmission entities <b>145</b>, which may be referred to as radio heads, smart radio heads, or transmission/reception points (TRPs). Each access network transmission entity <b>145</b> may include one or more antenna panels. In some configurations, various functions of each access network entity <b>140</b> or base station <b>105</b> may be distributed across various network devices (e.g., radio heads and ANCs) or consolidated into a single network device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may operate using one or more frequency bands, typically in the range of 300 megahertz (MHz) to 300 gigahertz (GHz). Generally, the region from 300 MHz to 3 GHz is known as the ultra-high frequency (UHF) region or decimeter band because the wavelengths range from approximately one decimeter to one meter in length. The UHF waves may be blocked or redirected by buildings and environmental features, but the waves may penetrate structures sufficiently for a macro cell to provide service to the UEs <b>115</b> located indoors. The transmission of UHF waves may be associated with smaller antennas and shorter ranges (e.g., less than 100 kilometers) compared to transmission using the smaller frequencies and longer waves of the high frequency (HF) or very high frequency (VHF) portion of the spectrum below 300 MHz.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may also operate in a super high frequency (SHF) region using frequency bands from 3 GHz to 30 GHz, also known as the centimeter band, or in an extremely high frequency (EHF) region of the spectrum (e.g., from 30 GHz to 300 GHz), also known as the millimeter band. In some examples, the wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support millimeter wave (mmW) communications between the UEs <b>115</b> and the base stations <b>105</b>, and EHF antennas of the respective devices may be smaller and more closely spaced than UHF antennas. In some examples, this may facilitate use of antenna arrays within a device. The propagation of EHF transmissions, however, may be subject to even greater atmospheric attenuation and shorter range than SHF or UHF transmissions. The techniques disclosed herein may be employed across transmissions that use one or more different frequency regions, and designated use of bands across these frequency regions may differ by country or regulating body.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may utilize both licensed and unlicensed RF spectrum bands. For example, the wireless communications system <b>100</b>  may employ License Assisted Access (LAA), LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) radio access technology, or NR technology in an unlicensed band such as the 5 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band. When operating in unlicensed RF spectrum bands, devices such as the base stations <b>105</b> and the UEs <b>115</b> may employ carrier sensing for collision detection and avoidance. In some examples, operations in unlicensed bands may be based on a carrier aggregation configuration in conjunction with component carriers operating in a licensed band (e.g., LAA). Operations in unlicensed spectrum may include downlink transmissions, uplink transmissions, P2P transmissions, or D2D transmissions, among other examples.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">A base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may be equipped with multiple antennas, which may be used to employ techniques such as transmit diversity, receive diversity, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, or beamforming. The antennas of a base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may be located within one or more antenna arrays or antenna panels, which may support MIMO operations or transmit or receive beamforming. For example, one or more base station antennas or antenna arrays may be co-located at an antenna assembly, such as an antenna tower. In some examples, antennas or antenna arrays associated with a base station <b>105</b> may be located in diverse geographic locations. A base station <b>105</b> may have an antenna array with a number of rows and columns of antenna ports that the base station <b>105</b> may use to support beamforming of communications with a UE <b>115</b>. Likewise, a UE <b>115</b> may have one or more antenna arrays that may support various MIMO or beamforming operations. Additionally or alternatively, an antenna panel may support RF beamforming for a signal transmitted via an antenna port.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">The base stations <b>105</b> or the UEs <b>115</b> may use MIMO communications to exploit multipath signal propagation and increase the spectral efficiency by transmitting or receiving multiple signals via different spatial layers. Such techniques may be referred to as spatial multiplexing. The multiple signals may, for example, be transmitted by the transmitting device via different antennas or different combinations of antennas. Likewise, the multiple signals may be received by the receiving device via different antennas or different combinations of antennas. Each of the multiple signals may be referred to as a separate spatial stream and may carry bits associated with the same data stream (e.g., the same codeword) or different data streams (e.g., different  codewords). Different spatial layers may be associated with different antenna ports used for channel measurement and reporting. MIMO techniques include single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO), where multiple spatial layers are transmitted to the same receiving device, and multiple-user MIMO (MU-MIMO), where multiple spatial layers are transmitted to multiple devices.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Beamforming, which may also be referred to as spatial filtering, directional transmission, or directional reception, is a signal processing technique that may be used at a transmitting device or a receiving device (e.g., a base station <b>105</b>, a UE <b>115</b>) to shape or steer an antenna beam (e.g., a transmit beam, a receive beam) along a spatial path between the transmitting device and the receiving device. Beamforming may be achieved by combining the signals communicated via antenna elements of an antenna array such that some signals propagating at particular orientations with respect to an antenna array experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. The adjustment of signals communicated via the antenna elements may include a transmitting device or a receiving device applying amplitude offsets, phase offsets, or both to signals carried via the antenna elements associated with the device. The adjustments associated with each of the antenna elements may be defined by a beamforming weight set associated with a particular orientation (e.g., with respect to the antenna array of the transmitting device or receiving device, or with respect to some other orientation).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">A base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b> may use beam sweeping techniques as part of beam forming operations. For example, a base station <b>105</b> may use multiple antennas or antenna arrays (e.g., antenna panels) to conduct beamforming operations for directional communications with a UE <b>115</b>. Some signals (e.g., synchronization signals, reference signals, beam selection signals, or other control signals) may be transmitted by a base station <b>105</b> multiple times in different directions. For example, the base station <b>105</b> may transmit a signal according to different beamforming weight sets associated with different directions of transmission. Transmissions in different beam directions may be used to identify (e.g., by a transmitting device, such as a base station <b>105</b>, or by a receiving device, such as a UE <b>115</b>) a beam direction for later transmission or reception by the base station <b>105</b>. </p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Some signals, such as data signals associated with a particular receiving device, may be transmitted by a base station <b>105</b> in a single beam direction (e.g., a direction associated with the receiving device, such as a UE <b>115</b>). In some examples, the beam direction associated with transmissions along a single beam direction may be determined based on a signal that was transmitted in one or more beam directions. For example, a UE <b>115</b> may receive one or more of the signals transmitted by the base station <b>105</b> in different directions and may report to the base station <b>105</b> an indication of the signal that the UE <b>115</b> received with a highest signal quality or an otherwise acceptable signal quality.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In some examples, transmissions by a device (e.g., by a base station <b>105</b> or a UE <b>115</b>) may be performed using multiple beam directions, and the device may use a combination of digital precoding or RF beamforming to generate a combined beam for transmission (e.g., from a base station <b>105</b> to a UE <b>115</b>). The UE <b>115</b> may report feedback that indicates precoding weights for one or more beam directions, and the feedback may correspond to a configured number of beams across a system bandwidth or one or more sub-bands. The base station <b>105</b> may transmit a reference signal (e.g., a cell-specific reference signal (CRS), a channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS)), which may be precoded or unprecoded. The UE <b>115</b> may provide feedback for beam selection, which may be a precoding matrix indicator (PMI) or codebook-based feedback (e.g., a multi-panel type codebook, a linear combination type codebook, a port selection type codebook). Although these techniques are described with reference to signals transmitted in one or more directions by a base station <b>105</b>, a UE <b>115</b> may employ similar techniques for transmitting signals multiple times in different directions (e.g., for identifying a beam direction for subsequent transmission or reception by the UE <b>115</b>) or for transmitting a signal in a single direction (e.g., for transmitting data to a receiving device).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">A receiving device (e.g., a UE <b>115</b>) may try multiple receive configurations (e.g., directional listening) when receiving various signals from the base station <b>105</b>, such as synchronization signals, reference signals, beam selection signals, or other control signals. For example, a receiving device may try multiple receive directions by receiving via different antenna subarrays, by processing received signals according to different antenna subarrays, by receiving according to different receive beamforming  weight sets (e.g., different directional listening weight sets) applied to signals received at multiple antenna elements of an antenna array, or by processing received signals according to different receive beamforming weight sets applied to signals received at multiple antenna elements of an antenna array, any of which may be referred to as &#x201c;listening&#x201d; according to different receive configurations or receive directions. In some examples, a receiving device may use a single receive configuration to receive along a single beam direction (e.g., when receiving a data signal). The single receive configuration may be aligned in a beam direction determined based on listening according to different receive configuration directions (e.g., a beam direction determined to have a highest signal strength, highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or otherwise acceptable signal quality based on listening according to multiple beam directions).</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">The wireless communications system <b>100</b> may be a packet-based network that operates according to a layered protocol stack. In the user plane, communications at the bearer or Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) layer may be IP-based. A Radio Link Control (RLC) layer may perform packet segmentation and reassembly to communicate over logical channels. A Medium Access Control (MAC) layer may perform priority handling and multiplexing of logical channels into transport channels. The MAC layer may also use error detection techniques, error correction techniques, or both to support retransmissions at the MAC layer to improve link efficiency. In the control plane, the Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol layer may provide establishment, configuration, and maintenance of an RRC connection between a UE <b>115</b> and a base station <b>105</b> or a core network <b>130</b> supporting radio bearers for user plane data. At the physical layer, transport channels may be mapped to physical channels.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The UEs <b>115</b> and the base stations <b>105</b> may support retransmissions of data to increase the likelihood that data is received successfully. Hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) feedback is one technique for increasing the likelihood that data is received correctly over a communication link <b>125</b>. HARQ may include a combination of error detection (e.g., using a cyclic redundancy check (CRC)), forward error correction (FEC), and retransmission (e.g., automatic repeat request (ARQ)). HARQ may improve throughput at the MAC layer in poor radio conditions (e.g., low signal-to-noise conditions). In some examples, a device may support same-slot HARQ feedback,  where the device may provide HARQ feedback in a specific slot for data received in a previous symbol in the slot. In other cases, the device may provide HARQ feedback in a subsequent slot, or according to some other time interval.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Wireless communications system <b>100</b> may support communication between one or more wireless devices.

In some cases, such techniques may provide power savings over the exclusive use of DRMS-pattems per subchannel.
