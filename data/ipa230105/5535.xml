Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrating an implementation example of the STT-MRAM, the memory cell MC may include an MTJ element <b>20</b> and a selection transistor CT.

Also, the other electrode of the selection transistor CT may be connected to a source line (e.g., a first source line SL<b>0</b>). The MTJ element <b>20</b> may include a fixed layer <b>23</b>, a free layer <b>21</b>, and a tunnel layer <b>22</b> formed therebetween. A magnetization direction of the fixed layer <b>23</b> is fixed, and a magnetization direction of the free layer <b>21</b> may be the same as or opposite to that of the fixed layer <b>23</b> depending on conditions.

In some example embodiments, when an excessive read current flows to the bit line BL<b>0</b>, the magnetization direction of the free layer <b>21</b> may be altered, and accordingly, data stored in the MTJ element <b>20</b> may be altered.

Also, when the normal memory cell indicates a second resistance state (e.g., data &#x2018;0&#x2019;), the variable resistance element of the normal memory cell may have a second resistance value. A resistance value of a variable resistance element of the reference memory cell may have an intermediate value between the first resistance value and the second resistance value.

The target read current may refer to a maximum bit line current. A reference clamp voltage V<sub>CLAMP_REF </sub>may be a voltage generated by the target read current determined by the read reference current generator <b>30</b>.
