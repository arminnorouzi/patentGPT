APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application Nos. 10-2021-0150527 and 10-2021-0087334, filed on Nov. 4, 2021 and Jul. 2, 2021, respectively, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entireties.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">Technical Field</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a combustor of a liquid rocket engine, and more particularly, to a combustor of a liquid rocket engine, in which a fuel manifold can be miniaturized, and which can achieve improvement of cooling efficiency and structural strength of a nozzle neck.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Background Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">A rocket is an aircraft projected by the repulsive force that is generated as high-temperature and high-pressure fuel is generated and ejected, and includes a combustor that burns the propellant, and a nozzle for accelerating the gas produced in the combustor to give direction.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since there occurs very large heat transfer as the high-temperature and high-pressure combustion gas generated in the combustion chamber of the rocket flows along the walls of the combustion chamber, sufficient cooling is required to protect the walls. One method of protecting the combustion chamber wall surface from the high heat described above is to use a regenerative cooling method which reuses the propellant used for cooling the combustion chamber for combustion.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Meanwhile, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the related combustor of the liquid rocket engine has a structure in which a nozzle neck <b>100</b> is recessed inward in an hourglass shape, and includes a nozzle neck stiffener <b>200</b> surrounding the nozzle neck <b>100</b> in an annular shape to support the nozzle neck <b>100</b> and prevent the nozzle neck <b>100</b> having a small diameter from being damaged by the vibration of the engine.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, a bell-type expanded nozzle unit <b>400</b> includes a donut-shaped fuel inlet <b>300</b> which serves to distribute the fuel compressed by the turbo pump for the regenerative cooling of an expanded nozzle unit <b>400</b> and the combustor chamber, and then inject into the combustion chamber.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the related combustor of the liquid rocket engine has a problem in that, since the fuel inlet is positioned at a portion having a relatively large diameter, it increases the diameter and also the weight of the combustor including the fuel manifold, and it is difficult to apply the 3D printing method to manufacture.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure has been made to solve the problems described above, and an object of the present disclosure is to provide a combustor of a liquid rocket engine, in which a fuel manifold can be miniaturized, and which can achieve improvement of cooling efficiency and structural strength of a nozzle neck, and the like, and can apply 3D printing technology.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to achieve the objects mentioned above, a combustor according to an embodiment is provided, which may include a nozzle unit including a regenerative cooling channel, in which the nozzle unit may include a fuel manifold outer shell, a combustor inner shell, and a combustor outer shell having a downward channel inlet, and the combustor may include a fuel inlet connected to a nozzle neck of the nozzle unit, a fuel manifold formed between the fuel manifold outer shell and the combustor outer shell, and in which fuel introduced from the fuel inlet flows, a downward channel connected in communication with the fuel manifold through the downward channel inlet, and extending in a downward direction from an upper portion of the combustor, a diverting manifold provided at a distal end of the nozzle unit and connected in communication with the downward channel, and an upward channel connected in communication with the diverting manifold and extending in an upward direction of the combustor.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, the downward channel may be formed between an inner wall of the combustor outer shell and an outer wall of the combustor inner shell, the upward channel may extend upwards and downwards through an inside of the combustor inner shell, and the upward channel and the downward channel may be spaced apart from each other.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In addition, the diverting manifold may be formed in an annular shape, and cause fuel from the downward channel to flow toward the upward channel.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, the fuel manifold outer shell may be connected to the fuel inlet and the combustor outer shell, respectively.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, the upward channel may be branched into first and second upward channels positioned respectively on both sides of the downward channel, and then joined into the single upward channel at a predetermined point.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, the nozzle neck may not be provided with a nozzle neck stiffener for supporting the nozzle neck.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In addition, the downward channel may include an annular portion formed along an inner wall of the combustor outer shell, and a radial portion extending toward the annular portion and positioned between the first and second upward channels.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The combustor of the liquid rocket engine having the configuration described above according to embodiments has the following effects.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment, the nozzle neck stiffener for supporting the nozzle neck is not required, and the fuel inlet and the fuel manifold are arranged at the nozzle neck of the nozzle unit where the structure may be the weakest in the nozzle unit to implement a shape that does not require a separate support structure, thereby reducing the weight of the combustor of the liquid rocket engine.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, compared to the related combustor in which the manifold is arranged at a lower part of the nozzle unit, i.e., at the expanded nozzle unit, a manifold having a relatively smaller diameter can be used and accordingly, the weight of the fuel manifold itself can also be reduced.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, while it is difficult to apply 3D printing technology to the related combustor that has the fuel manifold located in the expanded nozzle unit and thus has an increased diameter due to the size of the fuel manifold, it is possible to apply the 3D printing technology having size restrictions to the embodiment of the present disclosure and reduce the manufacturing cost.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, since the heat of the nozzle neck can be cooled by introducing fuel through the fuel manifold arranged at the nozzle neck where the most heat is generated, it is advantageous in improving the cooling effect and the structural strength of the nozzle neck.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Meanwhile, although the present disclosure is not explicitly described, it also includes other effects that can be expected from the configuration described above.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

reference to the accompanying drawings, that will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art to which the present disclosure pertains. However, the description proposed herein is just a preferable example for the purpose of illustrations only, not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure, so it should be understood that other equivalents and modifications could be made thereto without departing from the scope of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, a combustor of a liquid rocket engine according to an embodiment (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;combustor of liquid rocket engine&#x201d;) includes a nozzle unit <b>1</b> having a regenerative cooling channel.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the combustor of liquid rocket engine, the nozzle unit <b>1</b> includes a fuel manifold outer shell <b>3</b>, a combustor inner shell <b>4</b>, and a combustor outer shell <b>9</b> having a downward channel inlet <b>92</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b></figref>, and the like, the combustor of liquid rocket engine includes a fuel inlet <b>2</b>, a fuel manifold <b>5</b>, a downward channel <b>6</b>, a diverting manifold <b>7</b>, and an upward channel <b>8</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In particular, in an embodiment, a nozzle neck <b>11</b> is not provided with a nozzle neck stiffener for supporting the nozzle neck <b>11</b>, and the fuel inlet <b>2</b> is connected to the nozzle neck <b>11</b> of the nozzle unit <b>1</b>. Specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the fuel inlet <b>2</b> is connected to the fuel manifold outer shell <b>3</b> such that an outlet <b>21</b> of the fuel inlet <b>2</b> is connected in communication with the fuel manifold <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described above, the related combustor is provided with the nozzle neck stiffener for supporting the nozzle neck and prevent the nozzle neck having a small diameter from being damaged by engine vibration, and the bell-type expanded nozzle unit includes the donut-shaped fuel manifold. However, in an embodiment, the nozzle neck stiffener for supporting the nozzle neck <b>11</b> is not required, and the fuel inlet <b>2</b>, the fuel manifold <b>5</b>, and the fuel manifold outer shell <b>3</b> are arranged at the nozzle neck <b>11</b> where the structure may be weakest in the nozzle unit <b>1</b>, thereby achieving the function of the related nozzle neck stiffener. Accordingly, the weight of the combustor of the liquid rocket engine can be reduced according to the removal of the nozzle neck stiffener, and compared to the related combustor in which the manifold is arranged at a lower part of the nozzle unit, i.e., at the expanded nozzle unit, a manifold having a relatively smaller diameter can be used and accordingly, the weight of the fuel manifold itself can also be reduced.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition, while it is difficult to apply 3D printing technology to the related combustor that has the fuel manifold located in the expanded nozzle unit and thus has an increased diameter due to the size of the fuel manifold, it is possible to apply the 3D printing technology to the embodiment of the present disclosure and reduce the manufacturing cost. In addition, by introducing fuel through the fuel manifold disposed at the nozzle neck where generally the most heat is generated, the heat of the nozzle neck can be cooled, and accordingly, it is more advantageous in improving the cooling effect and the structural strength of the nozzle neck.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Meanwhile, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> to <b>5</b></figref>, the fuel manifold <b>5</b> is formed between the fuel manifold outer shell <b>3</b> and the combustor outer shell <b>9</b>, and fuel F is introduced through the fuel inlet <b>2</b> and flows.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The fuel manifold outer shell <b>3</b> is connected to the fuel inlet <b>2</b> and the combustor outer shell <b>9</b>, respectively.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the downward channel <b>6</b> is connected in communication with the fuel manifold <b>5</b> through the downward channel inlet <b>92</b> and extends from an upward direction of the combustor (upper direction based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>6</b></figref>) to a downward direction (lower direction based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>6</b></figref>). The fuel introduced through the fuel inlet <b>2</b> flows into the downward channel <b>6</b> through the downward channel inlet <b>92</b> and flows in a downward direction of the combustor (F<b>1</b>). Specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, when viewed in the cross section taken along the line C-C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the downward channel <b>6</b> is formed between an inner wall <b>41</b> of the combustor inner shell <b>4</b> and an inner wall <b>91</b> of the combustor outer shell <b>9</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the downward channel <b>6</b> includes an annular portion <b>61</b> formed along the inner wall <b>91</b> of the combustor outer shell <b>9</b>, and a radial portion <b>62</b> extending toward the annular portion <b>61</b> and positioned between first and second upward channels <b>81</b> and <b>82</b>.
