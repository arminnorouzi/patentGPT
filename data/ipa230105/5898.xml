As the second functional layer RL is formed by alternately stacking the first inorganic films <b>811</b> and the second inorganic films <b>812</b>, which have a different refractive index from the first inorganic films <b>711</b>, to repeatedly generate a change in refractive index, the transmittance of light incident upon the second functional layer RL varies depending on the incidence angle of the light. The reflectance of light incident upon the second functional layer RL can be controlled depending on the incidence angle of the light by controlling the materials and thicknesses of the first inorganic films <b>811</b> and the second inorganic films <b>812</b> and the number of inorganic films included in the second functional layer RL.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0255">For example, the thicknesses of the first inorganic films <b>811</b> and the second inorganic films <b>812</b> may be controlled depending on the wavelength and the refractive index of light, to maximize the reflectance of light incident upon the second functional layer RL. If the refractive index of refractive layers (or inorganic films) is n and light to be reflected has a wavelength of &#x3bb;<sub>1</sub>, light having a wavelength of &#x3bb;<sub>1 </sub>can be effectively reflected by alternately stacking low- and high-refractive layers with a thickness of (&#x3bb;<sub>1</sub>)/(4n).</p><p id="p-0257" num="0256">The transmittance (or reflectance) of light incident upon the second functional layer RL may vary depending on the incidence angle of the light.
