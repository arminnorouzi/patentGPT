Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application relates to the general field of Integrated Circuit (IC) devices and fabrication methods, and more particularly to multilayer or Three Dimensional Integrated Circuit (3D IC) devices and fabrication methods.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Discussion of Background Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Performance enhancements and cost reductions in generations of electronic device technology has generally been achieved by reducing the size of the device, resulting in an enhancement in device speed and a reduction in the area of the device, and hence, its cost. This may be generally referred to as &#x2018;device scaling&#x2019;. The dominant electronic device technology in use today may be the Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) technology.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Performance and cost are driven by transistor scaling and the interconnection, or wiring, between those transistors. As the dimensions of the device elements have approached the nanometer scale, the interconnection wiring now dominates the performance, power, and density of integrated circuit devices as described in J. A. Davis, et.al., Proc. IEEE, vol. 89, no. 3, pp. 305-324, March 2001 (Davis).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Davis further teaches that three dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs), i.e. electronic chips in which active layers of transistors are stacked one above the other, separated by insulating oxides and connected to each other by metal interconnect wires, may be the best way to continue Moore's Law, especially as device scaling slows, stops, or becomes too costly to continue. 3D integration would provide shorter interconnect wiring and hence improved performance, lower power consumption, and higher density devices.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One approach to a practical implementation of a 3D IC independently processes two fully interconnected integrated circuits including transistors and wiring, thins one of the wafers, bonds the two wafers together, and then makes electrical connections between the bonded wafers with Thru Silicon Vias (TSV) that may be fabricated prior to or after the bonding. This approach may be less than satisfactory as the density of TSVs may be limited, because they may require large landing pads for the TSVs to overcome the poor wafer to wafer alignment and to allow for the large (about one to ten micron) diameter of the TSVs as a result of the thickness of the wafers bonded together. Additionally, handling and processing thinned silicon wafers may be very difficult and prone to yield loss. Current prototypes of this approach only obtain TSV densities of 10,000s per chip, in comparison to the millions of interconnections currently obtainable within a single chip.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">By utilizing Silicon On Insulator (SOI) wafers and glass handle wafers, A. W. Topol, et.al, in the IEDM Tech Digest, p 363-5 (2005), describe attaining TSVs of tenths of microns. The TSV density may be still limited as a result from misalignment issues resulting from pre-forming the random circuitry on both wafers prior to wafer bonding. In addition, SOI wafers are more costly than bulk silicon wafers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another approach may be to monolithically build transistors on top of a wafer of interconnected transistors. The utility of this approach may be limited by the requirement to maintain the reliability of the high performance lower layer interconnect metallization, such as, for example, aluminum and copper, and low-k intermetal dielectrics, and hence limits the allowable temperature exposure to below approximately 400&#xb0; C. Some of the processing steps to create useful transistor elements may require temperatures above about 700&#xb0; C., such as activating semiconductor doping or crystallization of a previously deposited amorphous material such as silicon to create a poly-crystalline silicon (polysilicon or poly) layer. It may be very difficult to achieve high performance transistors with only low temperature processing and without mono-crystalline silicon channels. However, this approach may be useful to construct memory devices where the transistor performance may not be critical.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Bakir and Meindl in the textbook &#x201c;Integrated Interconnect Technologies for 3D Nanosystems&#x201d;, Artech House, 2009, Chapter 13, illustrate a 3D stacked Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) where the silicon for the stacked transistors is produced using selective epitaxy technology or laser recrystallization. This concept may be unsatisfactory as the silicon processed in this manner may have a higher defect density when compared to single crystal silicon and hence may suffer in performance, stability, and control. It may also require higher temperatures than the underlying metallization or low-k intermetal dielectric could be exposed to without reliability concerns.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Sang-Yun Lee in U.S. Pat. No. 7,052,941 discloses methods to construct vertical transistors by preprocessing a single crystal silicon wafer with doping layers activated at high temperature, layer transferring the wafer to another wafer with preprocessed circuitry and metallization, and then forming vertical transistors from those doping layers with low temperature processing, such as etching silicon. This may be less than satisfactory as the semiconductor devices in the market today utilize horizontal or horizontally oriented transistors and it would be very difficult to convince the industry to move away from the horizontal. Additionally, the transistor performance may be less than satisfactory as a result from large parasitic capacitances and resistances in the vertical structures, and the lack of self-alignment of the transistor gate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">A key technology for 3D IC construction may be layer transfer, whereby a thin layer of a silicon wafer, called the donor wafer, may be transferred to another wafer, called the acceptor wafer, or target wafer. As described by L. DiCioccio, et. al., at ICICDT 2010 pg 110, the transfer of a thin (about tens of microns to tens of nanometers) layer of mono-crystalline silicon at low temperatures (below approximately 400&#xb0; C.) may be performed with low temperature direct oxide-oxide bonding, wafer thinning, and surface conditioning. This process is called &#x201c;Smart Stacking&#x201d; by Soitec (Crolles, France). In addition, the &#x201c;SmartCut&#x201d; process is a well understood technology used for fabrication of SOI wafers. The &#x201c;SmartCut&#x201d; process employs a hydrogen implant to enable cleaving of the donor wafer after the layer transfer. These processes with some variations and under different names may be commercially available from SiGen (Silicon Genesis Corporation, San Jose, Calif.). A room temperature wafer bonding process utilizing ion-beam preparation of the wafer surfaces in a vacuum has been recently demonstrated by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. This process allows room temperature layer transfer.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">There are many techniques to construct 3D stacked integrated circuits or chips including:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Through-silicon via (TSV) technology: Multiple layers of transistors (with or without wiring levels) can be constructed separately. Following this, they can be bonded to each other and connected to each other with through-silicon vias (TSVs).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Monolithic 3D technology: With this approach, multiple layers of transistors and wires can be monolithically constructed.

Acceptor substrate <b>100</b> may include elements such as, for example, transistors, alignment marks, metal layers, and metal connection strips. The metal layers may be utilized to interconnect the transistors. The acceptor substrate may also be called target wafer. The acceptor substrate <b>100</b> may be prepared for oxide to oxide wafer bonding by a deposition of an oxide <b>102</b>, and the acceptor substrate surface <b>104</b> may be made ready for low temperature bonding by various surface treatments, such as, for example, an RCA pre-clean that may include dilute ammonium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid, and may include plasma surface preparations, wherein gases such as oxygen, argon, and other gases or combinations of gases and plasma energies that changes the oxide surfaces so to lower the oxide to oxide bonding energy. In addition, polishes may be employed to achieve satisfactory flatness.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">A donor wafer or substrate <b>110</b> may be prepared for cleaving by an implant or implants of atomic species, such as, for example, Hydrogen and Helium, to form a layer transfer demarcation plane <b>199</b>, shown as a dashed line. Layer transfer demarcation plane <b>199</b> may be formed before or after other processing on the donor wafer or substrate <b>110</b>. The donor wafer or substrate <b>110</b> may be prepared for oxide to oxide wafer bonding by a deposition of an oxide <b>112</b>, and the donor wafer surface <b>114</b> may be made ready for low temperature bonding by various surface treatments, such as, for example, an RCA pre-clean that may include dilute ammonium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid, and may include plasma surface preparations, wherein gases such as oxygen, argon, and other gases or combinations of gases and plasma energies that change the oxide surfaces so to lower the oxide to oxide bonding energy.

Alignment of the donor wafer or substrate <b>110</b> with the acceptor substrate <b>100</b> may be performed immediately prior to the wafer bonding. Acceptable bond strengths may be obtained with bonding thermal cycles that do not exceed approximately 400&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The donor wafer or substrate <b>110</b> may be cleaved at or near the layer transfer demarcation plane <b>199</b> and removed leaving transferred layer <b>120</b> bonded and attached to acceptor substrate <b>100</b>, or target wafer. The cleaving may be accomplished by various applications of energy to the layer transfer demarcation plane, such as, for example, a mechanical strike by a knife, or jet of liquid or jet of air, or by local laser heating, or other suitable cleaving methods that propagate a fracture or separation approximately at the layer transfer demarcation plane <b>199</b>. The transferred layer <b>120</b> may be polished chemically and mechanically to provide a suitable surface for further processing. The transferred layer <b>120</b> may be of thickness approximately 200 nm or less to enable formation of nanometer sized thru layer vias and create a high density of interconnects between the donor wafer and acceptor wafer. The thinner the transferred layer <b>120</b>, the smaller the thru layer via diameter obtainable, as a result of maintaining manufacturable via aspect ratios. Thus, the transferred layer <b>120</b> may be, for example, less than about 2 microns thick, less than about 1 micron thick, less than about 0.4 microns thick, less than about 200 nm thick, less than about 150 nm thick, or less than about 100 nm thick. The thickness of the layer or layers transferred according to some embodiments of the invention may be designed as such to match and enable the most suitable lithographic resolution capability of the manufacturing process employed to create the thru layer vias or any other structures on the transferred layer or layers. The donor wafer or substrate <b>110</b> may now also be processed and reused for more layer transfers.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Transferred layer <b>120</b> may then be further processed to create a monolithic layer of interconnected devices <b>120</b>&#x2032; and the formation of thru layer vias (TLVs, or through-layer vias) to electrically couple (connection path) donor wafer circuitry with acceptor wafer circuitry. Alignment marks in acceptor substrate <b>100</b> and/or in transferred layer <b>120</b> may be utilized to contact transistors and circuitry in transferred layer <b>120</b> and electrically couple them to transistors and circuitry in the acceptor substrate <b>100</b>.

TLVs may be constructed mostly out of electrically conductive materials including, for example, copper, aluminum, conductive carbon, or tungsten. Barrier metals, including, for example, TiN and TaN, may be utilized to form TLVs.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Persons of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the illustrations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are exemplary only and are not drawn to scale. Such skilled persons will further appreciate that many variations are possible such as, for example, a heavily doped (greater than 1e20 atoms/cm3) boron layer or a silicon germanium (SiGe) layer may be utilized as an etch stop layer either within the ion-cut process flow, wherein the layer transfer demarcation plane may be placed within the etch stop layer or into the substrate material below, or the etch stop layers may be utilized without an implant cleave or ion-cut process and the donor wafer may be preferentially etched away until the etch stop layer may be reached. Such skilled persons will further appreciate that the oxide layer within an SOI or GeOI donor wafer may serve as the etch stop layer. Many other modifications within the scope of the invention will suggest themselves to such skilled persons after reading this specification. Thus the invention is to be limited only by the appended claims.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Alternatively, other technologies and techniques may be utilized for layer transfer as described in, for example, IBM's layer transfer method shown at IEDM 2005 by A. W. Topol, et. al. The IBM's layer transfer method employs a SOI technology and utilizes glass handle wafers. The donor circuit may be high-temperature processed on an SOI wafer, temporarily bonded to a borosilicate glass handle wafer, backside thinned by chemical mechanical polishing of the silicon and then the Buried Oxide (BOX) may be selectively etched off. The now thinned donor wafer may be subsequently aligned and low-temperature oxide-to-oxide bonded to the acceptor wafer topside. A low temperature release of the glass handle wafer from the thinned donor wafer may be next performed, and then thru layer via (or layer to layer) connections may be made.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Additionally, the inventors contemplate that other technology can be used. For example, an epitaxial liftoff (ELO) technology as shown by P. Demeester, et.al, of IMEC in Semiconductor Science Technology 1993 may be utilized for layer transfer. ELO makes use of the selective removal of a very thin sacrificial layer between the substrate and the layer structure to be transferred. The to-be-transferred layer of GaAs or silicon may be adhesively &#x2018;rolled&#x2019; up on a cylinder or removed from the substrate by utilizing a flexible carrier, such as, for example, black wax, to bow up the to-be-transferred layer structure when the selective etch, such as, for example, diluted Hydrofluoric (HF) Acid, etches the exposed release layer, such as, for example, the silicon oxide in SOI or a layer of AlAs. After liftoff, the transferred layer may be then aligned and bonded to the desired acceptor substrate or wafer. The manufacturability of the ELO process for multilayer layer transfer use was recently improved by J. Yoon, et. al., of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as described in Nature May 20, 2010.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Canon developed a layer transfer technology called ELTRAN&#x2014;Epitaxial Layer TRANsfer from porous silicon. ELTRAN may be utilized as a layer transfer method.

Epitaxial silicon may then be deposited on top of the porous silicon and then oxidized to form the SOI BOX. The seed wafer may be bonded to a handle wafer and the seed wafer may be split off by high pressure water directed at the porous silicon layer. The porous silicon may then be selectively etched off leaving a uniform silicon layer.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a drawing illustration of a generalized preprocessed wafer or layer <b>200</b>.

The high-k metal gate structure may be formed as follows. Following an industry standard HF/SC1/SC2 cleaning to create an atomically smooth surface, a high-k dielectric may be deposited. The semiconductor industry has chosen Hafnium-based dielectrics as the leading material of choice to replace SiO<sub>2 </sub>and Silicon oxynitride. The Hafnium-based family of dielectrics includes hafnium oxide and hafnium silicate/hafnium silicon oxynitride. Hafnium oxide, HfO<sub>2</sub>, may have a dielectric constant twice as much as that of hafnium silicate/hafnium silicon oxynitride (HfSiO/HfSiON k&#x2dc;15). The choice of the metal may be critical for the device to perform properly. A metal replacing N<sup>+</sup> poly as the gate electrode may need to have a work function of approximately 4.2 eV for the device to operate properly and at the right threshold voltage. Alternatively, a metal replacing P<sup>+</sup> poly as the gate electrode may need to have a work function of approximately 5.2 eV to operate properly. The TiAl and TiAlN based family of metals, for example, could be used to tune the work function of the metal from 4.2 eV to 5.2 eV.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Alternatively, a low temperature gate stack may be formed with a gate oxide formed by a microwave oxidation technique, such as, for example, the TEL SPA (Tokyo Electron Limited Slot Plane Antenna) oxygen radical plasma, that grows or deposits a low temperature Gate Dielectric to serve as the MOSFET gate oxide, or an atomic layer deposition (ALD) deposition technique may be utilized.

The thickness of the layer or layers transferred according to some embodiments of the invention may be designed as such to match and enable the most suitable obtainable lithographic resolution, such as, for example, less than about 10 nm, 14 nm, 22 nm or 28 nm linewidth resolution and alignment capability, such as, for example, less than about 5 nm, 10 nm, 20 nm, or 40 nm alignment accuracy/precision/error, of the manufacturing process employed to create the thru layer vias or any other structures on the transferred layer or layers.

The junction-less transistor structure avoids the increasingly sharply graded junctions necessary for sufficient separation between source and drain regions as silicon technology scales. This allows the JLT to have a thicker gate oxide than a conventional MOSFET for an equivalent performance. The junction-less transistor may also be known as a nanowire transistor without junctions, or gated resistor, or nanowire transistor as described in a paper by Jean-Pierre Colinge, et. al., (Colinge) published in Nature Nanotechnology on Feb. 21, 2010.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> the junction-less transistor may be constructed whereby the transistor channel may be a thin solid piece of evenly and heavily doped single crystal silicon. Single crystal silicon may also be referred to as mono-crystalline silicon. The doping concentration of the channel underneath the gate <b>406</b> and gate dielectric <b>408</b> may be identical to that of the source <b>404</b> and drain <b>402</b>. As a result of the high channel doping, the channel must be thin and narrow enough to allow for full depletion of the carriers when the device may be turned off. Additionally, the channel doping must be high enough to allow a reasonable current to flow when the device may be on. A multi-sided gate may provide increased control of the channel. The JLT may have a very small channel area (typically less than about 20 nm on one or more sides), so the gate can deplete the channel of charge carriers at approximately 0V and turn the source to drain current substantially off. I-V curves from Colinge of n channel and p channel junction-less transistors are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. This illustrates that the JLT can obtain comparable performance to the tri-gate transistor (junction-ed) that may be commonly researched and reported by transistor developers.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Turning the channel off with minimal leakage at an approximately zero gate bias may be a major challenge for a junction-less transistor device. To enhance gate control over the transistor channel, the channel may be doped unevenly; whereby the heaviest doping may be closest to the gate or gates and the channel doping may be lighter farther away from the gate electrode. For example, the cross-sectional center of a 2, 3, or 4 gate sided junction-less transistor channel may be more lightly doped than the edges. This may enable much lower transistor off currents for the same gate work function and control.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, drain to source current (Ids) as a function of the gate voltage (Vg) for various junction-less transistor channel doping levels may be simulated where the total thickness of the n-type channel may be about 20 nm. The y-axis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is plotted as logarithmic and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> as linear. Two of the four curves in each figure correspond to evenly doping the 20 nm channel thickness to 1E17 and 1E18 atoms/cm3, respectively. The remaining two curves show simulation results where the 20 nm channel has two layers of 10 nm thickness each. In the legend denotations for the remaining two curves, the first number corresponds to the 10 nm portion of the channel that is the closest to the gate electrode. For example, the curve D=1E18/1E17 illustrates the simulated results where the 10 nm channel portion doped at 1E18 is closest to the gate electrode while the 10 nm channel portion doped at 1E17 is farthest away from the gate electrode. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, curves <b>502</b> and <b>504</b> correspond to doping patterns of D=1E18/1E17 and D=1E17/1E18, respectively. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, at a Vg of 0 volts, the off current for the doping pattern of D=1E18/1E17 is approximately 50 times lower than that of the reversed doping pattern of D=1E17/1E18. Likewise, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, curves <b>506</b> and <b>508</b> correspond to doping patterns of D=1E18/1E17 and D=1E17/1E18, respectively. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> illustrates that at a Vg of 1 volt, the Ids of both doping patterns are within a few percent of each other.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">The junction-less transistor channel may be constructed with even, graded, or discrete layers of doping. The channel may be constructed with materials other than doped mono-crystalline silicon, such as, for example, poly-crystalline silicon, or other semi-conducting, insulating, or conducting material, such as, for example, graphene or other graphitic material, and may be in combination with other layers of similar or different material. For example, the center of the channel may include a layer of oxide, or of lightly doped silicon, and the edges more heavily doped single crystal silicon. This may enhance the gate control effectiveness for the off state of the resistor, and may increase the on-current as a result of strain effects on the other layer or layers in the channel. Strain techniques may be employed from covering and insulator material above, below, and surrounding the transistor channel and gate. Lattice modifiers may be employed to strain the silicon, such as, for example, an embedded SiGe implantation and anneal. The cross section of the transistor channel may be rectangular, circular, or oval shaped, to enhance the gate control of the channel. Alternatively, to optimize the mobility of the P-channel junction-less transistor in the 3D layer transfer method, the donor wafer may be rotated with respect to the acceptor wafer prior to bonding to facilitate the creation of the P-channel in the &#x3c;110&#x3e; silicon plane direction or may include other silicon crystal orientations such as &#x3c;511&#x3e;.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">3D memory device structures may also be constructed in layers of mono-crystalline silicon and utilize pre-processing a donor wafer by forming wafer sized layers of various materials without a process temperature restriction, then layer transferring the pre-processed donor wafer to the acceptor wafer, followed by some processing steps, and repeating this procedure multiple times, and then processing with either low temperature (below approximately 400&#xb0; C.) or high temperature (greater than approximately 400&#xb0; C.) after the final layer transfer to form memory device structures, such as, for example, transistors, capacitors, resistors, or memristors, on or in the multiple transferred layers that may be physically aligned and may be electrically coupled to the acceptor wafer.

Nos. 12/903,862, 12/903,847, 12/904,103 and 13/041,405 significant power and cost could be saved. Most of the elements in MCD <b>900</b> could be integrated in one 3D IC. Some of the MCD <b>900</b> elements may be logic functions which could utilize monolithic 3D transistors such as, for example, RCAT or Gate-Last. Some of the MCD <b>900</b> elements are storage devices and could be integrated on a 3D non-volatile memory device, such as, for example, 3D NAND or 3D RRAM, or volatile memory such as, for example, 3D DRAM or SRAM formed from RCAT or gate-last transistors, as been described herein. Storage 922 elements formed in monolithic 3D could be integrated on top or under a logic layer to reduce power and space. Keyboard <b>917</b> could be integrated as a touch screen or combination of image sensor and some light projection and could utilize structures described in some of the above mentioned related applications. The network/communication interface <b>925</b> could utilize another layer of silicon optimized for RF and gigahertz speed analog circuits or even may be integrated on substrates, such as GaN, that may be a better fit for such circuits.

As various blocks get tightly integrated, much of the power required to transfer signals between these elements may be reduced and similarly costs associated with these connections may be saved. Form factor may be compacted as the space associated with the individual substrate and the associated connections may be reduced by use of some embodiments of the 3D IC invention. For mobile device these may be very important competitive advantages. Some of these blocks might be better processed in different process flow or wafer fab location. For example the DSP/CPU <b>902</b> is a logic function that might use a logic process flow while the storage <b>922</b> might better be done using a NAND Flash technology process flow or wafer fab. An important advantage of some of the embodiments of the monolithic 3D inventions may be to allow some of the layers in the 3D structure to be processed using a logic process flow while another layer in the 3D structure might utilize a memory process flow, and then some other function the modems of the GPS or local position system (LPS) detection component <b>924</b> might use a high speed analog process flow or wafer fab. As those diverse functions may be structured in one device onto many different layers, these diverse functions could be very effectively and densely vertically interconnected.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">Charge trap NAND (Negated AND) memory devices are another form of popular commercial non-volatile memories.
