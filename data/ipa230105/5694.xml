id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a field emission electron source. Electron sources are typically used in scanning electron microscopes, as well as in cold cathode flat panel displays and vacuum microelectronics applications.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The electron sources currently used in electron microscopes or flat screens are based on field emission, or thermionic emission.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A material (usually a metal or semiconductor) can only spontaneously emit electrons if it receives and absorbs energy greater than the work output of the material. The energy can be supplied by many means, such as heat, an electric field, or light irradiation. There are thus several types of electron emissions, depending on the energy source used.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In thermionic emission, the energy is provided by the incidence of radiation, especially light, or by heating the substrate. Thermionic emission produces intense beams in a low vacuum (greater than 10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>Pa), the equivalent source being relatively large (greater than 10 &#x3bc;m). The brightness of such a source is relatively low (10<sup>9 </sup>A/m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;sr), knowing that it conditions the resolution accessible with this type of source in a microscope.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In field emission (or cold emission), the material is subjected to an electric field of about 1 V/nm. Under the effect of such a field, electrons tunnel through a potential barrier from the Fermi level, at room temperature. In thermionic emission, the heating of the material lowers the Fermi level to the vacuum level, which releases electrons. The field emission with a metal tip produces a beam with a low energy dispersion (&#x394;E=0.3 eV). A source based on this principle can reach a size below 10 nm. The brightness of such a source can reach values of the order of 10<sup>13 </sup>A/m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;sr. However, the field emission requires a high vacuum (less than 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>Pa) for a lifetime of more than 1000 hours. At higher pressures, the state of the tip rapidly deteriorates and no longer emits.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Schottky emission relies on field effect and thermionic emission, by applying an electric field to a tip, combined with heating of the substrate. Schottky emission produces intense beams in a low vacuum of about 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>Pa, the equivalent size of the source being about 15 nm. The brightness of such a beam is therefore also relatively low, of the order of 5.10<sup>10 </sup>A/m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;sr.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The shape of the field-emitting material affects the emission characteristics. Indeed, field emission is most easily obtained from needles or very sharp tips, the end of which has been polished to a substantially hemispherical shape whose radius can be less than 100 nm. When polarization is applied, the electric field lines diverge radially from the tip and the trajectories of the emitted electrons initially follow these field lines.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">When the flow of electrons emitted is sufficiently intense, the object subjected to the flow of electrons can emit photons. This phenomenon called &#x201c;cathodo-luminescence&#x201d; is used in some flat screens.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The publication &#x201c;A low-energy electron point-source projection microscope not using a sharp metal tip performs well in long-range imaging&#x201d;, E. Salancon, A. Degiovanni, L. Lapena, M. Lagaize, R. Morin, Ultramicroscopy Vol. 200 (2019), pp 125-131, describes an electron source formed at the end of a carbon wire of 10 &#x3bc;m diameter and a 0.5&#xd7;1 &#x3bc;m celadonite crystal of 50 nm thickness, deposited at the end of the wire in a drop of deionized water using a micropipette. This electron source requires an electric field of a few V/&#x3bc;m and can work at pressures higher than 1 Pa, the emissive zone being protected by the crystal. However, this source presents important instabilities and sometimes exhibits multiple emission points, which makes it difficult to use in conventional scanning electron microscopy.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Thus, it is desirable to provide an electron source that is sufficiently stable and bright, in particular for providing high resolution when used in a scanning electron microscope, without requiring a large energy input. It is also desirable that this source be robust and have a long lifespan, while being usable at relatively high pressures, compared to the sources of the prior art which generally require a high vacuum.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments relate to a method of manufacturing an electron source, comprising the steps of: forming a conductive substrate;

The electron source comprises a conductive wire <b>1</b>, one end of which is cut into a spike <b>10</b>, and the spike tip is machined to form a plateau <b>11</b>. A crystal <b>20</b> made of an insulating material is placed on the plateau <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The conductive wire <b>1</b> may have a diameter D of 100 &#x3bc;m or more and a length of a few mm. The plateau <b>11</b> may have a diameter d between 5 and 50 &#x3bc;m, for example around 100 &#x3bc;m. The crystal <b>20</b> may have a width (or length) L less than 100 nm, preferably between 10 and 100 nm, for example 50 nm (within &#xb1;10%), and a thickness E less than 50 nm, preferably between 1 and 50 nm, for example 10 nm (within &#xb1;10%).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the plateau <b>11</b> has a natural roughness, comparable to the thickness E of the crystal <b>20</b>, for example equal to the thickness E to within &#xb1;50%. Here, the roughness of the surface of a material corresponds to the maximum height of the valleys and peaks appearing on this surface, defined in absolute value compared to the average height of this surface, on the scale of the crystal dimensions.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Thus, the shape and dimensions of these peaks being random, some of the peaks of the plateau <b>11</b>, in the space delimited between the plateau <b>11</b> and the crystal <b>20</b>, are at a distance less than the thickness of the crystal <b>20</b> without this distance being zero, the faces of the crystal being substantially planar (the roughness of the crystal can be less than 0.5 nm). The simple deposition of the crystal <b>20</b> on the plateau <b>11</b>, combined with the roughness of the latter, forms a conductor/vacuum/insulator assembly, in which the vacuum is formed by the spaces <b>14</b> between the peaks of the plateau <b>11</b> and the crystal <b>20</b>. Given the very small dimensions of the crystal <b>20</b>, it is held firmly on the plateau <b>11</b> by van der Walls forces.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The angle &#x3b1; formed between the direction of the wire and a generatrix of the conical tip <b>10</b> may be adjusted according to the desired divergence of the electron beam generated at the tip <b>10</b>, knowing that the smaller the angle, the more the produced electron beam diverges. The diameter d of the plateau also has an influence on the divergence of the produced electron beam, knowing that the larger the diameter d of the plateau <b>11</b>, the less the angle &#x3b1; of the conical part influences the divergence of the beam.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to various embodiments, the wire <b>1</b> is made of a conductive material such as carbon or tungsten. Tungsten has the advantage of being easy to machine. The crystal <b>20</b> may be diamond or talcum. The electron source described above has a relatively long lifetime, even when used under relatively high pressures, of the order of 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>Pa or higher.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to an embodiment, the tip <b>10</b> at the end of the wire, may be manufactured for example by electrochemical etching. The plateau <b>11</b> may be made by erosion. The crystal <b>20</b> may be deposited on the plateau <b>11</b> either by means of a nanomanipulator (e.g., piezoelectric) or by means of a micropipette containing deionized water in which several crystals are suspended. The micropipette produces a microdrop of this mixture at its outlet port. The drop is then captured by capillary action, by simple contact of the drop with the tip <b>10</b>. The drop on the tip <b>10</b> dries quickly and deposits the crystal present in the drop. The crystals may be disaggregated in the water by means of ultrasound. The concentration of crystals in the water is adjusted so that the number of crystals per drop is close to one, considering the volume of a drop. The outlet port of the micropipette may be less than 10 &#x3bc;m in diameter to produce drops of substantially this size by applying a pressure of less than 10 kPa, for example 1.5 kPa, to the inlet port of the micropipette. The micropipette may be conventionally manufactured by stretching a capillary tube using a stretcher such as the P2000 stretcher sold by the company SUTTER INSTRUMENT&#xae;.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to an embodiment, a nanopipette is used, with an outlet port smaller than 500 nm, and partially filled with deionized water, for example using the method described in patent application WO 2013/079874, so that the water reaches the tapered portion in the vicinity of the outlet port of the nanopipette. The mixture of deionized water and crystals is then introduced through the inlet port of the nanopipette, and naturally mixes by diffusion with the water already present in the nanopipette through to the outlet port. A drop may be deposited on a support using the nanopipette, and then captured by capillarity by the tip <b>10</b> by bringing it into contact with the drop. The dimensions of the drop deposited on the support depend on the speed of movement of the nanopipette along the support as the drop is ejected and on the pressure exerted at the inlet of the nanopipette. The water in the drop on the plateau <b>11</b> evaporates very quickly and only one crystal <b>20</b> remains.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an electron microscope head <b>40</b> incorporating the electron source placed facing a screen, according to an embodiment. The electron microscope may be, for example, of the scanning, projection, or transmission type. The wire <b>1</b> is attached to a piezoelectric actuator <b>42</b>, with the tip <b>10</b> facing a diaphragm <b>41</b>. The wire <b>1</b> and the diaphragm <b>41</b> are connected to a voltage source <b>43</b>, to positively bias the diaphragm <b>41</b>, which thus serves as an anode or extractor with respect to the wire <b>1</b> serving as a cathode. The microscope assembly may be placed in a vacuum chamber (not shown) in which the pressure is lowered sufficiently, for example to a value between 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>and 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>Pa. The actuator <b>42</b> is arranged to adjust the distance between the crystal <b>20</b> and the diaphragm <b>41</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">An ammeter <b>47</b> may be placed between the diaphragm <b>41</b> and ground to detect the presence of the electron beam <b>15</b> and measure the intensity of the electron beam. As the voltage supplied by the voltage source <b>43</b> is gradually increased, an electron beam is observed to appear, with a non-zero current detected by the ammeter <b>47</b>, starting at about 400 V, with the diaphragm <b>41</b> at a distance between 0.5 and 1.5 mm from the crystal <b>20</b> or the plateau <b>11</b>. If the voltage supplied by the voltage source <b>43</b> is gradually lowered, the measured current stabilizes at a few hundred nA. In an exemplary implementation, the diaphragm <b>41</b> has a diameter of 1 mm.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Thus, the conductor/vacuum/insulator structure provides, thanks to an electric field of the order of a few V/&#x3bc;m, an electron source with an intensity of the order of a hundred nA. It can be observed that this electron source is very stable and follows a Fowler-Nordheim law in a current intensity band of ten orders of magnitude. It can also be observed that a saturation state is reached at about 10 &#x3bc;A for a voltage applied between source <b>1</b> and diaphragm <b>41</b> of 500 V. Knowing that this phenomenon is generally observed with an electric field of the order of 1 V/nm, it can be assumed that an exaltation of the electric field occurs in the volume at the interface between the conducting plateau <b>11</b> and the insulating crystal <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It can be observed that at a bias voltage of 500 V, the tip <b>10</b> associated with the crystal <b>20</b> produces a beam with a low energy dispersion AE between 0.2 and 0.4 eV, an equivalent source size of between 0.5 and 1.5 nm, and a high stability. The brightness of this source may reach high values of the order of 10<sup>13 </sup>to 10<sup>14 </sup>A/m2&#xb7;sr. This source has an acceptable lifetime of more than 1000 hours even when used under relatively high pressure (up to 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>Pa).</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The conductor/vacuum/insulator structure is not necessarily obtained by exploiting the surface roughness of the conductor supporting the insulator. Indeed, this structure may be entirely manufactured using conventional microelectronics techniques. Accordingly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> represents a multilayer structure, according to an embodiment. This structure comprises a substrate <b>50</b> on which a conductive layer <b>51</b> has been deposited and etched to form nanotips <b>31</b> a few nanometers high. An insulating layer <b>52</b> was then deposited on the conductive layer <b>51</b>. The thickness of the conductive layer <b>51</b> is slightly greater than the height of the nanotips <b>31</b>, so that the height between the apexes <b>32</b> of the nanotips <b>31</b> and the top surface of the insulating layer <b>52</b> is a few nanometers. Wells are then formed in the insulating layer <b>52</b> to expose the nanotips <b>31</b> and the layer <b>51</b> around them. The wells are then filled with a sacrificial layer to obtain a flat surface including the top surface of the insulating layer <b>52</b>. A monocrystalline layer <b>53</b> is formed, for example, by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using a raw gas containing hydrocarbons and hydrogen. The thickness of the layer <b>53</b> may lie between 5 and 50 nm, for example 10 nm. The layer <b>53</b> is then etched to form a single crystal plate <b>21</b> per nanotip <b>31</b>, with the apex <b>32</b> of each nanotip being under one of the plates <b>21</b> or flush with an edge thereof.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Anodes are then formed. For this purpose, an electrically insulating layer <b>54</b> is deposited on the plates <b>21</b> and the sacrificial layer, and then etched to form wells substantially flush with the wells around the nanotips <b>31</b>. The wells are filled with the sacrificial layer material, and the entire insulating layer <b>54</b> and sacrificial layer are covered with a conductive layer <b>55</b> which is then etched to form the anodes <b>56</b>. All of the sacrificial material is then removed from the wells to expose the nanotips, thereby achieving the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The nanotips <b>31</b> may be arranged in rows and columns to form an array of nanotips usable to form a flat screen operating by cathodoluminescence, to display animated images. The nanotips may be connected to each other line by line and controlled by conductive strips forming anodes <b>56</b> arranged in columns, in order to excite a single nanotip located on the line and the column subjected to a voltage.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Of course, other techniques used for manufacturing microelectronic components may be used to manufacture the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, and some aspects of this structure may vary depending on the intended applications.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">It will be apparent to the person skilled in the art that the present invention is susceptible to various embodiments and applications. In particular, the invention is not limited to the materials previously described for the conductive material and the insulating crystal, nor to the shape of the substrate formed at the apex of a tip. Indeed, the surface of the substrate covered by the crystal may be planar, the natural roughness of the substrate being exploited to form the void space under the crystal.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
