Notably, the described embodiments relate to techniques for dynamically specifying and providing visual representations of communication performance in an environment.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many electronic devices are capable of wirelessly communicating with other electronic devices. For example, these electronic devices can include a networking subsystem that implements a network interface for a wireless local area network (WLAN), e.g., a wireless network such as described in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 standard. For example, a wireless network may include an access point that communicates wirelessly with one or more associated electronic devices (which are sometimes referred to as &#x2018;clients&#x2019;).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to ensure good communication performance, radio surveys are typically performed after deploying a wireless network in an environment, such as in a building. However, it can be challenging to identify low-signal areas or dead zones in an environment. For example, it is often difficult to determine positions in an indoor environment when a local positioning system is unavailable. The resulting position uncertainty may degrade the quality of a radio survey, and thus may make it more difficult to take appropriate corrective or remedial action.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The described embodiments relate to an electronic device that characterizes communication performance. This electronic device may include: a network node; and an interface circuit that communicates with an access point or a controller of the access point. During operation, the electronic device may receive information specifying a location in an environment. For example, the information may specify the location relative to one or more visual landmarks in the environment. Then, the electronic device may provide the information to the access point and/or the controller, where the location is within communication range of the access point. Next, the electronic device may receive, from the access point and/or the controller, measurements of one or more communication performance metrics at or proximate to the location during a time interval. Moreover, the electronic device may provide a graphical representation of the communication performance at or proximate to the location based at least in part on the measurements.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Note that the electronic device may provide a user interface corresponding to the environment, and the information may correspond to user-interface activity associated with the user interface. For example, the user interface may include an augmented reality associated with the environment and the user-interface activity may include defining the location, such as by dropping a pin in the augmented reality.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Furthermore, providing the user interface may include displaying the user interface on a display and/or providing the graphical representation may include displaying the graphical representation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additionally, the electronic device may provide a visual indication to one or more other electronic devices. The visual indication may be intended for inclusion in instances of the user interface on the one or more other electronic devices and the visual indication may encourage communication with the one or more other electronic devices at or proximate to the location.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the graphical representation includes a contour map.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Note that the electronic device may provide a layout of the environment along with the graphical representation. Alternatively or additionally, the electronic device may provide statistics summarizing the measurements with the graphical representation, and presentation of the statistics along with the graphical representation may be selectable via a user-interface icon associated with the location.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, the electronic device may include a portable electronic device (such as a cellular telephone).</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Furthermore, the one or more communication performance metrics may include at least one of: a received signal strength indication (RSSI), a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or latency.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Additionally, the time interval may include: a day, a week or a month.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another embodiment provides a computer-readable storage medium for use with the electronic device. When executed by the electronic device, this computer-readable storage medium causes the electronic device to perform at least some of the aforementioned operations.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another embodiment provides a method, which may be performed by the electronic device.

During operation, the electronic device receives information specifying a location in an environment. For example, the information may correspond to user-interface activity associated with a user interface. Notably, the user interface may include an augmented reality associated with the environment and the user-interface activity may include defining the location, such as by dropping a pin in the augmented reality. Then, the electronic device provides the information to an access point and/or a controller of the access point, where the location is within communication range of the access point. Next, the electronic device receives, from the access point and/or the controller, measurements of one or more communication performance metrics at or proximate to the location during a time interval. Moreover, the electronic device provides a graphical representation (such as a heat map) of the communication performance at or proximate to the location based at least in part on the measurements. In some embodiments, the electronic device provides a layout of the environment and/or statistics summarizing the measurements along with the graphical representation.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">By providing a dynamic user interface that can be used to specify the location and display the graphical representation, the layout and/or the statistics, this communication may facilitate accurate characterization of the communication performance at or proximate to the location. Moreover, this characterization may be performed without the use of a local positioning system. For example, the information may specify the location relative to one or more visual landmarks in the environment (such as relative to walls of a building). Furthermore, the accurate characterization may facilitate appropriate corrective or remedial action for any problems that are identified. Consequently, the communication may facilitate improved communication performance in a wireless network (such as a wireless local area network or WLAN), and thus may improve the user experience when communicating via the WLAN.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the discussion that follows, the electronic device and an access point communicate packets in accordance with a wireless communication protocol, such as an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11 standard (which is sometimes referred to as &#x2018;Wi-Fi,&#x2019; from the Wi-Fi Alliance of Austin, Tex.), Bluetooth (from the Bluetooth Special Interest Group of Kirkland, Wash.), and/or another type of wireless interface. In the discussion that follows, Wi-Fi is used as an illustrative example. However, a wide variety of communication protocols (such as Long Term Evolution or LTE, another cellular-telephone communication protocol, etc.) may be used.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Moreover, the access point may communicate with other access points and/or computers in a network using a wired communication protocol, such as an IEEE 802.3 standard (which is sometimes referred to as &#x2018;Ethernet&#x2019;) and/or another type of wired interface. In the discussion that follows, Ethernet are used as an illustrative example.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> presents a block diagram illustrating an example of communication among one or more access points <b>110</b> and electronic devices <b>112</b> (such as a cellular telephone, and which are sometimes referred to as &#x2018;clients&#x2019;) in a WLAN <b>114</b> in accordance with some embodiments. Notably, access points <b>110</b> may communicate with each other in WLAN <b>114</b> using wireless and/or wired communication. Moreover, access points <b>110</b> may be configured and managed via one or more controllers, such as controller <b>108</b>. Furthermore, at least one of access points <b>110</b> (such as access point <b>110</b>-<b>3</b>) may provide access to a network <b>118</b> (such as the Internet, a cable network, a cellular-telephone network, etc.) that is external to WLAN <b>114</b>. Additionally, at least some of access points <b>110</b> (such as access points <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>110</b>-<b>2</b>) may communicate with electronic devices <b>112</b> using wireless communication. Note that access points <b>110</b> may include a physical access point and/or a virtual access point that is implemented in software in an environment of an electronic device or a computer.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The wired and/or wireless communication among access points <b>110</b> in WLAN <b>114</b> may occur via network <b>116</b> (such as an intra-net, a mesh network, point-to-point connections and/or the Internet) and may use a network communication protocol, such as Ethernet. This network may include one or more routers and/or switches (not shown). Furthermore, the wireless communication using Wi-Fi may involve: transmitting advertising frames on wireless channels, detecting one another by scanning wireless channels, establishing connections (for example, by transmitting association or attach requests), and/or transmitting and receiving packets (which may include the association requests and/or additional information as payloads). In some embodiments, the wired and/or wireless communication among access points <b>110</b> also involves the use of dedicated connections, such as via a peer-to-peer (P2P) communication technique.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As described further below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, access points <b>110</b> and/or electronic devices <b>112</b> may include subsystems, such as a networking subsystem, a memory subsystem and a processor subsystem. In addition, access points <b>110</b> and electronic devices <b>112</b> may include radios <b>120</b> in the networking subsystems. More generally, access points <b>110</b> and electronic devices <b>112</b> can include (or can be included within) any electronic devices with the networking subsystems that enable access points <b>110</b> and electronic devices <b>112</b> to communicate with each other using wireless and/or wired communication. This wireless communication can comprise transmitting advertisements on wireless channels to enable access points <b>110</b> and/or electronic devices <b>112</b> to make initial contact or detect each other, followed by exchanging subsequent data/management frames (such as association requests and responses) to establish a connection, configure security options (e.g., Internet Protocol Security), transmit and receive packets or frames via the connection, etc. Note that while instances of radios <b>120</b> are shown in access points <b>110</b> and electronic devices <b>112</b>, one or more of these instances may be different from the other instances of radios <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, wireless signals <b>122</b> (represented by a jagged line) are transmitted from radio <b>120</b>-<b>1</b> in access point <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>. These wireless signals may be received by radio <b>120</b>-<b>4</b> in electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b>. Notably, access point <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> may transmit packets. In turn, these packets may be received by electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b>. Moreover, access point <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> may allow electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> to communicate with other electronic devices, computers and/or servers via networks <b>116</b> and/or <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Note that the communication among access points <b>110</b> and/or with electronic devices <b>112</b> may be characterized by a variety of performance metrics (which are sometimes referred to as &#x2018;communication performance metrics&#x2019;), such as: a received signal strength (RSSI), a data rate, a data rate for successful communication (which is sometimes referred to as a &#x2018;throughput&#x2019;), an error rate (such as a retry or resend rate), a mean-square error of equalized signals relative to an equalization target, intersymbol interference, multipath interference, an SNR, a width of an eye pattern, a ratio of number of bytes successfully communicated during a time interval (such as 1-10 s) to an estimated maximum number of bytes that can be communicated in the time interval (the latter of which is sometimes referred to as the &#x2018;capacity&#x2019; of a communication channel or link), and/or a ratio of an actual data rate to an estimated data rate (which is sometimes referred to as &#x2018;utilization&#x2019;).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the described embodiments processing a packet or frame in access points <b>110</b> and electronic devices <b>112</b> includes: receiving signals (such as wireless signals <b>122</b>) with the packet or frame; decoding/extracting the packet or frame from received wireless signals <b>122</b> to acquire the packet or frame; and processing the packet or frame to determine information contained in the packet or frame.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Although we describe the network environment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as an example, in alternative embodiments, different numbers or types of electronic devices may be present. For example, some embodiments comprise more or fewer electronic devices. As another example, in another embodiment, different electronic devices are transmitting and/or receiving packets or frames.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As noted previously, it can be difficult to perform an accurate radio survey of WLAN <b>114</b>, especially when WLAN <b>114</b> is implemented in an indoor environment (such as one that does not include a local positioning system that determines locations or positions in the environment). As described further below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, in order to address this problem the communication technique may allow a user (such as a network administrator) to specify one or more locations in an environment (e.g., relative to one or more visual landmarks in the environment) via an augmented reality application that executes on or in one of electronic devices (such as electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b>). For example, the user may define or &#x2018;drop&#x2019; a pin in the augmented reality application at a location of interest (which is sometimes referred to as an &#x2018;anchor point&#x2019;). More generally, the user may specify the location based at least in part on user-interface activity when using the user interface. Thus, using the augmented reality application, the user may walk around the environment and can intuitively specify one or more locations that are of interest, i.e., that the user would like to have characterized.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In response to receiving information that specifies the location from the augmented reality application, electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> may provide the information to one of access points <b>110</b> (such as access point <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>) and/or controller <b>108</b>, where the location is within communication range of access point <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">After collecting or performing measurements of one or more communication performance metrics (such as RSSI, throughput, latency and/or SNR) at or proximate to the location during a time interval (such as a day, a week or a month), access point <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> may optionally provide the measurements to controller <b>108</b>. Then, access point <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> and/or controller <b>108</b> may provide the measurements (or a summary of the measurements) to electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b>. Next, electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> may provide a graphical representation of the communication performance (such as &#x2018;good,&#x2019; &#x2018;intermediate&#x2019; or &#x2018;bad&#x2019;) at or proximate to the location based at least in part on the measurements. For example, electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> may display the graphical representation of the communication performance, such as in the user interface associated with the augmented reality application. In some embodiments, the graphical representation includes a &#x2018;heat map,&#x2019; such as a contour map of communication performance that indicates low-signal areas or dead zones in an environment and/or over deployment in the environment.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In order to make the content provided in the augmented reality intuitive, electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> may provide or present additional information along with the graphical representation. For example, electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> may provide a layout (or floor map) of the environment (such as a floor a building or an outdoor region) along with the graphical representation. Alternatively or additionally, electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> may provide statistics summarizing the measurements with the graphical representation, and presentation of the statistics along with the graphical representation may be selectable via a user-interface icon associated with the location. For example, in response to activation of a user-interface icon (such as a physical key, a virtual icon on a touch-sensitive display, using a voice command, etc.), electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> may modify the displayed content in the augmented reality application to display the statistics proximate to the location in the augmented reality.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b>, access point <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> and/or controller <b>108</b> may provide a visual indication (such as a graphical character) to one or more other electronic devices (such as electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>2</b>). The visual indication may be intended for inclusion in instances of the user interface associated with the augmented reality application that executes on or in the one or more other electronic devices. Moreover, the visual indication may encourage communication with the one or more other electronic devices at or proximate to the location. For example, when ever users interact with the visual indication in the instances of the user interface (such as by grabbing or activating a user-interface device associated with the visual indicator), the one or more other electronic devices may communicate with access point <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>. These users may interact with the visual indication as part of a video game and/or in exchange for financial compensation (such as receiving points within the video game, receiving a credit or payment into the users' financial accounts, etc.). In this way, the communication technique may provide an incentive to the users to help ensure that there are sufficient measurements to accurately assess the communication performance at the location.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">While the previous discussion illustrated the communication technique with an augmented reality application that is installed on and that executes in an environment (such as an operating system) of electronic device <b>110</b>-<b>1</b>, in other embodiments the augmented reality application executes in an environment of a Web browser. For example, the augmented reality application may be a Web browser plugin. In some embodiments, the augmented reality application is implemented using a client-server architecture. For example, server <b>124</b> may provide user-interface information that specifies a dynamic user interface for display on electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Moreover, while the preceding example illustrated the use of the communication technique to perform a post-deployment radio survey, in other embodiments a modified version of the communication technique may be used prior to deployment to allow the expected coverage in WLAN <b>114</b> to be assessed and, thus, for WLAN <b>114</b> to be designed. For example, using the augmented reality application on electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b>, a user may specify a configuration of access points <b>110</b> in an environment, such as the number of access points, the locations of access points <b>110</b>, the types of access points, the transmit powers of access points <b>110</b>, etc. Then, using a predetermined look-up table of signal strength as a function of distance for the specified access points <b>110</b> with or without interference from neighboring access points, the augmented reality application may display a graphical representation of the communication performance in the environment, the layout and/or summary statistics, such as a contour map of RSSI in the environment. This information may allow the user to roughly select the spacings or locations of access points <b>110</b> to avoid low-signal regions or dead zones and/or over deployment in the environment.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> may perform measurements (such as throughput, RSSI, SNR, packet error rate, latency, etc.) of the neighboring access points that are proximate to a desired or intended location of an access point in WLAN <b>114</b>, to allow the user to assess the real-world impact in the environment. This may allow the user to iteratively or dynamically build WLAN <b>114</b>. For example, the user can empirically layout access points <b>110</b> and then can use the augmented reality application on electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> to intuitively and visually assess the communication performance of the current layout to determine if there are any low-signal regions or dead zones and/or over deployment in the environment.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Note that the communication technique may also provide a visual representation of the aesthetics of a proposed deployment or configuration, such as how access points <b>110</b> will look in the environment.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">While the preceding embodiments illustrated the communication technique using electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b>, in other embodiments the communication technique may be implemented on a different electronic device. For example, the user may interact with the dynamic user interface via a computer (such as a desktop computer, controller <b>108</b> or server <b>124</b>), instead of a portable electronic device, such as electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In these ways, the communication technique may allow a user to accurately and intuitively characterize communication performance in the environment, either before or after deployment of WLAN <b>114</b>. This capability may assist the user in diagnosing or trouble shooting any performance issues in WLAN <b>114</b>, and may allow the user to take appropriate remedial action, e.g., to reduce or eliminate any low-signal regions or dead zones (e.g., a region in which the one or more communication performance metrics are, on average during the time interval, more than 50% less than surrounding regions). Moreover, the communication technique may allow the user to ensure the communication performance in WLAN <b>114</b> without requiring the use of a local positioning system in the environment. Consequently, the communication technique may facilitate improved communication performance in WLAN <b>114</b>, and thus may improve the user experience when using WLAN <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">We now describe embodiments of the method. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> presents a flow diagram illustrating an example of a method <b>200</b> for characterizing communication performance using an electronic device, such as electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

For example, the graphical representation may include a contour map.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some embodiments, the electronic device optionally performs one or more additional operations (operation <b>218</b>). Notably, the electronic device may provide a user interface corresponding to the environment, and the information may correspond to user-interface activity associated with the user interface. For example, the user interface may include or may provide an augmented reality associated with the environment and the user-interface activity may include defining the location, such as by dropping a pin in the augmented reality. Furthermore, providing the user interface may include displaying the user interface on a display (such as a display in or associated with the electronic device) and/or providing the graphical representation may include displaying the graphical representation on the display.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Additionally, the electronic device may provide a visual indication to one or more other electronic devices. The visual indication may be intended for inclusion in instances of the user interface on the one or more other electronic devices and the visual indication may encourage communication with the one or more other electronic devices at or proximate to the location. Alternatively, the access point or the controller may provide the visual indication after receiving the information specifying the location from the electronic device.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">Note that the electronic device may provide a layout of the environment along with the graphical representation. Alternatively or additionally, the electronic device may provide statistics summarizing the measurements with the graphical representation, and presentation of the statistics along with the graphical representation may be selectable via a user-interface icon associated with the location.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the electronic device may provide current measurements of the RSSI and/or the SNR (and, more generally, one or more communication performance metrics) at one or more locations in the environment prior to receiving the information (operation <b>210</b>). For example, the RSSI and/or the SNR at the one or more locations in the user interface. The current measurements may assist a user in determining where to specify or define a location of interest (and, thus, to provide the information to the electronic device). Consequently, in method <b>200</b> there may be a dynamic interaction between the electronic device, which performs and display the one or more current measurements, and the user that specifies or defines the location via the user interface based at least in part on the displayed one or more current measurements.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments of method <b>200</b>, there may be additional or fewer operations.

Moreover, using method <b>200</b>, the electronic device may characterize the communication performance of different WLANs at one or more user-specified locations, such as three different WLANs having different service set identifiers (SSIDs).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> presents a drawing illustrating an example of communication among controller <b>108</b>, access point <b>110</b>-<b>1</b> and electronic device <b>112</b>-<b>1</b>.

Furthermore, by interacting with user interface <b>500</b> (such as by activating a virtual icon on a touch-sensitive display), a user may select to have statistics <b>512</b> for the measurements displayed in proximity to pin <b>414</b> in user interface <b>500</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">We now describe embodiments of an electronic device, which may perform at least some of the operations in the communication technique. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> presents a block diagram illustrating an example of an electronic device <b>600</b> in accordance with some embodiments, such as one of access points <b>110</b> or electronic devices <b>112</b>. This electronic device includes processing subsystem <b>610</b>, memory subsystem <b>612</b>, and networking subsystem <b>614</b>. Processing subsystem <b>610</b> includes one or more devices configured to perform computational operations. For example, processing subsystem <b>610</b> can include one or more microprocessors, ASICs, microcontrollers, programmable-logic devices, one or more graphics process units (GPUs) and/or one or more digital signal processors (DSPs).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Memory subsystem <b>612</b> includes one or more devices for storing data and/or instructions for processing subsystem <b>610</b> and networking subsystem <b>614</b>. For example, memory subsystem <b>612</b> can include dynamic random access memory (DRAM), static random access memory (SRAM), and/or other types of memory, in some embodiments, instructions for processing subsystem <b>610</b> in memory subsystem <b>612</b> include: one or more program modules or sets of instructions (such as program instructions <b>622</b> or operating system <b>624</b>), which may be executed by processing subsystem <b>610</b>. Note that the one or more computer programs may constitute a computer-program mechanism. Moreover, instructions in the various modules in memory subsystem <b>612</b> may be implemented in: a high-level procedural language, an object-oriented programming language, and/or in an assembly or machine language. Furthermore, the programming language may be compiled or interpreted, e.g., configurable or configured (which may be used interchangeably in this discussion), to be executed by processing subsystem <b>610</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In addition, memory subsystem <b>612</b> can include mechanisms for controlling access to the memory. In some embodiments, memory subsystem <b>612</b> includes a memory hierarchy that comprises one or more caches coupled to a memory in electronic device <b>600</b>. In some of these embodiments, one or more of the caches is located in processing subsystem <b>610</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, memory subsystem <b>612</b> is coupled to one or more high-capacity mass-storage devices (not shown). For example, memory subsystem <b>612</b> can be coupled to a magnetic or optical drive, a solid-state drive, or another type of mass-storage device. In these embodiments, memory subsystem <b>612</b> can be used by electronic device <b>600</b> as fast-access storage for often-used data, while the mass-storage device is used to store less frequently used data.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Networking subsystem <b>614</b> includes one or more devices configured to couple to and communicate on a wired and/or wireless network (i.e., to perform network operations), including: control logic <b>616</b>, an interface circuit <b>618</b> and one or more antennas <b>620</b> (or antenna elements). (While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> includes one or more antennas <b>620</b>, in some embodiments electronic device <b>600</b> includes one or more nodes, such as nodes <b>608</b>, e.g., a network node that can be connected or coupled to a network, or a pad that can be coupled to the one or more antennas <b>620</b>. Thus, electronic device <b>600</b> may or may not include the one or more antennas <b>620</b>.) For example, networking subsystem <b>614</b> can include a Bluetooth&#x2122; networking system, a cellular networking system (e.g., a 3G/4G network such as UMTS, LTE, etc.), a universal serial bus (USB) networking system, a networking system based on the standards described in IEEE 802.11 (e.g., a Wi-Fi&#xae; networking system), an Ethernet networking system, a cable modem networking system, and/or another networking system.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Note that a transmit or receive antenna pattern (or antenna radiation pattern) of electronic device <b>600</b> may be adapted or changed using pattern shapers (such as reflectors) in one or more antennas <b>620</b> (or antenna elements), which can be independently and selectively electrically coupled to ground to steer the transmit antenna pattern in different directions. Thus, if one or more antennas <b>620</b> include N antenna pattern shapers, the one or more antennas may have 2<sup>N </sup>different antenna pattern configurations. More generally, a given antenna pattern may include amplitudes and/or phases of signals that specify a direction of the main or primary lobe of the given antenna pattern, as well as so-called &#x2018;exclusion regions&#x2019; or &#x2018;exclusion zones&#x2019; (which are sometimes referred to as &#x2018;notches&#x2019; or &#x2018;nulls&#x2019;). Note that an exclusion zone of the given antenna pattern includes a low-intensity region of the given antenna pattern. While the intensity is not necessarily zero in the exclusion zone, it may be below a threshold, such as 3 dB or lower than the peak gain of the given antenna pattern. Thus, the given antenna pattern may include a local maximum (e.g., a primary beam) that directs gain in the direction of electronic device <b>600</b> that is of interest, and one or more local minima that reduce gain in the direction of other electronic devices that are not of interest. In this way, the given antenna pattern may be selected so that communication that is undesirable (such as with the other electronic devices) is avoided to reduce or eliminate adverse effects, such as interference or crosstalk.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Networking subsystem <b>614</b> includes processors, controllers, Is radios/antennas, sockets/plugs, and/or other devices used for coupling to, communicating on, and handling data and events for each supported networking system. Note that mechanisms used for coupling to, communicating on, and handling data and events on the network for each network system are sometimes collectively referred to as a &#x2018;network interface&#x2019; for the network system. Moreover, in some embodiments a &#x2018;network&#x2019; or a &#x2018;connection&#x2019; between the electronic devices does not yet exist. Therefore, electronic device <b>600</b> may use the mechanisms in networking subsystem <b>614</b> for performing simple wireless communication between the electronic devices, e.g., transmitting advertising or beacon frames and/or scanning for advertising frames transmitted by other electronic devices as described previously.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Within electronic device <b>600</b>, processing subsystem <b>610</b>, memory subsystem <b>612</b>, and networking subsystem <b>614</b> are coupled together using bus <b>628</b>. Bus <b>628</b> may include an electrical, optical, and/or electro-optical connection that the subsystems can use to communicate commands and data among one another. Although only one bus <b>628</b> is shown for clarity, different embodiments can include a different number or configuration of electrical, optical, and/or electro-optical connections among the subsystems.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, electronic device <b>600</b> includes a display subsystem <b>626</b> for displaying information on a display, which may include a display driver and the display, such as a liquid-crystal display, a multi-touch touchscreen, etc.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Electronic device <b>600</b> can be (or can be included in) any electronic device with at least one network interface.
