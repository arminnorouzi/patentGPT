The amorphous polyester resin may be defined as, for example, a polyester resin exhibiting a stepwise endothermic change when measured at a temperature increase rate of 10&#xb0; C./min by differential scanning calorimetry, or a polyester resin exhibiting an endothermic peak with a half width of more than 15&#xb0; C.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An amorphous polyester resin is, for example, a reaction product of a polyhydric alcohol and a polycarboxylic acid. In other words, the amorphous polyester resin includes, as monomer units, a polyhydric alcohol and a polycarboxylic acid.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The polyhydric alcohol may be, for example, a diol.

Examples of the polycarboxylic acid include trimellitic acid, pyromellitic acid, naphthalenetricarboxylic acid, naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid, pyrenetricarboxylic acid, pyrenetetracarboxylic acid, and acid anhydrides of these carboxylic acids.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The content of the polycarboxylic acid may be within range having a minimum of 20% by mass, 25% by mass, or 30% by mass and a maximum of 50% by mass, 45% by mass, or 40% by mass, based on the total amount of the monomer units in the amorphous polyester resin.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to increase the dispersibility of the crystalline polyester resin in the amorphous polyester resin, the weight average molecular weight of the amorphous polyester resin may be within a range having a minimum of 5,000, 10,000, or 12,000, and a maximum of 50,000, 45,000, or 40,000.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The weight average molecular weight of the amorphous polyester resin according to the present disclosure is measured according to gel permeation chromatography (GPC) of a tetrahydrofuran (THF)-soluble fraction. For example, the weight average molecular weight may be determined by the following method. Waters e2695 (manufactured by Nihon Waters K.K.) is used as a measuring apparatus, and two sets of Inertsil CN-3 25 cm (manufactured by GL Sciences, Inc.) are used as columns. A filtrate obtained by introducing 10 mg of the amorphous polyester resin into 10 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) (containing a stabilizer, manufactured by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), stirring the mixture for one hour, and then filtering the mixture through a 0.2 &#x3bc;m filter, is used as a sample solution.

When the binder resin includes a crystalline polyester resin, enhancement of the image glossiness of the toner and enhancement of the low-temperature fixability can be promoted.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">A crystalline polyester resin is, for example, a reaction product between a polyhydric alcohol and a polycarboxylic acid. For example, a crystalline polyester resin may include a polyhydric alcohol and a polycarboxylic acid as monomer units.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The polyhydric alcohol may be, for example, a diol or an aliphatic diol. In order to more easily achieve a crystalline polyester resin having an appropriate melting point for the toner particle, the number of carbon atoms of the polyhydric alcohol may be within a range having a minimum of 8 or 9 and a maximum of 12 or 10. For example, the number of carbon atoms of the polyhydric alcohol may be 9 in some examples, or 10 in other examples.

In some example, the polycarboxylic acid may be an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid to increase the linearity of the structure of the crystalline polyester resin, so as to increase the affinity with the amorphous polyester resin. In order to more easily achieve a crystalline polyester providing an appropriate melting point for the toner particle, the number of carbon atoms of the polycarboxylic acid (provided that the number of carbons excludes the carbons constituting a carboxyl group) may be within a range having a minimum of 8 or 9 and a maximum of 12 or 10. For example, the number of carbon atoms may be 9 in some examples or 10 in other examples. Examples of the polycarboxylic acid include 1,10-decane dicarboxylic acid and 1,12-dodecane dicarboxylic acid.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The content of the polycarboxylic acid may be within a range having a minimum of 40% by mass, 45% by mass, or 50% by mass, and a maximum of 70% by mass, 65% by mass, or 60% by mass, based on the total amount of monomer units in the crystalline polyester resin.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In order to suppress a decrease in the strength of the binder resin and a decrease in the glass transition temperature of the toner particle, and in order to increase low-temperature fixability, the intensity of images fixed on paper, and the preservability of the toner particle, the weight average molecular weight of the crystalline polyester resin may be within a range having a minimum of 5,000, 5,500, or 6,000, and a maximum of 15,000, 10,000, or 8,000.

Specifically, the diffuse reflection spectrum of inorganic fine particles was measured, and then Kubelka-Munk conversion was performed to convert the wavelength on the horizontal axis into eV and the vertical axis into the square root of ahv. Then, the converted spectrum in a high energy region of the obtained graph, representing a higher energy than the energy at which the absorption started, was approximated by a statistical method and was represented by a line in the graph. The converted spectrum of a low energy region representing a lower energy than the energy at which the absorption started, was approximated in the same manner and represented by another line used as a baseline. The eV value corresponding to a point at which the line of the high energy region intersects the baseline of the low energy region was calculated as an energy band gap.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0115">Measurement of Relative Permittivity</p><p id="p-0110" num="0116">The relative permittivity (E) of the obtained inorganic fine particles 1 to 12 were measured by an automatic balance bridge method using LCR meter HP4284A (manufactured by Agilent Technologies), TO-19 (manufactured by Ando Electric Co., Ltd.), SE-70 type solid electrode (manufactured by Ando Electric Co., Ltd.) as a measuring device, and a powder electrode cell (manufactured by SUS-made, main electrode diameter 37 mm&#x3d5;, guard electrode inner diameter 39 mm&#x3d5;/outer diameter 55 mm&#x3d5;) as an electrode cell.
