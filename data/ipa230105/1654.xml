It should be understood that the statements in this section of this document are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In conventional power transmission belts, the belt has an inner compression section, an outer tension section, and an intermediate neutral plane. Typically, helically wound reinforcing cords are located within the neutral plane and so the neutral plane is commonly referred to as the load carrying zone. Such belts have a variety of groove and rib configurations, using longitudinal or transverse grooves/ribs or a combination of both. The grooves are often located in the inner compression section of the belt. The grooves assist in engaging a pulley, or other drive, in the power transmission system. For some belts, grooves and rib configurations may also be provided in the outer tension section.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The generation of adhesion between the reinforcing cords and rubber compounds within the neutral plane and adjacent thereto, in dynamic products such as belts, tires, couplings, or hose is fundamental to their proper operation. Without sufficient adhesion, the product will fail to perform under dynamic conditions. Typically used adhesive system include many components or layers beginning with a fiber sizing applied to the fibers as they are spun, a primer typically applied to a yarn or greige cord or fabric or other fibrous reinforcement, an adhesive applied to and/or within the cord, and an overcoat applied to the treated cord bundle (or other fibrous reinforcement) to ensure compatibility with the surrounding rubber compound. The treated cords may finally be embedded in or surrounded by an adhesive or gum type rubber composition generally formed from one or more rubber plies or layers making up the body of the belt or other dynamic rubber product.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A conventional treatment for reinforcing cords consists of three coatings: 1) a primer treatment of isocyanate or epoxy in organic solvent; 2) a resorcinol-formaldehyde-latex (&#x201c;RFL&#x201d;) treatment; and 3) a conventional overcoat adhesive based on a complex blend of chlorinated polymers, curatives, crosslinkers, adhesion promoters, film-formers, and/or acid scavengers, and the like. In some cases, a variation used for aramid cord includes a first polyurethane treatment based on hydroxyl- or epoxy-terminated liquid rubber and isocyanate-terminated liquid rubber, either of which may be a diene rubber, followed by a conventional RFL treatment. Presumably, an overcoat adhesive would also be needed for many applications, such as for bonding to ethylene-alpha-olefin rubber compounds. These are a complex series of treatments that are expensive, may involve use of some volatile components, and require optimization for best performance.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, there is a need for improved belt manufacturing methods which address the above described problems and complications, and such needs are met, at least in part, with embodiments according to this disclosure.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This section provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a necessarily a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a first aspect of the disclosure, methods of manufacturing a belt include, at least, laying up a plurality of cords of a belt build on a mandrel, laying up a tape adhesive on an inner surface of the plurality of cords, laying up a cushion layer on an opposing side of the tape adhesive, and vulcanizing the belt build in a profile-forming mold, where the tape adhesive is a vulcanizable rubber which is devoid carbon black. The methods may further include laying up an outer tape adhesive before the laying up of the plurality of cords, and in some aspects, tension layer is laid up before laying up the outer tape adhesive. In some other methods, the tension layer is laid up before the laying up of the plurality of cords. The methods may further include partially or fully wrapping the belt with a belt wrap prior to vulcanizing the belt. In some aspects, the vulcanizable rubber of the tape adhesive is a rubber like that used in the cushion layer, while in some other cases, the vulcanizable rubber of the tape adhesive is a rubber which is different from that used in the cushion layer.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another aspect of the disclosure, methods of manufacturing a belt include, at least laying up the outer tape adhesive of the belt build on the mandrel, laying up the plurality of cords on the outer tape adhesive, laying up the cushion layer on an opposing side of the plurality of cords, and vulcanizing the belt build in a profile-forming mold.

In accordance with other embodiments, the belt <b>400</b> may have multiple drive surfaces of two or more. A fabric layer may also be on the non-drive outer surface <b>402</b> of the belt. The fabric layer may be made from a woven, non-woven or knitted fabric. Some useful fabrics in accordance with the disclosure include conventional materials such as nylon (such as nylon 4, 6, nylon 6, 6 and nylon 6), cotton, polyester, cotton/polyester, nylon/polyester, cotton/nylon, Lycra&#x2122; (segmented polyurethane), aramid, rayon and the like. In some embodiments, the fabric is made of nylon 6, 6.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The elastomers for use in the tension section <b>402</b> and the compression section <b>404</b> may be the same or different. Conventional elastomers which may be used in one or both of these sections include natural rubber, polychloroprene, acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymers (NBR), polyisoprene, zinc salts of unsaturated carboxylic acid ester grafted hydrogenated nitrile butadiene elastomers, styrene-butadiene rubbers, polybutadiene, ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber (EPDM), hydrogenated acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymers (HNBR), polyurethane, and ethylene-acrylic elastomers. The insulation layer <b>410</b> may in some cases be a blend of an elastomer and a thermoplastic. The elastomer component of the insulation layer <b>410</b> is selected from conventional elastomers used in manufacturing belts and includes, but is not limited to, the list of elastomers set forth above in the discussion of elastomers for use in the tension section <b>402</b> and compression section <b>404</b> of the belt <b>400</b>. Some suitable examples of the elastomers are butadiene copolymers such as polybutadiene, NBR, and HNBR.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In each of the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>4</b></figref> above, belt body portions may be formed of any conventional and/or suitable cured elastomer composition, and may be of the same as or different from that described below in relation to the optional adhesive rubber member comprising tensile reinforcement layers. Suitable elastomers that may be utilized for this purpose include for example polyurethane elastomers (including as well polyurethane/urea elastomers and so-called millable gums) (PU), polychloroprene rubber (CR), acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR), hydrogenated NBR (HNBR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), alkylated chlorosulfonated polyethylene (ACSM), polyepichlorohydrin, polybutadiene rubber (BR), natural rubber (NR), and ethylene alpha olefin elastomers such as ethylene propylene copolymers (EPM), ethylene propylene diene terpolymers (EPDM), ethylene octene copolymers (EOM), ethylene butene copolymers (EBM), ethylene octene terpolymers (EODM); and ethylene butene terpolymers (EBDM); ethylene vinylacetate elastomers (EVM); ethylene methylacrylate (EAM); and silicone rubber, or a combination of any two or more of the foregoing.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In preparing the elastomeric belt (or other articles) body portions, in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosure, the elastomer(s) may be blended with conventional rubber compounding ingredients including fillers, plasticizers, stabilizers, vulcanization agents/curatives and accelerators, in amounts conventionally employed; and, while the tape adhesives according to the disclosure is a vulcanizable rubber which is devoid carbon black, it may also be devoid of any one or more of these ingredients. When ethylene-alpha-olefin elastomer and diene elastomers such as HNBR are used in the elastomeric portions, one or more metal salts of alpha-beta organic acids may be employed in amounts now conventionally utilized to improve dynamic performance of the resultant article. Thus, zinc dimethacrylate and/or zinc diacrylate may be utilized in such compositions in amounts of from about 1 to about 50 pounds per hundred pounds of elastomer (phr); or alternatively of from about 5 to about 30 phr; or of from about 10 to about 25 phr. These materials furthermore contribute to the adhesiveness of the composition, and increase the overall cross-link density of the polymer upon curing with peroxide or related agents through ionic crosslinking. Further, any number of suitable compositions for utilization in or as the elastomeric portions of the rubber articles useful herein, may be used, and could be selected from elastomer compositions described for example in The R. T. Vanderbilt Rubber Handbook (13th ed., 1996), and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,610,217, the contents of which, are incorporated herein by reference. In an embodiment of the disclosure, associated with automotive accessory drive applications, the elastomeric belt body portions 12 may be formed, in some cases, of a suitable ethylene alpha olefin composition, such as an EPM, EPDM, EBM or EOM composition.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Any of the belt body portions may, in some aspects, include discontinuous fibers as is well known in the art, utilizing materials such as including but not limited to cotton, polyester, fiberglass, aramid and nylon, in such forms as staple or chopped fibers, flock or pulp, in amounts generally employed. In some embodiments, relating to profiled (e.g., as by cutting or grinding) multi-v-ribbed belts, such fiber loading is formed and arranged such that a substantial portion of the fibers are formed and arranged to lay in a direction generally transverse the direction of travel of the belt. In molded multi-v-ribbed belts and/or synchronous belts made according to flow through methods however, the fiber loading would generally lack the same degree of orientation.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The tape adhesives according to the disclosure, which are vulcanizable rubber devoid of at least carbon black, may be provided as a preform and thereafter laid up, or otherwise applied, during the belt build. A tape adhesive preform is different from the conventional adhesive applications which uses a solvated tackifying resin which is applied by spraying or dipping, followed by volatile solvent flash off. In some aspects, the tape adhesive preform is actually devoid of volatile solvent when applied in the belt build. Also, the tape adhesive preform(s) may be applied by an operator, a machine, or any other suitable technique. Further, the tape adhesive preform(s) could be provided as a double faced tape, and applied to the surface(s) that it is used for adherence onto.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to some aspects of the disclosure, the belts are built up on a mandrel in a series of layers before vulcanization.

For example, the fabrication process may include evacuating the air from inside the mold, applying steam pressure on the outside shell to a range of about 175 to 235 psig (about 1.2 to 1.62 MPa) for about 2 to 10 minutes, then applying steam pressure on the inside of the mold to a range of about 85 to 210 psig (about 0.59 to 1.45 MPa), and curing for about 10 to 20 minutes. Once cooled, the cured belt build is then separated from the mandrel and cut to the appropriate belt widths. The optimum rib shapes may be achieved with process pressures on the high end of the range. Hydraulics or other methods known in the art (pneumatic, mechanical, and the like) can also be used to apply pressure to the belt, in conjunction with concurrently applied electric heat for curing in lieu of steam cure. The pressure range for a hydraulic cure may be about 85 to 500 psig (about 0.59 to 3.45 MPa). The temperature range may be about 250 to 500&#xb0; F. (about 120 to 260&#xb0; C.). This method of curing broadens the choice of rubber stocks to include many with relatively poor scorch safety and/or relatively high viscosity.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">While some aspects of the disclosure are illustrated with reference to the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b>E</figref>, it should be understood that the disclosure is not to be limited to these particular embodiments or forms as illustrated but rather is applicable to any belt construction within the scope of the claims as defined below.
