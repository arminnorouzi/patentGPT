Neurogenic bladder can be defined as impaired urinary function due to neurological injury or disease, such as spinal cord injury (SCI). Some known methods for managing neurogenic bladder and other chronic urinary retention disorders are to drain the bladder using (a) intermittent catheterization (IC), or (b) indwelling Foley catheters. These methods, however, are associated with relatively high rates of urinary tract infection and genito-urinary (GU) injury, each of which diminishes a patient's quality of life. Furthermore, because some individuals with neurogenic bladder lack bladder sensation, and thus cannot accurately perceive bladder fullness, they are susceptible to bladder over-filling. This can result in urinary &#x201c;accidents&#x201d; and/or urinary reflux, and urinary reflux presents a risk of infection and tissue damage to the upper urinary tract.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">To avoid these problems, individuals with neurogenic bladder on an IC program commonly rely on a timed catheterization schedule. This approach is imprecise and may lead to catheterization more frequently than necessary, which can increase the risk of infection and GU injury. Therefore, it is desirable to provide an improved urinary prosthesis that helps to alleviate one or all of the preceding problems.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This application incorporates by reference the following: U.S. application Ser.

The disclosed devices, systems, and methods may be used for fluid flow control for other bodily organs as well, such as kidneys, or draining abscesses or fluids from a body.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An extended-use catheter as disclosed is configured for being retained inside of the body. The catheter can be used, for example, in the human male or human female urinary tract. When in use, its distal end, which is the end that is positioned inside of the user's (or &#x201c;patient's&#x201d;) bladder is preferably positioned fully inside of, and retained in, the bladder and the remainder of the catheter is positioned in the urethra. In one embodiment, the catheter comprises an elongated tube (or &#x201c;tube&#x201d;) having a wall with an outer surface, and a lumen through which fluid, such as urine, can pass. Positioned on, or formed as part of, the tube wall are at least two structures to help retain the catheter in the body of a user. One is a retainer configured to be positioned in the bulbar urethra when the catheter is properly positioned in the body and the other is a bladder retention structure (or &#x201c;retention structure&#x201d;) configured to be positioned in the bladder when the catheter is properly positioned in the body.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The retention structure is juxtaposed the distal end of the catheter, is flexible and is comprised of a soft, flexible material, such as silicone rubber. The retention structure can be a structure having a flexible flat portion (also referred to as a &#x201c;flap&#x201d; or &#x201c;wing&#x201d;) that has a first, compressed position (or &#x201c;first position&#x201d; or &#x201c;compressed position&#x201d;) in which it is pressed against and may be at least partially wrapped around the tube, and a second, extended position (or &#x201c;second position&#x201d; or &#x201c;extended position&#x201d;) in which it extends outwards from the tube and has a length as measured from where it connects to the tube body of about 2-6 times greater than the outer diameter of the tube, although any suitable length may be used. This retention structure also has an attachment portion with an aperture that fits over and retains part of the tube body, or alternatively the attachment portion can be overmolded onto the tube. The flap is in its second position where it extends outward from the tube when positioned in the bladder, and is configured to collapse to its first position when pulled through the penile urethra. The retention structure can be moved from the second, expanded position to the first, compressed position by applying sufficient force to push it into, or pull it out, the penile urethra.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Alternatively, the retention structure may have a handle shape with an opening. In this embodiment, the retention structure has an attachment portion with an aperture that fits over and retains part of the tube body, or alternatively the attachment portion can be overmolded onto the tube. The housing has a housing distal end juxtaposed the distal end of the housing and a housing proximal end that is farther from the distal end of the catheter. A handle-shaped portion has a first leg attached to the housing distal end and a second leg attached to the housing proximal end. A center portion is formed between the first leg and the second leg. This retention structure has a first, compressed position (or &#x201c;first position&#x201d; or &#x201c;compressed position&#x201d;) in which the center portion is pressed close to or against the tube, and a second, extended position (or &#x201c;second position&#x201d; or &#x201c;extended position&#x201d;) in which the center portion extends outwards from the tube about 2-6 times farther than the tube diameter, although any suitable distance would suffice.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The first leg, second leg, and center portion each have a thickness that is about 1-4 times the thickness of a wall of the tube, although any suitable thickness may suffice. An opening (or &#x201c;window&#x201d; or &#x201c;space&#x201d;) is between the center portion, the first leg, the second leg, and the outer wall of the tube and the opening has a height as measured from the tube outer surface to the inner surface of the center position of about 2-4 times the outer diameter of the tube, although any suitable height would suffice. This retention structure is also comprised of a soft, flexible material such as silicone rubber. Each bladder retention structure is further configured to assist in keeping one or more of the aperture(s) at the distal end from pressing against the wall of the bladder, which could block or inhibit the flow of fluid into the apertures.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The catheter may also include a retainer positioned between the distal end and the proximal end of the tube. The retainer preferably has one of the same structures as the bladder retention structure, although the dimensions may be different because the retainer is positioned in the bulbar urethra when the catheter id deployed in a body. The retainer is configured to help maintain the distal end in the bladder until sufficient force is applied to remove the distal end from the bladder (e.g., a user pulls the catheter out of the body). Once in the bulbar urethra, the retainer extends outward to its extended position in order to secure the catheter in position with the retention structure in the bulbar urethra and the distal end of the tube in the bladder until a user removes the catheter from the body. The retainer is configured to move to its first, compressed position when moved through the penile urethra.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, any of the structures used on the distal end of the catheters shown in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/436,773, entitled &#x201c;URINARY CATHETER,&#x201d; could be used as a retention structure or retainer in a catheter according to this disclosure, although the dimensions may be altered.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A catheter according to this disclosure could be periodically inserted, removed, and replaced by the user without medical assistance or the aid of another individual, which is convenient and saves time and medical expense. Such a catheter could remain in the body for days or weeks without being removed, which alleviates the problem of catheterization multiple times per day.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The catheter may be configured to include one or more sensors, which may be on, inside of, or embedded in material forming the catheter, or partially or entirely within the lumen. The one or more sensors can be at any suitable location on the catheter, such as at a position where they are positioned in the bladder when the catheter is properly positioned in the lower urinary tract of a human male. The one or more sensors could collect any relevant data, such as fluid pressure in the bladder, pH level of fluid, temperature, volume of urine in the bladder, and/or amount of blood or bacteria in urine. The one or more sensors could communicate with other devices, such as CT scanners, ultrasound devices, x-ray machines, electronic data storage devices, computers, cell phones, the wireless controller, the catheter mating device and/or sensors placed in toilets or hospital beds. The data collected by the sensors could be stored, analyzed and/or transmitted by a device including software configured for these functions.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Because the catheter can remain in the body for long periods, a sensor on the catheter can gather and send data over the entire period the catheter is in the body, as opposed to gathering data only at a specific time, such as when a patent is at a doctor's office or hospital.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">A catheter mating device configured to engage and move the catheter is also disclosed and may be part of a system according to aspects of the invention. The catheter mating device has a distal end and a proximal end. The distal end is configured to connect to the proximal end of the catheter, and includes an apparatus moveable between: (a) a first position, wherein the apparatus is retracted, and (b) a second position, wherein the apparatus is expanded. When in the first position, the apparatus is configured to fit into the lumen (or a mating chamber of the catheter) at the proximal end of the catheter. Once placed in the lumen, the apparatus can be moved to its second position, wherein the apparatus expands until it presses against and engages the wall of the lumen (or inner wall of the mating chamber). That connects the catheter mating device to the catheter, and the catheter can then be pushed into, or removed from a body structure, such as a bladder and urethra by, respectively, pushing or pulling the catheter mating device. Thus, the catheter mating device can be used to: (a) accurately place the catheter inside of a body, and/or (b) remove the catheter from a body.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As used herein, the term &#x201c;user&#x201d; means any person able to insert and/or remove a catheter as disclosed herein, and includes a patient, doctor, caregiver, and nurse. &#x201c;Patient&#x201d; means a person that

num="0057">Extended-Use Catheter</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Turning now to the Figures, wherein the purpose is to describe preferred embodiments and not to limit the scope of the invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>1</b>G and <b>3</b></figref> show an exemplary catheter <b>10</b> according to aspects of the invention. Catheter <b>10</b> is an extended use catheter, and can be shaped and sized to be introduced into, and retained in, the lower urinary tract of a human male or human female. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, catheter <b>10</b> can extend from the bladder <b>2050</b> to a portion of the urethra <b>2600</b> distal to the prostate and distal to the bulbar urethra. Catheter <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> extends past the prostate and the external urinary sphincter. In a female anatomy, the retainer <b>20</b> is preferably positioned within the urethra, between the internal urethral orifice and the external urethral orifice. The retainer <b>20</b> can then be positioned such that it is in the bulbar urethra between the meatus and the external urethral sphincter with the retention structure and distal end positioned in the bladder. Catheter <b>10</b> is preferably fully internal to the body once properly installed.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>1</b>C, and <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, catheter <b>10</b> can comprise a tube <b>12</b> with a wall <b>12</b>A having an outer surface <b>12</b>B, a lumen <b>14</b> with a lumen wall <b>14</b>A, a valve <b>100</b>, a retainer <b>20</b>, a proximal end <b>16</b> with a proximal tip <b>16</b>A and an engagement chamber <b>16</b>B, and a distal end <b>18</b> with bladder retention structure <b>19</b>, and openings <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B. The catheter tube <b>12</b>, which is shown in cross section in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, preferably has a circular cross-sectional shape, but can be of any shape suitable for the intended use of catheter <b>10</b>. In one embodiment tube wall <b>12</b>A has a thickness of about 0.45 mm, or from about 0.35 mm to about 0.55 mm.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">When used in the lower urinary tract of a human male, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, tube <b>12</b> preferably has an outer diameter (as measured across outer surface <b>12</b>B) ranging from about 1 French (0.3 mm) to 20 French (6.6 mm), which is approximately the same as or less than the maximum expanded dimension of the urethra <b>2600</b>. Wall <b>12</b>A can have a hardness of any amount from: about 30 Shore A to 55 Shore D, or about 60 Shore A, or about 30 to 70 Shore A, or about 20 to 50 Shore A, although any suitable hardness for the intended use of catheter <b>10</b> would suffice.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Lumen <b>14</b> may have any suitable cross-sectional geometrical shape (e.g., circular (which is most preferred), oval, semi-circular, rectangular, triangular, trapezoidal, or crescent) and can have a cross-sectional surface area (which is the area inside of lumen wall <b>14</b>A when viewed in cross section) equivalent to the area of a 0.1 mm diameter circle to that of a 5.5 mm diameter circle. If the cross-sectional shape of lumen <b>14</b> is circular lumen <b>14</b> preferably has a diameter of any amount from: 0.1 mm to 5.5 mm. Lumen <b>14</b> may also comprise different cross-sectional areas along its length. For example, the cross-sectional area of the lumen may be greater where the valve <b>100</b> is positioned, and/or a greater cross-sectional area at the proximal end <b>16</b>. Or the lumen's cross-sectional area may be greater along its entire length distal to valve <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Tip <b>16</b>A can have an outer diameter larger or smaller than the diameter of the outer wall <b>12</b>B. For example, tip <b>16</b>A may have a diameter of 0.5 mm-1 mm larger or smaller than the diameter of outer wall <b>12</b>B. The purpose of tip <b>16</b>A having a slightly different diameter is so a user can locate it by touch (e.g., by pressing against the skin and feeling the ridge at tip <b>16</b>A) when tip <b>16</b>A is positioned in the penile urethra, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Engagement chamber <b>16</b>B can be at or near the proximal end <b>16</b> of the catheter <b>10</b>. The engagement chamber <b>16</b>B can be located between the proximal tip <b>16</b>A and the valve <b>100</b>, or extend from proximal tip <b>16</b>A to the most distal portion of valve <b>100</b> and retain valve <b>100</b>. The engagement chamber <b>16</b>B includes a space configured to engage an apparatus <b>1172</b>, which is described below. The engagement chamber <b>16</b>B can have an annular, cylindrical shape, with a circular cross-section although any suitable shape may be used. As shown, the engagement chamber <b>16</b>B has a circular cross-sectional shape with a diameter preferably form 0.1 mm to 5.5 mm. The engagement chamber <b>16</b>B may have a hardness greater than the hardness of tube <b>12</b>. For example, the hardness may be of any hardness between 10 Shore A to 55 Shore D harder than tube <b>12</b>, or 10 Shore A-20 Shore A or harder, or 20 Shore A-50 Shore A or harder, or 50 Shore A-55 Shore D or harder. A purpose for engagement chamber <b>16</b>B being harder than tube <b>12</b> is to better secure apparatus <b>1172</b> in engagement chamber <b>16</b>B. It is not, however, required that catheter <b>10</b> have a mating chamber <b>16</b>B or that mating chamber <b>16</b>B be harder than the rest of tube <b>12</b>. For example, apparatus <b>1172</b> could engage lumen wall <b>14</b>A or another structure.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>5</b>-<b>6</b>, and <b>9</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, distal end <b>18</b> is configured to enter the patient's body through the urethral orifice <b>2700</b>, and into the urethra <b>2600</b> when catheter <b>10</b> is positioned inside the lower urinary tract, and is finally positioned in the bladder. As shown in this embodiment, distal end <b>18</b> has a bullet-shaped tip <b>18</b>C that is tapered, rounded and closed. The distal tip <b>18</b>C can comprise a material with hardness greater than the hardness of wall <b>12</b>A, such as a hardness of 10% greater, 20% greater, 30% greater, 40% greater, 50% greater, 50-100% greater, or 20-100% greater. Tip <b>18</b>C narrows from an annular proximal part P to a rounded end R. It has an intermediate, tapered portion T that reduces in cross-sectional area from about 5% to 20% from proximal part P before reaching rounded end R.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Distal end <b>18</b> permits the inflow of bodily fluid, such as urine, from a bladder or other body part into lumen <b>14</b>, which can be accomplished in any suitable manner. As shown one or more (and preferably, two) openings <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B permit bodily fluid, such as urine, to enter lumen <b>14</b>. As shown, openings <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B are on opposite sides of tube <b>12</b>, so if one opening <b>18</b>A or <b>18</b>B is blocked because it is positioned against body tissue, the other opening <b>18</b>A or <b>18</b>B should still be unblocked. However, there need only be one opening, or there could be more than two openings at distal end <b>18</b>, and the openings could be of any suitable size, configuration or location so they allow fluid, such as urine from the bladder, to enter lumen <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">When catheter <b>10</b> is positioned in the lower urinary tract of a human male, the one or more openings <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B are positioned in the bladder <b>2500</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Retainer</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Retainer <b>20</b>, shown in Figures is positioned between the distal end <b>18</b> and the proximal end <b>16</b>. The retainer <b>20</b> is positioned in the bulbar urethra <b>2300</b> when catheter <b>10</b> is properly positioned in the lower urinary tract of a human male, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>. Retainer <b>20</b> is configured to help prevent the inadvertent migration of catheter <b>10</b> either forward or backward once catheter <b>10</b> is properly positioned in the body. When positioned in the bulbar urethra, the retainer <b>20</b> is blocked by the external sphincter to prevent inadvertent retrograde migration, and blocked by the penile portion of the urethra <b>2600</b> to prevent inadvertent ante grade migration. When sufficient pulling or pushing force is applied to catheter <b>10</b>, retainer <b>20</b> compresses from its second, expanded position, in which it is extended from outer surface <b>12</b>B of tube <b>12</b>, as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>D-<b>1</b>G, <b>3</b>, and <b>9</b></figref>, to its first, compressed position, in which it is pressed against the outer wall <b>12</b>B of tube <b>12</b>, so that it can pass through the penile portion of the urethra <b>2600</b>. In this manner, catheter <b>10</b> can be removed from, or be placed in, the lower urinary tract. The retainer <b>20</b> may be of suitable thickness, length, and hardness suitable for use of the catheter <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">The retainer <b>20</b> as shown comprises a connecting (or attachment) portion <b>21</b>, which fits over, is overmolded, or is otherwise attached to outer wall <b>12</b>B of tube <b>12</b>, and a flap (or &#x201c;wing&#x201d; or &#x201c;structure&#x201d;) <b>22</b>. Flap <b>22</b> preferably has a length (as measured from the position where it connects to outer wall <b>12</b>B of tube <b>12</b> to the outermost edge <b>24</b>) that is about 20%, or about 30%, or about 40%, or about 50%, or about 60%, or about 70%, or about 80%, or about 90%, or about 100%, or about 120%, or about 150%, or any amount from 20%-50%, 30%-75%, 40%-100%, 100%-150%, or 100%-500%, or 200%-500%, or 300% to 600%, or 300% to 800%, of the diameter of the tube <b>12</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, the overall length of retainer <b>20</b> (including the diameter of tube <b>12</b>) is about 18.3 mm, or between 15 mm-25 mm.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Retainer <b>20</b> preferably has a thickness as measured from flat side <b>22</b>C to flat side <b>22</b>D that is about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 100%, about 110%, about 120%, about 130%, about 1540%, about 150%, or any amount from 10% to 150% of the thickness of the tube wall, as measured from outer surface <b>12</b>B to lumen wall <b>14</b>A. The thickness could be between 0.75 mm to 1.0 mm or about 0.085 mm.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Retainer <b>20</b> could have a <b>70</b>A shore hardness with a 0.85 mm wall thickness as measured along from side <b>22</b>C to side <b>22</b>D.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Retainer <b>20</b> has an axial length as measured from side <b>22</b>A to side <b>22</b>B along attachment portion <b>21</b> that can be about equal to the length (referenced above), or any amount from about 50% of the length to about 200% of the length, such as about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 100%, about 110%, about 120%, about 130%, about 1540%, about 150% about 160%, about 170%, about 180%, about 190%, or about 200%. In one embodiment the axial length is about 30 mm, or from about 25 mm to about 35 mm.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The retainer <b>20</b> may comprise a thicker portion, or thicker ridge (shown as a cylindrical bulb) <b>24</b>A along outer edge <b>24</b> as compared to the thickness of the rest of flap <b>22</b>. For example, the thickness of bulb <b>24</b>A could be thicker than the thickness as measured between surface <b>22</b>C and <b>22</b>D by any amount from 10% to 100%, such as 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100% thicker. This added thickness at edge <b>24</b> can aid in collapsing the retainer for insertion, also provide additional rigidity to support proper anchoring, and also provide a smooth surface to alleviate trauma.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The average retention force of catheter <b>10</b> (after it has been properly positioned in the bladder of an adult, human male) according to this disclosure in the forward direction (i.e., into the bladder) is about 0.5 lbs. to 1.0 lbs., 1.15 lbs. to 1.5 lbs., or about 1.15 lbs. to 1.70 lbs. The average retention force of catheter <b>10</b> (after it has been properly positioned in the bladder of an adult, human male) according to this disclosure in the reverse direction (i.e., outward from the bladder) is about: 0.5 lbs., to 1.0 lbs., 1.0 lbs. to 1.5 lbs., 1.30 lbs. to about 2.0 lbs., or about 1.3 lbs. to about 2.0 lbs., or about 1.3 lbs. to about 1.8 lbs.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The retainer <b>20</b> should be atraumatic, and it preferably is comprised of a flexible silicone, or other suitable material. When used in the lower urinary tract of a human male, the retainer <b>20</b> should compress to at least a dimension so that it can be pushed or pulled through the maximum expanded dimension of urethra <b>2600</b>, which could be a diameter of about 6 mm to 12 mm, or about 10 mm. The retainer <b>20</b> expands once it is no longer restricted. When used in the lower urinary tract of a human male, the retainer <b>20</b> moves to its first, compressed position when it is pulled through the urethra <b>2600</b> and expands to its second, expanded once it enters the bulbar urethra <b>2300</b>.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The retainer <b>20</b> is compressed to its first, compressed position when a total force is applied to it of about 0.1 lbs., 0.25 lbs., 0.1 lbs.-0.25 lbs., 0.05 lbs.-0.1 lbs., or 0.1 lbs.-0.2 lbs., 0.5 lbs., to 1.0 lbs., 1.0 lbs. to 1.5 lbs., 1.30 lbs. to 2.0 lbs., about 1.5 lbs. to about 2.2 lbs., or about 1.3 lbs. to about 1.8 lbs.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Another retainer <b>30</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>G and <b>21</b></figref> for catheter <b>10</b>A. This retainer <b>30</b> is handle-shaped and has an attachment portion <b>32</b> connected (or attached) to tube wall <b>12</b>B.

As used herein, any sensor used with a catheter according to the invention is referenced by numeral. Thus, one or more sensors refers to a single sensor and a plurality of sensors. The data can comprise one or more of: fluid pressure of urine in the bladder and/or urethra, volume of fluid in the bladder, temperature of fluid in the bladder and/or urethra, acidity of fluid in the bladder and/or urethra, bacteria type and quantity of fluid in the bladder and/or urethra, chemical composition of fluid of fluid in the bladder and/or urethra, fluid flow during emptying of the bladder when valve <b>100</b> is open, or actuated. One or more sensors as described in this disclosure are of a type known to those skilled in the relevant art, although the claims are not limited to presently-known sensors. One or more sensors on or inside of catheter <b>10</b>D would have basically consistent sensor location and extended sensors measurements within the body to better monitor patient conditions, without having sensors taken out of the body.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">In one embodiment, the one or more sensors can determine the pressure of urine within the bladder and send a signal to a processor that sends the information to a computing device, or the one or more sensors could send data directly to the computing device. The computing device, which can be any device, such as a PC or other computer, cell phone, dedicated catheter device, the wireless controller, or the catheter mating device, can have software that determines whether and when fluid (such as urine) needs to be drained from the bladder. The computing device can notify the user in any manner to drain urine from his/her bladder. In some embodiments, the one or more sensors can be used to determine when urine has been sufficiently drained from the bladder, such as by determining that the pressure level within the bladder has dropped below a certain level. This information can be used to close the valve <b>100</b> and halt the flow of urine from leaving the bladder. In some embodiments, the one or more sensors can include acoustics to determine the volume of urine in the bladder. Different types of sensors can be placed in or on the catheter <b>10</b> to determine metrics related to the health of areas of the body, such as bladder health.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">The data collected by the one or more sensors can be stored, analyzed, and/or transmitted via software resident on a device outside of the body in which one or more sensors is positioned.
