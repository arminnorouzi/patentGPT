More specifically, the present invention relates to solar powered fashion accessories such as glow jewelry designed to replace standard plastic, throwaway glow items, party favors and other chemically powered accessories. The accessory item features several different colors and styles available in green, blue, and other colors and hues, and is capable of being installed within necklaces, bracelets, wristbands, charms, pendants, broaches, rings, earrings, helix piercing rings, loops and pins, and other similar items. The fashion accessory, such as jewelry, includes photocells for capturing solar light and light emitting diodes (&#x201c;LED&#x201d;) for illumination. Accordingly, the present disclosure makes specific reference thereto. Nonetheless, it is to be appreciated that aspects of the present invention are also equally applicable to other like applications, devices, and methods of manufacture.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">By way of background, people, especially at parties, beaches, social events, reveal parties, and on holidays or when participating in holiday events, such as Halloween, day of the dead celebrations, enjoy using and wearing glow sticks, glow necklaces, wristbands, and other items that can be illuminated to create a festive mode or to further accentuate the theme. Generally, such glowing accessories and jewelry are chemiluminescent containing chemical substances that are mixed to produce light and generate a colored glow. However, such accessories or jewelry are not reusable and are typically discarded after use creating additional and unnecessary waste. People are required to throw them away after chemiluminescence is exhausted. This is not only expensive but also requires people to carry multiple glowing items of the same type and regularly repurchase such items to participate in the next event or in prolonged duration events.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many glowing accessories are made from fluorescence and phosphorescence technology for illumination. However, such glowing accessories only glow for a short period of time and are unusable after the glow period has elapsed.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some people like metallic chains and pendants and currently glowing techniques are not efficient with such aesthetically desirable items and accessories. People desire improved glowing accessories that can come in the form of necklaces, bracelets, wristbands, charms, pendants, broaches, rings, earrings, helix piercing rings, loops and pins, and other similar or combination of items.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, there exists a long-felt need in the art for a glowing fashion accessory such as, jewelry or other adornment, that is designed to be reusable. There is also a long-felt need in the art for a glowing fashion accessory, adornment or jewelry that does not require the use of any chemical substances for illumination. Additionally, there is a long-felt need in the art for an improved glowing wearable accessory item that is safe to wear by a user. Moreover, there is a long-felt need in the art for glowing adornment, accessory or jewelry that comes in various forms including necklaces, bracelets, wristbands, charms, pendants, broaches, rings, earrings, helix piercing rings, loops and pins, other combinations, and other similar items. Further, there is a long-felt need in the art for an improved adornment, accessory or jewelry that can remain illuminated for longer periods of time and has a longer life. Finally, there is a long-felt need in the art for an improved adornment, accessory or jewelry item that is cost-effective, multipurpose and use a free source of energy such as solar energy for providing power for illumination of the jewelry.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The subject matter disclosed and claimed herein, in one embodiment thereof, comprises a solar powered reusable adornment, accessory or jewelry. The adornment, accessory or jewelry is designed as a rechargeable and usable fashion accessory to replace standard plastic, throwaway glow items. The jewelry or accessory comprises a thin solar rope string, with the string having a plurality of photocells integrated therein.

The illumination article comprises a light source for illuminating at least a portion of the article, and a battery for providing power to the light source. The battery is positioned in a clasp or other closure of the jewelry, and a plurality of photocells that are positioned in at least a portion of the jewelry for converting solar energy into electrical energy. The electrical energy is used by the light source for illumination. The article further comprises a plurality of crystals, design elements or beads and a sun catcher for creating a sparkling effect using the natural light impinging on the jewelry, as well as the artificial light provided by the light source.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring initially to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of one potential embodiment of the solar powered glowing illumination accessory <b>100</b> of the present invention in accordance with the disclosed specification. The glowing accessory <b>100</b> of the present embodiment is in the form of a necklace that has a transparent or translucent nylon cord <b>102</b> having magnetic clasps or closure ends <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>. The magnetic clasp or closure ends <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> are configured to make a closed loop of the cord <b>102</b>. It should be noted that the cord <b>102</b> may have hook, loop or any other fastening or closing mechanism for making a closed loop. The closing of the rope or cord may also complete the circuit to enable the illumination feature to commence the illumination cycle.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The nylon cord <b>102</b> is hollow and has a cavity <b>108</b>, having a diameter ranging from 1/32&#x2033; to about 2&#x2033;, running through length of the cord <b>102</b> for accommodating a solar rope string <b>110</b>. The solar rope string <b>110</b> runs from the first clasp end <b>104</b> to the opposite clasp end <b>106</b>. The solar rope string <b>110</b> is configured to have continuous photocells (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) along the length for capturing solar light. The solar rope string <b>110</b> also has LEDs <b>112</b> disposed thereon that illuminate using the captured solar light. The solar rope string <b>110</b> can be easily accommodated in the nylon cord <b>102</b> and enables the necklace <b>100</b> to glow at night, in low illumination, or dark areas. The photocells may be interspersed with the LEDs in equal instances, or the photocells may be provided in groups or sets at a different portion of the rope and the LEDs provided at other areas or in the same areas as the photocells.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The illumination article such as a necklace <b>100</b> has a pendant <b>114</b> that is fixedly attached to, or hangs from, the nylon cord <b>102</b>. The pendant <b>114</b> can have any shape and size and has a solar powered illuminating element <b>116</b>. The solar powered illuminating element <b>116</b> provides illumination in the pendant and uses solar energy for power.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The illumination article, such as a necklace <b>100</b>, has transparent beads, other design/decorative elements and crystals <b>118</b> that reflect or enhance the light illuminated by solar rope string <b>110</b> for creating a glowing effect. The beads, decorative elements or crystals <b>118</b> can also be in a specific color for providing glow in a specific or multicolor.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a close-up view of the solar rope string <b>110</b> used in glowing necklace <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in accordance with the disclosed specification. As illustrated, the solar rope string <b>110</b> has a plurality of photocells <b>202</b> for capturing solar energy. The photocells <b>202</b> are disposed in the string <b>110</b> and are designed to capture enough solar energy in an hour to allow illumination of the LEDs <b>112</b> for more than six hours.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">More specifically, the LEDs <b>112</b> are adhered or integrated along the surface of the string <b>110</b> and provide illumination, in a continuous, intermittent, flashing, running or circling effect or any other desired illumination effects. The string <b>110</b> has an associated button battery <b>204</b> that is configured to store electric power produced by the photocells <b>202</b>. The button battery <b>204</b> is preferably positioned inside one of clasps or closures of the necklace or fashion accessory <b>100</b> and provides power to the LEDs <b>112</b>.
