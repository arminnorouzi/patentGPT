A known example of a machine tool for grinding the convex spherical surface of such a workpiece is the honing machine disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application publication No. 2015-229214.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">As disclosed, this honing machine machines a curved or spherical surface of a workpiece and includes a workpiece rotation mechanism for rotating the workpiece and a grindstone rotation mechanism for rotating a grindstone. In this honing machine, the grindstone rotation mechanism includes a turret rotation disk having grindstones attached on the outer periphery thereof, a single grindstone driving means rotating a shaft of each grindstone, and an uncoupling means uncoupling grindstone rotating shafts and a shaft of the grindstone driving means.

Accordingly, if the product to be machined is small in production quantity, the equipment cost to order volume will be excessive, which leads to significantly high manufacturing cost. Further, the mechanical operation of the honing machine is also complicated because of its complicated structure; therefore, the honing machine cannot always provide efficient machining.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been achieved in view of the above-described circumstances, and an object of the invention is to provide a machine tool which is capable of efficiently grinding a convex spherical surface of a workpiece by a relatively simple configuration.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">To solve the above-described problems, the present invention provides a machine tool including:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">a workpiece spindle unit including a workpiece spindle and a workpiece spindle motor, the workpiece spindle being rotatably held and configured to hold a workpiece, the workpiece spindle motor being configured to rotate the workpiece spindle;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">a tool spindle unit including a tool spindle and a tool spindle motor, the tool spindle being rotatably held and configured to hold a cup grindstone having a concave surface, the tool spindle motor being configured to rotate the tool spindle;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">a first-axis movement mechanism and a second-axis movement mechanism configured to relatively move, in a plane including an axis of the workpiece spindle and an axis of the tool spindle, the workpiece spindle unit and the tool spindle unit in a direction of a first axis and a direction of a second axis intersecting the first axis, respectively; and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">a controller configured to control the workpiece spindle motor, the tool spindle motor, the first-axis movement mechanism, and the second-axis movement mechanism, wherein:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">the first-axis movement mechanism includes a first-axis drive motor;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">the second-axis movement mechanism includes a second-axis drive motor;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">the tool spindle unit is arranged such that the axis of the tool spindle intersects the axis of the workpiece spindle; and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">the controller is configured to drive the first-axis movement mechanism and the second-axis movement mechanism to relatively move the workpiece spindle unit and the tool spindle unit along the axis of the tool spindle through combined operation of the first-axis movement mechanism and second-axis movement mechanism, thereby grinding the workpiece held by the workpiece spindle with the cup grindstone held by the tool spindle.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">This machine tool consists of the bare minimum of components required to grind a convex spherical surface of a workpiece, i.e., the workpiece spindle unit, the tool spindle unit, the first-axis movement mechanism, the second-axis movement mechanism, and the controller controlling them. Therefore, this machine tool can be produced at a low cost; consequently, even when the product to be machined is small in production quantity, the equipment cost to order volume can be suppressed and the product can therefore be manufactured at an appropriate cost.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this machine tool, as described above, the controller drives the first-axis movement mechanism and the second-axis movement mechanism to relatively move the workpiece spindle unit and the tool spindle unit along the axis of the tool spindle through combined operation of the first-axis movement mechanism and second-axis movement mechanism, whereby the workpiece held by the workpiece spindle is grinded by the cup grindstone held by the tool spindle. Thus, this machine tool grinds a workpiece by a very simple mechanical operation; therefore, this machine tool is capable of providing more efficient machining than the above-described conventional honing machine.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The machine tool according to the present invention may have a configuration in which:</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">the controller is configured to drive at least one of the first-axis movement mechanism and second-axis movement mechanism to relatively move the workpiece spindle unit and the tool spindle unit at a rapid feed rate such that the cup grindstone is positioned at an approach position set at a position prior to the cup grindstone coming into contact with the workpiece, and then drive both the first-axis movement mechanism and the second-axis movement mechanism to relatively move the workpiece spindle unit and the tool spindle unit at a grinding feed rate set for grinding; and</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">the controller is further configured to monitor a load on at least one of the workpiece spindle motor, tool spindle motor, first-axis drive motor, and second-axis drive motor to detect the cup grindstone coming into contact with the workpiece and configured to revise the approach position to a position which is located prior to and spaced a preset distance from a detected contact position between the cup grindstone and the workpiece.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In this machine tool, for example, when starting grinding with a new cup grindstone attached to the tool spindle, the position of the grinding acting surface of the cup grindstone is not accurately recognized; therefore, the approach position for the first-time grinding is set at a safe position which is sufficiently spaced away. In the first-time grinding, the position of contact between the cup grindstone and the workpiece is recognized through monitoring of a load on at least one of the workpiece spindle motor, tool spindle motor, first-axis drive motor, and second-axis drive motor, and, based on the recognized position, the approach position is revised to a position shifted as much as possible to the workpiece side. Thereafter, in and after the second-time machining, the cup grindstone is first moved at a rapid feed rate to the approach position shifted as much as possible to the workpiece side, and then grinding is performed at a grinding feed rate; therefore, the grinding is performed efficiently in a shorter machining time.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Furthermore, the machine tool according to the present invention may have a configuration in which:</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">the machine tool further includes a detector configured to detect an outer diameter of the workpiece reaching a predetermined dimension during grinding of the workpiece;</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">the controller is configured to finish the grinding when the detector detects the outer diameter of the workpiece reaching the predetermined dimension and configured to store as a machining completion position a relative positional relation between the cup grindstone and the workpiece at time of detection; and</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">the controller is further configured to, in machining a plurality of workpieces with the cup grindstone, compare a machining completion position obtained in machining of a current workpiece with a machining completion position obtained in machining of an initial workpiece, and when an amount of variation between the machining completion positions exceeds a predetermined limit amount, judge that the cup grindstone has reached an end of its life and make a notification to outside.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the machine tool having this configuration, a relative positional relation between the cup grindstone and the workpiece obtained at the time when completion of machining is detected by the detector is stored as a machining completion position. Further, in machining a plurality of workpieces, the machining completion position detected in each machining is compared with the initially detected machining completion position and an amount of variation between them is calculated. This amount of variation is equivalent to an amount of wear of the cup grindstone. Therefore, when the amount of variation, i.e., the amount of wear, exceeds a predetermined limit amount, the cup grindstone is judged to have reached the end of its life and a notification is made to the outside. Since the notification that the cup grindstone has reached the end of its life is made to the outside, it is possible to replace the cup grindstone having reached the end of its life with a new one at an appropriate time. By replacing the cup grindstone appropriately in this manner, the grinding acting part of the cup grindstone, which performs machining on the workpieces, is kept in a suitable condition, so that the accuracy in machining the workpieces is suitably maintained.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, the machine tool according to the present invention may have a configuration in which:</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">the cup grindstone has a through hole formed to penetrate the cup grindstone along an axis of the cup grindstone;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">the tool spindle has a supply hole communicating with the through hole of the cup grindstone held by the tool spindle; and</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">the machine tool further includes a coolant supply mechanism configured to supply coolant to the supply hole of the tool spindle to discharge the coolant through an opening of the through hole formed in the cup grindstone.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In typical grinding, coolant is supplied to the grinding acting part to cool the workpiece and prevent clogging of the grindstone. However, in grinding using a cup grindstone, these effects cannot be expected because coolant sprayed from the outside hardly reaches the inside of the grinding acting part. With the machine tool having the above-described configuration, since the coolant supply mechanism is provided such that coolant is discharged through the opening of the through hole formed in the cup grindstone, coolant spreads all over the grinding acting part; therefore, the above-mentioned cooling effect and clogging prevention effect are sufficiently obtained.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The machine tool according to the present invention consists of the bare minimum of components required to grind a convex spherical surface of a workpiece, i.e., the workpiece spindle unit, the tool spindle unit, the first-axis movement mechanism, the second-axis movement mechanism, and the controller controlling them. Therefore, this machine tool can be produced at a low cost; consequently, even when the product to be machined is small in production quantity, the equipment cost to order volume can be suppressed and the product can therefore be manufactured at an appropriate cost.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further, this machine tool grinds a workpiece by the very simple mechanical operation, that is, by driving the first-axis movement mechanism and the second-axis movement mechanism through the controller so as to relatively move the workpiece spindle unit and the tool spindle unit along the axis of the tool spindle through combined operation of the first-axis movement mechanism and second-axis movement mechanism.

The grinding control unit <b>52</b> executes a process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>. Specifically, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> starts the process upon receipt of a continuous machining start command from the continuous machining control unit <b>51</b>, and then waits until receiving a machining start command from the continuous machining control unit <b>51</b>, that is to say, until an unmachined workpiece W becomes ready for grinding after being clamped by the chuck <b>19</b> (step S<b>1</b>).</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Upon receipt of the machining start command, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> drives the workpiece spindle motor <b>20</b> to rotate the workpiece spindle <b>17</b>, the chuck <b>19</b>, and the workpiece W, drives the tool spindle motor <b>28</b> to rotate the tool spindle <b>27</b> and the grindstone T, and starts supply of coolant from the coolant supply <b>42</b> (step S<b>2</b>). Once the supply of coolant from the coolant supply <b>42</b> is started, coolant is supplied to the through hole <b>27</b><i>a </i>of the tool spindle <b>27</b> through the supply pipe <b>43</b> and the rotary joint <b>41</b>. Thereafter, the coolant passes through the through hole <b>27</b><i>a </i>and then the through holes T<sub>1a </sub>and T<sub>2a </sub>of the grindstone T, after which the coolant is discharged through an opening formed in the concave surface T<sub>1b</sub>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Subsequently, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> drives the air cylinder <b>38</b> to advance the detector <b>39</b> toward the workpiece W and bring the pair of styluses <b>39</b><i>a </i>into contact with the spherical portion Wa of the workpiece W such that the spherical portion Wa is sandwiched by the pair of styluses <b>39</b> (step S<b>3</b>). Thereafter, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> verifies whether this machining is the first time after replacement for the grindstone T (step S<b>4</b>). Where it is the first time, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> sets a counter n to the initial value &#x201c;1&#x201d; (step S<b>5</b>), and then drives the X-axis drive motor <b>11</b> and the Z-axis drive motor <b>8</b> to move the carriage <b>4</b> and the table <b>5</b> at a rapid feed rate to move the grindstone T to a provisionally set approach position (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;provisional approach position&#x201d;) (step S<b>6</b>).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The provisional approach position is a safe position which is sufficiently spaced away such that the grindstone T cannot come into contact with the workpiece W. The provisional approach position is set at a position such that the concave surface T<sub>1b </sub>of the grindstone T comes into contact with the spherical portion Wa of the workpiece W when the grindstone T is moved toward the spherical portion Wa along the axis of the tool spindle <b>27</b> from the position. The provisional approach position is previously set and stored in the information storage <b>53</b> of the controller <b>50</b>. Information on whether the machining is the first time after replacement for the grindstone T is also stored in the information storage <b>53</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Subsequently, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> drives the X-axis drive motor <b>11</b> and the Z-axis drive motor <b>8</b> to move the grindstone T at a grinding feed rate along the axis of the tool spindle <b>27</b> through combined operation of the X-axis movement mechanism <b>9</b> and Z-axis movement mechanism <b>6</b> (step S<b>7</b>), and monitors the status of load of at least one of the X-axis drive motor <b>11</b>, Z-axis drive motor <b>8</b>, and workpiece spindle motor <b>20</b> to detect the concave surface T<sub>1b </sub>of the grindstone T coming into contact with the spherical portion Wa (step S<b>8</b>). That is to say, the loads on the X-axis drive motor <b>11</b>, Z-axis drive motor <b>8</b>, and workpiece spindle motor <b>20</b> are increased when the concave surface T<sub>1b </sub>of the grindstone T comes into contact with the spherical portion Wa. Therefore, monitoring any of these motors enables detection of the grindstone T coming into contact with the spherical portion Wa.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Once detecting the grindstone T coming into contact with the spherical portion Wa, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> revises, i.e., updates, the provisional approach position stored in the information storage <b>53</b> with a position which is reached by moving the grindstone T a predetermined distance away from the spherical portion Wa along the axis of the tool spindle <b>27</b> from the position at which the grindstone T is positioned at the time of detection (step S<b>9</b>). The approach position after this revision (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;revised approach position&#x201d;) is a position which is shifted as much as possible to the spherical portion Wa side from the provisional approach position and at which the grindstone T cannot come into contact with the spherical portion Wa.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">After the grindstone T comes into contact with the spherical portion Wa, the spherical portion Wa is grinded by the grindstone T. During the grinding, coolant is discharged through the opening in the concave surface T<sub>1b </sub>so that the coolant spreads all over the portion on which the grinding by the concave surface T<sub>1b </sub>is acting. Therefore, the cooling effect and the clogging prevention effect are sufficiently obtained. Note that, since, as described above, the tool spindle unit <b>25</b> is arranged with the axis of the tool spindle <b>27</b> tilted to the right with respect to the X-axis, the grindstone T is able to come into contact only with the spherical portion Wa when coming into contact with the spherical portion Wa and is prevented from interfering with the detector <b>39</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the foregoing step S<b>4</b>, on the other hand, where it is verified that the machining is the second time or more after replacement for the grindstone T, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> drives the X-axis drive motor <b>11</b> and the Z-axis drive motor <b>8</b> to move the grindstone T at the rapid feed rate to the revised approach position (step S<b>10</b>), and then drives the X-axis drive motor <b>11</b> and the Z-axis drive motor <b>8</b> to move the grindstone T at the grinding feed rate along the axis of the tool spindle <b>27</b> through combined operation of the X-axis movement mechanism <b>9</b> and Z-axis movement mechanism <b>6</b> (step S<b>11</b>). Thereby, the concave surface T<sub>1b </sub>of the grindstone T is brought into contact with the spherical portion Wa and the spherical portion Wa is grinded in the same manner as described above. During the grinding, coolant is discharged through the opening in the concave surface T<sub>1b </sub>so that the coolant spreads all over the portion on which the grinding by the concave surface T<sub>1b </sub>is acting. Therefore, the cooling effect and the clogging prevention effect are sufficiently obtained.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">After the grinding is started in the step S<b>7</b> or in the step S<b>11</b>, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> monitors whether the grinding completion signal is output from the detector <b>39</b> (step S<b>12</b>). Upon receipt of the grinding completion signal, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> stops the grinding feed of the grindstone T (step S<b>13</b>), and updates the counter n (step S<b>14</b>) and stores the then position of the grindstone T into the information storage <b>53</b> (step S<b>15</b>). Thereafter, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> drives the X-axis drive motor <b>11</b> and the Z-axis drive motor <b>8</b> to return the grindstone T at the rapid feed rate to its home position and drives the air cylinder <b>38</b> to retract the detector <b>39</b> to its home position (step S<b>16</b>).</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Subsequently, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> stops the workpiece spindle motor <b>20</b> and the tool spindle motor <b>28</b> and stops the supply of coolant from the coolant supply <b>42</b> (step S<b>17</b>). Thereafter, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> compares the position of the grindstone T at the time of grinding completion (grinding completion position) detected in the step S<b>15</b> with the grinding completion position detected in the first-time machining to calculate an amount of variation between them. On the basis of whether the calculated amount of variation exceeds a predetermined amount, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> makes a judgment on the life of the grindstone T (step S<b>18</b>). This amount of variation is equivalent to an amount of wear of the grindstone T. When the amount of variation, i.e., the amount of wear exceeds a predetermined limit amount, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> judges that the grindstone T has reached the end of its life, and notifies the outside of the need to replace the grindstone T (step S<b>20</b>).</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the amount of variation does not exceed the predetermined amount, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> judges whether the counter n, that is to say, the number of times of grinding using the grindstone T has reached a preset limit number of times m (step S<b>19</b>). When it has reached the limit number of times, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> notifies the outside of the need to replace the grindstone T (step S<b>20</b>). As described above, when the amount of wear of the grindstone T exceeds the predetermined amount, the grindstone T can be judged to have reached the end of its life and the grindstone T therefore needs to be replaced. However, the amount of wear is not the only criterion for replacement of the grindstone T. When the number of times of grinding has reached the preset limit number of times m, the surface accuracy of the machined surface cannot satisfy a predetermined level. Therefore, the number of times of grinding also can be used as a criterion for replacement of the grindstone T. In this embodiment, the grindstone T is to be replaced when either the amount of wear of the grindstone T or the number of times of grinding for the grindstone T exceeds its reference value, which enables more appropriate replacement of the grindstone T and consequently enables the accuracy in machining the workpieces W to be suitably maintained.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The grinding control unit <b>52</b> repeats the above-described steps S<b>1</b> through S<b>20</b> until receiving a machining finish signal from the continuous machining control unit <b>51</b>. Upon receipt of the machining finish signal, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> finishes the process (step S<b>21</b>).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the machine tool according to this embodiment having the above-described configuration, the spherical portion Wa of the workpiece W is grinded in the manner described below under control by the controller <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">That is to say, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> starts the process upon receipt of the continuous machining start command from the continuous machining control unit <b>51</b>. Thereafter, upon receipt of the machining start command from the continuous machining control unit <b>51</b>, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> drives the workpiece spindle motor <b>20</b> to rotate the workpiece W, drives the tool spindle motor <b>28</b> to rotate the grindstone T, and starts supply of coolant from the coolant supply <b>42</b> (step S<b>2</b>). Further, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> drives the air cylinder <b>38</b> to advance the detector <b>39</b> toward the workpiece W by and bring the pair of styluses <b>39</b><i>a </i>into contact with the spherical portion Wa (step S<b>3</b>).</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Subsequently, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> verifies whether the machining is the first time after replacement for the grindstone T (step S<b>4</b>). When it is the first time, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> moves the grindstone T at the rapid feed rate to the provisional approach position (step S<b>6</b>), and then moves the grindstone T at the grinding feed rate along the axis of the tool spindle <b>27</b> (step S<b>7</b>). On the other hand, when the machining is the second time or more, the grinding control unit <b>52</b> moves the grindstone T at the rapid feed rate to the revised approach position (step S<b>10</b>), and then moves the grindstone T at the grinding feed rate along the axis of the tool spindle <b>27</b> (step S<b>7</b>).</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">When using a new grindstone T, the position of the concave surface T<sub>1b </sub>of the grindstone T is not accurately recognized. Therefore, in the first-time machining, the grindstone T is moved at the rapid feed rate to a safe position (provisional approach position) which is sufficiently spaced away such that the grindstone T cannot come into contact with the spherical portion Wa of the workpiece W, which ensures that the grindstone T is prevented from colliding with the workpiece W.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The provisional approach position is thereafter revised on the basis of the contact position between the grindstone T and the workpiece W detected in the first-time machining. Thereafter, in and after the second-time machining, the grindstone T is moved at the rapid feed rate to and positioned at the revised approach position. The revised approach position is a position which is shifted as much as possible to the spherical portion Wa side from the provisional approach position and at which the grindstone T cannot come into contact with the spherical portion Wa. Therefore, in and after the second-time machining, positioning the grindstone T at the revised approach position enables the grinding to be performed efficiently in a shorter machining time.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">After the grindstone T is moved at the rapid feed rate to and positioned at the approach position in the above-described manner, the grindstone T is moved at the grinding feed rate along the axis of the tool spindle <b>27</b>. Thereby, the spherical portion Wa of the workpiece W is brought into contact with the concave surface T<sub>1b </sub>as the grinding acting surface of the grindstone T and the spherical portion Wa is grinded. During the grinding, coolant is discharged through the opening formed in the concave surface T<sub>1b </sub>so that the coolant spreads all over the portion on which the grinding by the concave surface T<sub>1b </sub>is acting. Therefore, the cooling effect and the clogging prevention effect are sufficiently obtained so that preferable grinding is carried out.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Once the detector <b>39</b> detects the spherical portion Wa reaching a predetermined dimension (step S<b>12</b>), the grinding is finished (steps S<b>13</b> through S<b>17</b>) and a judgment is made on the life of the grindstone T (step S<b>18</b>). When the grindstone T has reached the end of its life or when the number of times of grinding using the grindstone T has reached the limit number of times m (step S<b>19</b>), a notification of the need to replace the grindstone T is made to the outside (Step S<b>20</b>). Thus, since a notification is made to the outside when the grindstone T needs to be replaced, it is possible to replace the grindstone T at an appropriate time, and consequently the accuracy in machining the workpieces W is suitably maintained.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Further, as described above, the machine tool <b>1</b> according to this embodiment is configured by combining the typical general-purpose NC machine tool components, namely, the bed <b>2</b>, the guide board <b>3</b>, the workpiece spindle unit <b>15</b>, the carriage <b>4</b>, the table <b>5</b>, the Z-axis movement mechanism <b>6</b>, and the X-axis movement mechanism <b>9</b> with the tool spindle unit <b>25</b>, the detection unit <b>35</b>, and the coolant supply mechanism <b>40</b> and providing the grinding control unit <b>52</b> in the controller <b>50</b>. Therefore, this machine tool <b>1</b> can be produced at a low cost; consequently, even when the product to be machined (workpiece W) is small in production quantity, the equipment cost to order volume can be suppressed and the product can therefore be manufactured at an appropriate cost.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">Hereinbefore, a specific embodiment of the present invention has been described.
