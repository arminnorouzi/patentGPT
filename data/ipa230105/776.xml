The granulation method is divided into wet granulation and dry granulation depending on the presence or absence of a solvent. When granulating an active ingredient which is unstable in water, a dry granulation method which does not use a solvent is selected. Among the dry granulation methods, a melt granulation method in which an additive agent is melted by heat and used as a binder is known. For example, Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 2017-1999, Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 2015-199721, Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 2015-71542, Japanese laid-open patent publication No. H6-256169 and Chem. Pharm. Bull. 65, 726-731 (2017) describe nuclear particles in which a layer containing an active ingredient is arranged on the surface of the nuclear material by using the melt granulation method.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">On the other hand, since the melt granulation method is greatly affected by the physical properties of the melt component, it is difficult to control the particle size of the granulated product. In addition, since the melt granulation method uses a melt component instead of a solvent, it is difficult to increase the content of the active ingredient in the granulated product, and as a result, the problems that the formulation inevitably becomes large and the medication adherence decreases arise.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">One of the problems of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide granules having a high content of an active ingredient and a high uniformity of particle size by using a melt granulation method.

In the drawings referred to in the present embodiment and the examples described later, the same parts or parts having the same functions are designated by the same reference numerals, and the repeated description thereof will be omitted.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram (cross-sectional view) showing a granule <b>10</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. The granule <b>10</b> contains a nuclear material <b>11</b>, a melt component layer <b>13</b> arranged on the surface of the nuclear material <b>11</b>, and an active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b> arranged on the surface of the melt component layer <b>13</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The nuclear material <b>11</b> is a carrier for arranging the melt component layer <b>13</b> and the active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b>, and a substance which serves as a core for arranging the melt component layer <b>13</b> and the active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b> when producing the granules <b>10</b>. An adsorbent is used as the nuclear material <b>11</b> in order to obtain adhesion to the melt component layer <b>13</b>. For examples, Amberlite IRP-64, ion exchange resin, kaolin, carmellose calcium, hydrated silicon dioxide, magnesium silicate, light anhydrous silicic acid, light liquid paraffin, silica soil, synthetic aluminum silicate, aluminum oxide, aluminum hydroxide, absorbent cotton, magnesium carbonate, precipitated calcium carbonate, dextrin, silicon dioxide, compound aluminum potassium silicate granules, bentonite, polyethylene fiber, magnesium aluminometasilicate, an adsorbent composed of medicated charcoal and the like can be use as the nuclear material <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The nuclear material <b>11</b> is preferably spherical in order to uniformly arrange the melt component layer <b>13</b> and the active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b>. Further, from the viewpoint of adhering the active ingredient, the particle size of the nuclear material <b>11</b> needs to be larger than the particle size of the active ingredient. The particle size of the nuclear material <b>11</b> is, for example, twice or more the particle size of the active ingredient, but is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The melt component layer <b>13</b> is a layer arranged between the nuclear material <b>11</b> and the active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b>. The melt component layer <b>13</b> is a base layer for arranging the active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b>. In the above-mentioned patent document, a melt component and an active ingredient are directly arranged on a nuclear material, but when the active ingredient itself has weak adhesion to the nuclear material or the nuclear material has a low ability to support the active ingredient, it was inevitably necessary to add a large amount of melt component to the active ingredient, and it was not possible to obtain granules containing the active ingredient in a high content. On the other hand, in the present invention, by arranging the melt component layer <b>13</b> on the surface of the nuclear material <b>11</b> in the granule <b>10</b>, more active ingredient can be attached to the melt component layer <b>13</b>, and the content of the active ingredient in the granule <b>10</b> can be effectively increased.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As described above, the melt component (first melt component) constituting the melt component layer <b>13</b> is selected from oil-based additive agents. Since the melt component layer <b>13</b> is formed by a melt granulation method, the first melt component is selected from additive agents which are solid at room temperature. Considering the temperature range generally used in the melt granulation method, the first melt component is preferably selected from additive agents having a melting point of 100&#xb0; C. or lower, and preferably selected from additive agents which have a melting point in a temperature range in which denaturation of the active ingredient and significant increase of the related substances is not recognized. Examples of additive agents having such properties include, but are not limited to, glycerin monostearate, macrogol (polyethylene glycol), lauromacrogol, stearic acid, and the like. In addition, the first melt component is preferably selected from additive agents which do not denature the active ingredient and show a significant increase in related substances due to contact with the active ingredient.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The melt component layer <b>13</b> may be arranged on the surface of the nuclear material <b>11</b> in an amount in which the active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b> can be arranged, and may be arranged on at least a part of the surface of the nuclear material <b>11</b>. The melt component layer <b>13</b> preferably covers 90% or more of the surface of the nuclear material <b>11</b>, and more preferably covers the entire surface of the nuclear material <b>11</b>. The thickness of the melt component layer <b>13</b> is not particularly limited, but it is preferable that the thickness of the melt component layer <b>13</b> is as thin as possible from the viewpoint of increasing the active ingredient content per granule <b>10</b>. In one embodiment, it is preferable that the first melt component constituting the melt component layer <b>13</b> is also arranged in pores of the surface of the nuclear material <b>11</b>. In one embodiment, the interface between the nuclear material <b>11</b> and the melt component layer <b>13</b> may have a structure in which the melt component constituting the melt component layer <b>13</b> enters from the surface of the nuclear material <b>11</b>. In this case, the nuclear material <b>11</b> and the melt component layer <b>13</b> do not have to have a clear interface. By arranging the melt component not only on the surface of the nuclear material <b>11</b> but also in the pores connected to the surface of the nuclear material <b>11</b>, the melt component layer <b>13</b> is imparted with an anchor effect on the nuclear material <b>11</b> and the adhesion of the melt component layer <b>13</b> on the nuclear material <b>11</b> is improved.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The active ingredient-containing layer is a layer containing the active ingredient and a second melt component or polymer, and is arranged on a surface of the melt component layer <b>13</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows granules <b>10</b> in which the active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b> contains the active ingredient and a second melt component. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows granules <b>20</b> in which the active ingredient-containing layer <b>25</b> contains the active ingredient and a polymer having compatibility with the first melt component. In the granules <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, the active ingredient is not particularly limited. In methods for producing the granules <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, since a solvent, particularly water, is not used, a water-unstable active ingredient can be preferably used.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b>, the second melt component is an additive agent for binding the active ingredients to each other and binding the active ingredient to the surface of the melt component layer <b>13</b>. Since the active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b> is formed by the melt granulation method, the second melt component is selected from additive agents which are solid at room temperature. Considering the temperature range generally used in the melt granulation method, the second melt component is preferably selected from additive agents having a melting point of 100&#xb0; C. or lower, and preferably selected from additive agents which have a melting point in a temperature range in which denaturation of the active ingredient and significant increase of the related substances is not recognized. In the case where an additive agent having a melting point lower than a melting point of the first melt component is selected as the second melt component, when the active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b> is formed by the melt granulation method, the active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b> can be arranged on the surface of the melt component layer <b>13</b> without significantly affecting the surface structure of the melt component layer <b>13</b> or changing the surface structure of the melt component layer <b>13</b>. On the other hand, In the case where an additive agent having a melting point higher than a melting point of the first melt component is selected as the second melt component, when the active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b> is formed by the melt granulation method, the surface of the melt component layer <b>13</b> is slightly melted, and the interface between the melt component layer <b>13</b> and the active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b> is fused, so that the adhesion of the active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b> to the melt component layer <b>13</b> can be improved.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Examples of the additive agents used as the second melt component include stearic acid, glycerin monostearate, macrogol (polyethylene glycol), carnauba wax, hardened oil, lauromacrogol, palmitic acid, cetyl alcohol and the like, but are not limited thereto. The second melt component is preferably selected from additive agents which do not denature the active ingredient and show a significant increase in related substances due to contact with the active ingredient. From the viewpoint of adhering to the nuclear material <b>11</b>, the particle size of the melt component needs to be smaller than the particle size of the nuclear material <b>11</b>. Further, the melt component (second melt component) contained in the active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b> may be the same additive agents as the melt component (first melt component) contained in the melt component layer <b>13</b>, or may be different.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, in the granule <b>20</b>, a polymer having compatibility with the first melt component can be used instead of the second melt component. The expression that the polymer is &#x201c;compatible&#x201d; with respect to the first melt component means that the first melt component and the polymer are not separated from each other. Alternatively, it indicates a state in which the polymer is dispersed in the first melt component, or a state in which the first melt component is dispersed in the polymer. In one embodiment, the state in which the melt component and the polymer are not separated can be confirmed by an increase in the viscosity of the mixture (liquid or semi-solid having fluidity) when the melt component and the polymer are mixed and the melt component is melted. By using a polymer having compatibility with the first melt component, the viscosity of the surface of the melt component layer <b>13</b> is further improved as compared with the case of using the second melt component, and the active ingredient-containing layer <b>25</b> can be adhered more stably. As a combination of a polymer having compatibility with the first melt component, when the first melt component is stearic acid or lauromacrogol, the polymer is an aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer, an ammonioalkyl methacrylate copolymer, a methacrylic acid copolymer, a hypromellose acetate succinate or a polyvinylpyrrolidone can be preferably combined. More preferably, when the first melt component is stearic acid, an aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer, an ammonioalkyl methacrylate copolymer or a polyvinylpyrrolidone can be combined as the polymer. Alternatively, when the first melt component is lauromacrogol, an aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer, an ammonioalkyl methacrylate copolymer, a methacrylic acid copolymer or a hypromellose acetate succinate can be preferably combined.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">When a polymer having compatibility with the first melt component is used instead of the second melt component, the content of the first melt component in the granules <b>20</b> is preferably equal to or higher than the content of the polymer. For example, in the granule <b>20</b>, the blending ratio of the first melt component and the polymer is preferably 20:1 to 1:1 and more preferably 4:1 to 1:1.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b> and the active ingredient-containing layer <b>25</b> contain the active ingredient as a main component. The active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b> and the active ingredient-containing layer <b>25</b> preferably contains 50% by mass or more of the active ingredient with respect to the total mass of the active ingredient and the second melt component or polymer. In other words, in the active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b> and the active ingredient-containing layer <b>25</b>, it is preferable to contain a small amount of the second melt component or polymer on the surface of the melt component layer <b>13</b> in the extent which the active ingredient-containing layer <b>15</b> or the active ingredient-containing layer <b>25</b> can be formed. Thereby, the content of the active ingredient in the granules <b>10</b> and <b>20</b> can be effectively increased.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">[Method for Producing Granules <b>10</b>]</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow diagram illustrating a method for producing granules containing nuclear particles according to one embodiment of the present invention.
