In the liquid crystal display device, the arrangement of the liquid crystals is changed by applying a voltage to the liquid crystals. The light emitted from the light source is transmitted or shielded due to the difference in the arrangement of the liquid crystals. That is, in the liquid crystal display device, the liquid crystals are used as a switch to control the transmission or non-transmission of the light emitted from the light source.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A light emitting diode (LED) can be used for the light source of the liquid crystal display device. For example, a light source (also referred to as a backlight) in which a plurality of red LED chips, green LED chips, and blue LED chips are arranged in a matrix to obtain white light can be used as a light source of a liquid crystal display device.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the LED chip may be damaged by electrostatic discharge due to the application of a voltage in the opposite direction. Therefore, in order to prevent electrostatic discharge damage of the LED chip, a configuration in which a protection diode is connected in parallel to the LED chip is known (see, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2008-227423).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, focusing on a light emitting element included in the display device, in recent years, a micro LED display device in which a minute LED chip is arranged in each of a plurality of pixels has been developed. The micro LED display device is a self-luminous display device different from the liquid crystal display device, and has excellent visibility. In addition, the LED chip has high emission efficiency and a long life time. Therefore, the micro LED display device is expected to replace the organic EL display device as a next-generation display.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">A display device includes a plurality of first pixels and a plurality of second pixels.
