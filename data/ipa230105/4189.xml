In order to increase the amount of deformability of a flexible display device, a flexible substrate is usually provided with a set of openings and it is divided into island regions where pixels are located and bridge regions where connecting lines are located, so that the display device has property of stretchability and deformability.

Compared with the pixel design of the non-stretchable display region, pixels in the stretchable display region are designed as an extension of pixels in the non-stretchable display region since there is a difference in deformation amounts of the stretchable display region and the non-stretchable display region. For example, it may be formed by removing a part of the pixels on the basis of the pixel design of the non-stretchable display region.

The pixels are arranged on the island regions, and signal wires are arranged on the bridge regions, and when an external force is applied, the deformation mainly occurs in the bridge regions, and the pixels in the island regions basically maintain their shapes. For the flexible display device, a display screen includes a non-stretchable display region and a stretchable display region. Compared with the pixel design of the non-stretchable display region, pixels in the stretchable display region may be formed by removing a part of the pixels on the basis of the pixel design of the non-stretchable display region. For example, after the pixels at the corresponding openings are removed in the pixel arrangement of the non-stretchable display region, the pixel arrangement of the stretchable display region is formed. That is, when the stretchable display region is not subjected to stretching deformation, the pixel distribution thereof is uniform and consistent with the pixel distribution of the non-stretchable display region, and the display brightness is uniform; however, when stretching deformation occurs, uniformity of the pixel distribution is broken and the pixel density of the stretchable display region decreases, which results in a decrease in the brightness of the stretchable display region, thereby causing the luminous brightness of the entire stretchable display region to differ from the luminous brightness of the non-stretchable display region in the display panel. As a result, the display quality is adversely affected.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0043">In view of the above-mentioned technical problem, embodiments of the present disclosure provide a display substrate, a manufacturing method thereof, and a display device, which can improve the phenomenon of luminance difference between the stretchable display region and the non-stretchable display region in the related technologies.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, the display substrate provided by the embodiments of the present disclosure includes:</p><p id="p-0047" num="0045">a non-stretchable display region <b>100</b> and a stretchable display region <b>200</b>.

In this way, the decrease in pixel density of the stretchable display region <b>200</b> caused due to stretching deformation is pre-compensated, so as to alleviate the problem of non-uniform display effect and difference in brightness that are caused by the difference in pixel density, improve the uniformity of display brightness and improve the product quality.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0048">In some optional embodiments, the pixel density difference between the stretchable display region <b>200</b> and the non-stretchable display region <b>100</b> after stretching of the stretchable display region <b>200</b> is reduced, by predicting the stretching deformation amount of the stretchable display region <b>200</b> in advance and compensating the pixel pitch design of the stretchable display region <b>200</b> with the stretching deformation amount to achieve the desired pixel arrangement after stretching deformation. The display substrate provided by the embodiments of the present disclosure is optionally described below.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0049">In some optional embodiments, in a stretching direction F, the stretchable display region <b>200</b> includes multiple bridge regions <b>220</b>, the bridge region <b>220</b> has a stretching deformation amount &#x394;P in the stretching direction F, and the first pitch P<sub>1 </sub>is: P<sub>1</sub>=P<sub>0</sub>&#x2212;&#x394;P.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0050">In the above-mentioned solution, for the stretchable display region <b>200</b>, the stretching deformation amount &#x394;P of the bridge region <b>220</b> is the stretching deformation amount in the stretching direction F between the pixel units <b>211</b> on the two adjacent island regions <b>210</b>. After the stretching deformation amount &#x394;P is determined, the stretching deformation in the stretching direction F between the pixel units <b>211</b> on the two adjacent island regions <b>210</b> may be pre-compensated according to the stretching deformation amount &#x394;P, and the difference between the reference pitch P<b>0</b> and the stretching deformation amount &#x394;P is the first pitch P<b>1</b>. An example is as follows.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0051">Taking <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> as an example, the pixels of the stretchable display region <b>200</b> are arranged in the island regions <b>210</b>, the multiple island regions <b>210</b> are arranged in a uniform array, and bridge regions <b>220</b> are arranged at gaps in the array of island regions <b>210</b>. Taking the four bridge regions <b>220</b> of A, B, C and D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> as an example, when a certain stretching deformation amount needs to be reached (for example, the stretching deformation amount &#x394;P reaches 3% or more), the area of the island region <b>210</b> and the bridge region <b>220</b> between the island regions <b>210</b> are deformed to a certain extent, and the deformation mainly occurs at the joint between the island regions <b>210</b>, namely, the deformation mainly occurs at the bridge region <b>220</b>. Thus, the pixel arrangement of the stretchable display region <b>200</b> is optimized to reduce the pixel pitch between island regions <b>210</b>, i.e., the pitch between adjacent pixel units <b>211</b>.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0052">In general, the deformation amount of the stretchable display region of the stretchable screen is small, and in the scheme of the present disclosure, only positions of the pixel units of the overall stretchable display region relative to the normal non-stretchable display region may be changed.
