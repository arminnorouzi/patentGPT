to metal laminates with senses of tactile warmth and elasticity and, more particularly, to a metal architectured plate with senses of tactile warmth and elasticity, which is manufactured by performing architecturing on a metal material to have a structure that gives human-friendly senses of tactile warmth and elasticity by reproducing the microstructure and textural characteristics of natural matters (e.g., wood).</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In general, advanced materials refer to materials that compensate for defects of existing materials and improve advantages of those materials with manufacturing technologies or processing technologies developed based on existing materials or new materials or that have new characteristics that have not existed up to now.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, research for developing such advanced materials has been actively conducting. Among others, a study of metal materials that are used in various ways as the surface materials of not only the exterior materials of IT&#x2022;electronic products or the interior/exterior materials of motor vehicles but also the interior/exterior materials for construction&#x2022;interior construction has been actively conducting.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such metal materials have an advantage of providing products with an elegant aesthetic sense or a sense of luster and having high durability. However, metal materials of the prior art have a disadvantage that they are heavy in comparison to aluminum, plastic, and fiber glass reinforce plastic (FRP) due to their high specific weight and they give a cold sense of touch without giving a sense of stability to people like foam, cork, rubber, wood, or leather.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to solve the problems as described above, a study of developing advanced metal materials realizing sensitivity that gives a sense of stability to people has been actively conducting recently.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, metal materials realizing such sensitivity in the prior art are limited to products showing a visual effect related to colors, so developing a metal material that can realize senses of touch such as senses of tactile warmth and elasticity that give a sense of stability to people is insufficient.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To this end, there was a technique intended to use the advantages of ductility and rigidity of metals for fiber, etc. by applying the technique of attaching a net structure to a raw carbon fiber in close contact state to reinforce the strength of a carbon fiber in the field of carbon fiber reinforce plastic (CFRP). See, Korean registered patent No. 10-1961103. However, up till now, there is no technology that allows the metal itself to provide senses of tactile warmth and elasticity that are human-friendly senses of touch.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, there were several attempts to provide a sense of touch by forming a pore structure in a metal material. However, the techniques of the prior art have problems in that such metal materials have low durability, limitative use, and difficulty in mass production because their physical properties are not uniform due to non-uniform pore structure and structural problems.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, it is increasingly required to develop a metal architectured plate with senses of tactile warmth and elasticity and an architecturing method that can improve a structure to have ductility and strength, which are advantages of metal, and have senses of tactile warmth and elasticity that are human-friendly senses of touch.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">An objective of the present disclosure is to provide a metal architectured plate with senses of tactile warmth and elasticity, the metal architectured plate being able to solve the problem that metal materials of the prior art cannot provide senses of touch such as senses of tactile warmth and elasticity which give a sense of stability to people even though they have several advantages such as high ductility and strength, an excellent energy absorption ratio, etc., and being able to realize non-cold metal and a soft sense of touch depending on necessities of consumer, and a method of manufacturing the metal architectured plate.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another objective of the present disclosure is to provide a metal architectured plate with senses of tactile warmth and elasticity, the metal
