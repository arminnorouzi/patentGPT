No. 16/660,980, filed Oct. 23, 2019, which claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/754,039, filed Nov. 1, 2018, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Different types of manually driven and autonomous vehicles employ sensors in order to observe the surrounding environment. Depending on the type of sensor, it may either be fixed to view a specific region external to the vehicle, or the sensor may be adjustable, e.g., rotatable to provide a partially panoramic or a full 360&#xb0; view. However, rotating the sensor or a component of the sensor assembly at high speeds can create drag and other affects that may impact sensor performance or longevity.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The technology relates to rotating sensor units, such as Lidar and other sensors, which may be employed with vehicles configured to drive in autonomous and/or manual driving modes, fixed location sensors, and other equipment. A mirror assembly of the sensor unit is configured to rotate at high speed around a central axis. For instance, the speed may exceed hundreds or thousands of revolutions per minute (RPM). Alternatively, the mirror assembly may rotate with tip velocities exceeding 10-30 meters/second.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to minimize drag and other issues created by such high rotation speeds, aspects of the technology employ mirror assemblies with rounded, filleted, beveled, chamfered or otherwise truncated corners. For instance, a rotary sensor apparatus may comprise a mirror assembly having multiple reflective surfaces arranged in a geometric shape. The geometric shape includes an axis perpendicular to the reflective surfaces. The mirror assembly is configured to rotate in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction about the axis. A laser light source is configured to emit light so that the emitted light is reflected off of one or more of the reflective surfaces and is directed to one or more locations in an environment external to the rotary sensor apparatus. A control system is operatively coupled to the mirror assembly and the laser light source. The control system is configured to set a rate of rotation of the mirror assembly about the axis and to control emission of the light from the laser light source, so that the rotating sensor apparatus can detect objects in the external environment. Detection of such objects can be used, e.g., by a vehicle operating in an autonomous mode to drive around or otherwise avoid the detected objects based on the received sensor data. The reflective surfaces of the mirror assembly are coupled to one another along a set of edges. Normally, the edges would be subject to issues arising from rotating the mirror assembly at a high rate of rotation. However, the set of edges may rounded with a selected radius of curvature of at least 0.1 mm, or may be otherwise truncated, which reduces localized maximums of airflow behind the edges and correspondingly the dynamic pressure adjacent to the edges. Torque is also beneficially reduced, thereby improving sensor assembly performance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one example, each truncated edge is rounded with a selected radius of curvature of at least 0.1 mm. For instance, the radius of curvature may be between 0.1 mm and 1.0 mm. Alternatively, the radius of curvature may be no more than 2.0 mm.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another example, the mirror assembly comprises three reflective surfaces and the geometric shape is triangular. In this case, the geometric shape may be an equilateral triangle.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a further example, the rotary sensor apparatus further includes a spindle extending along the axis and one or more actuators coupled to the spindle. Here, the control system is configured to activate the one or more actuators to cause the spindle to rotate the mirror assembly about the axis.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In yet another example, the rotary sensor apparatus further includes at least one light baffle affixed to an end of the mirror assembly. The at least one light baffle provides optical isolation between transmit and receive areas of the rotary sensor apparatus. For instance, the at least one baffle may extend at least 10% past the edges of the mirror assembly. The at least one light baffle may comprise a pair of light baffles. Here, a first one of the light baffles is arranged along a first end of the mirror assembly and a second one of the light baffles is arranged along a second end of the mirror assembly. The at least one light baffle may be circular.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another example, the rotary sensor apparatus further includes at least one acoustic baffle affixed to an end of the mirror assembly. In this case, the at least one acoustic baffle may comprise a pair of acoustic baffles. A first one of the acoustic baffles is arranged along a first end of the mirror assembly and a second one of the acoustic baffles is arranged along a second end of the mirror assembly.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet a further example, the rotary sensor apparatus further includes at least one aerodynamic baffle affixed to an end of the mirror assembly. The at least one aerodynamic baffle is configured to reduce aerodynamic drag as the mirror assembly rotates. In this case, the at least one aerodynamic baffle may comprise a pair of aerodynamic baffles, in which a first one of the aerodynamic baffles is arranged along a first end of the mirror assembly and a second one of the aerodynamic baffles is arranged along a second end of the mirror assembly.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The rotary sensor apparatus may also further include a receiver operatively coupled to the control system. The receiver is configured to receive reflected light from the external environment, where the reflected light is evaluated in order to detect objects in the external environment.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another aspect of the technology, a vehicle comprises a driving system and a perception system operatively coupled to the driving system. The driving system is configured to perform acceleration, deceleration and steering operations for the vehicle. And the perception system comprises one or more rotary sensor apparatuses as described above.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one example, the one or more rotary sensor apparatuses are arranged along one or more of a front end of the vehicle, a rear end of the vehicle, a left side of the vehicle, a right side of the vehicle, and a roof of the vehicle.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another example, the vehicle further includes one or more computing devices operatively coupled to the driving system and the perception system. For instance, the one or more computing devices may comprise an autonomous driving computing system configured to operate the vehicle in an autonomous driving mode in response to sensor data received from the perception system.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example vehicle that can operate in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a functional diagram of the example vehicle of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates examples of sensor fields of view.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary sensor unit in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a system diagram of the exemplary sensor unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-B</figref> illustrate examples of velocity drag and dynamic pressure in a high-speed rotating mirror assembly.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-B</figref> illustrate a rounded mirror assembly in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-C</figref> illustrate truncated mirror assemblies in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-B</figref> illustrate examples of velocity drag and dynamic pressure in a high-speed rotating mirror assembly in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-C</figref> illustrate several mirror assembly examples in view of aspects of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-F</figref> illustrate examples of mirror assemblies with baffles in accordance with aspects of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><heading id="h-0006" level="2">Overview</heading><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In order to detect objects in a given environment, a sensor assembly may employ a sensor assembly with a reflective mirror component.

For instance, the vehicle may have one or more computing devices, such as computing devices <b>202</b> containing one or more processors <b>204</b>, memory <b>206</b> and other components typically present in general purpose computing devices.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The memory <b>206</b> stores information accessible by the one or more processors <b>204</b>, including instructions <b>208</b> and data <b>210</b> that may be executed or otherwise used by the processor(s) <b>204</b>. The memory <b>206</b> may be of any type capable of storing information accessible by the processor, including a computing device-readable medium, or other medium that stores data that may be read with the aid of an electronic device, such as a hard-drive, memory card, ROM, RAM, DVD or other optical disks, as well as other write-capable and read-only memories. Systems and methods may include different combinations of the foregoing, whereby different portions of the instructions and data are stored on different types of media.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The instructions <b>208</b> may be any set of instructions to be executed directly (such as machine code) or indirectly (such as scripts) by the processor. For example, the instructions may be stored as computing device code on the computing device-readable medium. In that regard, the terms &#x201c;instructions&#x201d; and &#x201c;programs&#x201d; may be used interchangeably herein. The instructions may be stored in object code format for direct processing by the processor, or in any other computing device language including scripts or collections of independent source code modules that are interpreted on demand or compiled in advance. Functions, methods and routines of the instructions are explained in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The data <b>210</b> may be retrieved, stored or modified by a given processor <b>204</b> in accordance with the instructions <b>208</b>. For instance, although the claimed subject matter is not limited by any particular data structure, the data may be stored in computing device registers, in a relational database as a table having a plurality of different fields and records, XML documents or flat files. The data may also be formatted in any computing device-readable format.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The one or more processor <b>204</b> may be any conventional processors, such as commercially available CPUs. Alternatively, the one or more processors may be a dedicated device such as an ASIC or other hardware-based processor. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> functionally illustrates the processor(s), memory, and other elements of computing device(s) <b>202</b> as being within the same block, it will be understood that the processor, computing device, or memory may actually include multiple processors, computing devices, or memories that may or may not be stored within the same physical housing. For example, memory may be a hard drive or other storage media located in a housing different from that of computing devices <b>202</b>. Accordingly, references to a processor or computing device will be understood to include references to a collection of processors or computing devices or memories that may or may not operate in parallel, or which may have a distributed architecture.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one example, computing devices <b>202</b> may be control computing devices of an autonomous driving computing system or otherwise be incorporated into vehicle <b>100</b>. The autonomous driving computing system may be capable of communicating with various components of the vehicle in order to control the movement of vehicle <b>100</b> according to primary vehicle control code of memory <b>206</b>. For example, computing devices <b>202</b> may be in communication with various systems of vehicle <b>100</b>, such as a driving system including a deceleration system <b>212</b>, acceleration system <b>214</b>, and steering system <b>216</b>, as well as a signaling system <b>218</b>, navigation system <b>220</b>, positioning system <b>222</b>, perception system <b>224</b>, power system <b>226</b> (e.g., the vehicle's engine or motor), transmission system <b>230</b> and suspension system <b>234</b> in order to control the movement, speed, etc. of vehicle <b>100</b> in accordance with the instructions <b>208</b> of memory <b>206</b>. The wheels/tires <b>228</b> may be controlled directly by the computing devices <b>202</b> or indirectly via these other systems. Again, although these systems are shown as external to computing devices <b>202</b>, in actuality, these systems may also be incorporated into computing devices <b>202</b>, again as an autonomous driving computing system for controlling vehicle <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As an example, computing devices <b>202</b> may interact with one or more actuators of the deceleration system <b>212</b> and/or acceleration system <b>214</b>, such as brakes, accelerator pedal, and/or the engine or motor <b>226</b> of the vehicle, in order to control the speed of the vehicle. Similarly, one or more actuators of the steering system <b>216</b>, such as a steering wheel, steering shaft, and/or pinion and rack in a rack and pinion system, may be used by computing devices <b>202</b> in order to control the direction of vehicle <b>100</b>. For example, if vehicle <b>100</b> is configured for use on a road, such as a car or truck, the steering system may include one or more actuators to control the angle of wheels to turn the vehicle. Signaling system <b>218</b> may be used by computing devices <b>202</b> in order to signal the vehicle's intent to other drivers or vehicles, for example, by lighting turn signals or brake lights when needed.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Navigation system <b>220</b> may be used by computing devices <b>202</b> in order to determine and follow a route to a location. In this regard, the navigation system <b>220</b> and/or data <b>210</b> may store detailed map information, e.g., highly detailed maps identifying the shape and elevation of roadways, lane lines, intersections, crosswalks, speed limits, traffic signals, buildings, signs, real time traffic information, vegetation, or other such objects and information.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Positioning system <b>222</b> may be used by computing devices <b>202</b> in order to determine the vehicle's relative or absolute position on a map or on the earth. For example, the position system <b>222</b> may include a GPS receiver to determine the device's latitude, longitude and/or altitude position. Other location systems such as laser-based localization systems, inertial-aided GPS, or camera-based localization may also be used to identify the location of the vehicle. The location of the vehicle may include an absolute geographical location, such as latitude, longitude, and altitude as well as relative location information, such as location relative to other cars immediately around it which can often be determined with less noise than absolute geographical location.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The positioning system <b>222</b> may also include other devices in communication with computing devices <b>202</b>, such as an accelerometer, gyroscope or another direction/speed detection device to determine the direction and speed of the vehicle or changes thereto. By way of example only, an acceleration device may determine its pitch, yaw or roll (or changes thereto) relative to the direction of gravity or a plane perpendicular thereto. The device may also track increases or decreases in speed and the direction of such changes. The device's provision of location and orientation data as set forth herein may be provided automatically to the computing devices <b>202</b>, other computing devices and combinations of the foregoing.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The perception system <b>224</b> also includes one or more components for detecting objects external to the vehicle such as other vehicles, obstacles in the roadway, traffic signals, signs, trees, etc. For example, the perception system <b>224</b> may include one or more sensor assemblies <b>232</b> such as lasers (Lidar), sonar, radar, cameras and/or any other detection devices that record data which may be processed by computing devices <b>202</b>. In the case where the vehicle is a passenger vehicle such as a minivan, the minivan may include Lidar or other sensor devices mounted on the roof or other convenient location.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The computing devices <b>202</b> may control the direction and speed of the vehicle according to various operation modes which include autonomous driving by controlling various components. By way of example, computing devices <b>202</b> may navigate the vehicle to a destination location completely autonomously using data from the detailed map information and navigation system <b>220</b>. Computing devices <b>202</b> may use the positioning system <b>222</b> to determine the vehicle's location and perception system <b>224</b> to detect and respond to objects when needed to reach the location safely. In order to do so, computing devices <b>202</b> may cause the vehicle to accelerate (e.g., by increasing fuel or other energy provided to the engine by acceleration system <b>214</b>), decelerate (e.g., by decreasing the fuel supplied to the engine, changing gears, and/or by applying brakes by deceleration system <b>212</b>), change direction (e.g., by turning the front or rear wheels of vehicle <b>100</b> by steering system <b>216</b>), and signal such changes (e.g., by lighting turn signals of signaling system <b>218</b>). Thus, the acceleration system <b>214</b> and deceleration system <b>212</b> may be a part of a drivetrain that includes various components between an engine of the vehicle and the wheels <b>228</b> of the vehicle, such as transmission system <b>230</b>. Again, by controlling these systems, computing devices <b>202</b> may also control the drivetrain of the vehicle in order to maneuver the vehicle autonomously.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Suspension system <b>234</b> may be configured to provide various vehicle chassis adjustments. The adjustments can, for example, change the length of the shock absorber at every wheel, only some wheels, or even just one wheel.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Computing devices <b>202</b> may include all of the components normally used in connection with a computing device such as the processor and memory described above as well as a user interface <b>236</b> (e.g., a mouse, keyboard, touch screen and/or microphone) and various electronic displays (e.g., a monitor having a screen or any other electrical device that is operable to display information). In this regard, an internal electronic display may be located within a cabin of vehicle <b>100</b> (not shown) and may be used by computing devices <b>202</b> to provide information to passengers within the vehicle <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a communication system <b>238</b>. The communication system <b>238</b> may also include one or more wireless network connections to facilitate communication with other computing devices, such as passenger computing devices within the vehicle, and computing devices external to the vehicle, such as in another nearby vehicle on the roadway, or a remote server system. The network connections may include short range communication protocols such as Bluetooth, Bluetooth low energy (LE), cellular connections, as well as various configurations and protocols including the Internet, World Wide Web, intranets, virtual private networks, wide area networks, local networks, private networks using communication protocols proprietary to one or more companies, Ethernet, WiFi and HTTP, and various combinations of the foregoing. The perception system <b>224</b>, computing devices <b>202</b> and other systems may be directly or indirectly connected with one or more wired connection, e.g., via a Controller Area Network (CAN bus) of the vehicle.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Example Device Configurations</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In conjunction with the operations described above and illustrated in the figures, various device configurations will now be described.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a scenario in which a vehicle <b>300</b> has various sensors <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> positioned at various locations around the vehicle. As seen in the figure, during operation the sensors have respective exemplary fields of view <b>308</b>, <b>310</b> and <b>312</b> in order to detect objects in the environment around the vehicle. As shown, the vehicle is positioned on a substantially flat roadway or otherwise planar surface <b>314</b>. Each sensor's FOV may be dependent on the type of sensor (e.g., Lidar, radar, camera, sonar), its location around the vehicle (e.g., rooftop, front bumper, rear bumper, side quarter panel, undercarriage, etc.), the sensor's orientation, environmental conditions (e.g., clear and sunny, overcast, foggy, rainy, snowy, evening versus morning, etc.) and other factors.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">For instance, sensor <b>302</b> may be a Lidar sensor, wherein FOV <b>308</b> is a 360&#xb0; view around the vehicle <b>300</b>. Front sensor <b>304</b> and rear sensor <b>306</b> may also be Lidar sensors, and each provide the respective FOVs <b>310</b> and <b>312</b>, which may be, e.g., between 30&#xb0;-90&#xb0; or more. In order to achieve these FOVs, the Lidar sensor may employ a rotating mirror.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">One example of this is shown by Lidar sensor assembly <b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. As illustrated, the assembly <b>400</b> includes a housing <b>402</b> that includes a rotatable mirror unit <b>404</b>, a light emission element (e.g., a light emitting diode) <b>406</b>, and a light detector (e.g., a photodiode receiver) <b>408</b>. The light emission element <b>406</b> and the light detector <b>408</b> may be co-located and mounted on a platform <b>410</b>. While shown as offset for clarity, the light emission element <b>406</b> and the light detector <b>408</b> may both be centered at a predetermined spot of the mirror unit <b>404</b>. For instance, they may be centered at a spot perpendicular to an axis <b>412</b> of the mirror unit <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The mirror unit <b>404</b> is configured to rotate as shown by arrow <b>414</b>, in either a counterclockwise or a clockwise direction about the axis <b>412</b>. As noted above, the rate of rotation may be high, for instance on the order of 1,000 rpm to 100,000 rpm. In one example, the mirror unit <b>400</b> may rotate at a rate between 5,000-7000 rpm. In another example, the mirror unit <b>400</b> may rotate at a rate between 20,000-50,000 rpm, or more or less.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As the mirror assembly <b>404</b> rotates, light <b>416</b> emitted from the light emission element <b>406</b> is reflected off of one or more mirror surfaces and into the external environment. Light <b>418</b> may be returned off of one or more objects in the external environment, reflect off of one or more mirror surfaces and be detected by the light detector <b>408</b>. Thus, the mirror assembly <b>404</b> is configured to steer light emitted from the optics subsystem towards the viewing direction of the Lidar, and can steer reflected light from the environment towards the optics subsystem. In the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the mirror assembly <b>404</b> has 3 mirror surfaces with an equilateral triangular cross-sectional (or top-down) configuration. However, the mirror assembly <b>404</b> may have a different geometric shape and have 4, 5 or more mirror surfaces.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram of the sensor assembly <b>400</b>. As shown, the light emission element <b>406</b> and the light detector <b>408</b> are parts of an optics subsystem <b>500</b>. One or more actuators <b>502</b>, such as a motor or gear assembly, are configured to rotate the reflective surfaces of the mirror assembly about a central axis. The housing <b>402</b>, which may comprise a support structure, may include one or more of the following: at least one beam stop <b>504</b> to prevent light from being emitted along certain portions of the housing, at least one light baffle <b>506</b> to optically separate the transmit and receive sections of the optics subsystem <b>500</b>, and/or one or more acoustic/aerodynamic baffles <b>508</b>. The baffle(s) <b>508</b> is configured to reduce acoustic noise and to decrease the aerodynamic drag (and therefore torque) acting on the mirror assembly <b>404</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">At least the optics subsystem <b>500</b> and the one or more actuators <b>502</b> are operatively coupled to a control system <b>510</b>. The control system <b>510</b> includes one or more processors <b>512</b> and memory <b>514</b> configured to store instructions <b>516</b> and data <b>518</b>. The processor(s) <b>512</b> and memory <b>514</b> may be equivalent to the processors and memory described above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In one example, the control system <b>510</b> may be part of the computing device(s) <b>202</b>. In another example, the control system <b>510</b> may be part of the perception system <b>224</b>. In a further example, the control system <b>510</b> is configured separately from the computing device(s) <b>202</b> and the perception system <b>224</b>. In this case, the control system <b>510</b> may be integrated into the housing <b>402</b>, such that the sensor assembly <b>400</b> is a self-contained unit. The sensor assembly <b>400</b> is configured to receive power from an external source via power system <b>520</b>. It is also configured to communicate with other components or devices, e.g., the computing device(s) <b>202</b> and the perception system <b>224</b> or an external system, via communication system <b>522</b>. The communication system <b>522</b> may be configured in a manner similar to communication system <b>238</b>, for instance capable of communicating via a wired and/or wireless connection.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">As the mirror assembly rotates, there is a resultant air velocity which impacts different portions of the assembly differently. In a triangular assembly, the sharp edges of the triangular configuration can experience a high air velocity and corresponding high dynamic pressure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> illustrates a velocity example <b>600</b>, in which the mirror assembly is rotating in a counterclockwise direction. The small arrows indicate example directions of airflow, and the image is shaded to indicate localized wind velocities. As shown, dotted regions <b>602</b> experience the highest localized wind velocities, e.g., in excess of 20 m/s, along the trailing parts of the mirror surfaces adjacent to the edges.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> illustrates a dynamic pressure example <b>610</b>. Here, again, the mirror assembly is rotating in a counterclockwise direction. As shown, dotted regions <b>612</b> along the trailing parts of the mirror surfaces adjacent to the edges experience the highest dynamic pressure. In this example, these parts of the mirror surfaces experience dynamic pressures in on the order of 300 Pa or more.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">One result of rotating at high speeds is that it produces an aerodynamic drag, resulting in relatively poor power consumption for the sensor (e.g., Lidar) unit. In particular, the drag may account for about 10-20% of the unit's power consumption. By way of example, the power required to drive the mirror assembly is proportional to the size of the mirror assembly. In particular, it may be proportional to the length of the mirror, but with the fourth power of the diameter of the mirror, and with the third power of the angular velocity. Thus, the larger the mirror surfaces, the exponentially larger the potential drag. Another impact is that the drag and dynamic pressure differences could potentially cause uneven heating or other adverse consequences for the mirror assembly.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In order to address such issues, aspects of the technology provide rounded, filleted, beveled, chamfered or otherwise truncated corners (edges) to the mirror assembly. Such truncated edges reduce the air velocity and dynamic pressure along the corners of the triangle or other geometric shape. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-B</figref> illustrate an example mirror assembly <b>700</b> having rounded corners. By way of example, the radius of curvature for the rounded corners may be on the order of hundreds of microns (e.g., 100-900 microns) or several millimeters or more, depending on the size of the mirror assembly. For instance, each truncated edge may be rounded with a selected radius of curvature of at least 0.1 mm. Alternatively, the radius of curvature may be between 0.1 mm and 1.0 mm Still further, the radius of curvature may be no more than 2.0-5.0 mm.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-B</figref> illustrate another mirror assembly configuration, in which the corners of the geometric shape are sharply truncated rather than rounded. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, the rounding or other truncation may run the length of the reflective surfaces. However, in other examples, the truncation may extend anywhere from 25% to 95% or more of the length of the reflective surfaces. One example <b>810</b> of this is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>. Here, a first region <b>812</b> of the mirror assembly is arranged with truncated corners for use with the transmit side of the optical subsystem. A second region <b>814</b> of the mirror assembly is arranged without truncated corners for use with the receive side of the optics subsystem. Also illustrated are spindle elements <b>816</b>, which may be part of the actuators used to rotate the mirror assembly. In this example, one may place a light baffle (not shown) along the demarcation region <b>818</b> between the transmit and receive sides. This can help to optically isolate the two sections of the optics subsystem. For instance, placing the light baffle at the limit of the truncation may make it easier to attach, since the baffle can be attached on the side-wall created by the truncation.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Truncated mirror assemblies such as those described above can reduce the localized wind velocity and dynamic pressure. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> illustrates a velocity example <b>900</b>, in which the mirror assembly is rotating in a counterclockwise direction. The small arrows indicate example directions of airflow, and the image is shaded to indicate localized wind velocities. As shown, dotted regions <b>902</b> experience the highest localized wind velocities; however, such velocities are lower than those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>. Here, the dotted regions <b>902</b> may only experience velocities on the order of 16-20 m/s, along the trailing parts of the mirror surfaces adjacent to the edges. Similarly, as shown in the dynamic pressure example <b>910</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, the localized pressure may be lower than with sharp-edged corners. Here, again, the mirror assembly is rotating in a counterclockwise direction. As shown, dotted regions <b>912</b> along the trailing parts of the mirror surfaces adjacent to the edges experience the highest dynamic pressure. In this example, these parts of the mirror surfaces experience dynamic pressures on the order of 250-300 Pa.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Rounding or otherwise truncating the mirror corners can reduce the overall surface area of the mirror faces. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-C</figref> illustrate a few examples. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> illustrates a non-truncated mirror assembly. Here, the inner circle illustrates a rotational diameter of, for example, 16 cm. In this case, the side of each mirror face would have a length on the order of 13.86 cm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> illustrates one example of rounded corners, in which the rounding reduces the length of the mirror face. By way of example, the radius of curvature in this example may be on the order of 0.1 mm. Here, as shown, the side length is on the order of 10.40 cm. In contrast, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref> illustrates another example of rounded corners, in which the rounded parts are extended to the edge of the rotational diameter, thereby maximizing the size of the mirror surface. By way of example, the radius of curvature in this example may be on the order of 1.0 mm Here, the side length is on the order of 12.12 cm. A larger mirror surface results in a larger mirror assembly, which in turn can increase torque due to aerodynamic drag.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">As noted with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the housing or other support structure for the sensor unit may include one or more beam stops, light baffles and/or acoustic/aerodynamic baffles. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> illustrates one example <b>1100</b> with a pair of acoustic/aerodynamic baffles <b>1102</b>. The baffles <b>1102</b> are arranged as two discs, whose primary purpose is to reduce acoustic noise and decrease the aerodynamic drag (and therefore torque) acting on the mirror assembly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>B-F</figref> illustrate different examples in which the mirror assembly size remains constant, but the area of each baffle increases. For instance, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, the rotational diameter of the mirror assembly is, e.g., 16 cm, and the diameter of the baffles is 16 cm. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>, the baffle diameter is, e.g., 18 cm, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> it is, e.g., 20 cm. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>E</figref> the baffle diameter is, e.g., 25 cm, while in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>F</figref> the baffle diameter is, e.g., 30 cm. The increase in baffle diameter may increase torque during rotation of the mirror assembly. Thus, a tradeoff may exist between the amount of acoustical baffling desired versus the power required to address any increase in drag.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The approaches described herein have a number of benefits and advantages. For instance, rounded or otherwise truncated corners reduce wind drag on the mirror assembly. This can also reduce the need to split the transmitted beam on the corner of the mirror at the top of the field of view. Also, the sidewalls where the mirror assembly has been truncated can be a good place to attach a baffle that separates the transmit and receive sides of the optics subsystem.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">As noted above, sensor assemblies such as those described above may be employed on a vehicle, either one that is capable of operating in a self-driving mode or one with a human driver. Such sensor assemblies may also be used with non-vehicle equipment, and can be deployed at or near a building or other structure in order to detect people and other objects in the environment.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The foregoing alternative examples are not mutually exclusive, but may be implemented in various combinations to achieve unique advantages.
