The data line Data is electrically connected to the sub-pixel <b>4</b> and configured to provide a data signal to the sub-pixel <b>4</b>, and the data lines Data include a first data line Data<b>1</b> located in the first display region <b>2</b> and a second data line Data<b>2</b> located in the second display region <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The display panel also includes a shift register <b>5</b> located in the first display region <b>2</b> and electrically connected to the sub-pixels <b>4</b>, and the shift register <b>5</b> is configured to provide scanning signals or light-emitting signals to the sub-pixels <b>4</b>. The shift register <b>5</b> includes cascaded shift units <b>6</b>. The shift unit <b>6</b> is divided into at least two sub-units <b>7</b>, and one of the at least two sub-units <b>7</b> is located at a side of one of the sub-pixels <b>4</b>. For example, the display panel includes multiple pixel rows, each pixel row includes multiple sub-pixels <b>4</b> arranged in a row direction, and the shift unit <b>6</b> can be located between two adjacent pixel rows, that is, the sub-unit <b>7</b> in the shift unit <b>6</b> is located at a side of the sub-pixels <b>4</b> in a column direction, and multiple sub-units <b>7</b> in a same shift unit <b>6</b> can be aligned with each other in the row direction.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the display panel includes a connecting line <b>8</b> electrically connected to the sub-unit <b>7</b>, and in a direction perpendicular to a plane of the display panel, the connecting line <b>8</b> overlaps with the first data line Data<b>1</b> and does not overlap with the second data line Data<b>2</b>.

Because there are a large number of transistors in a single shift unit <b>6</b>, in the embodiment of the present disclosure, the shift unit <b>6</b> is divided into multiple sub-units <b>7</b> which are dispersedly arranged at a side of multiple sub-pixels <b>4</b>, thereby optimizing arrangement of the shift register <b>5</b> in the display region <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">It can be understood that when the shift unit <b>6</b> is divided into multiple sub-units <b>7</b> which are dispersedly arranged at a side of the multiple sub-pixels <b>4</b>, the connecting line <b>8</b> between the sub-units <b>7</b> or the connecting line <b>8</b> between the sub-unit <b>7</b> and other signal line overlaps with the data line Data (the first data line Data<b>1</b>) around the sub-unit <b>7</b>, thereby generating parasitic capacitance and increasing load of this first data line Data<b>1</b>. As a result, data signals transmitted on different data lines Data can have large difference in delay, resulting in charging difference between sub-pixels <b>4</b> electrically connected to different data lines Data, and thus causing vertical display non-uniformity of the display panel, that is, vertical Mura phenomenon.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, by providing the compensation structure <b>9</b> overlapping with the second data line Data<b>2</b> in the second display region <b>3</b>, a parasitic capacitance formed by overlapping between the compensation structure <b>9</b> and the second data line Data<b>2</b> can be configured to compensate parasitic capacitance formed by overlapping between the connecting line <b>8</b> and the first data line Data<b>1</b>, so that a load of the second data line Data<b>2</b> and a load of the first data line Data<b>1</b> tend to be consistent. In this way, delays of data signals transmitted on different data lines Data tend to be consistent, charging difference of sub-pixels <b>4</b> in the first display region <b>2</b> and the second display region <b>3</b> can be weakened, thus effectively improving vertical display non-uniformity of the display panel and optimizing the display performance of the display panel with ultra-narrow bezel or even borderless design.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a circuit schematic diagram of a shift unit <b>6</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a layer schematic diagram of a display panel according to an embodiment of the present disclosure; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is another layer schematic diagram of a display panel according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.
