As used herein, therefore, the terms &#x201c;aircraft loader&#x201d; and &#x201c;loader&#x201d; are directed to apparatus and systems for performing either or both of these functions. Similarly, as used herein, the term &#x201c;load lifting apparatus&#x201d; refers to an apparatus for both lifting and lowering loads.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Mobile loaders are widely used and both single platform and double platform loaders are known. In the aircraft catering industry, a loader is usually in the form a vehicle comprising a cab and two platforms. A first platform is located in an enclosed or partially enclosed container known as a &#x201c;load box&#x201d;, behind the cab of the vehicle. The box is mounted to a load lifting mechanism, typically being a hydraulically powered scissor lift mechanism secured to the vehicle's chassis, which is configured to raise and lower the box and thus the first platform. A second platform is located outside of and adjacent to the box, either on top of or at the side of the cab.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When in use in the catering industry, wheeled catering trolleys and other items are loaded onto the first platform while the box is in a lowered position and the load lifting mechanism then raises the box to the required height for loading the aircraft (e.g. to an aircraft door's sill height). The box is raised such that the first and second platforms are at the same level or, alternatively, the loader is configured such that the second platform is displaced together with the box (i.e. the two platforms are always at the same height, in use). The second platform then bridges the gap between the first platform and the aircraft's door, thereby acting as a loading bridge and allowing the items to be transported from the box and into the aircraft.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The &#x201c;box and scissor&#x201d; design referred to above has some significant drawbacks. In particular, as the entire box needs to be raised, a heavy construction base is required to raise and lower the load safely. This can make the system fairly cumbersome to deploy and expensive to manufacture and operate.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, in many applications a separate power supply and lifting mechanism are required in addition to the first platform's scissor mechanism in order to adjust the second platform to the desired height relative to the first platform and/or the aircraft.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The Inventors identified a need for a load lifting apparatus in which the platform/s to be lifted are smaller and/or lighter, allowing the apparatus to be mounted to a lighter or less strong chassis. Furthermore, the Inventors identified a need for a load lifting apparatus which allows loads to be raised and lowered more rapidly and without requiring a separate lifting mechanism and/or power source per platform, particularly when used to load narrow-body aircraft in the catering industry. Embodiments of the present invention aim to address these needs, at least to some extent.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided an aircraft loader which comprises a chassis, a cab, a loading floor and a load lifting apparatus, wherein the load lifting apparatus comprises:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">a frame which is secured to the chassis, the frame including a pair of vertical columns spaced apart behind the cab, wherein each column has a front section and a rear section, and wherein each front section is provided with a front slider and each rear section is provided with a rear slider, the front and rear sliders being configured to be displaced vertically along the columns;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">a first horizontal platform mounted behind the cab, the first platform being secured to the rear sliders and selectively displaceable through movement of the rear sliders between a loading floor height and an aircraft loading height, the first platform being driven by a cable system coupled to the rear sliders; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">a second horizontal platform mounted in front of the first platform, either on top of or at a side of the cab, the second platform secured to the front sliders and displaceable through movement of the front sliders and the first platform between an intermediate height and the aircraft loading height, the intermediate height being a height between the loading floor height and the aircraft loading height, wherein one or both of the first and second platform has mating formations configured such that when the first platform is raised from the loading floor height and reaches the intermediate height, the first and second platforms engage to define a loading deck which is displaceable between the intermediate height and the aircraft loading height, the second platform being driven by the first platform when the platforms are engaged, thereby resulting in the first and second platforms moving in unison between the intermediate height and the aircraft loading height, and such that when the first platform is lowered from the intermediate height the first platform disengages from the second platform to permit the first platform to move back to the loading floor height; and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0012">a front bridge section which is connected to the second platform, at least part of the front bridge section being displaceable relative to the second platform to accommodate an aircraft opening, in use.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0010" num="0013">The aircraft loader may be a mobile loader in the form of a wheeled vehicle. In some embodiments, the aircraft loader is an aircraft catering truck for a narrow-body aircraft loader.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0014">The aircraft loader may be a full cab or a half cab aircraft loader. In the case of a full cab aircraft loader, the second platform is located on top of the cab and in the case of a half cab aircraft loader, the second platform is located at a side of the cab. The loading floor may be the floor of a loading box/container forming part of the loader. A loading zone may be defined inside of the loading box, with the first platform being located in the loading zone when at the loading floor height.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0015">The first platform may be mounted substantially between the columns, with the columns being located at front corners of the first platform. The second platform may also be mounted substantially between the columns, with the columns being located at rear corners of the second platform.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0016">Each column may include a pair of slide receivers (a front slide receiver and a rear slide receiver). Each slide receiver may have a vertical slot in a front face thereof for receiving one of the sliders therein. Each slide receiver thus defines a vertical track for the relevant slider to run along. The slide receivers in each column may be positioned back-to-back. In some embodiments, the slide receivers may be in the form of slotted square tubes.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">Each slider may have a platform supporting portion and a sliding portion. The platform supporting and sliding portions may be perpendicular to each other and the slider may thus generally have or resemble an &#x201c;L&#x201d; shape. Preferably the platform supporting portion is located above the sliding portion. The platform supporting portion may be located at a top of the slider and may support one of the platforms, while the sliding portion may be located below the platform supporting portion and received in the vertical slot of a corresponding slide receiver.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0018">The mating formations may include one or more flanges on the second platform. The flanges may extend from the second platform and may project into a transverse plane traversed by the first platform when raised towards the second platform. Accordingly, when the first platform reaches the second platform the flanges engage with a surface of the first platform such that further upward movement of the first platform also moves the second platform.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0019">The cable system may include at least two cables. Each cable may be secured to a bottom region, e.g. to the sliding portion, of a rear slider. The cables may be secured to their respective sliders via spring-loaded safety brake devices attached to each slider inside of the columns.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0020">The cable system may be a cable and pulley system. The cable and pulley system may in turn be driven by a hydraulic piston and cylinder arrangement, e.g. a hydraulic ram mounted underneath the loading floor. The hydraulic piston and cylinder arrangement may be powered from an engine of the loader or may be battery powered, e.g. using an electro-hydraulic pump. A single stroke, single acting piston and cylinder may be utilised, preferably with a piston stroke length of greater than 1 m, more preferably about 1.5 m. The piston and cylinder may be oriented along the length of the loader.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0021">As mentioned above, in embodiments of the invention only the first platform is directly powered. The second platform is indirectly powered in that it can only move once the first platform engages the second platform. The second platform can only move once the first platform reaches its level, i.e. the intermediate height. From there, the two platforms function in unison as the loading deck from the same power source. Accordingly, the first platform may also be referred to as the &#x201c;master platform&#x201d; and the second platform may also be referred to as the &#x201c;slave platform&#x201d;. The first and second platforms are preferably lowered with gravity against controlled hydraulic oil flow.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0022">In some embodiments, the front bridge section may be extend in parallel to the loading deck. The front bridge section may have an extension which is movable along or in a horizontal plane, preferably forwards and backwards, as well as laterally, relative to the loading deck. The front bridge section's extension may be powered by a stepper motor. The aircraft opening may be an open door or a sill of the aircraft and, in use, the front bridge section may be adjusted to ensure that a load such as a wheeled catering trolley can be safely transferred across the loading deck, through the aircraft opening and into the aircraft.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0023">The columns may be fitted with a stabilising arrangement which, when deployed, engages with the ground below the chassis so as to stabilise and support the aircraft loader prior to lifting of the platforms. The stabilising arrangement may include, for example at each of the front slide receivers, a stabilising mechanism. Each stabilising mechanism may include a tubular sliding element and a baseplate, or foot, configured to be manipulated by a hydraulic cylinder (e.g. an outboard fitted cylinder) to displace the foot between the ground and a retracted position.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0024">The stabilising arrangement may extend downwardly from each column and may thus include a sliding element and an adjustable foot, the foot being adjustable between a retracted position in which it is clear of the ground and an extended position in which it engages with the ground below the chassis.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0025">The columns may be aligned along a length of the loader and may be secured to each other, e.g. using a transverse beam.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0026">The frame may be secured to the chassis via a sub-frame. The sub-frame may include spaced apart upright elements and spaced apart cross-members. The cross-members may be configured to receive the cable and pulley system and/or the hydraulic piston and cylinder arrangement.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0027">The columns may have a height above the ground of between 3 and 4 metres.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0028">An upper stopping element, or stopper, may be located at or near a top of each column. The upper stoppers may be configured such that they prevent the sliding portions from being raised above the stoppers (and thus above the top of each column), while the platform supporting portions are located above the sliding portions thus allowing the platforms to be raised to a level or height above the top of the columns. In other words, the aircraft loading height may be higher than a height of the columns above a ground level.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0029">A lower stopping element, or stopper, may be located along the front of each column so as to prevent the second platform from being lowered below the intermediate height. In full-cab embodiments, it will be appreciated that the front platform cannot be lowered below the level of the roof of the cab. However, in half-cab embodiments, the intermediate height may be below the roof of the cab.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0030">According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a load lifting apparatus for an aircraft loader, the load lifting apparatus comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li

front and rear sliders being configured to be displaced vertically along the columns;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0032">a first platform which is configured to be mounted behind the cab, the first platform being horizontally securable to the rear sliders and selectively displaceable through movement of the rear sliders between a loading floor height and an aircraft loading height, the first platform operatively being driven by a cable system coupled to the rear sliders; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0033">a second platform which is configured to be mounted in front of the first platform, either on top of or at a side of the cab, the second platform being horizontally securable to the front sliders and displaceable through movement of the front sliders between an intermediate height and the aircraft loading height, the intermediate height being a height between the loading floor height and the aircraft loading height, wherein one or both of the first and second platform has mating formations configured such that when the first platform is raised from the loading floor height and reaches the intermediate height, the first and second platforms engage to define a loading deck which is displaceable between the intermediate height and the aircraft loading height, the second platform operatively being driven by the first platform when the platforms are engaged, thereby resulting in the first and second platforms moving in unison between the intermediate height and the aircraft loading height, and such that when the first platform is lowered from the intermediate height the first platform disengages from the second platform to permit the first platform to move back to the loading floor height; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0034">a

invention, is illustrative of principles associated with the invention and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Changes may be made to the embodiments depicted and described, while still attaining results of the present invention and/or without departing from the scope of the invention. Furthermore, it will be understood that some results or advantages of the present invention may be attained by selecting some of the features of the present invention without utilising other features. Accordingly, those skilled in the art will recognise that modifications and adaptations to the present invention may be possible and may even be desirable in certain circumstances, and may form part of the present invention. Parts are shown in broken lines in some of the drawings better to illustrate certain aspects of the invention. Furthermore, some parts are omitted from certain drawings in order to simplify the drawings and thus facilitate understanding of aspects of the invention.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0056">A first embodiment of a loading lifting apparatus <b>110</b> (hereafter simply &#x201c;the apparatus <b>110</b>&#x201d;) is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>6</b></figref> and a first embodiment of an aircraft loader <b>100</b> (hereafter simply &#x201c;the loader <b>100</b>&#x201d;), including the apparatus <b>110</b>, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>12</b></figref>. In this example, the loader <b>100</b> is a wheeled vehicle in the form of a full-cab truck used for loading a narrow-body (single-aisle) aircraft, particularly with catering trolleys.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0057">The apparatus <b>110</b> makes use of dual-slide posts referred to below as &#x201c;columns&#x201d;, as well as a system of pulleys and cables to permit platforms to be lifted higher than a height of the columns.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0058">The apparatus <b>110</b> includes a frame <b>112</b>, a first horizontal platform <b>114</b>, a second horizontal platform <b>116</b>, a front bridge section <b>118</b> and a cable system <b>120</b> powered by a hydraulic piston and cylinder arrangement <b>122</b> (hereafter &#x201c;the cylinder arrangement <b>122</b>&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0059">The frame <b>112</b> is operatively secured to a chassis <b>124</b> of the loader <b>100</b> and includes a pair of vertical columns <b>126</b> spaced apart behind a cab <b>128</b> of the loader. The columns <b>126</b> are aligned along the length of the loader <b>100</b> and in this embodiment they are located in the front corners of a load box <b>160</b> of the loader <b>100</b> (the load box <b>160</b> defines a loading zone <b>162</b> therein). A transverse beam <b>156</b> extends between the columns <b>126</b> to provide structural support and to ensure that they remain evenly spaced apart along the lengths thereof.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0060">When viewed from the side (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>7</b> to <b>9</b></figref>), it will be evident that the columns <b>126</b> are positioned so as to ensure the loads of the two platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> are balance by cantilever effect. The positioning also helps to reduce friction on the sliders described below.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0061">In this example, each column has a height of approximately 3 metres. Preferably, when installed in the loader, the top of the columns <b>126</b> is at a height of less than 4 metres.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0062">The frame <b>112</b> and transverse beam <b>156</b> may rest on and be secured to a sub-frame (not shown) that spans a substantial part of the chassis <b>124</b> of the loader <b>100</b>. Preferably such a sub-frame has upright members and cross-members and the cross-members may be used to secure a cable system and its hydraulic driving system (described below) in position.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0063">The exact dimensions and position of the frame <b>112</b>, sub-frame and platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> may be varied and it will be appreciated that these depend on factors such as truck dimensions and manufacturer's requirements.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0064">Each column <b>126</b> has a front section <b>128</b> defining a front slide receiver with a vertical slot <b>130</b> and a rear section <b>132</b> defining a rear slide receiver, also with a vertical slot <b>134</b>. Each slot <b>130</b>, <b>134</b> is configured to receive a slider used to move the platforms <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> upwardly and downwardly relatively to the columns <b>126</b> in use. More specifically, each front section <b>128</b> has a front slider <b>136</b> and each rear section <b>132</b> has a rear slider <b>138</b>. The slots <b>130</b>, <b>134</b> are essentially vertical tracks in which the sliders <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> are held captive and along which they run to displace the platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0065">The slide receivers may be manufactured using square tubes. Each tube may be provided with a slot in its front face and the tubes may then be secured back-to-back, thereby to define a column <b>126</b>. The slide receivers may thus be substantially U-shaped in cross-section.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0066">As mentioned above, the apparatus <b>110</b> makes use of two platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>. The exact shape and dimensions of each platform <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, as well as the front bridge section <b>118</b> connected to the second platform <b>116</b>, may be varied to accommodate the dimensions of the loader used and to suit the loading and operating requirements of the installation.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0067">Side walls <b>164</b> extend upwardly from the first platform <b>114</b>, while the front and the rear of the first platform <b>114</b> are substantially open (i.e. free from walls) to facilitate loading of items onto and from the platform <b>114</b>. Similarly, side walls <b>166</b> extend upwardly from the second platform <b>116</b> while its rear its substantially open. The front of the second platform <b>116</b> is provided with wall sections <b>168</b> with doors <b>158</b> there between. The doors <b>158</b> are shown in an open condition in the drawings, but it should be appreciated that the doors <b>158</b> may be closed when required, e.g. when lifting or lowering a load. The doors <b>158</b> open up to expose the front bridge section <b>118</b> which operatively bridges the gap between the platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> and the aircraft. The front bridge section <b>118</b> includes an extension <b>178</b> which can be moved forwardly, rearwardly and from side to side using an electrical stepper motor (not shown).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0068">The first platform <b>114</b> is mounted between the pair of rear sliders <b>138</b> and the second platform <b>116</b> is mounted between the pair of front sliders <b>136</b>. As shown in the drawings, the columns <b>126</b> are located at front corners of the first platform <b>114</b> and at rear corners of the second platform <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0069">As is best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, each slider <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> has an upper portion referred to as its platform supporting portion <b>140</b> and a lower portion referred to as its sliding portion <b>142</b>. The portions <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> extend generally perpendicular to each other thus making the slider <b>136</b>, <b>138</b> resemble an &#x201c;L&#x201d; shape or inverted &#x201c;L&#x201d; shape. Each platform <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> is secured between two platform supporting portions <b>140</b>, while the sliding portions <b>142</b> are held captive in the slots <b>130</b>, <b>134</b>. For example, sides of each platform <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> may be bolted to the respective platform supporting portions <b>140</b> of the sliders <b>136</b>/<b>138</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0070">The design and configuration of the sliders <b>136</b>/<b>138</b> are particularly advantageous in that this allows the platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> to be lifted higher than the height of the columns <b>126</b>. While the sliding portions <b>142</b> are held captive in and restricted by the columns <b>126</b> (i.e. the sliding portions <b>142</b> themselves cannot move above the columns <b>126</b>), the supporting portions <b>140</b> are located above the sliding portions <b>142</b>. The platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> are at the same level as the supporting portions <b>140</b>. Accordingly, when the sliders <b>136</b>/<b>138</b> are raised to the highest possible point in this example embodiment, the platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> are higher than the columns <b>126</b>. In this way, the desired loading levels, e.g. aircraft door sill heights of up to 4 metres (in the case of narrow-body aircraft) can be accommodated without the column height exceeding for instance a maximum prescribed height.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0071">The cable system <b>120</b> and cylinder arrangement <b>122</b> are located below a loading floor <b>144</b> of the loader <b>100</b> and may be mounted in position using a sub-frame as described above.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0072">In this example embodiment, the cable system <b>120</b> is in the form of a double pulley system with a pair of cables <b>146</b> connected to the cylinder arrangement <b>122</b> and to the rear sliders <b>138</b>. In this example, a cable <b>146</b> is secured to a sliding portion <b>142</b> of a respective rear slider <b>138</b> via a spring-loaded safety brake device (not shown) located inside of the column <b>126</b>. In use, this feature prevents a slider from dropping in the case of tension loss on a cable which may result from a cable breaking or another fault in the system <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0073">The cylinder arrangement <b>122</b> is in the form of a hydraulic ram mounted to a sub-frame of the frame <b>112</b> underneath the loading floor <b>144</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>10</b></figref>) and powered from the engine of the loader <b>100</b>. In this example, the cylinder arrangement <b>122</b> utilises a single stroke, single acting piston and cylinder oriented along the length of the loader <b>100</b>, with a piston stroke length of 1.5 m. In use, movement of a piston rod (not shown) of the cylinder arrangement <b>122</b> drives the cable system <b>120</b> so as to raise and lower the sliders <b>138</b> and thus the platform <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0074">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>12</b></figref>, the first platform <b>114</b> is horizontally mounted behind a cab <b>148</b> of the loader <b>100</b> and the second platform <b>116</b> is located above the cab <b>148</b>. The first platform <b>114</b> is selectively displaceable through movement of the rear sliders <b>138</b> via the cable system <b>120</b>. The first platform <b>114</b> can be moved vertically (through sliding motion of the sliders <b>138</b>) between its lowest position at a loading floor height (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) and its highest position at an aircraft loading height (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The first platform <b>114</b> can thus be moved vertically upwardly and downwardly along the entire length of the columns <b>126</b>. Motion of the second platform <b>116</b> is more limited. The second platform <b>116</b> can be moved vertically (through sliding motion of the sliders <b>140</b>) between the its lowest position at an intermediate height (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>) and its highest position which is also the aircraft loading height (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The intermediate height is a height just above the roof <b>168</b> of the cab <b>148</b>. The load box <b>160</b> has an opening in a front upper region of its roof <b>170</b> to allow the first platform <b>114</b> to be lifted substantially out of the load box <b>160</b> and up to the aircraft loading height as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0075">An upper stopper <b>152</b> is located at the top of each column <b>126</b> to prevent the sliding portions <b>142</b> from sliding out of the columns <b>126</b>, i.e. to hold them captive therein. In this embodiment, the upper stopper <b>152</b> is in the form of a plate covering the column <b>126</b>, acting both as a lid for components of the cable system <b>120</b> and as a platform stopper.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0076">A lower stopper <b>154</b> is located along the front of each column <b>126</b> so as to prevent the second platform <b>116</b> from being lowered below the intermediate height. While in this embodiment it is impossible for the platform <b>116</b> to be lowered lower than the roof <b>168</b>, a stopper <b>154</b> is nevertheless useful in preventing damage and allowing precise displacement. In a half-cab embodiment such as the second embodiment described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> to <b>17</b></figref> below, the intermediate height is lower as the lower stopper is located lower than the roof of the cab, with the second platform travelling in a plane at the side of the cab.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0077">While the first platform <b>114</b> is driven directly using the cable system <b>120</b> and cylinder arrangement <b>122</b>, the second platform <b>116</b> is not directly powered or driven. The second platform <b>116</b> can only be raised and lowered when the platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> are engaged to define a loading deck of the loader <b>100</b>. Thus the first platform <b>114</b> is the master platform and the second platform <b>116</b> is the slave platform.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0078">In order to establish engagement or locking between the platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, the second platform <b>116</b> has a pair of flanges <b>150</b> in rear corner regions thereof. Each flange <b>150</b> has one end secured to the platform <b>116</b> and a second end which projects past the second platform <b>116</b> and into a transverse plane traversed by the first platform <b>114</b>. In this way the platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> mate when the first platform <b>114</b> reaches the second platform's height and they then move in unison up to the aircraft loading height.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0079">The front section <b>128</b> of each column <b>126</b> is fitted with a stabilising arrangement <b>172</b>. The stabilising arrangement <b>172</b> includes a tubular sliding element <b>174</b> and a foot <b>176</b> adjusted using an outboard fitted hydraulic cylinder. The foot <b>176</b> is displaced between a resting position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) in which it is retracted and an extended position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>10</b></figref>) in which it engages with the ground below the chassis <b>124</b> to support and stabilise the apparatus <b>110</b>. The arrangement <b>172</b> is preferably manipulated into the extended position prior to loading activities.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0080">Referring now specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>12</b></figref>, in use, with the loader <b>100</b> parked next to an aircraft <b>102</b> and the stabilising arrangement <b>172</b> in position to support the apparatus <b>110</b>, the process typically starts with the first platform <b>114</b> at the loading floor height and the second platform <b>116</b> at the intermediate height, suspended just above the cab <b>148</b>. The two platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> thus start from different heights. Items <b>180</b>, e.g. wheeled catering trolleys, are then moved from the loading floor <b>144</b> and onto the first platform <b>114</b>. Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> in this regard.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0081">Then, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the first platform <b>114</b> is raised to the intermediate height while carrying a load. Here the platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> join/engage in the manner described above to form a loading deck. The second platform <b>116</b> is the slave platform, meaning it can only move when engaged with the first platform <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0082">From the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> the platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> travel in unison. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> or loading deck then move to a third position in which the loading deck is located at the aircraft loading height.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0083">Typically once the loading deck is in the appropriate position, the front bridge section <b>118</b> is adjusted to mate with the aircraft <b>102</b>, e.g. to be aligned with a sill of the aircraft door <b>104</b>. As mentioned above, the front bridge section <b>118</b> has the motorised extension <b>178</b> which can be moved relative to the loading deck and the rest of the front bridge section <b>118</b> as required before loading the items <b>180</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). This ensures that items <b>180</b>, e.g. a wheeled catering trolley can be safely transferred across the loading deck and into the aircraft.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0084">Once loading has been completed, the platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> are lowered in unison with gravity against controlled hydraulic oil flow. Once the platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> reach the intermediate height, the second platform <b>116</b> also reaches the lower stoppers <b>154</b> and cannot be lowered further. As a result, the platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> disengage and the first platform <b>114</b> travels alone back to the bottom of the loading zone <b>162</b> until it reaches the loading floor <b>144</b>. The stabilising arrangement <b>172</b> can be retracted, after which the loader <b>100</b> may travel away from the aircraft <b>102</b>.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0085">It should be appreciated that the loader <b>100</b> may include a suitable controller, e.g. a controller located on the first platform, which is used to send commands to the arrangement <b>122</b> for raising or lowering the platforms <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>. Alternatively or additionally, a remote control device may be employed for this purpose.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0086">A second embodiment of a loading lifting apparatus <b>210</b> (hereafter simply &#x201c;the apparatus <b>210</b>&#x201d;) is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> and a second embodiment of an aircraft loader <b>200</b> (hereafter simply &#x201c;the loader <b>200</b>&#x201d;), including the apparatus <b>210</b>, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> to <b>17</b></figref>. In this example, the loader <b>100</b> is a wheeled vehicle in the form of a half-cab loader for loading a narrow-body aircraft with items such as catering trolleys.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0087">The second embodiment of the load lifting apparatus <b>210</b> is highly similar to the first embodiment <b>110</b>. Furthermore, the second embodiment of the loader <b>200</b> is similar to the first embodiment <b>100</b>. Like reference numerals refer to like components and arrangements. The principles of construction and operation will not be repeated in the description below, which serves merely to highlight the differences between the embodiments.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0088">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the primary difference between the loaders <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> is that the loader <b>200</b> has a so-called &#x201c;half cab&#x201d; <b>248</b>. Accordingly, the second platform <b>214</b> of the loader <b>200</b> is located at the side of the cab <b>248</b> (not above the cab <b>148</b> as in the first embodiment described above). In order to accommodate the half-cab dimensions, the first platform <b>212</b>, second platform <b>214</b>, front bridge section <b>216</b> and bridge extension <b>278</b> are all narrower. Similarly, the frame <b>212</b> of the loader <b>200</b> is narrower as the columns <b>126</b> are spaced closer to each other. One of the columns <b>126</b> is located in the front left corner of the load box <b>160</b> while the other column <b>126</b> is located centrally in the front of the load box <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0089">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> to <b>17</b></figref>, the loader <b>200</b> operates based on substantially the same principles and mechanisms as the loader <b>100</b>. The primary difference resides in the intermediate height employed in the loader <b>200</b> being lower than the roof <b>268</b> of the cab <b>248</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0090">As an example, in the case of a full-cab loader such as the loader <b>100</b>, the columns may be approximately 3 m in height with the intermediate height being about 2.2 m above the loading floor, while in the case of a half-cab loader such as the loader <b>200</b>, the intermediate height may be lowered to for instance 1.3 m above the loading floor. It will be appreciated that as the intermediate height is lower, the loader <b>200</b> may have a lower stopper (not shown) similar to the stopper <b>154</b>, but which is located lower down along each column <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0091">In this embodiment, the process also typically starts with the first platform <b>214</b> at the loading floor height and the second platform <b>216</b> at the intermediate height, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. The two platforms <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> thus also start from different heights, but they are closer to each other in the loader <b>200</b>. Items <b>180</b> are then moved from the loading floor <b>144</b> and onto the first platform <b>214</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0092">Then, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the first platform <b>214</b> is raised to the intermediate height with the load it is carrying. Here the platforms <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> join/engage in the manner described above to form a loading deck.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0093">From the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> the platforms <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> travel in unison. Referring to FIG. <b>17</b>, the platforms <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> or loading deck then move to a third position in which the loading deck is located at the aircraft loading height. The remainder of the process can be carried out as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>12</b></figref> above.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0094">Embodiments of the present invention may address some of the issues identified in the &#x201c;Background&#x201d; section above, at least to some extent, and the Inventors have identified numerous possible advantages. In addition to the possible advantages mentioned above, other possible advantages are set out below.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0095">A loader according to the invention may utilise three distinct platform positions. Firstly, in a resting position the master platform can be loaded at loading floor level while the slave platform rests at the intermediate height. Then, in an engaging position the master platform is raised to a &#x201c;marriage point&#x201d; so that the two platforms define a single loading deck. Then, the platforms are raised together to a third position which is the desired height needed to reach for instance a doorsill height of the aircraft. As explained above, in this third position, both the first and second platforms may be located not only above the cab's roof but also higher than the columns and/or higher than the vehicle's load box/body. This may be particularly useful where loaders (when in a driving condition) are limited to a certain height, e.g. 4 m.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0096">Embodiments of the invention provide a lighter and/or smaller lifting arrangement, meaning that the vehicle can deploy the platforms faster and load more aircraft in less time. Furthermore, the load lifting apparatus can be installed on a lighter and lower-cost chassis, saving capital and other costs such as running and insurance costs. Particularly in catering applications where the only loads to be lifted are, for instance, catering trolleys and other relatively small catering items, embodiments of the invention eliminate the need for large, heavy and expensive lifting apparatus such as scissor mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0097">To achieve the travel height required from the first platform, e.g. 3 m as mentioned above, at even speed and pressure, a single stroke, single acting hydraulic cylinder (parallel to the vehicle length) with a stroke of about 1500 mm may advantageously be used. This is in contrast to existing lifting systems of which the Inventors are aware that utilise a hydraulic cylinder transversely, limiting the stroke to the width of the loader vehicle. The cylinder stroke length may be altered to accommodate the required loading heights.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0098">Embodiments of the invention utilise &#x201c;inverted L shape&#x201d; sliders that move along columns are able to exceed the standard travelling height by extending past the columns, as described above. The system utilises sets of slide receivers that form a single column.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0099">As explained above, embodiments of the invention provide one master platform and one slave platform, which together may act to balance the load lifting apparatus and increase dimensions of the loading deck. The use of a master-slave relationship may eliminate the need to provide a separate lifting mechanism and/or power supply above the cab roof to manipulate the second platform.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0100">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that there are many variations to the invention as herein defined and/or described with reference to the accompanying drawings, without departing from the spirit and scope of this disclosure. For example, in the examples provided and illustrated in the drawings, the aircraft loader is in the form of an aircraft catering truck for a narrow-body aircraft. However, it should be appreciated the principles of the invention may be applied to other types of aircraft loaders.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
