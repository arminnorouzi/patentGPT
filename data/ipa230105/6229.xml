The energy barrier required to break the molecular bonds of the described monomer can be calculated using computational methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT). Such methods are described in the literature (Yu et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc. </i>2011, 133, 19857-19863). Typically, an (e.g. open-source) software package such as NWChem, such as available from Pacific Northwest National Labs (PNNL), that employs a commonly accepted basis set such as B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,p) is utilized. Reaction barriers are calculated from the difference between the total calculated energy of the molecule of interest and the transition state of that molecule during the fluorine abstraction reaction. In some embodiments, the energy barrier to abstract a fluorine atom by a hydrogen atom (H&#xb7;) from the C<sub>m</sub>F<sub>2m+1 </sub>of the ethylenically unsaturated group is greater 23 kcal/mol. Higher bond strength can provide improved chemical durability.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0028">The monomer can be prepared from any suitable method.

A membrane electrode assembly (MEA) is the central element of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell, such as a hydrogen fuel cell. Fuel cells are electrochemical cells that produce usable electricity by the catalyzed combination of a fuel such as hydrogen and an oxidant such as oxygen. Typical MEA's comprise a polymer electrolyte membrane (also known as an ion conductive membrane (ICM)), which functions as a solid electrolyte. One particular type of ICM is a proton exchange membrane, (PEM). One face of the ICM or PEM is in contact with an anode electrode layer and the opposite face is in contact with a cathode electrode layer. Each electrode layer includes electrochemical catalysts, typically including platinum metal or alloys of platinum metal. Gas diffusion layers (GDL's) facilitate gas transport to and from the anode and cathode electrode materials and conduct electrical current. The GDL may also be called a fluid transport layer (FTL) or a diffuser/current collector (DCC). The anode and cathode electrode layers may be applied to GDL's in the form of a catalyst ink, and the resulting coated GDL's sandwiched with a PEM to form a five-layer MEA. Alternately, the anode and cathode electrode layers may be applied to opposite sides of the PEM in the form of a catalyst ink, and the resulting catalyst-coated membrane (CCM) sandwiched with two GDL's to form a five-layer MEA. Details concerning the preparation of catalyst inks and their use in membrane assemblies can be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2004/0107869 (Velamakanni et al.). In a typical PEM fuel cell, protons are formed at the anode via hydrogen oxidation and transported across the PEM to the cathode to react with oxygen, causing electrical current to flow in an external circuit connecting the electrodes. The PEM forms a durable, non-porous, electrically non-conductive mechanical barrier between the reactant gases, yet it also passes H<sup>+</sup> ions readily.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0084">The fluoropolymers described herein are useful as a PEM and/or useful for making a membrane or catalyst ink composition.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0085">In some embodiments, the copolymer of the present disclosure may be useful for making a polymer electrolyte membrane.

Typically, the membrane is cast from a fluoropolymer dispersion (e.g., those described above in any of their embodiments) and then dried, annealed, or both.

After forming, the membrane may be annealed, typically at a temperature of 120&#xb0; C. or higher, more typically 130&#xb0; C. or higher, most typically 150&#xb0; C. or higher. In some embodiments of the method according to the present disclosure, a polymer electrolyte membrane can be obtained by obtaining the copolymer in a fluoropolymer dispersion, optionally purifying the dispersion by ion-exchange purification, and concentrating the dispersion to make a membrane. Typically, if the fluoropolymer dispersion is to be used to form a membrane, the concentration of copolymer is advantageously high (e.g., at least 20, 30, or 40 percent by weight). Often a water-miscible organic solvent is added to facilitate film formation. Examples of water-miscible solvents include lower alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-propanol), polyols (e.g., ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol), ethers (e.g., tetrahydrofuran and dioxane), ether acetates, acetonitrile, acetone, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), N,N dimethylacetamide (DMA), ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, dimethylcarbonate, diethylcarbonate, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP), dimethylimidazolidinone, butyrolactone, hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPT), isobutyl methyl ketone, sulfolane, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0086">In another embodiment, a fluoropolymer (e.g. TFE copolymer) dispersion as described herein can be combined with catalyst particles (e.g., metal particles or carbon-supported metal particles) to form a catalyst ink. A variety of catalysts may be useful. Typically, carbon-supported catalyst particles are used. Typical carbon-supported catalyst particles are 30% to 95% carbon and 5% to 70% catalyst metal by weight, the catalyst metal typically comprising platinum for the cathode and platinum or platinum and ruthenium in a weight ratio of 2:1 for the anode. However, other metals may be useful, for example, gold, silver, palladium, iridium, rhodium, iron, cobalt, nickel, chromium, tungsten, manganese, vanadium, and alloys thereof. To make an MEA or CCM, catalyst may be applied to the PEM by any suitable means, including both hand and machine methods, including hand brushing, notch bar coating, fluid bearing die coating, wire-wound rod coating, slot-fed knife coating, three-roll coating, or decal transfer. Coating may be achieved in one application or in multiple applications. Advantageously, copolymers according to the present disclosure may be useful for making a catalyst layer with one coating application. The catalyst ink may be applied to a PEM or a GDL directly, or the catalyst ink may be applied to a transfer substrate, dried, and thereafter applied to the PEM or to the FTL as a decal.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0087">In some embodiments, the catalyst ink includes the copolymer disclosed herein at a concentration of at least 10, 15, or 20 percent by weight and up to 30 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the catalyst ink. In some embodiment, the catalyst ink includes the catalyst particles in an amount of at least 10, 15, or 20 percent by weight and up to 50, 40, or 30 percent by weight, based on the total weight of the catalyst ink. The catalyst particles may be added to the fluoropolymer dispersion made as described above in any of its embodiments. The resulting catalyst ink may be mixed, for example, with heating. The percent solids in the catalyst ink may be selected, for example, to obtain desirable rheological properties. Examples of suitable organic solvents useful for including in the catalyst ink include lower alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, n-propanol), polyols (e.g., ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol), ethers (e.g., tetrahydrofuran and dioxane), diglyme, polyglycol ethers, ether acetates, acetonitrile, acetone, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), N,N dimethylacetamide (DMA), ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate, dimethylcarbonate, diethylcarbonate, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP), dimethylimidazolidinone, butyrolactone, hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPT), isobutyl methyl ketone, sulfolane, and combinations thereof In some embodiments, the catalyst ink contains 0% to 50% by weight of a lower alcohol and 0% to 20% by weight of a polyol. In addition, the ink may contain 0% to 2% of a suitable dispersant.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0088">In some embodiments of the polymer electrolyte membrane of the present disclosure, a salt of at least one of cerium, manganese or ruthenium, or one or more cerium oxide or zirconium oxide compounds is added to the acid form of the copolymer before membrane formation. Typically, the salt of cerium, manganese, or ruthenium and/or the cerium or zirconium oxide compound is mixed well with or dissolved within the copolymer to achieve substantially uniform distribution.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0089">The salt of cerium, manganese, or ruthenium may comprise any suitable anion, including chloride, bromide, hydroxide, nitrate, sulfonate, acetate, phosphate, and carbonate. More than one anion may be present. Other salts may be present, including salts that include other metal cations or ammonium cations. Once cation exchange occurs between the transition metal salt and the acid form of the ionomer, it may be desirable for the acid formed by combination of the liberated proton and the original salt anion to be removed. Thus, it may be useful to use anions that generate volatile or soluble acids, for example chloride or nitrate. Manganese cations may be in any suitable oxidation state, including Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>3+</sup>, and Mn<sup>4+</sup>, but are most typically Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Ruthenium cations may be in any suitable oxidation state, including Ru<sup>3+</sup> and Ru<sup>4+</sup>, but are most typically Ru<sup>3+</sup>. Cerium cations may be in any suitable oxidation state, including Ce<sup>3+</sup> and Ce<sup>4+</sup>. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the cerium, manganese, or ruthenium cations persist in the polymer electrolyte because they are exchanged with H<sup>+</sup> ions from the anion groups of the polymer electrolyte and become associated with those anion groups. Furthermore, it is believed that polyvalent cerium, manganese, or ruthenium cations may form ionic crosslinks between anion groups of the polymer electrolyte, further adding to the stability of the polymer. In some embodiments, the salt may be present in solid form. The cations may be present in a combination of two or more forms including solvated cation, cation associated with bound anion groups of the polymer electrolyte membrane, and cation bound in a salt precipitate. The amount of salt added is typically between 0.001 and 0.5 charge equivalents based on the molar amount of acid functional groups present in the polymer electrolyte, more typically between 0.005 and 0.2, more typically between 0.01 and 0.1, and more typically between 0.02 and 0.05. Further details for combining an anionic copolymer with cerium, manganese, or ruthenium cations can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,575,534 and 8,628,871, each to Frey et al. and U.S. Pat.

Fuel cell Membrane Electrode Assembly with Combined Additives&#x201d;, Pierpont et al.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0090">Useful cerium oxide compounds may contain cerium in the (IV) oxidation state, the (III) oxidation state, or both and may be crystalline or amorphous. The cerium oxide may be, for example, CeO<sub>2 </sub>or Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The cerium oxide may be substantially free of metallic cerium or may contain metallic cerium. The cerium oxide compound may or may not contain other metal elements. Examples of mixed metal oxide compounds comprising cerium oxide include solid solutions such as zirconia-ceria and multicomponent oxide compounds such as barium cerate. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the cerium oxide may strengthen the polymer by chelating and forming crosslinks between bound anionic groups. The amount of cerium oxide compound added is typically between 0.01 and 5 weight percent based on the total weight of the copolymer, more typically between 0.1 and 2 weight percent, and more typically between 0.2 and 0.3 weight percent. The cerium oxide compound is typically present in an amount of less than 1% by volume relative to the total volume of the polymer electrolyte membrane, more typically less than 0.8% by volume, and more typically less than 0.5% by volume. Cerium oxide may be in particles of any suitable size, in some embodiments, between 1 nm and 5000 nm, 200 nm to 5000 nm, or 500 nm to 1000 nm. Further details regarding polymer electrolyte membranes including cerium oxide compounds can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 8,367,267 (Frey et al.).</p><p id="p-0087" num="0091">The polymer electrolyte membrane, in some embodiments, may have a thickness of up to 90 micrometers, up to 60 micrometers, or up to 30 micrometers. A thinner membrane may provide less resistance to the passage of ions. In fuel cell use, this results in cooler operation and greater output of usable energy.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0092">In some embodiments, a fluoropolymer (e.g. TFE copolymer) as described herein may be imbibed into a porous supporting matrix, typically in the form of a thin membrane having a thickness of up to 90 micrometers, up to 60 micrometers, or up to 30 micrometers. Any suitable method of imbibing the copolymer into the pores of the supporting matrix may be used, including overpressure, vacuum, wicking, and immersion. Any suitable supporting matrix may be used. Typically, the supporting matrix is electrically non-conductive. Typically, the supporting matrix is composed of a fluoropolymer, which is more typically perfluorinated. Typical matrices include porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), such as biaxially stretched PTFE webs. In another embodiment fillers (e.g., fibers) might be added to the polymer to reinforce the membrane.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0093">The membranes can be fabricated to include a mechanical reinforcement support such as expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (ePTFE) as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,599,614 &#x201c;Integral Composite Membrane&#x201d;, Bahar et al. Alternatively, an electrospun nanofiber may be used, as described in US 2013/0101918 A1 &#x201c;Reinforced Polymer Electrolyte Membrane&#x201d;, Yandrasits et al. Membrane thickness including such support can range from 5 to 500 micrometers in thickness.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0094">To make an MEA, GDL's may be applied to either side of a CCM by any suitable means. Any suitable GDL may be used in the practice of the present disclosure. Typically, the GDL support is comprised of sheet material comprising carbon fibers. Typically, the GDL is a carbon fiber construction selected from woven and non-woven carbon fiber constructions. Carbon fiber constructions that may be useful include Toray&#x2122; Carbon Paper, SpectraCarb&#x2122; Carbon Paper, AFN&#x2122; non-woven carbon cloth, and Zoltek&#x2122; Carbon Cloth. The GDL may be coated or impregnated with various materials, including carbon particle coatings, hydrophilizing treatments, and hydrophobizing treatments such as coating with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).</p><p id="p-0091" num="0095">In use, the MEA is typically sandwiched between two rigid plates, known as distribution plates, also known as bipolar plates (BPP's) or monopolar plates. Like the GDL, the distribution plate is typically electrically conductive. The distribution plate is typically made of a carbon composite, metal, or plated metal material. The distribution plate distributes reactant or product fluids to and from the MEA electrode surfaces, typically through one or more fluid-conducting channels engraved, milled, molded or stamped in the surface(s) facing the MEA(s). These channels are sometimes designated a flow field. The distribution plate may distribute fluids to and from two consecutive MEA's in a stack, with one face directing fuel to the anode of the first MEA while the other face directs oxidant to the cathode of the next MEA (and removes product water), hence the term &#x201c;bipolar plate.&#x201d; Alternately, the distribution plate may have channels on one side only, to distribute fluids to or from an MEA on only that side, which plate may be termed a &#x201c;monopolar plate.&#x201d; A typical fuel cell stack comprises a number of MEA's stacked alternately with bipolar plates.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0096">Another type of electrochemical device is an electrolysis cell, which uses electricity to produce chemical changes or chemical energy. An example of an electrolysis cell is a chlor-alkali membrane cell where aqueous sodium chloride is electrolyzed by an electric current between an anode and a cathode. The electrolyte is separated into an anolyte portion and a catholyte portion by a membrane subject to harsh conditions. In chlor-alkali membrane cells, caustic sodium hydroxide collects in the catholyte portion, hydrogen gas is evolved at the cathode portion, and chlorine gas is evolved from the sodium chloride-rich anolyte portion at the anode. The copolymer of the present disclosure may be useful, for example, in the manufacture of catalyst ink and electrolyte membranes for use in chlor-alkali membrane cells or other electrolytic cells. Another type of electrolysis cell uses electricity to produce hydrogen and oxygen where water is electrolyzed by an electric current between an anode and a cathode.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0097">The copolymer according to the present disclosure may also be useful as a binder for an electrode in other electrochemical cells (for example, lithium ion batteries). To make electrodes, powdered active ingredients can be dispersed in a solvent with the copolymer and coated onto a metal foil substrate, or current collector. The resulting composite electrode contains the powdered active ingredient in the polymer binder adhered to the metal substrate. Useful active materials for making negative electrodes include alloys of main group elements and conductive powders such as graphite. Examples of useful active materials for making a negative electrode include oxides (tin oxide), carbon compounds (e.g., artificial graphite, natural graphite, soil black lead, expanded graphite, and scaly graphite), silicon carbide compounds, silicon-oxide compounds, titanium sulfides, and boron carbide compounds. Useful active materials for making positive electrodes include lithium compounds, such as Li<sub>4/3</sub>Ti<sub>5/3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, LiV<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, LiV<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, LiCo<sub>0.2</sub>N<sub>0.8</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, LiNiO<sub>2</sub>, LiFePO<sub>4</sub>, LiMnPO<sub>4</sub>, LiCoPO<sub>4</sub>, LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and LiCoO<sub>2</sub>. The electrodes can also include electrically conductive diluents and adhesion promoters.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0098">Electrochemical battery cells (for example, lithium ion batteries) including the copolymer disclosed herein as a binder or solid polymer electrolyte can be made by placing at least one each of a positive electrode and a negative electrode in contact with an electrolyte. Typically, a microporous separator imbibed with liquid electrolyte can be used to prevent the contact of the negative electrode directly with the positive electrode. The copolymer disclosed herein may be suitable to serve as the electrolyte and separator. Once the electrodes are connected externally, lithiation and delithiation can take place at the electrodes, generating a current.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0099">The electrochemical cells can be useful as rechargeable batteries and can be used in a variety of devices, including portable computers, tablet displays, personal digital assistants, mobile telephones, motorized devices (e.g., personal or household appliances and vehicles), instruments, illumination devices (e.g., flashlights) and heating devices. One or more of the electrochemical cells can be combined to provide a battery pack.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0096" num="0100"></p><p id="p-0097" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00002" num="00002"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Abbreviation or </entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Trade Name</entry><entry>Description</entry><entry>Source</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Potassium Fluoride </entry><entry>&#x3e;99%</entry><entry>Sigma Aldrich Co.

The reaction was held at a temperature of 220&#xb0; C. for 3 hours (including the excursion) and was cooled to room temperature then vented. Lustrous iodine crystals were observed on the cooling line and reactor head upon opening the reactor. A dark purple liquid was decanted with some fine grey solids (74.511 g) leaving behind the bulk of dark grey solids. The reaction liquid (40.89 g) was filtered through a 1 micrometer glass microfiber syringe filter to recover 24.827 g of a pink transparent liquid. The filtered liquid was washed with 75 mL 0.5 M HCl(aq) over 3 washes to recover 22.56 g of a burnt orange transparent liquid of approximately 32.9% primary iodide (PI). After purification by distillation and heating of this material at 220&#xb0; C. for 3 hours, over a 2 hour and 1 hour hold for sampling, led to a recovered yield of 19.71 g that, by <sup>19</sup>F NMR, contained the primary iodide of Formula II (18.33 g, 32.9 mmol, (26.9% yield)).</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Prophetic Example 4: Synthesis of FSO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>OC(CF<sub>3</sub>)&#x2550;CF<sub>2 </sub></heading><p id="p-0111" num="0111">Synthetic example monomer of perfluoroisopropenyl ether ethane sulfonyl fluoride (designated MV(CH3)2S) could be provided by the following reaction scheme:</p><p id="p-0112" num="0000"><chemistry id="CHEM-US-00026" num="00026"><img id="EMI-C00026" he="30.23mm" wi="75.86mm" file="US20230006230A1-20230105-C00026.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="chem" img-format="tif"/></chemistry></p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The primary iodide product from Example 3 will be reacted with phenyl lithium (PhLi) as described in Example 2 to form the isopropenyl ether C<sub>2 </sub>sulfonyl fluoride monomer.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Based on the description of U.S. Pat.
