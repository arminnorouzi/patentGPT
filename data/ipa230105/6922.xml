The application further, for at least some of the plurality of international call routes, defines a prioritized list of carrier supported routes based on the determination whether the contracted minutes of use has been satisfied and based on the cost for the international communication service carriers to support the international call route. The application further transmits a file associating each of the plurality of international call routes to the prioritized list of carrier supported routes to a central routing function (CRF), whereby the CRF responds to requests for international call routes to complete international calls.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">These and other features will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">For a more complete understanding of the present disclosure, reference is now made to the following brief description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings and detailed description, wherein like reference numerals represent like parts.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a block diagram of a communication system according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a block diagram of a communication system according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is a block diagram of a communication system according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow chart of a method of international call routing according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> are a flow chart of a method of domestic long-distance call routing according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> are a flow chart of a method of domestic long-distance call routing according to another embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> are a flow chart of a method of wholesale call routing according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> are a flow chart of another method of wholesale call routing according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> are a flow chart of yet another method of wholesale call routing according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is a block diagram of a 6G communication network according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> is a block diagram of a 5G core network according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a block diagram of a computer system according to an embodiment of the disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more embodiments are illustrated below, the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or not yet in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations, drawings, and techniques illustrated below, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present disclosure teaches a system that generates a prioritized list of routes based on criteria that may be provided on request to a network element (NE) that requests such a prioritized list of routes to complete a domestic long-distance call or, as described further below, to complete an international call. More specifically, a route generation application may generate prioritized call route list transactions, and a centralized routing function (CRF) may process these prioritized call route list transactions to build readily searchable prioritized call route lists. When a NE sends a request for a prioritized call route list to the CRF, the CRF provides an appropriate prioritized call route list based on the parameters provided by the NE in the request. Because the CRF has pre-built the prioritized route lists, the CRF can quickly look-up and return the appropriate prioritized call route list to the requesting NE, thereby avoiding delaying the call routing and at the same time making the network more efficient by promoting use of the highest priority call route. The CRF is out of the call path (e.g., the bearer content&#x2014;for example voice signals&#x2014;do not flow through the CRF). In some contexts, prioritized call route lists may be referred to more succinctly as prioritized route lists.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Domestic call route generation is based, in part, on identifying the highest priority routes by the route generation application based on one or more criteria. Various criteria can be used, and the prioritized routes in a prioritized call route list can be selected as an optimization among the criteria. One criterium may be a least cost route. Another criterium may be key performance indicators (KPIs) developed from data provided by the NEs and sent by the NEs to the route generation application. Another criterium may be adapting to provide a percentage distribution among alternative different routes. As an example, the route generation application analyzes rate sheets in the context of data about routes already on record. Specifically, four different sets of rate sheets may be analyzed depending on the context: an intra-state/intra-major trading area (MTA) rate sheet; an intra-state/inter-MTA rate sheet; an inter-state/intra-MTA rate sheet, and an inter-state/inter-MTA rate sheet.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">As circumstances change, the route generation application may generate new prioritized route transactions and send them to the CRF. In practice, the route generation application periodically provides an extensive list of new prioritized route transactions as a batch to the CRF. The CRF then processes these prioritized route transactions to generate prioritized call route lists in a readily searchable format. For example, the CRF may generate the prioritized call route lists from the prioritized route transactions as a relational database, as a table, as a flat file, or as a different searchable data structure. When a NE needing to route a call to a domestic number sends a query to the CRF with an indication of a location of a call originator and a destination number, the CRF uses the indication of the location of the call originator and the destination number to determine a call type of the call. The call type may be an intra-state/intra-MTA type call, an intra-state/inter-MTA type call, an inter-state/intra-MTA type call, or an inter-state/Inter-MTA type call. The CRF then uses the call type and the destination number to index into the prioritized call route lists, selects one prioritized call route list, and returns up to 6 different routes in prioritized order.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Communication networks change frequently. Loads on specific call routes increase or decrease suddenly. Changes can flow from a myriad of different causes which often are not predictable. Changes may flow from seasonal changes, such as schools or colleges being in session or not being in session. Changes may flow from opening of businesses or closing of businesses. Changes may flow from launching construction projects. Changes may flow from an accident or a natural disaster such as a tornado, hurricane, forest fire, or flood. Because the route generation application and the CRF update periodically, for example once per day, once every two days, once per week, the network effectively adapts to use preferred call routes as network conditions change. For example, if a given call route experiences load increases, for example because of the opening of a new corporate headquarters or the opening of a new distribution center, one or more of the KPI values associated with that call route may degrade. The route generation application and the CRF, working collaboratively, may change the prioritized route lists including that degraded call route (e.g., moving it lower in the priority order or dropping the degraded call route entirely from one or more prioritized route lists), and the end result is that the network operates better, more efficiently, and provides a higher quality of service to customers. It is observed that such changes in loads on call routes happen commonly and are difficult to predict in advance. In the case of the route generation application and the CRF there is no need to predict call route changes in advance, the system automatically adapts based on current KPI values relatively quickly, for example within one day, within two days, within a week, or some other relatively short period of time. Said in other words, the collaboration of the route generation application and the CRF taught herein constitutes a distributed computing solution or information technology (IT) solution that evolves the way call routing is performed: this system provides a refined IT solution for developing and delivering call routes as prioritized lists of call routes to NEs. This IT solution improves network efficiency and makes the NEs more responsive to network changes.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The CRF is not in the call path (e.g., not in the bearer traffic path) which enhances both efficiency and likely reliability of the network. This, however, introduces the challenge of how to access KPIs to improve prioritized route analysis. This is provided by relying upon a feed from monitoring NEs that are present in the call path. This allows the determination of domestic least cost routing additionally based on KPIs.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an embodiment, the CRF has been adopted to support percentage allocation of routes. Formerly, if it was desired (e.g., business agreement) to route 50% of routes in a country via carrier A and 50% of routes in the same country via carrier B, this would be accomplished by alternating a route list that lists carrier A first, carrier B second, and overflow carriers after this on a given query from a NE. In the next query (which maps to the same country) the route list provided would list carrier B first, carrier A second, and overflow carriers after this on the query from a NE. In an embodiment, the first query would include carrier A first and then overflow carriers after (carrier B is not identified), and in a second query the response to the query would include carrier B first and then the overflow carriers after (carrier A is not identified). It is understood that different percentage allocations can be supported by the CRF. Percentage allocation is described further below with reference to international routes, but the same processing is applicable to the handling of domestic long-distance calls.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The present disclosure also teaches a system for identifying and delivering prioritized lists of alternative call routes to complete an international call in a communication system. A network element (NE) may request a central routing function (CRF) to provide a list of call routes for completing a call from a call originator to a call destination such as to a user equipment (UE), to a content server, or to an application server. In some cases, the originator may be the NE requesting the call routes (e.g., the NE may be seeking a route from it to a designated terminator). In other cases the originator may not be the NE but may be a UE or a computer. In some cases, the call destination may be a communication service carrier who will receive the call from the NE and deliver it to an end-point UE or to yet another communication service carrier. In other cases the call destination may not be the next communication service carrier but may be a UE or a computer.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In many instances the call can be completed via a number of alternative different call routes or call paths, and the challenge is providing a relatively short list of alternative call routes that optimize the call according to one or more operational parameters. The NE initially attempts to complete the call with the highest priority call route. If the first call route attempted fails, the NE next attempts to complete the call with the second highest priority call route. If the second call route attempted fails, the NE next attempts to complete the call with the third highest priority call route, and so on until the call is completed or the list of alternative routes are exhausted. A call route can be understood to be a communication path or communication link that may pass from an origination device to a termination device via a plurality of intermediate nodes. Different call routes comprise one or more different intermediate nodes. Hereinafter call routes may be referred to as routes to be more concise.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">One of the operational parameters considered in determining a prioritized list of routes may be costs of the different available routes, whereby to prioritize routes, at least in part, based on a least cost routing criteria. A route generation application executing on a computer can analyze rate sheets provided by communication service carriers who support the routes in the context of data about routes already on record. This data on record defines each route as a sequence of nodes to establish communication coupling between the originator and the terminator and optionally comprises information about those nodes or links between the nodes. For each of a plurality of different calls (e.g., communication coupling from originator to terminator), a cost for each of the available routes to complete the call is determined by the route generation application and used to prioritize the list of alternative routes for that call. The route generation application stores each of the routes in a route list for a given call in priority order. For example, if a call is a communication path between a point A and a point B, the route list for this call may comprise a first entry which is the highest priority route from point A to point B, a second entry which is the second highest priority route from point A to point B, a third entry which is the third highest priority from point A to point B, etc.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an embodiment, the route generation application may restrict each route list to a maximum of 6 routes. In another embodiment, the route generation application may restrict each route list to a maximum of fewer than 6 routes or to a maximum that is greater than 6 routes. In an embodiment, the route generation application may restrict each route list to a maximum of 20 routes, a maximum of 18 routes, a maximum of 15 routes, a maximum of 12 routes, a maximum of 10 routes, or some other maximum value. Different network elements are able to handle different numbers of routes in a route list, and the maximum number of routes in a prioritized route list may be determined based on surveying the capabilities of the network elements that request route lists from the CRF. The route generation application may be said to restrict each route list to a predefined maximum number of routes. If there are more than the maximum number of routes available for a given call, the route generation application includes only the maximum number of routes in the route list for that call and the remaining routes are not included in the route list. If there are fewer routes available for a given call, the route generation application may include all of the available routes in the route list in prioritized order.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The route generation application builds route lists for each of the different calls that it knows to exist. The route generation application may build the route lists periodically, such as once per day, once per week, or on some other time interval. The route generation application may build the route lists on command. Because the rate sheets provided by communication service carriers change over time, the prioritization of routes may change. Likewise, the routes that different carriers support may change. These changes can result in the route generation application building different prioritized routes for at least some of the different calls.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the route generation application has built the route lists, it may propagate or send the new route lists to the CRF, for example in the form of a batch file. In some circumstances, the route generation application may compare the route lists it creates to a set of route lists previously configured into the CRF, determine what route lists have changed, and send a reduced set of route lists representing only the change&#x2014;a so-called delta of route lists&#x2014;to the CRF. The CRF processes the route lists received from the route generation application and configures these route lists into one or more data tables that the CRF uses to provide routes in response to route requests.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">When an NE needs to route a call, the NE sends a query to the CRF with information about the call. This information comprises a phone number of the destination device, for example an international telephone number of a terminating device. The CRF uses the phone number to index into the prioritized call routes lists defined by the route generation application and returns a prioritized call route list to the requesting NE.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Part of the challenge for the route generation application analyzing least cost routes for international calls is that there are often different rating approaches used by different international communication service carriers. For example, a first international carrier applies different rates for calls it carries or routes within Canada for different cities. A second international carrier uses a uniform rate across all of Canada. A third international carrier uses an intermediate granularity rate, for example different rates in different provinces of Canada. Different sets of communication service carriers may provide service in different countries. Example international communication service carriers comprise Belgacom International Carrier Services (BICS), Business Telecommunication Services (BTS), Deutsche Telecom, i-Basis, Identidad, Last Mile, Telcel, TalkTel, TATA, and Telecom Malaysia.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an embodiment, the route generation application optimizes based on both costs and based on key performance indicators (KPIs) that have been determined for the different routes. Thus, the route generation application can prioritize the routes in a route list associated with a given call based on the costs of the different possible routes but also based on the KPIs associated with these different possible routes. As an example, a minutes-of-use KPI may be tracked by international communication service carriers per period of time (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, or some other interval of time) and provided to the route generation application. The route generation application may analyze the minutes-of-use KPI data provided by carriers in combination with rate sheets provided by the carriers to jointly optimize a cost criteria and a minutes-of-use criteria. For example, an international communication service carrier may reach an agreement to support a guaranteed minutes-of-use per month with the operator of the CRF. The route generation application may build prioritized call route lists balancing both considerations of costs of the routes and minutes-of-use KPIs. For example, if an evaluation period is half complete but less than half the guaranteed minutes-of-use per period have been accumulated by the carrier, the route generation application may move the routes associated with the subject carrier higher in the prioritized call route lists than otherwise to increase the minutes-of-use tallied by the subject carrier. Contrariwise, if the evaluation period is half complete but three-quarters of the guaranteed minutes-of-use per period have been accumulated for the carrier, the route generation application may move the routes associated with the subject carrier lower in the prioritized call route lists than otherwise. In a like manner, other KPIs may be balanced with each other and with cost considerations.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In an embodiment, a carrier whose guaranteed minutes-of-use have not yet been delivered during the in-progress evaluation period may be placed in the highest priority position in the route lists for calls it is able to support. After the guaranteed minutes-of-use have been delivered for the in-progress evaluation period, the route generation application may discontinue consideration of that carrier's minutes-of-use KPI for the remainder of the evaluation period.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an embodiment, international numbers routed by network elements may take different formats. For example, an international number may be an 11-digit number, a 12-digit number, a 13-digit number, a 14-digit number, or a 15-digit number. Sometimes different format numbers may associate to the same international dial code. In the past, the CRF may have had functionally duplicative entries in its provisioning tables to support routing calls to the same end destination (e.g., same dial code) for different length digit strings. This is inefficient in that it consumes extra memory space to contain the associated data entries and in that it may take more processing steps to associate the dialed number to the international dial code.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an embodiment, the CRF extends table key values, which are dial codes that associate to dialed number values, in its route list lookup table to have 15 characters, for example by adding one or more characters to extend the dial codes to 15 characters. In an embodiment, the dial codes are ASCII characters, and digit strings less than 15 digits have one or more instances of ASCII &#x2018;A&#x2019; suffixed to pad out the dialed number digit string to 15 characters. When the CRF receives a request from an NE with an international number having less than 15 digits, the CRF first suffixes one or more &#x2018;0&#x2019; values to extend the dialed number to 15 digits. Then the CRF uses the 15-digit extended dialed number to look up a route list in the route list lookup table based on the 15-digit string, thereby avoiding supplying alternative length digit strings in its provisioning tables. This innovation provides a particular technical solution to the technical problem of mapping alternative length international phone numbers to a prioritized list of routes.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The prioritized route generation system described above can be used in wholesale routing as well. For example, when the route generation application and the CRF are operated by a first communication service carrier, an NE controlled or operated by a second communication service carrier can request a session border controller (SBC) controlled or operated by the first communication service carrier to route the call on a wholesale basis. In some contexts, the second communication service carrier may be referred to as an external customer of the first communication service carrier. These wholesale calls may be domestic long-distance calls, international calls, or toll-free calls. The SBC may receive a request to route a call on an untrusted side of the SBC from a second communication service provider, where the request comprises the destination telephone number and optionally a location of the call originator. The SBC may provide the untrusted access to the second communication service provider via a first application programming interface (API) that restricts the access to services of the SBC available through the first API. The SBC may communicate with the CRF via a trusted side via a second API. The CRF looks up a prioritized route list, as briefly described further above and in more detail hereinafter, and returns the prioritized route list to the SBC. The SBC routes the call based on the prioritized route list via the untrusted side of the SBC. Routing the call of the second communication service provider via the untrusted side of the SBC can allow the SBC to protect the network infrastructure from the second communication service provider.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an embodiment, the request for call routing from the second communication service provider may be sent to an SBC that operates in an ingress SBC capacity, indicating the call enters the network of the first communication service provider at this point. The ingress SBC, in response to receiving the prioritized call route list from the CRF, may send the call to an egress SBC to route the call on out of the network of the first communication service carrier. The egress SBC operates in an egress capacity, indicating the call leaves the network of the first communication service provider at this point.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">In an embodiment, the second communication service provider may subscribe to different types of wholesale call routing services provided by the first communication service provider. For example, the subscription may support international call routing service, domestic long-distance call routing service, toll-free call routing service, international call routing and domestic long-distance call routing service, international call routing and toll-free routing service, domestic long-distance call routing and toll-free call routing, or international call routing, domestic long-distance call routing, and toll-free call routing service. When the CRF receives a request for a whole sale call route from the SBC, the SBC provides an identity of the second communication service provider. The CRF checks the subscription service available to the second communication service provider before completing the prioritized route list lookup. When a toll-free call is involved, the CRF does an access to a service management system (SMS) (e.g., does a &#x201c;dip&#x201d; into the SMS) to obtain an identification of a carrier associated with the toll-free number. The CRF chooses a prioritized route list for the toll-free call based at least in part on the identification of the carrier associated with the toll-free number. The identity of the carrier associated with the toll-free number may be a carrier identification code (a &#x201c;CIC&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a communication system <b>100</b> is described.

In an embodiment, the predefined maximum may be 7 call routes, 8 call routes, 9 call routes, 10 call routes, 11 call routes, 12 call routes, 13 call routes, 14 call routes, or 15 call routes. In an embodiment, a call route specifies a uniform resource locator (URL) designating another network element to which the NE <b>130</b> routes the call. In an embodiment, a call route specifies a URL designating a carrier (e.g., an international carrier). In some contexts, the URL designating the network element may be said to associate to an international communication service carrier that operates the network element. In an embodiment, a call route specifies a FQDN.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The rate sheets <b>108</b> may be provided by communication service carriers and identify tolls they apply for routing calls via their network infrastructure or network infrastructure that they pay for. The rate sheets <b>108</b> may identify tolls for international calls. The rate sheets <b>108</b> may identify tolls for domestic calls. It is observed that different communication carriers may structure their rate sheets differently. For example, a first international communication carrier may designate a single rate that applies to routing any call to a specific country, a second international communication carrier may designate different rates for a plurality of different provinces or states of the specific country, and a third international communication carrier may designate different rates for each of a plurality of different cities in the specific country. The communication carriers may send updated rate sheets <b>108</b> to the route generation application <b>102</b> (or make different rate sheets available at a data store accessible by the route generation application <b>102</b>) from time to time. Different communication carriers may update their respective rate sheets <b>108</b> at different times and in an uncoordinated fashion.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">The KPIs <b>110</b> may be collected by the communication service carrier that operates the CRF <b>120</b> and stored in a data store. The KPIs <b>110</b> may be updated periodically to reflect latest conditions in the different network infrastructures, for example hourly, twice daily, daily, weekly, or on some other time interval. The KPIs <b>110</b> may comprise a minutes of usage accumulated during a current reporting or evaluation time period. The minutes of usage KPI <b>110</b> may record minutes of usage delivered by a communication service carrier based on traffic directed to that carrier by the CRF <b>120</b>. In an embodiment, the minutes of usage may be determined based on the signaling between the communication service carrier that operates the CRF <b>120</b> and the communication service carrier (e.g., the target carrier) that requests the prioritized call route list from the CRF <b>120</b>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, the time between a &#x201c;200&#x201d; SIP OK response to a SIP invite sent by the target carrier and a &#x201c;BYE&#x201d; SIP message received from or sent to the target carrier may be used to calculate the minutes of usage of a given call, and these minutes of usage accumulated for all calls associated with that target carrier to determine the total minutes of usage per evaluation time period. In an embodiment, an international SBC operated by the communication service carrier that operates the CRF <b>120</b> may monitor the SIP messages and provide minutes of usage KPI data. The KPIs <b>110</b> may comprise information about post-dial delay. The KPIs <b>110</b> may comprise information about average route advances (e.g., SIP <b>503</b> response). The KPIs <b>110</b> may comprise information about average duration of call. The KPIs <b>110</b> may comprise average mean opinion score (average MOS). The KPIs <b>110</b> may comprise average killed calls (SIP <b>603</b> response). The KPIs <b>110</b> may comprise average successful calls (SIP <b>200</b> response). The KPIs <b>110</b> may comprise quality of service (QoS) reporting information.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">The overrides may specify certain conditions that apply for determining prioritization of specific call routes that vary from the least cost routing criteria and/or from the optimizing of KPIs. For example, a first override may exclude a carrier from routing for a specific call route. A second override may designate that a carrier is given precedence over the least cost routing criteria for a specific route. A third override may designate that a carrier is subordinated to the precedence of the least cost routing criteria for a specific route. A fourth override may designate that a carrier is included as the last route (e.g., lowest priority route) in a route list for a specific route.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The route generation application <b>102</b> may execute and build call route transactions <b>106</b> once per day, once per week, once per month, or on some other periodic basis. The route generation application <b>102</b> re-executes because its determination of prioritization changes based on changes in the rate sheets <b>108</b>, changes in the KPIs <b>110</b>, and/or changes in the overrides <b>112</b>. In an embodiment, the route generation application <b>102</b> reviews the transaction acknowledgements <b>124</b> stored in the data store <b>126</b> and adapts its generation of call route transactions <b>106</b> accordingly. It will be appreciated that the route generation application <b>102</b> may execute relatively often whereby to keep the prioritization of route lists maintained by the CRF <b>120</b> closely aligned with changing rate sheets <b>108</b>, changing KPIs <b>110</b>, and changing overrides <b>112</b>. For example, in an embodiment, the route generation application <b>102</b> may execute daily or weekly.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">When the CRF <b>120</b> builds the prioritized call route lists stored in the data store <b>122</b> it may establish the primary key or index of each international route list by a 15-digit phone number (e.g., a dial code) that designates a range of 15-digit phone numbers. For example, a 15-digit phone number &#x2018;123456789100000&#x2019; may designate a range of 100,000 different 15-digit phone numbers from &#x2018;123456789100000&#x2019; to &#x2018;123456789199999.&#x2019; For example, a 15-digit phone number &#x2018;123456789120000&#x2019; may designate a range of 10,000 different 15-digit phone numbers from &#x2018;123456789120000&#x2019; to &#x2018;123456789129999.&#x2019;</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In an embodiment, the dial codes are represented as 15-character ASCII values. When a dial code has less than 15 digits, the dial code (e.g., the primary key of the route lists table) is extended by suffixing the ASCII character &#x201c;A&#x201d; (e.g., the character associated with the hexadecimal value 41) one or more times to the dial code. In an embodiment, any ASCII printable character that is greater than &#x2018;9&#x2019; (e.g., the character associated with the hexadecimal value 39 in the ASCII encoding system) may be used for suffixing the dial code to extend it to 15 ASCII characters.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the CRF <b>120</b> receives a request from a NE <b>130</b> to provide a prioritized list of routes including an international phone number, if the international phone number comprises less than 15 digits, the CRF <b>120</b> extends the dialed number with zeros to make the extended dialed phone number 15 digits. The CRF <b>120</b> uses the padded out 15-digit dialed number to index into the call routes data store <b>122</b> to obtain the prioritized list of routes associated with that padded-out 15-digit number. This involves finding the dial code primary key that associates to the dialed number (e.g., the dialed number falls into the range of values associated with the dial code primary key). The CRF <b>120</b> retrieves the prioritized list of routes associated with this dial code. In an embodiment, finding or looking up the prioritized international route list comprises finding an international telephone number in a non-transitory memory of the CRF <b>120</b> or in the data store <b>122</b> that has a range that covers the international telephone number provided in the request from the network element.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">The CRF <b>120</b> then returns the prioritized list of routes to the requesting NE <b>130</b>. The NE <b>130</b> then completes the call it is placing by attempting to complete the call using the highest priority route in the received route list. If this route fails, the NE <b>130</b> attempts to complete the call using the second highest priority route in the received route list. If the second highest priority route fails, the NE <b>130</b> attempts to complete the call using the third highest priority route in the received route list, and so on.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In an embodiment, the CRF <b>120</b> provides support for a percentage allocation of call routes when responding to requests for prioritized call route lists from the NEs <b>130</b>. The percentage allocation can designate a distribution of calls among international communication service carriers. For example, a percentage distribution may designate that 50% of international calls directed to a first call route be routed to a first communication service carrier and 50% of international calls directed to the first call route be routed to a second communication service carrier. Over time, the CRF <b>120</b> would provide prioritized call route lists to requesting NEs <b>130</b> specifying the first call route such that the distribution of calls between the first and second carrier on this first call route approach 50% each. Alternatively, if the percentage allocation stipulates 65% of international calls directed to a second call route be routed to the first communication service carrier and 35% of international calls directed to the second call route be routed to the second communication service carrier, over time the CRF <b>120</b> would provide prioritized call route lists to requesting NEs <b>130</b> specifying the second all route such that the distribution of calls between the first and second carrier on this second call route approach 65% and 35% respectively.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In an embodiment, the CRF <b>120</b> supports percentage allocation of call routes by providing a prioritized call route list that expunges one of the routes supported by a communication service carrier designated in a percentage allocation stipulation. Expunging a route from a call route list may be referred to as curtailing the call route list in some contexts. For example, in about half of the requests from NEs <b>130</b> for a prioritized call route for the first call route, the first communication service carrier is expunged and only the second communication service carrier is presented in highest priority position, and in the remaining half of the requests from NEs <b>130</b> for a prioritized call route for the first call route, the second communication service carrier is expunged and only the first communication service carrier is presented in the highest priority position. In both these types of prioritized call route responses, there may be additional call routes associated with communication service carriers other than the first and second communication service carriers. It is understood that the CRF <b>120</b> may comprise a plurality of separate computers that execute software to provide the central routing function. Additionally, a single computer may execute a plurality of different instances of the central routing function, for example on different processors and/or different cores of the computer. In an embodiment, the percentage allocation operation is performed by each computer and/or each instance of the central routing function independently and without coordinating with other instances or other computers. The percentage allocation, hence, may not be maintained if analyzed over a short duration of time, but the percentage allocation is approached in a converging fashion over time.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">The percentage allocation may be applied to the first (e.g., highest priority) route in the route list. Alternatively, the percentage allocation may be applied to the second priority route in the route list or the third priority route in the route list or the fourth priority route in the route list. This may be accomplished by associating a priority with each route in the route list. If a route is associated with a 100% percentage, then that route is fixed in its priority position in the route list. For example, if a route list comprises five routes listed in the order {route A, 100%}, {route B, 60%}, {route C, 40%}, {route D, 100%}, {route E, 100%}, then route A will always be the first priority route, route D will always be the third priority route, and route E will always be the fourth priority route. The second priority route will be route B 60% of the time and route C 40% of the time. As another example, if a route list comprises fix routes listed in the order {route A, 100%}, {route B, 100%}, {route C, 25%}, {route D, 50%}, {route E, 25%}, {route F, 100%}, then route A will always be the first priority route, route B will always be the second priority route, and route F will always be the fourth priority route. The third priority route will be route C 25% of the time, route D 50% of the time, and route E 25% of the time. For further details on international call routing see U.S. patent application Ser.

In an embodiment, the call of the UE <b>132</b> routed by the NE <b>130</b> may be a domestic long-distance telephone call, for example a call from a first UE <b>132</b> located within the United States to a second UE <b>132</b> located within the United States via communication network infrastructure located within the United States. Some of the functionality described above with reference to the route generation application <b>102</b> and the CRF <b>120</b> remain applicable here, but there are additional extended functionality that may be better explained in the context of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In an embodiment, the rate sheets <b>108</b> further comprises intra-state/intra-major trading area (MTA) rate sheets <b>108</b><i>a</i>, intra-state/inter-MTA rate sheets <b>108</b><i>b</i>, inter-state/intra-MTA rate sheets <b>108</b><i>c</i>, and inter-state/inter-MTA rate sheets <b>108</b><i>d</i>. These rate sheets <b>108</b> may be provided by different communication service carriers to describe what rates they will charge to carry calls to a given destination telephone number depending on whether the call is intra-state (a call from a call originator to a call destination both located in the same state) or inter-state (a call from a call originator to a call destination located in different states) and whether the call is intra-MTA (a call from a call originator to a call destination located in the same MTA) or inter-MTA (a call from a call originator to a call destination located in different MTAs). The route generation application <b>102</b> may build call route transactions <b>106</b> for domestic long-distance calls based in part on these rate sheets <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b</i>, <b>108</b><i>c</i>, <b>108</b><i>d </i>as well as based in part on other criteria. For example, the route generation application <b>102</b> may develop prioritized route list transactions <b>106</b> further based on KPIs received from NEs <b>130</b>. These call route transactions <b>106</b> may be processed by the CRF <b>120</b> as described above to build prioritized call route lists <b>140</b>. In an embodiment, the call route lists <b>140</b> are grouped together. In another embodiment, the call route lists <b>140</b> for domestic long-distance calls are stored in a first call route list <b>140</b><i>a </i>for intra-state/intra-MTA calls, in a second call route list <b>140</b><i>b </i>for intra-state/inter-MTA calls, in a third call route list <b>140</b><i>c </i>for inter-state/intra-MTA calls, and in a fourth call route list <b>140</b><i>d </i>for inter-state/inter-MTA calls.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">When a NE <b>130</b> is seeking to route a domestic call from a call originator to a destination number, the NE <b>130</b> sends a request for a prioritized call route list including an indication of the location of the call originator and the destination number to the CRF <b>120</b>. In an embodiment, the CRF <b>120</b> analyzes the call based on the indication of the location of the call originator and the destination number to determine if the call is an intra-state/intra-MTA call, an intra-state/inter-MTA call, an inter-state/intra-MTA call, or an inter-state/inter-MTA call and then uses the destination number to index into the appropriate one of the four route lists <b>140</b><i>a</i>, <b>140</b><i>b</i>, <b>140</b><i>c</i>, <b>140</b><i>d</i>. In another embodiment, the route lists <b>140</b> are not segregated into intra-state/intra-MTA call routes, intra-state/inter-MTA call routes, inter-state/intra-MTA call routes, and inter-state/inter-MTA call routes, and the CRF <b>120</b> uses both the origination number and the destination number to index into the undifferentiated store of route lists <b>140</b>. The indication of the location of the call originator may be provided based on a location of a cell site which is providing a wireless communication link to a telephone that acts as the call originator.

In an embodiment, the call of the UE <b>132</b> routed by the NE <b>130</b> may be a wholesale type of call. For example, a second communication service provider may operate a second network <b>115</b><i>a </i>and a UE <b>132</b><i>a </i>may place a call via NEs <b>130</b><i>a </i>controlled and/or operated by the second service provider. The second network <b>115</b><i>a</i>, UEs <b>132</b><i>a</i>, and NEs <b>130</b><i>a </i>may be referred to as a second communication service carrier domain. The NEs <b>130</b><i>a </i>may comprise a gateway. The NEs <b>130</b><i>a </i>may comprise a router. The NEs <b>130</b><i>a </i>may comprise an SBC. The NEs <b>130</b><i>a </i>may comprise a BGCF. The NEs <b>130</b><i>a </i>may comprise a MGCF. The second communication service provider (e.g., external customer) may request a first communication service carrier who operates the network <b>114</b> to route the call for them. In this case, the NE <b>130</b><i>a </i>may send a request to route to a session border controller <b>133</b> controlled by and/or operated by the first communication service carrier.

The CRF returns the prioritized route list to the SBC <b>133</b>. The SBC <b>133</b> that received the request to route from the NE <b>130</b><i>a </i>in the external customer network <b>115</b><i>a </i>may then route the call on to a destination and carry that bearer traffic (e.g., the SBC <b>133</b> remains in the call path). In an embodiment, the call routes comprise FQDNs, the SBC <b>133</b> requests a domain name service (DNS) server (not shown) to return an Internet protocol (IP) address corresponding to the FQDNs, and the SBC <b>133</b> uses the returned IP or IPs to route the call out of the first communication service provider's domain and on to the destination telephone number.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In another circumstance, the SBC <b>133</b> that receives the request from the NE <b>130</b><i>a </i>may provide an ingress functionality only.

The access nodes <b>554</b> may be said to establish an access network <b>556</b>. The access network <b>556</b> may be referred to as a radio access network (RAN) in some contexts.

In 4G technology (e.g., long term evolution (LTE) technology) an access node <b>554</b> may be referred to as an evolved Node B (eNB).

It is understood that the access network <b>556</b> may include any number of access nodes <b>554</b>. Further, each access node <b>554</b> could be coupled with a core network <b>558</b> that provides connectivity with various application servers <b>559</b> and/or a network <b>560</b>. In an embodiment, at least some of the application servers <b>559</b> may be located close to the network edge (e.g., geographically close to the UE <b>552</b> and the end user) to deliver so-called &#x201c;edge computing.&#x201d; The network <b>560</b> may be one or more private networks, one or more public networks, or a combination thereof. The network <b>560</b> may comprise the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The network <b>560</b> may comprise the Internet. With this arrangement, a UE <b>552</b> within coverage of the access network <b>556</b> could engage in air-interface communication with an access node <b>554</b> and could thereby communicate via the access node <b>554</b> with various application servers and other entities.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The communication system <b>550</b> could operate in accordance with a particular radio access technology (RAT), with communications from an access node <b>554</b> to UEs <b>552</b> defining a downlink or forward link and communications from the UEs <b>552</b> to the access node <b>554</b> defining an uplink or reverse link. Over the years, the industry has developed various generations of RATs, in a continuous effort to increase available data rate and quality of service for end users. These generations have ranged from &#x201c;1G,&#x201d; which used simple analog frequency modulation to facilitate basic voice-call service, to &#x201c;4G&#x201d;&#x2014;such as Long Term Evolution (LTE), which now facilitates mobile broadband service using technologies such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and multiple input multiple output (MIMO).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">Recently, the industry has been exploring developments in &#x201c;5G&#x201d; and particularly &#x201c;5G NR&#x201d; (5G New Radio), which may use a scalable OFDM air interface, advanced channel coding, massive MIMO, beamforming, mobile mmWave (e.g., frequency bands above 24 GHz), and/or other features, to support higher data rates and countless applications, such as mission-critical services, enhanced mobile broadband, and massive Internet of Things (IoT). 5G is hoped to provide virtually unlimited bandwidth on demand, for example providing access on demand to as much as 20 gigabits per second (Gbps) downlink data throughput and as much as 10 Gbps uplink data throughput. Due to the increased bandwidth associated with 5G, it is expected that the new networks will serve, in addition to conventional cell phones, general internet service providers for laptops and desktop computers, competing with existing ISPs such as cable internet, and also will make possible new applications in internet of things (IoT) and machine to machine areas.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In accordance with the RAT, each access node <b>554</b> could provide service on one or more radio-frequency (RF) carriers, each of which could be frequency division duplex (FDD), with separate frequency channels for downlink and uplink communication, or time division duplex (TDD), with a single frequency channel multiplexed over time between downlink and uplink use. Each such frequency channel could be defined as a specific range of frequency (e.g., in radio-frequency (RF) spectrum) having a bandwidth and a center frequency and thus extending from a low-end frequency to a high-end frequency. Further, on the downlink and uplink channels, the coverage of each access node <b>554</b> could define an air interface configured in a specific manner to define physical resources for carrying information wirelessly between the access node <b>554</b> and UEs <b>552</b>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Without limitation, for instance, the air interface could be divided over time into frames, subframes, and symbol time segments, and over frequency into subcarriers that could be modulated to carry data. The example air interface could thus define an array of time-frequency resource elements each being at a respective symbol time segment and subcarrier, and the subcarrier of each resource element could be modulated to carry data. Further, in each subframe or other transmission time interval (TTI), the resource elements on the downlink and uplink could be grouped to define physical resource blocks (PRBs) that the access node could allocate as needed to carry data between the access node and served UEs <b>552</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">In addition, certain resource elements on the example air interface could be reserved for special purposes. For instance, on the downlink, certain resource elements could be reserved to carry synchronization signals that UEs <b>552</b> could detect as an indication of the presence of coverage and to establish frame timing, other resource elements could be reserved to carry a reference signal that UEs <b>552</b> could measure in order to determine coverage strength, and still other resource elements could be reserved to carry other control signaling such as PRB-scheduling directives and acknowledgement messaging from the access node <b>554</b> to served UEs <b>552</b>. And on the uplink, certain resource elements could be reserved to carry random access signaling from UEs <b>552</b> to the access node <b>554</b>, and other resource elements could be reserved to carry other control signaling such as PRB-scheduling requests and acknowledgement signaling from UEs <b>552</b> to the access node <b>554</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The access node <b>554</b>, in some instances, may be split functionally into a radio unit (RU), a distributed unit (DU), and a central unit (CU) where each of the RU, DU, and CU have distinctive roles to play in the access network <b>556</b>. The RU provides radio functions. The DU provides L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> real-time scheduling functions; and the CU provides higher L<b>2</b> and L<b>3</b> non-real time scheduling. This split supports flexibility in deploying the DU and CU. The CU may be hosted in a regional cloud data center.

In an embodiment, the core network <b>558</b> is a 5G core network. 5G core network technology is based on a service based architecture paradigm. Rather than constructing the 5G core network as a series of special purpose communication nodes (e.g., an HSS node, a MME node, etc.) running on dedicated server computers, the 5G core network is provided as a set of services or network functions. These services or network functions can be executed on virtual servers in a cloud computing environment which supports dynamic scaling and avoidance of long-term capital expenditures (fees for use may substitute for capital expenditures). These network functions can include, for example, a user plane function (UPF) <b>579</b>, an authentication server function (AUSF) <b>575</b>, an access and mobility management function (AMF) <b>576</b>, a session management function (SMF) <b>577</b>, a network exposure function (NEF) <b>570</b>, a network repository function (NRF) <b>571</b>, a policy control function (PCF) <b>572</b>, a unified data management (UDM) <b>573</b>, a network slice selection function (NSSF) <b>574</b>, and other network functions. The network functions may be referred to as virtual network functions (VNFs) in some contexts.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Network functions may be formed by a combination of small pieces of software called microservices. Some microservices can be re-used in composing different network functions, thereby leveraging the utility of such microservices. Network functions may offer services to other network functions by extending application programming interfaces (APIs) to those other network functions that call their services via the APIs. The 5G core network <b>558</b> may be segregated into a user plane <b>580</b> and a control plane <b>582</b>, thereby promoting independent scalability, evolution, and flexible deployment.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The UPF <b>579</b> delivers packet processing and links the UE <b>552</b>, via the access network <b>556</b>, to a data network <b>590</b> (e.g., the network <b>560</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>). The AMF <b>576</b> handles registration and connection management of non-access stratum (NAS) signaling with the UE <b>552</b>. Said in other words, the AMF <b>576</b> manages UE registration and mobility issues. The AMF <b>576</b> manages reachability of the UEs <b>552</b> as well as various security issues. The SMF <b>577</b> handles session management issues. Specifically, the SMF <b>577</b> creates, updates, and removes (destroys) protocol data unit (PDU) sessions and manages the session context within the UPF <b>579</b>. The SMF <b>577</b> decouples other control plane functions from user plane functions by performing dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) functions and IP address management functions. The AUSF <b>575</b> facilitates security processes.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The NEF <b>570</b> securely exposes the services and capabilities provided by network functions. The NRF <b>571</b> supports service registration by network functions and discovery of network functions by other network functions. The PCF <b>572</b> supports policy control decisions and flow based charging control. The UDM <b>573</b> manages network user data and can be paired with a user data repository (UDR) that stores user data such as customer profile information, customer authentication number, and encryption keys for the information. An application function <b>592</b>, which may be located outside of the core network <b>558</b>, exposes the application layer for interacting with the core network <b>558</b>. In an embodiment, the application function <b>592</b> may be execute on an application server <b>559</b> located geographically proximate to the UE <b>552</b> in an &#x201c;edge computing&#x201d; deployment mode. The core network <b>558</b> can provide a network slice to a subscriber, for example an enterprise customer, that is composed of a plurality of 5G network functions that are configured to provide customized communication service for that subscriber, for example to provide communication service in accordance with communication policies defined by the customer. The NSSF <b>574</b> can help the AMF <b>576</b> to select the network slice instance (NSI) for use with the UE <b>552</b>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a computer system <b>380</b> suitable for implementing one or more embodiments disclosed herein. The computer system <b>380</b> includes a processor <b>382</b> (which may be referred to as a central processor unit or CPU) that is in communication with memory devices including secondary storage <b>384</b>, read only memory (ROM) <b>386</b>, random access memory (RAM) <b>388</b>, input/output (I/O) devices <b>390</b>, and network connectivity devices <b>392</b>. The processor <b>382</b> may be implemented as one or more CPU chips.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">It is understood that by programming and/or loading executable instructions onto the computer system <b>380</b>, at least one of the CPU <b>382</b>, the RAM <b>388</b>, and the ROM <b>386</b> are changed, transforming the computer system <b>380</b> in part into a particular machine or apparatus having the novel functionality taught by the present disclosure. It is fundamental to the electrical engineering and software engineering arts that functionality that can be implemented by loading executable software into a computer can be converted to a hardware implementation by well-known design rules. Decisions between implementing a concept in software versus hardware typically hinge on considerations of stability of the design and numbers of units to be produced rather than any issues involved in translating from the software domain to the hardware domain. Generally, a design that is still subject to frequent change may be preferred to be implemented in software, because re-spinning a hardware implementation is more expensive than re-spinning a software design. Generally, a design that is stable that will be produced in large volume may be preferred to be implemented in hardware, for example in an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), because for large production runs the hardware implementation may be less expensive than the software implementation. Often a design may be developed and tested in a software form and later transformed, by well-known design rules, to an equivalent hardware implementation in an application specific integrated circuit that hardwires the instructions of the software. In the same manner as a machine controlled by a new ASIC is a particular machine or apparatus, likewise a computer that has been programmed and/or loaded with executable instructions may be viewed as a particular machine or apparatus.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">Additionally, after the system <b>380</b> is turned on or booted, the CPU <b>382</b> may execute a computer program or application. For example, the CPU <b>382</b> may execute software or firmware stored in the ROM <b>386</b> or stored in the RAM <b>388</b>. In some cases, on boot and/or when the application is initiated, the CPU <b>382</b> may copy the application or portions of the application from the secondary storage <b>384</b> to the RAM <b>388</b> or to memory space within the CPU <b>382</b> itself, and the CPU <b>382</b> may then execute instructions that the application is comprised of. In some cases, the CPU <b>382</b> may copy the application or portions of the application from memory accessed via the network connectivity devices <b>392</b> or via the I/O devices <b>390</b> to the RAM <b>388</b> or to memory space within the CPU <b>382</b>, and the CPU <b>382</b> may then execute instructions that the application is comprised of. During execution, an application may load instructions into the CPU <b>382</b>, for example load some of the instructions of the application into a cache of the CPU <b>382</b>. In some contexts, an application that is executed may be said to configure the CPU <b>382</b> to do something, e.g., to configure the CPU <b>382</b> to perform the function or functions promoted by the subject application. When the CPU <b>382</b> is configured in this way by the application, the CPU <b>382</b> becomes a specific purpose computer or a specific purpose machine.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">The secondary storage <b>384</b> is typically comprised of one or more disk drives or tape drives and is used for non-volatile storage of data and as an over-flow data storage device if RAM <b>388</b> is not large enough to hold all working data. Secondary storage <b>384</b> may be used to store programs which are loaded into RAM <b>388</b> when such programs are selected for execution. The ROM <b>386</b> is used to store instructions and perhaps data which are read during program execution. ROM <b>386</b> is a non-volatile memory device which typically has a small memory capacity relative to the larger memory capacity of secondary storage <b>384</b>. The RAM <b>388</b> is used to store volatile data and perhaps to store instructions. Access to both ROM <b>386</b> and RAM <b>388</b> is typically faster than to secondary storage <b>384</b>. The secondary storage <b>384</b>, the RAM <b>388</b>, and/or the ROM <b>386</b> may be referred to in some contexts as computer readable storage media and/or non-transitory computer readable media.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">I/O devices <b>390</b> may include printers, video monitors, liquid crystal displays (LCDs), touch screen displays, keyboards, keypads, switches, dials, mice, track balls, voice recognizers, card readers, paper tape readers, or other well-known input devices.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">The network connectivity devices <b>392</b> may take the form of modems, modem banks, Ethernet cards, universal serial bus (USB) interface cards, serial interfaces, token ring cards, fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) cards, wireless local area network (WLAN) cards, radio transceiver cards, and/or other well-known network devices. The network connectivity devices <b>392</b> may provide wired communication links and/or wireless communication links (e.g., a first network connectivity device <b>392</b> may provide a wired communication link and a second network connectivity device <b>392</b> may provide a wireless communication link). Wired communication links may be provided in accordance with Ethernet (IEEE 802.3), Internet protocol (IP), time division multiplex (TDM), data over cable service interface specification (DOCSIS), wavelength division multiplexing (WDM), and/or the like. In an embodiment, the radio transceiver cards may provide wireless communication links using protocols such as code division multiple access (CDMA), global system for mobile communications (GSM), long-term evolution (LTE), WiFi (IEEE 802.11), Bluetooth, Zigbee, narrowband Internet of things (NB IoT), near field communications (NFC), radio frequency identity (RFID). The radio transceiver cards may promote radio communications using 5G, 5G New Radio, or 5G LTE radio communication protocols. These network connectivity devices <b>392</b> may enable the processor <b>382</b> to communicate with the Internet or one or more intranets. With such a network connection, it is contemplated that the processor <b>382</b> might receive information from the network, or might output information to the network in the course of performing the above-described method steps. Such information, which is often represented as a sequence of instructions to be executed using processor <b>382</b>, may be received from and outputted to the network, for example, in the form of a computer data signal embodied in a carrier wave.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">Such information, which may include data or instructions to be executed using processor <b>382</b> for example, may be received from and outputted to the network, for example, in the form of a computer data baseband signal or signal embodied in a carrier wave. The baseband signal or signal embedded in the carrier wave, or other types of signals currently used or hereafter developed, may be generated according to several methods well-known to one skilled in the art. The baseband signal and/or signal embedded in the carrier wave may be referred to in some contexts as a transitory signal.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">The processor <b>382</b> executes instructions, codes, computer programs, scripts which it accesses from hard disk, floppy disk, optical disk (these various disk-based systems may all be considered secondary storage <b>384</b>), flash drive, ROM <b>386</b>, RAM <b>388</b>, or the network connectivity devices <b>392</b>. While only one processor <b>382</b> is shown, multiple processors may be present. Thus, while instructions may be discussed as executed by a processor, the instructions may be executed simultaneously, serially, or otherwise executed by one or multiple processors. Instructions, codes, computer programs, scripts, and/or data that may be accessed from the secondary storage <b>384</b>, for example, hard drives, floppy disks, optical disks, and/or other device, the ROM <b>386</b>, and/or the RAM <b>388</b> may be referred to in some contexts as non-transitory instructions and/or non-transitory information.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">In an embodiment, the computer system <b>380</b> may comprise two or more computers in communication with each other that collaborate to perform a task. For example, but not by way of limitation, an application may be partitioned in such a way as to permit concurrent and/or parallel processing of the instructions of the application. Alternatively, the data processed by the application may be partitioned in such a way as to permit concurrent and/or parallel processing of different portions of a data set by the two or more computers. In an embodiment, virtualization software may be employed by the computer system <b>380</b> to provide the functionality of a number of servers that is not directly bound to the number of computers in the computer system <b>380</b>. For example, virtualization software may provide twenty virtual servers on four physical computers.
