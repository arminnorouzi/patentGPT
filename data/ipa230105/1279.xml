In particular, the innovative device is able to ensure an extremely firm fixing of a vertical pole even in places where the support surfaces on the ceiling and the floor do not allow the perpendicularity of the equipment to be firmly maintained.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">As is well known, gym disciplines using vertical poles have developed considerably in recent years.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One example is pole dancing, i.e. a mixture of gym and pole dance. In particular, this discipline is performed using a vertical pole and the Chinese pole. Further examples are lap dance, calisthenics, flagman, etc., which also require a pole firmly fixed to the floor and ceiling. These disciplines are in fact based on the performance of acrobatic figures, which require considerable strength, fluency, coordination, agility, flexibility and endurance.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In particular, the evolution of these sporting activities sees practitioners engaged in increasingly complex evolutions that place ever greater demands on the equipment. Moreover, the spread of this sport has seen the development of competition circuits held both outdoors and in theatres and arenas.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The installation of the elements used in these sports (pole dance poles, lap dance poles, Chinese poles, etc.) requires the pole to be installed perfectly vertical. However, sometimes the inclination of the support surface does not allow the perpendicularity of the equipment to the base to be maintained (e.g. in domestic locations, gyms, Italian-style theatres), which causes problems with the rotation of the pole and the performance of the figures. Parallelism defects between floor and ceiling can also be found in private homes.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Systems can be provided to correct these misalignments of the pole, which are usually minimal. A well-known solution is that described in patent No. GB2446126B, which shows a rounded pin working in a rounded cavity. However, since the pole must be able to be both static and rotating, the friction generated in a connection such as the one described is not sufficient to guarantee that the pole, in the static mode, remains perfectly still due to the high stresses generated by the practitioners.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is therefore a need for a pole that overcomes the disadvantages of the vertical poles for gym exercises currently on the market, and in particular that is extremely stable in the various positions of use and for the purposes for which it is used.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The object of the invention is therefore to provide an innovative coupling device for a vertical pole for gym exercises, capable of keeping the pole firmly fixed to the ceiling and the floor even in places where the support surfaces do not allow the perpendicularity of the equipment to be firmly maintained.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The solution of the present invention allows to follow the inclination of the surfaces allowing the pole to remain perfectly vertical. In order to achieve this result, the pole includes a coupling device that prevents its rotation with respect to the base when the pole is used in static mode.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Furthermore, since the pole needs to be fixed between two coupling surfaces (typically to the floor and the ceiling) according to the present invention using also the thrust generated by the extension of the pole, there is also provided a system for lifting the pole itself, integrated in the base.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further preferred and/or particularly advantageous embodiments of the invention are described according to the features set forth in the dependent claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The invention will be described below by means of the following drawing plates, which are entirely illustrative and not limiting:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an overall view of the coupling device of a vertical pole for gym exercises, in a first embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an overall view of the coupling device of a vertical gym exercise pole, in a second embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a detail view of the coupling device of a vertical pole for gym exercises, in a third embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the coupling device of the vertical pole for gym exercises, in a fourth embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the coupling device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> according to a first example of use;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the pole coupling device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> according to a further example of use,</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a detail of the pole coupling device, provided with adjustable feet, according to the invention,</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a detail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, according to the invention,</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is an overall view of the coupling device, showing the threaded shaft of the vertical pole for gym exercises, according to the invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0023" num="0022">A coupling device <b>20</b> for a vertical gym pole which is the subject of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b></figref>.

The coupling device <b>20</b> comprises a hemispherical element <b>3</b> within which a shaft <b>5</b> connected to a vertical gym pole <b>8</b> is inserted.

In this embodiment, the hemispherical element <b>3</b> is made in one piece with the shaft <b>5</b> engaging in the vertical gym exercise pole. In this case the pole <b>8</b> is only static. Outside the hemispherical element <b>3</b> are a series of constraints called blocking elements <b>33</b> which, suitably positioned, prevent the rotation of the pole <b>8</b> around an axis X passing through the centre of the device <b>20</b>. The blocking elements <b>33</b> are, for example, a plurality of recesses made in the outer wall of the hemispherical element <b>3</b> and which engage with a second corresponding plurality of reliefs <b>34</b>, made on the inner surface of the seat <b>22</b> of the hemispherical element <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Advantageously, in an alternative configuration, the plurality of reliefs <b>34</b> may be positioned on an inner ring accommodated between the hemispherical element <b>3</b> and the seat <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to a second embodiment of the present invention, a coupling device <b>20</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The coupling device <b>20</b> comprises a hemispherical element <b>3</b>. The hemispherical element <b>3</b> is contained within a seat <b>22</b>, of the base <b>1</b>, which is also hemispherical. The hemispherical element <b>3</b> houses within it at least one bearing <b>4</b>, also of different types: thrust bearing, double crown, etc., in which a shaft <b>5</b> connected to a vertical pole <b>8</b> for gym exercises is inserted. In this case, the pole is only rotatable. On the outside of the hemispherical element <b>3</b> there are a series of constraints called blocking elements <b>33</b> which, suitably positioned, prevent the rotation of the pole <b>8</b> around an axis X passing through the centre of the device <b>20</b>. The blocking elements <b>33</b> are, for example, a plurality of recesses made in the outer wall of the hemispherical element <b>3</b> and which engage with a second corresponding plurality of reliefs <b>34</b>, made on the inner surface of the seat <b>22</b> of the hemispherical element <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to a third embodiment of the present invention, a coupling device <b>20</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The coupling device <b>20</b> comprises a hemispherical element <b>3</b>. The hemispherical element <b>3</b> is contained within a seat <b>22</b>, of the base <b>1</b>, which is also hemispherical. The hemispherical element <b>3</b> is a regular polygon, for example a hexagon, with a plurality of blocking elements <b>45</b> (six curved side faces in the case of the hexagon) configured to be selectively coupled to a plurality of corresponding flat walls <b>44</b> (six walls, in the case of the hexagonal-shaped embodiment). The flat walls <b>44</b> are made on the inner surface of the seat <b>22</b> of the hemispherical element <b>3</b> respectively to prevent the rotation of the pole <b>8</b> around an axis X passing through the centre of the device <b>20</b>, while leaving free the oscillatory movement of the pole <b>8</b> with respect to the same axis X.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, according to a fourth form of implementation, the coupling device <b>20</b> comprises a hemispherical element <b>3</b> housing at least one bearing <b>4</b>, also of different types: thrust bearing, double crown, etc., in which a shaft <b>5</b> connected to a vertical pole <b>8</b> for gym exercises is inserted. On the outside of the hemispherical element <b>3</b> there are a series of constraints called blocking elements <b>10</b> which, suitably positioned, prevent the rotation of the pole <b>8</b> about an axis X passing through the centre of the device <b>20</b>, while leaving free the oscillatory movement of the pole <b>8</b> with respect to the same axis X. The blocking elements <b>10</b> are, for example, a plurality of balls positioned within a first plurality of recesses <b>25</b> made in the outer wall of the hemispherical element <b>3</b> and engaging with a second corresponding plurality of recesses <b>26</b>, made on the inner surface of the seat <b>22</b> of the hemispherical element <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The hemispherical element <b>3</b> is housed inside a seat <b>22</b>, of the base <b>1</b>, which is also hemispherical and whose external wall can be threaded <b>2</b>, in order to be able to adjust the height and put the pressure on the pole <b>8</b>. Alternatively, the same purpose can be achieved by, for example, providing external feet connected to the base <b>1</b>, in which case the adjustment and pressurisation will have to be carried out in another manner.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Advantageously, base <b>1</b> can be fixed to the ceiling or floor by means of suitable fasteners or can simply be placed on top. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the pressure exerted by the thread on the shaft <b>5</b> of the pole <b>8</b>, once extended, generates a thrust between the ceiling and the floor, equivalent to a weight of about 350 kg, thus allowing a stable adhesion of the base <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, there is a selector means <b>6</b>, which is engaged by the hemispherical element <b>3</b>, which allows the pole <b>8</b> to rotate on itself around the X axis. On the other hand, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, when the selector means <b>6</b> is engaged on the hemispherical element <b>3</b>, it makes the pole <b>8</b> integral with the hemispherical element <b>3</b> itself and the pole <b>8</b> therefore remains free to oscillate in all directions but is prevented from rotating. Therefore, the selector means <b>6</b> is configured to assume two different positions: a position in which it engages the hemispherical element <b>3</b> and a position in which it is disengaged from the hemispherical element <b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The anchoring of the vertical pole for gym exercise within two opposite walls is achieved by adjusting the pole <b>8</b> through the presence of the threaded shaft <b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Advantageously, the pressurisation of the pole <b>8</b> is easily carried out by means of a threaded outer wall <b>2</b> of the seat <b>22</b>, to adjust the height and pressurise the pole <b>8</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Advantageously, the pressurisation of the pole <b>8</b> can also be achieved by means of elements external to the base <b>1</b> such as, for example, by means of a plurality of feet <b>23</b> provided with threads <b>24</b> placed underneath the base, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In this way, the height adjustment no longer takes place on the pole <b>8</b> but directly on the base <b>1</b>. This is an alternative but equally secure and robust adjustment for the attachment of pole <b>8</b> itself.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Although at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in the summary and detailed description, it should be understood that there are a large number of variants falling within the scope of protection of the invention.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Furthermore, it must be understood that the embodiment(s) presented are merely examples which are not intended to limit in any way the scope of protection of the invention or its application or configurations.
