Failure to snooze audible alarms, and to do so for a long enough duration, can lead to the safety system being disregarded or even disabled by an operator.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Given that additional concerns can emerge while an alarm system is snoozed, there have been efforts to establish criteria to retrigger a snoozed alarm. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,275,847 to Lewis (hereinafter &#x201c;Lewis&#x201d;) describes an Interactive Maintenance Management System (&#x201c;IMMS&#x201d;) which includes an alarm handling system for handling alarms that indicate present or imminent equipment failure. The IMMS may be used in industrial situations, such as strip-mines, to reduce equipment downtime and reduce or prevent equipment failure. Lewis's IMMS uses a flexible response system to track, analyze, and improve performance of the alarm handling system. As Lewis is directed to alarms related to equipment failure, the criteria Lewis defines for retriggering an alarm is not relevant to proximity alarm systems. For example, Lewis retriggers a snoozed alarm for required maintenance/repair after a maintenance facility becomes available.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, there are still opportunities to improve proximity alarm systems used on machines to alert an operator to nearby and/or approaching objects. The example systems and methods described herein are directed toward overcoming one or more of the deficiencies described above and/or other problems with the prior art.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, a proximity warning system can include one or more cameras positioned on a machine, one or more processors, and one or more memory devices. The memory devices can include instructions for execution by the one or more processors. The system can include instructions to receive, from the one or more cameras, image data depicting an object disposed within a field of view of the one or more cameras. The system can include instructions to derive a first distance between the object and the machine based on the image data, and an alarm is triggered when the first distance is less than a first threshold distance. The system can also include instructions to receive a request to snooze the alarm and discontinue the alarm. Additional image data can be received from the one or more cameras depicting the object, and a second distance between the object and the machine is derived based on the additional image data. The system can include instructions to cancel the snooze and retrigger the alarm when the second distance is less than a second threshold distance.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some aspects, the system further comprises instructions to: receive a second request to snooze the alarm; receive, from the one or more cameras, further image data depicting the object; derive a third distance between the object and the machine based on the further image data; and cancel the second snooze and retrigger the alarm when the third distance is less than a third threshold distance. According to some aspects, the first threshold distance corresponds to a visual alarm and the second and third threshold distances correspond respectively to audible and/or haptic alarms. In some aspects, the first threshold distance is 9 meters from the machine, the second threshold distance is 6 meters from the machine, and the third threshold distance is 3 meters from the machine. In further aspects, the one or more cameras comprise a camera positioned at the rear of the machine and cameras respectively positioned at left and right sides of the machine. In some aspects, the one or more cameras comprise an object identification system capable of identifying whether the object is a person, whereby the alarm distinguishes the object as a person.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, a proximity warning system can include one or more cameras positioned on a machine, one or more processors, and one or more memory devices.

The system can include instructions to derive a first distance between the object and the machine based on the image data, and an alarm is triggered when the first distance is less than a first threshold distance. The system can also include instructions to receive a request to snooze the alarm and discontinue the alarm. A buffer zone distance can be defined upon receiving the request to snooze the alarm. Additional image data can be received from the one or more cameras depicting the object, and a second distance between the object and the machine is derived based on the additional image data. The system can include instructions to cancel the snooze and retrigger the alarm when: the second distance is less than a second threshold distance; and the difference between the first distance and the second distance is greater than the buffer zone distance.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some aspects, the buffer zone distance is proportional to the first distance. According to some aspects, the buffer zone distance is inversely proportional to a speed of the object. In some aspects, the system further comprises instructions to: receive a second request to snooze the alarm; receive, from the one or more cameras, further image data depicting the object; derive a third distance between the object and the machine based on the further image data; and cancel the second snooze and retrigger the alarm when: the third distance is less than a third threshold distance; and the difference between the second distance and the third distance is greater than the buffer zone distance.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, a proximity warning system can include one or more cameras positioned on a machine, one or more processors, and one or more memory devices.

Snooze time periods can range from minutes to hours depending on the application. In that time period circumstances can change such that it is desirable to cancel the snooze and retrigger the alarm. Disclosed herein are systems and methods for detection based proximity warning systems including methods to retrigger the system after it has been snoozed. These methods include retriggering an alarm when an object transitions between defined warning zones surrounding the machine. These methods also include retriggering an alarm when the predicted track of an object will cause it to transition between warning zones within a selected threshold period of time. Image-based detection systems can fluctuate greatly depending on the complexity of the image. In other words, the distances for detected objects can vary within a margin of error. Therefore, methods are also disclosed for using a buffer zone to help prevent false alarms when an object is near a distance threshold defining the different zones.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a machine <b>10</b>, such as a hydraulic excavator, configured with a detection based proximity warning system <b>100</b>, according to embodiments of the disclosed technology. The proximity warning system <b>100</b> can include a controller <b>102</b> and multiple cameras <b>104</b>. In some embodiments, the system can include a camera <b>104</b>(R) positioned at the rear of the machine <b>10</b> and two cameras <b>104</b>(S) respectively positioned at left and right sides of the machine <b>10</b>. The depicted three-camera configuration provides an approximately 270 degree field of view (FOV), wider or narrower fields of view could be employed. In some embodiments, different numbers and positions of cameras can be used. The controller <b>102</b> can include one or more processors and one or more memory devices storing instructions to control the alarm system, including methods to retrigger the system after it has been snoozed.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The cameras <b>104</b> can be any type of analog or digital image sensor, digital camera, and/or digital video camera. For example, the cameras <b>104</b> can be a high dynamic range (HDR) camera, a light-sensitive camera, and/or an ultra-sonic camera. In some embodiments, the cameras may provide two-dimensional image data, three-dimensional image data, image sequences, gray image data, and/or color image data. In some embodiments, the system <b>100</b> can further include any known type of sensor, such as one or more light detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensors, one or more sound navigation ranging (SONAR) sensors, one or more radio detection and ranging (RADAR) sensors, or any other suitable sensor type. In some embodiments, the cameras comprise an object identification system capable of identifying whether an object is a person, a machine, a vehicle, or other obstacle. In some embodiments, the alarm system is configured to distinguish the object as a person, a machine, a vehicle, or other obstacle in order to further inform the operator as to the nature of the objects(s) around the machine <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the cameras can provide, for each object in the FOV, image data including a distance, a bearing angle, and a speed, for example.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The detection based proximity warning system <b>100</b> can include multiple warning zones within the FOV. In some embodiments, the warning zones can be defined by threshold distances from the machine. For example, a first threshold distance D<b>1</b> can define an Aware zone, a second threshold distance D<b>2</b> can define a Caution zone, and a third threshold distance D<b>3</b> can define a Critical zone and, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the threshold distances can define concentric arcuate regions around machine <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the first threshold distance D<b>1</b> is 9 meters from the machine, the second threshold distance D<b>2</b> is 6 meters from the machine, and the third threshold distance D<b>3</b> is 3 meters from the machine. In some embodiments, the thresholds can be configurable. Each warning zone can correspond to different alarm types triggered (i.e., activated) once the object comes closer to the machine <b>10</b> than the corresponding threshold distance. For example, the Aware zone can correspond to a visual alarm (e.g., flashing light), the Caution zone can correspond to a combination of audible (e.g., speaker or siren) and visual alarms, and the Critical zone can correspond to audible, visual, and haptic (e.g., vibration mechanism) alarms. In some embodiments, the alarms can be visually output on a display of the machine <b>10</b>, which can include a user interface that an operator can use for controlling machine operations.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">When an object <b>20</b>, such as a person, enters the Aware zone by crossing the first distance threshold D<b>1</b>, an alarm (e.g., audible alarm device <b>108</b>) is triggered. Once the alarm is initially triggered the operator can snooze the alarm with the machine's control display or via a manual button <b>106</b>, for example. Snooze time periods can range from minutes to hours depending on the application. In that time period circumstances can change such that it is desirable to cancel the snooze and retrigger (i.e., reactivate) the alarm. For example, if the object moves closer to the machine within the snooze time period, it may be necessary to cancel the snooze and alert the operator. Thus, if the object <b>20</b> enters the Caution zone by crossing the second distance threshold D<b>2</b>, the snooze is canceled and the alarm is retriggered to alert the operator that the object has moved closer to the machine or the machine is approaching the object. It should be noted that the distance between the object and the machine can change due to movement of the object <b>20</b> and/or the machine <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Because the Aware zone can correspond to only a visual alarm, in some embodiments, the system does not allow the operator to snooze the visual Aware zone alarm. A visual alarm may not be as distracting as an audible and/or haptic alarm and may therefore be less likely to be disabled. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the snooze feature is enabled when the object <b>20</b> enters the Caution zone and the alarm is retriggered if the object <b>20</b> enters the Critical zone by crossing the third distance threshold D<b>3</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow diagram showing a method <b>200</b>, corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for controlling the alarm system including retriggering the alarm according to embodiments of the disclosed technology. At step <b>202</b>, the system receives, from the one or more cameras, image data depicting an object disposed within a field of view of the one or more cameras. At step <b>204</b>, the system derives a first distance between the object and the machine based on the image data. At step <b>206</b>, the system triggers an alarm when the first distance is less than a first threshold distance. At step <b>208</b>, the system receives a request to snooze the alarm and discontinues the alarm. At step <b>210</b>, the system receives, from the one or more cameras, additional image data depicting the object. At step <b>212</b>, the system derives a second distance between the object and the machine based on the additional image data. At step <b>214</b>, the system cancels the snooze and retriggers the alarm when the second distance is less than a second threshold distance. In some embodiments, the method can also include receiving a second request to snooze the alarm; receiving further image data depicting the object; deriving a third distance between the object and the machine based on the further image data; and canceling the second snooze and retriggering the alarm when the third distance is less than a third threshold distance.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating another method for retriggering a detection based proximity alarm using a buffer zone according to further embodiments of the disclosed technology. When an object <b>20</b> enters the Aware zone by crossing the first distance threshold D<b>1</b>, an alarm is triggered. Once the alarm is initially triggered the operator can snooze the alarm. Upon receiving the request to snooze the alarm, the system defines a buffer zone distance Db reflecting the surface of the object <b>20</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> the buffer zone has approximately the same shape as the object <b>20</b>, although as an alternative the buffer zone could be a circle having as its center the center of the object). In some implementations, the buffer zone distance Db can be directly proportional to the first distance. In some implementations, the buffer zone distance Db can be inversely proportional to a speed of the object. The buffer zone distance Db can also be defined based on the type of object e.g., different distances for people as opposed to vehicles.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Image-based detection systems can fluctuate greatly in accuracy depending on the complexity of the image. In other words, the distances for detected objects can vary within a margin of error. The buffer zone prevents false alarms when an object is near a distance threshold defining the different zones. Thus, if the object <b>20</b> enters the Caution zone by crossing the second distance threshold D<b>2</b>, the snooze is canceled and the alarm is retriggered only if the object has also moved closer to the machine <b>10</b> by the buffer zone distance Db (such distances may be measured in a straight line from the machine <b>10</b> to the object <b>20</b>). The buffer zone also acts to consolidate multiple detections that are within a threshold distance of each other.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a flow diagram showing a method <b>400</b>, corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, for controlling the alarm system including retriggering the alarm according to embodiments of the disclosed technology. At step <b>402</b>, the system receives, from the one or more cameras, image data depicting an object disposed within a field of view of the one or more cameras. At step <b>404</b>, the system derives a first distance between the object and the machine based on the image data. At step <b>406</b>, the system triggers an alarm when the first distance is less than a first threshold distance.

When an object <b>20</b> enters the Aware zone by crossing the first distance threshold D<b>1</b>, an alarm is triggered. Once the alarm is initially triggered the operator can snooze the alarm. Upon receiving the request to snooze the alarm, the system derives a closing speed S between the machine and the object <b>20</b>. If the speed S and distance D<b>1</b> of the object will result in the object <b>20</b> entering the next threat zone (e.g., D<b>2</b> Caution zone) within a configurable threshold period of time t, the snooze is canceled and the alarm is retriggered. Using the object's track information to cancel the snooze and retrigger the alarm can provide faster retriggering for fast approaching objects to provide an operator more time to react.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a flow diagram showing a method <b>600</b>, corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, for controlling the alarm system including retriggering the alarm according to embodiments of the disclosed technology.
