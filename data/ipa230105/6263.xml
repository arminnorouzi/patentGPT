Korean Patent Application No. 10-2020-0011328 filed on Jan. 30, 2020 with the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its

particularly to a secondary battery including a reference electrode for measuring the electrode potential of a three-electrode system, and a method manufacturing the secondary battery.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, as energy source price is increasing due to the depletion of fossil fuels and increasing interest is being paid to environmental pollution, the demand for environmentally-friendly alternative energy sources is bound to play an important role in the future life. Thus, research into techniques for generating various kinds of power, such as nuclear energy, solar energy, wind energy, and tidal power, is underway, and power storage apparatuses for more efficient use of the generated energy are also drawing much attention.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In particular, as technology development and demands for mobile devices increase, the demand for batteries as energy sources is rapidly increasing. Accordingly, many researches on batteries capable of meeting diverse demands have been conducted.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically, a lithium secondary battery, such as a lithium ion battery or a lithium ion polymer battery, which have advantages such as a high energy density, a discharge voltage, an output stability, and the like is highly demanded.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, the secondary batteries may be classified based on how the electrode assembly, having a structure in which a positive electrode, a negative electrode, and a separator interposed between the positive electrode and the negative electrode are stacked, is structured. Typically, the electrode assemblies may include a jelly-roll (wound) type electrode assembly in which long sheet type positive electrodes and negative electrodes are wound in a state where separators are interposed therebetween, and a stacked (laminated) type electrode assembly in which a plurality of positive electrodes and a plurality of negative electrodes, which are cut into predetermined unit sizes, are sequentially stacked in a state where separators are interposed therebetween, and the like. Recently, in order to solve the problems involved in the jelly-roll type electrode assembly and the stacked type electrode assembly, there have been developed a stacked/folded type electrode assembly which is a combination of the jelly-roll type electrode assembly and the stacked type electrode assembly, and has a structure in which unit cells stacked with certain units of the positive electrodes and unit negative electrode are sequentially wound with a separation film while a separator being interposed therebetween.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, the secondary battery is classified based on the shape of a battery case into a cylindrical battery having an electrode assembly mounted in a cylindrical container, a prismatic battery having an electrode assembly mounted in a prismatic container, or a pouch-shaped case having an electrode assembly mounted in a pouch-shaped case formed of an aluminum laminate sheet.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is schematically a schematic diagram schematically illustrating a structure of a cylindrical secondary battery <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the cylindrical secondary battery <b>10</b> is manufactured by mounting a wound type electrode assembly <b>20</b> in a cylindrical case <b>30</b>, injecting an electrolyte solution into the case <b>30</b>, and coupling a cap assembly <b>40</b> provided with an electrode terminal to the open upper end of the case <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further, in the case <b>30</b>, a beading part <b>31</b> indented in a central direction may be formed in order to stably couple the cap assembly <b>40</b> and prevent movement of the electrode assembly <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">When the electrode assembly <b>20</b> is mounted in the case <b>30</b>, a first electrode tab <b>51</b> and a second electrode tab <b>61</b> are protruded in directions that are opposite to each other. Moreover, the first electrode tab <b>51</b> is connected to the cap assembly <b>40</b> coupled to one opened surface of the case <b>30</b> in a state of being protruded toward the opened one surface, and accordingly, one surface of the cap assembly <b>40</b> acts as the first electrode <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The second electrode tab <b>61</b> is protruded in a direction of a lower surface of the case <b>30</b>, which is opposite to the opened one surface of the case <b>30</b>, and coupled to an inner surface of the case <b>30</b>, and accordingly, the lower surface of the case <b>30</b> acts as a second electrode <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The first electrode <b>50</b> and the second electrode <b>60</b> may be a positive electrode and a negative electrode, respectively.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to check the performance of newly developed and manufactured battery cells, a process of measuring an electrode potential of a battery cell is undertaken.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">For measurement of an electrode potential, a method for measuring an electrode potential of a three-electrode system composed of a reference electrode, a working electrode, and a counter electrode is mainly used.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The reference electrode is an electrode used to create a battery circuit for the measurement of an electrode potential in order to measure the potential of the electrode constituting a battery or the electrode causing an electrolysis, and acts as a reference for potentials when measuring the relative value of electrode potential.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a state after a beading part of the cylindrical secondary battery of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is cut for measurement of an electrode potential.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the beading part <b>31</b> of the secondary battery <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is cut to measure an electrode potential.

That is, the battery case <b>130</b> is crimp-coupled with the cap assembly <b>140</b> to form a crimping portion <b>133</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The cap assembly <b>140</b> may include an upper cap <b>141</b> forming a positive electrode terminal, and a cap plate <b>142</b> to which the positive electrode tab <b>144</b> extending upward from the electrode assembly <b>120</b> is connected.

Actually, it is possible to accurately measure the electrode potential. In addition, in the conventional electrode potential measurement method, in which it is difficult to precisely adjust the injected amount of the electrolyte solution, and in the case of excessive injection of the electrolyte solution, a large deviation may occur in the data value.

In such a case, there is a disadvantage that an additional space is required inside the secondary battery for interposing the sealant, and there is a problem that the sealing is easily released by deformation of the sealant.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">Unlike this, the reference electrode <b>200</b> of the secondary battery <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment is provided between the crimping portion <b>133</b> and the gasket <b>143</b>, does not require the formation of a separate hole, and can be tightly fixed and sealed due to crimp-coupling. That is, even if the reference electrode <b>200</b> is provided, problems such as unsealing or structural deformation of the secondary battery <b>100</b> do not occur. Accordingly, the secondary battery <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment has an advantage that it can evaluate a high temperature at which an internal pressure is largely generated.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The battery case <b>130</b> may be a cylindrical case or a prismatic case, but as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the battery case <b>130</b> is preferably a cylindrical case.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Meanwhile, the reference electrode <b>200</b> extends from the lower portion <b>124</b> of the electrode assembly <b>120</b> along the outer peripheral surface <b>125</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) of the electrode assembly <b>120</b>, and can pass between the battery case <b>130</b> and the cap assembly <b>140</b>, and one end <b>210</b> of the reference electrode <b>200</b> may be located on the lower portion <b>124</b> of the electrode assembly <b>120</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.
