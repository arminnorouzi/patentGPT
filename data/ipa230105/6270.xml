To this end, a battery may be probed in a manner allowing a battery monitoring and/or charging system to obtain data that characterizes at least two or three of these different battery phenomena. In some cases, the battery's response to a stimulus is analyzed in the frequency domain. In some such cases, the battery is probed at different applied current or voltage frequencies. In some cases, battery data is collected at different times after application of a stimulus (e.g., a current pulse/edge). In one example, the battery data is or includes a battery's charge pulse voltage (&#x201c;CPV&#x201d;), which may provide information reflective of diffusion in the battery's solid electrode material. In another example, the battery data may be a battery's partial relaxation time, which provides information reflective of transport in the electrolyte. In various embodiments, the battery is monitored, and data is collected, during charging of the battery. In some cases, the charging and monitoring is accomplished by using a pulsed charge current.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0042">Systems and apparatus may be designed and/or configured to carry out analysis of battery physical phenomena, and characterize batteries based on phenomena occurring at one of the above-mentioned time and/or frequency domains. These systems may be additionally responsible for charging and/or monitoring a rechargeable battery.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Terminology</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0043">The term &#x201c;battery&#x201d; as used herein refers to one or more galvanic cells (each of which stores energy electrochemically). A battery may be an individual cell and/or a plurality of cells arranged electrically in a series and/or parallel configuration. Although some references describe a battery as including two or more cells, the term &#x201c;battery&#x201d; is not so limited in this disclosure. In some implementations, a battery is a single cell or multiple cells connected in series or parallel to provide a desired voltage or current rating. Batteries considered herein are typically rechargeable (secondary batteries).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0044">A battery generally contains an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte or separator. In some contexts, for galvanic electrochemical systems such as batteries, the anode is referred to as the negative electrode and the cathode is referred to as the positive electrode. In operation of a battery, an electrolyte conducts ions but not electrons. During discharge, the negative electrode is oxidized and donates electrons to an external circuit, while the positive electrode is reduced and consumes electrons from an external circuit. During charge, the processes are reversed. In some cases, the negative electrode is an intercalation anode that includes an intercalation matrix or substrate such as carbon, tin, and/or silicon that is configured to insert or intercalate ions during charge. These ions are typically alkali metal ions (e.g., lithium or sodium ions) or alkaline earth metal ions. Other types of battery chemistries or materials may be used in the methods and apparatus of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0045">An &#x201c;electronic device&#x201d; as indicated herein refers to a device that performs any number of tasks or functions electrically and that can be powered by a battery. The device may or may not physically include (e.g., enclose or attach) the battery, battery charging system, or control logic described herein. Electronic devices may be portable or fixed. Examples of electronic devices include mobile phones, digital cameras, laptops, portable speakers, battery powered vehicles, systems for storing solar and other generated electrical energy, uninterruptible power supplies, and power tools.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0046">&#x201c;Battery parameters&#x201d; refer to parameters of, or associated with, a battery and its use. Values of battery parameters are often obtained and/or used by battery control logic such as logic used in a battery charger. Examples of types of battery parameters include charge pulse voltage, partial relaxation time, time in service for the battery (e.g., from the time it was installed in the device it powers or when it was first used), and full charge capacity, and projected capacity (typically to some number of cycles. Other battery parameters may reflect battery physical properties such as material transport in an electrode or electrolyte (e.g., diffusion coefficients), reactions or processes within or at the interface of an electrode (e.g., rate constants and double layer capacitance), etc. The values of each of these parameters may vary as a function of the state of charge during the charge portion of a single battery cycle or operating temperature. The parameters values may also vary from cycle-to-cycle over the battery's life.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0047">&#x201c;Battery type&#x201d; distinguishes classes or groups of batteries from one another. Among the factors that identify a battery type are (i) battery chemistry (e.g., lithium ion batteries and nickel metal hydride batteries), (ii) battery format (e.g., cylindrical versus prismatic versus pouch) and size (e.g., 18650 versus AA), (iii) manufacturer identity (e.g., Samsung SDI versus Panasonic), (iv) manufacturing process, and (v) manufacturer process implementation (e.g. lot, plant, and/or site). An example of a battery type is an 18650 format rechargeable lithium-ion battery produced by a particular manufacturer (e.g., Samsung SDI, LG Chemical, Murata Energy, etc.) produced in a particular lot using a particular process of the manufacturer. Any one or more of the above factors may be used to define a battery type. Further, the factors may be defined specifically. For example, lithium ion batteries may be divided into types of negative electrodes such as graphite, silicon, and tin or tin oxide.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0048">A &#x201c;charge process&#x201d; or &#x201c;charging process&#x201d; refers to a process in which a battery is charged from a state of less charge to a state of more charge. During a charge process, the battery's state of charge increases. A charge process may be conducted under the control of charging circuitry which may be part of the battery charging system or the battery control logic. In certain embodiments, charging circuitry adapts, adjusts and/or controls the amplitude, pulse width, duty cycle, or other parameter of charging or discharging current pulses and/or it adjusts and/or controls the conditions of a constant voltage portion of the charge process. It may perform any such function to control or adjust a feature of the battery such as the battery's overall charging rate, cycle life, etc. It may perform these functions to control or adjust a more specific characteristic of the battery such as the battery's relaxation time, characteristics of the decay of the terminal voltage (e.g., the rate of decay or the shape of the decay curve), propensity to plate metallic lithium, etc. For example, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, charging circuitry may adapt, adjust and/or control the amplitude and pulse width of the discharge pulse to reduce or minimize the &#x201c;overshoot&#x201d; or &#x201c;undershoot&#x201d; of the decay of the terminal voltage of the battery.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0049">A &#x201c;charge cycle&#x201d; is the process of charging a rechargeable battery and discharging it with a particular load. A charge cycle may involve charging and discharging an amount of charge that is equivalent or nearly equivalent to the battery's capacity, but not necessarily by one full charge and one full discharge. For instance, using half the charge of a fully charged battery, recharging it, and then using the same amount of charge again, and then subsequently recharging it may count as one charge cycle. The number of charge cycles until a battery fails indicates how many times a rechargeable battery can undergo the process of complete charging and discharging until failing certain criteria. The number of charge cycles may be used to specify a battery's expected life, which may affect battery life more than the mere passage of time.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0050">A &#x201c;charge signal&#x201d; refers to the electrical current (e.g., the current waveform) that passes through the terminals of a battery as a result of circuitry configured to apply charge (a charging signal) or remove charge (a discharging signal) from a battery. In various embodiments, one or more charge signals are applied to a battery to charge it, as part of a charge process. A charging or recharging sequence, operation, process, or cycle may include one or more charge signals, which, in total, inject or apply charge into the battery and, optionally, one or more discharge signals (e.g., discharge signals), which, in total, remove charge from the battery. A charge signal may include a plurality of charge packets and/or discharge packets. Each charge packet may represent a portion of a charge sequence and contain one or more charge pulses, discharge pulses and rest periods. Current variations such as edges and pulses may be provided as independent features, outside the concept of a charge packet. Regardless of whether they are part of a charge packet, pulses of a charge signal may be any shape (for example, rectangular, triangle, sinusoidal or square). In some cases, a charge pulse has a temporal duration of between about 1 ms to about 5,000 ms.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0051">&#x201c;Battery Control Logic&#x201d; refers to the control algorithms and/or rules that are used to determine (i) charging parameters (for example, the amplitude, width, and frequency of charge and discharge pulses) in the charge process, and/or (ii) information about a battery's health, expected life, defects, its physical and/or material properties, etc. In some embodiments, the algorithms or rules are chosen to improve or balance a battery's cycle life and/or charge speed. In some cases, battery control logic may determine or estimate a battery's state of charge (SOC), state of health (SOH), partial relaxation time, overpotential, or whether metal plating has occurred. In some cases, battery control logic may make use of state of health (SOH) information and/or battery feedback measurements that may include the state of charge (SOC), temperature, voltage, current, and the voltage response shape due to charging and discharging cycles. In some cases, battery control logic employs a battery model to classify a battery and/or the battery when subject to a defined set of charging conditions (e.g., battery charge process parameter values). In certain embodiments, battery control logic is implemented as executable instructions or code stored in hardware (e.g., any of various forms of memory), firmware, or software. The battery control logic may also be considered to include one or more processors configured or designed to execute the instructions or code, particularly when such processors are directly linked to the memory or other storage providing the instructions or code. Unless otherwise stated, the terms battery control circuitry and control circuitry are equivalent to battery control logic. In certain embodiments, battery control logic is part of a battery charging system.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0052">A &#x201c;battery monitoring system,&#x201d; which may be part of a battery charging system, is used to monitor a battery and use measured frequency or time domain battery data obtained from the battery (and/or characterizing conditions under which the battery is charged or otherwise operated). In various embodiments, the monitoring system provides information to the battery control logic to characterize a battery and/or determine appropriate charging conditions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts in block form an example battery charging system that includes charging circuitry <b>112</b> that responds to control circuitry <b>116</b> (e.g., battery control logic) that receives battery information from monitoring circuitry <b>114</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is described in more detail below.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0053">&#x201c;Capacity&#x201d; or nominal capacity refers to the total charge (which may be measured in Amp-hours or coulombs) available when the battery is discharged at a certain discharge current (which may be specified as a C-rate) from a fully charged state (e.g., 100 percent state-of-charge) to a defined cut-off voltage. A battery's capacity may change over multiple charge cycles. In conventional batteries, it is common for the battery's capacity to decrease or &#x201c;fade&#x201d; over multiple cycles.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0054">The term &#x201c;capacity fade&#x201d; refers to reduction of battery capacity over time or multiple charge cycles. A battery's capacity at any given cycle may be based on the maximum battery capacity, at that cycle, or other reference value of battery capacity (e.g., 85% of initial maximum capacity, capacity at specific terminal voltage, etc.)</p><p id="p-0054" num="0055">&#x201c;Terminal voltage&#x201d; is the voltage between the battery terminals. Terminal voltage may vary with state of charge and/or the magnitude of discharge or charge current. The terminal voltage may be measured with or without current flowing through a load. In the latter case, the terminal voltage is an open circuit voltage.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0056">An &#x201c;open circuit voltage&#x201d; (OCV) is the terminal voltage of a battery in the absence of current flow. It is a property of the cell under a particular set of conditions. A closed circuit voltage (CCV) is the battery terminal in the presence of current flow (e.g., during charging of the battery). CCV is affected by OCV, but also depends on the operation of the battery. For example, during constant current charging, a CCV may be calculated as the sum of the OCV and the charging current multiplied by the resistance of the battery. During constant voltage charge, the CCV is equal to the applied voltage.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0057">&#x201c;State of charge&#x201d; (SOC) may refer to the amount of charge currently stored in a battery as a percentage of maximum capacity. SOC is used to characterize how far a battery in use has progressed between a fully charged state and a discharged state. In some cases, state of charge is calculated using current integration to determine the present amount of charge in a battery.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0058">The &#x201c;state of health&#x201d; (SOH) of a battery is a parameter that characterizes the &#x201c;age&#x201d; or &#x201c;health&#x201d; of the battery and/or ability of the battery to hold charge, for example, relative to a given point in the battery's operation (for example, the initial time in operation). The SOH of a battery may provide information to estimate, calculate, measure, and/or determine other battery parameters such as the ability of a battery to hold a charge. The voltage at the terminals of the battery at a given SOC changes as the SOH changes, and hence the voltage curve (voltage versus state of charge) of the battery shifts as it ages and its SOH deteriorates. The state of health parameter is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,121,910, issued Sep. 1, 2015, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0059">A &#x201c;charge pulse voltage&#x201d; (CPV) is a voltage measurement that may be characterized as (i) a peak voltage, measured at the terminals of the battery/cell, which is produced by the battery in response to a change in current (e.g., an edge or pulse) to which the battery voltage responses, and/or (ii) a substantial peak voltage (e.g., within 5-10% of the peak voltage), measured at the terminals of the battery/cell, which is produced by the battery in response to a charge pulse. In some cases, a CPV measurement is used by an adaptive charging process. In some cases, a CPV measurement is taken to determine a battery parameter such as SOC or SOH.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0060">A &#x201c;battery model&#x201d; or simply a &#x201c;model&#x201d; is mathematical construct, software, and/or other logic that may classify a battery or a particular set of charge process parameters applied to or characterizing the battery. Examples of such parameters include a battery's state of charge, temperature, charge voltage, open circuit voltage, charge current, the properties and state of its internal materials, the battery's design, etc. The model takes as inputs information about the battery itself and/or the charge process parameters and outputs one or more charge process characteristics of the battery. The charge characteristics may represent a conclusion about the appropriateness of the charge process parameters (e.g., safe, potentially unsafe, or unsafe charging conditions) and/or a prediction about the results or effects of the charge process parameters on the battery; e.g., the effects of subjecting the battery to the input set of charge process parameters.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0061">A model may be applicable to just a particular individual battery or to a plurality of batteries of the same battery type or within a group of related battery types. In some cases, a model accounts for the state of health of a battery. For example, if irreversible damage to the battery cell has occurred, a model may reflect the battery's state of health. More generally, the model may evolve or learn based on information and/or data it gains from application to one or more batteries. Some changes to the model may result from changes in a battery itself, e.g., changes in its health or material properties, as mentioned. Other changes to the model may result from observing and incorporating different situations encountered during battery charging. Such observing and learning may be implemented as machine learning or deep learning.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0062">A model may take any of various forms. In one example, the model takes the form of a lookup table. In another example, the model takes the form of one or more expressions, matrices, etc. such as regression relationships, neural networks, decision trees, and the like.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0063">&#x201c;Measuring,&#x201d; &#x201c;collecting,&#x201d; or &#x201c;capturing&#x201d; a parameter as stated herein is a way of obtaining a value of the parameter. For instance, measuring the voltage of a battery can mean using an instrument such as a voltmeter to directly measure the voltage between terminals of the battery. In some contexts, it means obtaining parameter values related to raw measurements of the battery and/or deriving other information about the battery (e.g., partial relaxation, battery swelling, etc.). Raw measurements of a battery may include current (applied or generated), charge accepted or passed, voltage, and temperature.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0064">Numeric ranges are inclusive of the numbers defining the range.

Using adaptive charging techniques, one or more characteristics of a charge signal may be continuously or periodically adjusted or controlled while charging a battery. Such adjustment or control may be performed to maintain battery parameter values within a selected range. Generally, adaptive charging is used to optimize the battery's cycle life, optimize its charge speed, minimize its swelling, and/or keep it operating within safe boundaries. For example, adaptive charging may keep a battery charge process operating in a regime where minimal or no battery degradation, such as from metal plating (e.g., metallic lithium plating), occurs or is likely to occur. Various types of battery parameter values may be captured and used for adaptive charging. Some of these parameter values are obtained by measuring parameters directly associated with the battery, charging system, and/or the device powered by the battery. For example, parameter values may be obtained from battery terminal voltage measurements, battery temperature, battery size, and the like. In some cases, adaptive charging also makes use of parameters not directly associated with a battery. Examples include user information and environmental information. Examples of indirectly obtained battery parameters that may be used for adaptive charging include charge pulse voltage, partial relaxation time, the state of charge, and the battery's state of health. In some cases, ranges of acceptable values of each of these parameters may vary as a function of the state of charge during the charge portion of a battery cycle. The parameters values may also vary from cycle-to-cycle over the battery's life. In some cases, adaptive charging may also make use of the current charging parameters such as the current or voltage that is being applied to a battery by charging circuitry.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0070">Various adaptive charging techniques are described in applications assigned to Qnovo Inc. of Newark, Calif.

Such characteristics may be derived using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy or related techniques.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0072">To illustrate an example of adaptive charging, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows how a charging process can reduce or minimize the &#x201c;overshoot&#x201d; or &#x201c;undershoot&#x201d; of the decay of the terminal voltage of the battery by adjusting the amplitude and pulse width of a discharge pulse. When a charge process provides an &#x201c;overshoot&#x201d; of the decay of the terminal voltage of the battery relative to partial equilibrium (see discharge pulse A), the charging circuitry may adjust the characteristics of the discharge pulse by, e.g., increasing the amount of charge removed by the discharge pulse. For example, by increasing the amplitude and/or pulse width of the discharge pulse, the overshoot may be corrected. When a charge process results in an &#x201c;undershoot&#x201d; of the decay of the terminal voltage of the battery relative to partial equilibrium (see discharge pulse C), charging circuitry may decrease the amount of charge removed by the discharge pulse (for example, via decreasing the amplitude and/or pulse width of the discharge pulse). As such, the control circuitry may adjust the characteristics of one or more subsequent discharge pulses (for example, the amplitude, pulse width, and/or pulse shape) to control or adjust rate, shape and/or characteristics of the decay of the terminal voltage of the battery. Other examples of charge process modification to accomplish adaptive charging include modifying the rate or amount of charge injected to the battery during charging. In general, in one class of adaptive charging techniques, the charge process changes the amplitude and/or duration of one or more discharge pulses to stimulate a desired response in the partial relaxation time. Examples of adjustable parameters of discharge pulses are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b><i>b </i></figref>and <b>8</b><i>c. </i></p><p id="p-0072" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a</i>-<b>3</b><i>d </i></figref>present example waveforms of charge signals. A charging or recharging sequence, operation, or cycle may include charging signals (which, in total, inject or apply charge into the battery) and discharging signals (which, in total, remove charge from the battery). Charging signals may decrease according to a predetermined rate and/or pattern (for example, asymptotically, linearly or quadraticaly) as, e.g., the terminal voltage of the battery increases during a charging or recharging sequence, operation, or cycle (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>b </i>and <b>3</b><i>d</i></figref>). In some cases, a pulse charging sequence or operation may include a constant voltage (CV) phase after a period of pulse charging and/or upon charging the battery/cell to a predetermined state of charge. In some embodiments, the period prior to the CV phase involves controlling current delivered to the battery. In some cases, this phase is nominally a constant current (CC) phase&#x2014;although pulses may be superimposed&#x2014;or a current step phase.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>e </i></figref>illustrate charge and/or discharge packets of the charging and discharging signals (which are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b><i>a</i>-<b>3</b><i>d</i></figref>), where such charge and discharge packets may include one or more charge pulses and one or more discharge pulses.

More generally, a charge packet includes one or more changes in charging current or other charging parameter. In some cases, the change(s) contained in a charge packet include an edge in the charge current. When pulses are used, they may be of any shape&#x2014;for example, pulses may be, rectangular, triangular, sinusoidal, or square. In some embodiments, charge and/or discharge pulses of the packet may include a temporal duration of between about 1 ms to about 2000 ms, and preferably less than 1000 ms.

In this regard, the discharge period may remove excess charge that might otherwise contribute to degradation mechanisms such as the thickening of the solid-electrolyte interface (SEI) layer or metallic plating of lithium. The difference between the electrical charge added to the cell during a charging period and the electrical charge removed from the cell during a discharge period determines a net total electrical charge added to the cell in one period. This net total electrical charge divided by the period may determine a net effective charging current.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0078">There are numerous combinations and permutations involving the amount of electrical charge added to the battery during the charge signal and the amount of charge removed during the discharge signal. All permutations are intended to fall within the scope of the present disclosure. For example, each permutation may result in a different rate, shape and/or characteristics of the decay of the terminal voltage of the battery. Moreover, within each permutation, there exists a large number of sub-permutations that i) combine the characteristics of a charge signal (for example, the duration, shape and/or amplitude of the charge signal), the product of which determines the amount of electrical charge added to the cell; and ii) combine the characteristics of a discharge signal (for example, the duration, shape and/or amplitude of a discharge signal), the product of which determines the amount of electrical charge removed from the cell; and iii) the length of time of the rest period. The characteristics of a charge signal may differ from the characteristics of a discharge signal.

When charging a rechargeable battery (e.g., a lithium-ion type rechargeable battery) using CCCV, the charging sequence includes a constant-current (CC) charging mode until the terminal voltage of the battery/cell is at about a maximum amplitude (for example, about 4.2V to 4.5V for certain lithium-ion type rechargeable batteries) at which point the charging sequence changes from the constant-current charging mode to a constant-voltage (CV) charging mode. In the CV mode, a constant voltage is applied to the terminals of the battery. Generally when charging a rechargeable battery using the CCCV technique, the charging circuitry changes from the CC charging mode to the CV charging mode when the state of charge (SOC) of the battery is at, e.g., about 60-80%, although in some embodiments, as described herein, a charging circuitry does not enter a CV charging mode until the battery charge is greater than about 90% SOC or greater than about 95% SOC. Adaptive charging may be employed to adjust the CC and/or CV portions of a CCCV charging process. Adaptive charging may also be employed to adjust the transition from the CC to the CV portion of the process.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrates current and voltage of a battery as a function of time when charged by a step-charging technique. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a single example of a step charging technique.

Battery Model Overview</heading><p id="p-0081" num="0082">Aspects of this disclosure pertain to models or similar tools for characterizing or classifying a battery and/or a battery's characteristics (e.g., charge characteristics) at various points in the battery's life, some or all of which may be when the battery is in service, as for example when the battery is installed in an electronic device such as a phone, an automobile, etc. In certain embodiments, models are developed or refined using information about a battery collected while the battery is in service. Regardless of how a model is generated and/or updated, it may classify a battery in a way that identifies different charge process regimes or characteristics of the battery.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0083">A simple pictorial example of a two-dimensional battery model is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>c</i></figref>. As shown, the model classifies charge process parameters for a particular battery&#x2014;in this particular case, values of state of charge and charge current. Using these charge parameters, the model classifies the charging process according to a particular state: safe, safe and slow, potentially unsafe, and known unsafe, thereby defining inter-relationships between the parameters under consideration (in this simple example, state of charge and charging current). Understand that while the plot of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>c </i></figref>shows charge current and state of charge as charge process parameters, often a model will consider other and/or additional charge process parameters and/or operating conditions such as temperature, terminal voltage (provided in isolation or as a response to a stimulus such as an applied current edge), battery age/health, material properties, sampling periods to obtain the requisite information, durations of measurement, etc., all of which may constitute independent axes in a multi-dimensional model. At the core of the multi-dimensional models are relationships that connect the independent parameters (and axes) to each other. These relationships then determine the optimal charging and operation of a battery.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0084">In some cases, a battery's charge process parameters may be visualized in a battery parameter space having a number of dimensions associated with these parameters. Thus, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>c </i></figref>shows two dimensions of battery charge process parameter space, other examples have three or more such dimensions. The number of battery charge process parameters included in a model (and hence a multidimensional space considered by the model) depends on the ability of chosen parameters to accurately and/or safely classify a battery or serve another requirement. In certain embodiments, the model employs at least two battery charge parameters, or at least about five battery charge parameters. Regardless of the number of dimensions, each set of battery charging process parameter values, alone or in combination with battery type information, represents a point in the multidimensional parameter space.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0085">As used herein, the term battery charge process parameters or just battery charge parameters indicates information about a battery, sometimes including information about a battery's charge conditions, (e.g., state of charge and current magnitude) that may be input to a model, while the term battery charge process characteristics or just battery charge characteristics indicates a conclusion or prediction about the results or appropriateness of the battery when subjected to particular battery charge parameters. Examples of battery charge process characteristics include safe operating conditions, potentially unsafe operating conditions, and known unsafe operating conditions. Distinct battery charge process characteristics may occupy different regions or regimes in a multidimensional space representing battery charge process parameters. In other words, the space is divided into regions, each associated with a different classification or characteristic of a given battery. The boundaries between these regions may be sharp or graded (i.e., the transition between a safe to a potentially safe charge process region may occur over distance in parameter space). See the distinct regions in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>c</i></figref>. A battery model classifies a battery and associated charge process parameters into one of the regimes/characteristics.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0086">Alternatively, or in addition, to simply classifying a battery by position in multidimensional battery parameter space, a battery model may produce a score based on battery charge process parameter values, optionally with weights applied to individual parameter values. For example, the score may be a weighted summation of selected individual battery charge process parameters. In certain embodiments, the weights can be computed from statistical analyses of the properties of previously tested batteries. Other functions of the battery charge process parameters, such as non-linear functions, may be used to obtain a score.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0087">In some embodiments, principal component analysis or a similar technique for reducing dimensionality is applied to a data set containing charge process parameter values for batteries and their associated charging procedures. The principal components of the dataset define vectors of maximum variation through the multidimensional parameter space. The principal components may be used in a reduced dimension battery parameter space. In some cases, a battery model is trained or otherwise designed to use parameter values presented in terms of principal components.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0088">In certain embodiments, separate models are provided for different batteries. This reflects the fact that individual batteries frequently have different characteristics, which result from different designs, manufacturing, handling, and/or use in service. In some implementations, multiple batteries of the same type (e.g., the same size, format, chemistry, manufacture, and batch) may use the same model, at least initially. Over time, the models for individual ones of these batteries of the same type may evolve or develop into different models to account for distinct observed properties, which may result from initially unknown differences or from use patterns differences. As should be apparent from this example, models can change over time, and the changes can be dictated by observed changes in a battery's response to particular stimuli or other conditions. Some examples of battery responses are described below with respect to time domain and frequency domain battery information. For example, a battery model may employ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) or EIS-like information to generate or refine or train a model.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0089">In certain embodiments, the battery is evaluated in situ using a model. That is, the battery need not be removed from its electronic device in order to be classified by the model. Collection of battery parameter values and application to a battery model may be conducted in a way that is unobtrusive, e.g., during charging and in a way that does not significantly slow or modify the charging. In some implementations or some use patterns, the model may conduct its evaluations without being noticed by the user of the device powered by the battery.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0090">The battery charge process characteristics provided by a model may inform decisions about future performance of battery and/or actions to be taken to address potential safety hazards, performance degradation, charging procedures, etc. For example, a particular model for a particular battery may indicate that the battery can or should be charged with a current of greater than 0.5 A when the battery's state of charge is 40% at a given temperature. The same model may indicate that the battery can be comfortably and appropriately charged with a current of about 0.6 A when the battery's state of charge is 80% at the same temperature. Still further, the model may indicate that the battery definitely should not be charged with a current of greater than 0.5 A when the battery's state of charge is 90% also at the same temperature. In certain embodiments, the battery charge characteristics are used to adapt charge process parameters (e.g., as with adaptive charging described herein).</p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">B. Input and Output Variables</heading><p id="p-0090" num="0091">As explained, a battery model may receive as inputs various battery charge process parameters. Examples of classes of these parameters include the following: (a) applied current characteristics (e.g., magnitude or shape such as pulse, edge, or step characteristics), (b) measured voltage across the battery terminals (e.g., as a function of time after the applied current pulse(s) or at fixed times after the current pulse(s)) (measured at various times after the stimulus or in response to various stimulus frequencies), (c) state of charge (determined by open circuit voltage, coulombs passed, etc.), (d) temperature (measured via a temperature sensor and optionally provided as a function of time after the applied current pulse or at fixed times after the current pulse), (e) battery age (cycle count, days in service, etc.), (f) previously generated output variables and/or battery state of health, (g) sampling frequencies of the current and/or voltage values, (h) duration of the sampling and measurement period (sampling frequency and duration point to different physical and chemical processes within the battery), (i) design values of the battery obtained either directly from the manufacturer or through physical dissection of the battery (e.g., material thicknesses, dimensions, properties of the electrolyte, known temperature dependences of such material properties), and the like.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0092">In certain embodiments, battery models are configured to receive parameter values for both current applied to the battery and voltage across the battery terminals. In some cases, battery models use, in addition, some combination of parameters of the types (c)-(f) listed above. In certain embodiments, battery models use the battery's applied and/or measured current at multiple different states of charge; in other words, at various states of charge, encountered over the course of a single charge process or over multiple charge processes. In certain embodiments, battery models use (i) the charge current, (ii) associated terminal voltage, and (iii) state of charge are provided as inputs to the model. Note that the charge current used in models may be, e.g., an instantaneous charge current or an average charge current. In some cases, an instantaneous charge current is obtained over a period of milliseconds to tens of seconds. Regardless of what battery charge process parameter values are input to the model, the model classifies the charge process having these parameter values. Note that the current and voltage values, as well as certain other charge process parameters, may be provided in a particular time domain or frequency domain, as is further explained below.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0093">To generate values of certain of these input variables, a battery system may apply a stimulus, which may be a current pulse applied at a specified state of charge. In response to the applied stimulus, the system measures the terminal voltage, and optionally one or more other parameter values such as the temperature of the battery.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0094">The applied current is not necessarily a current pulse; in various embodiments it is some form of an edge, which is a change in the magnitude of applied current. From the perspective of signal theory, an edge contains harmonic frequencies, which may be considered when evaluating a battery's response to the applied current edge. The fundamental and harmonic frequencies may be the primary mechanism to stimulate the battery's response. Note that the magnitude of current edge need not go to zero Amps to provide an edge; it merely has to change in value and in time. Further, the edge need not be vertical, as in the case of an edge of a triangular wave. The rate at which the edge changes should contain a sufficient frequency bandwidth to stimulate the frequencies of interest within the battery. The terminal voltage and/or other parameter may be measured at various times during or after application of the current edge. Alternatively, in some circumstances, the stimulus itself may be the terminal voltage instead of the terminal current.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0095">The model output classifies a battery under a set of conditions. The model may do this for conditions at the time of the measurement or at some other time such as a future time when exposed to a hypothetical set of conditions (e.g., an anticipated future applied current magnitude at a particular state of charge and temperature).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0096">In certain embodiments, the classification provided by a battery model allows the charging system to suggest or implement a change in a charge condition (e.g., an increased or decreased instantaneous or average current). In certain embodiments, the classification allows the control system associated with the battery or an electronic device in which the battery is installed to determine whether the battery is operating in a potentially unsafe mode and should be flagged for further observation or have its operation terminated. In certain embodiments, the classification allows the system to determine that the battery is in imminent danger of failure and/or represents a serious safety concern. In such cases, a system may prevent further charging and/or discharging until the battery has been removed or replaced from the device.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0097">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>c</i></figref>, a classification plot <b>521</b> represents a simplified pictorial example of a battery model for a given battery or a family of batteries. The plot <b>521</b> provides four discrete regions that represent four different battery charge process characteristics. As shown, these are a safe but slow charging region <b>523</b>, a generally safe operating region <b>525</b>, a potentially unsafe operating region <b>527</b>, and known unsafe operating region <b>529</b>. If the charging process operates in the safe but slow charging region <b>523</b>, the battery is unlikely to be damaged or destroyed, but it might be charged more rapidly without problem. In other words, while the battery is safely charged in region <b>523</b>, the charging process logic might determine that the battery should be charged faster, possibly to a level within the region <b>525</b>. As shown, region <b>525</b> lies above (has a higher charging current) than region <b>523</b>, but it does not extend into high states of charge. In other words, a charging process that operates at both a high state of charge and a high charge current is deemed unsafe by the battery model. Generally, batteries operating in region <b>525</b> are considered to be safely charged at an adequately fast charge rate. It is readily possible to picture a multi-dimensional version of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>c </i></figref>where additional parameters (or axes) are added, such as temperature, health and/or aging, operating condition, etc.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0098">As shown, the model characterizes charging processes that use relatively high charging currents at high states of charge as either potentially unsafe (region <b>527</b>) or known to be unsafe (<b>529</b>). A known unsafe operating region may be one where a failure of the battery may lead in due time to a fire or explosion. For example, a buildup of metallic lithium may cause dendritic filaments that can cause an internal electric short-circuit thereby leading to a rapid discharge of the battery and a likely fire. A potentially unsafe region is one where the risk of failure is elevated, but where failure may or may not involve fire or explosion. If a device's charging logic determines that a battery is operating in one of these regions or will soon be operating in one of them, it may adjust its charging parameters to stay out of these regions.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0099">In some embodiments, the charging logic attempts to operate close to a boundary <b>531</b> between safe region <b>525</b> and potentially unsafe operating region <b>527</b>. Of course, the logic will attempt to stay on the safe side of boundary <b>531</b>, but this of course requires that the model accurately defines the boundary. Further, the boundary can vary from battery-to-battery, or even at different evaluation times for a given battery.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0100">These boundaries or thresholds between different regions may, in some cases, depend on previous or on-going measurements of battery properties such as voltage measured in response to particular stimuli. For example, a current charge threshold (e.g., for boundary <b>531</b>) may be relaxed if there is a detected gradual (or abrupt) change in the battery's response to particular stimuli, which response indicates that operating at higher currents does not pose a safety threat. In certain embodiments, the boundary determination is made (and periodically updated) using an optimization scheme that takes, e.g., various EIS measurements as inputs and determines how they relate to a defined specification (e.g., charge time, cycle life, health and aging progression, etc.). The boundary determination or update may iterate this process using present and historical data and inputs, if necessary, to adjust the model, which allows for updating an optimal charge process configuration.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0101">As indicated, the model illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>c </i></figref>provides just one of example of many possible model structures. The parameters considered to define the space in which a charge process for a battery is classified can include, as examples, any one or more of the following: state of charge, charge current (average, peak, etc.), voltage responses (which may be provided at various time or frequency regimes), etc.</p><heading id="h-0012" level="1">C. Developing the Model</heading><p id="p-0101" num="0102">To develop a battery model, a group of batteries such as those of a particular battery type provided by a particular vendor is analyzed for such factors as the state of health of the battery under various conditions, the failure of the battery, and safety issues. Safety issues include such issues as plating of metal onto the anode during charge and consequent formation of conductive dendrites, loss of battery electrolyte, swelling, and fire or explosion of the battery.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0103">The computational system or individual(s) charged with developing the model analyzes some or all of the above-identified input variables for patterns or trends that are reflected in a computational model that classifies batteries based on values of the input variables (charge process parameters). Information about each battery including battery charge process parameters and associated battery charge process characteristics/classifications may collectively serve as a training set for developing the battery model.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0104">Batteries chosen for study in developing a model may be selected based on various criteria. As mentioned, they may all be of the same type, but in some cases other criteria are used. For example, the batteries may be selected based on differences in how a battery operates, which may be determined based on physical know-how. Thus, in some cases, an expert possessing such knowledge considers model empirical parameters that may be due to, e.g., manufacturing variability and factors this association into choosing batteries for developing a battery model. In other cases, a computational system selects batteries to be analyzed for developing a battery model.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0105">The mechanics of developing a battery model can take various forms.

Using the Model</heading><p id="p-0106" num="0107">A model may be executed at any of various locations. In certain embodiments, logic for executing the battery model resides entirely on the device or the device charger (e.g., with a battery pack or a processor used by the device for other purposes). In certain embodiments, logic for executing the battery model resides at a remote location (e.g., a cloud or a server under the control the battery manufacturer, the device manufacturer, or the battery charging/monitoring system provider). In certain embodiments, logic for executing the battery model is distributed between local and remote resources.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0108">As explained, in some implementations, battery control logic may monitor or otherwise determine parameters associated with a charging process. Some of these may be used as battery charging process parameters, e.g., inputs to a battery model. These parameters may be provided directly or indirectly from the measurement circuitry. See e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Raw battery measurements taken by the measurement circuitry include but are not limited to temperature, voltage, current, charge passed, and time from or between events. In some embodiments, raw battery measurements are passed to the control circuitry, which may employ logic to determine parameters such as SOC, SOH, overpotential, and PRT. Depending on the design of the battery model, any raw or derived measurements and parameters may be used by battery models. As an example, measurements such as a battery's SOC are made directly by measurement circuitry and passed to a battery model. Raw and/or derived parameters may be stored locally or on a remote device and provided, at an appropriate time, to the battery model for analysis and ultimately to provide a battery charge process classification. The analyzed present and/or historical data and/or battery charge process classification may be fed back into the battery control logic to allow for, e.g., adaptive charging, safety alerts, etc.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0109">In some implementations, battery models are trained or further refined over time, such as when service data from one or more batteries is collected, to improve the performance of the models. In some cases, multiple batteries, such as batteries on phones, can provide information that serves as data points for further training a model. For example, when a battery experiences failure, as detected by the device or by a user, the data leading up to or otherwise associated with the failure can be used to improve the accuracy of a battery model. This approach may, e.g., identify rare manufacturing defects.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0110">The model results or outputs may be treated or used in various ways. In one approach, model results/outputs broadly classify a battery as behaving (a) as expected for a normal battery of similar age, (b) in a way suggesting a premature failure risk, or (c) in a way that poses a safety risk. If the battery is behaving as expected, the battery charging system may adapt the charge protocol to permit faster charging. If the battery is behaving in a way suggesting that it might fail prematurely, the battery charging system or other logic may send an alert to the user, and/or the manufacturer, and/or adapt the charging protocol to extend the battery life. If an alert is sent, it might trigger a warranty clause for the device and/or battery, and/or it might suggest early replacement of the battery. If the battery is behaving in a way that poses a safety risk, the responsible system may shut down the device and send a warning to immediately replace the battery or device or take some other precaution.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Characterizing Battery Physical Phenomena</heading><heading id="h-0015" level="1">a. Time Regimes and Battery Phenomena</heading><p id="p-0110" num="0111">Battery performance is affected by various phenomena, each having an associated response time to events that can occur during battery charging. While not an exhaustive list, three classes of phenomena will be used as examples: (1) lithium ion transport in electrolyte, (2) reaction kinetics occurring at the electrode surface (often the anode), and (3) lithium ion diffusion within the solid matrix of an electrode (anode or cathode). Understand that while this disclosure frequently makes reference to lithium ions, the disclosed concepts extend to battery systems that employ other types of current carrying ions such as sodium ions.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0112">Lithium-ion transport in a battery's electrolyte, which may be quiescent, is typically caused by some combination of migration (movement of charged species in an electric field) and diffusion (movement driven by a concentration gradient) in the electrolyte. This transport is a relatively fast process and is reflected in data obtained (i) with a high-frequency stimulus (e.g., a high frequency current signal applied in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) and/or (ii) at short times after a stimulus is applied. The response time of lithium ions in a battery electrolyte is typically on the order of a few to tens of milliseconds, although it may be slower in some types of electrolytes, particularly some solid state electrolytes, in which case the response time is typically on the order of up to about 1 to 5 seconds. Transport of metal ions in a liquid battery electrolyte may be reflected in battery response characteristics such as partial relaxation time (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i></figref>).</p><p id="p-0112" num="0113">Kinetics of reactions taking place at the interface of the electrode(s) in a battery are governed by various factors. In the anode or negative electrode (during charging), the changes in the reaction kinetics can reflect the growth of an SEI layer and/or the nature of electrochemical reactions at the interface. These phenomena are noticeable in data acquired in response to an intermediate frequency stimulus in the case of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The response time of an interfacial reaction in a battery is typically on the order of a few milliseconds and is typically longer than the response time of ion transport in the electrolyte. Interfacial reactions at battery's electrode surface (e.g., anode surface) may be reflected in battery response characteristics such as partial relaxation time, overpotential, and CPV.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0114">Transport of lithium ions in the solid electrode material such as carbon or silicon or metal oxide may be reflected by the diffusion of lithium ions in the solid matrix of the electrode. Characterization of this phenomenon can be obtained using relatively low frequency stimulation. The response time of diffusion of metal ions in an anode active material (e.g., lithium ions in graphite) of a battery is typically on the order of few to tens of seconds and is typically longer than the response time of reaction kinetics at the electrolyte-electrode interface. Transport of metal ions in the solid particles of the electrode may be reflected in battery response characteristics such as charge pulse voltage (CPV) and relaxation time.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0115">Note that a response time in a battery may be measured from a step or pulse and may be characterized by a time constant. In this context, a time constant may be understood to represent the elapsed time required for the battery response to decay to a near-equilibrium value if the system had continued to decay at the initial rate. In the case of an exponential decay, the response will have actually decreased in value to in this time (from a step decrease). In an increasing exponential system, the time constant is the time for the battery's response to reach its final (asymptotic) value (from a step increase). For certain battery processes, the rate of decay is close to an exponential decay, but it is not actually an exponential decay.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0116">The time constant for full relaxation is on the order of hundreds of milliseconds to seconds. The time constant for CPV is similar. The time constant for partial relaxation is on the order of tens of milliseconds. As explained, each reflect a different process within the battery. Each is also stimulated by a &#x201c;pulse&#x201d; or &#x201c;edge&#x201d; of sufficient bandwidth (i.e., contains enough harmonics). Regarding measurement of relaxation time versus partial relaxation time, shorter measurement duration (after application of the current edge or other stimulus) and faster sampling tend toward partial relaxation time, while longer measurement duration and slower sampling tend toward full relaxation time. In certain embodiments, although this is not required, relaxation time is measured with a positive current step or pulse, and partial relaxation time is measured with a negative current step or pulse.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="1">a. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy</heading><p id="p-0116" num="0117">Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is conventionally performed by applying a small excitation signal, typically an AC potential, to the electrochemical cell and measuring the resulting current through the cell. Assuming that a sinusoidal excitation potential is applied, the response is a sinusoidal current signal. By measuring the amplitude of the response and the phase difference between the excitation and response, both as a function of applied frequency, a test system can provide information about the mechanisms or performance of the electrochemical cell. This information includes or is influenced by the response times discussed above.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0118">Approaches to analyzing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data often model electrochemical cells using equivalent circuit elements such as resistors and capacitors. Charge transfer, reaction kinetics, diffusion, and other electrochemical phenomena can be represented as circuit elements, and a battery can be represented as one or more circuits having such elements arranged in series or parallel or a combination of series and parallel. Some models use empirically derived elements as alternatives to or partial substitutes for physical model elements (e.g., physical circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, and combinations thereof).</p><p id="p-0118" num="0119">Some electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tools attempt to find a model whose calculated impedance matches the measured impedance of a battery under consideration. When model parameters provide good agreement with observed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results, the model parameters can provide good physical insight into the operation of a battery. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is further described in the book &#x201c;Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy and its Applications,&#x201d; by A. Lasia, (2014), Springer, published by Springer, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0120">In certain embodiments, an EIS applied stimulus is provided by superimposing a known signal of a single frequency and scanning the frequency. In some implementations, EIS applied stimulus is provided in the form of current pulses at various frequencies where a particular type of battery phenomenon can be characterized. In certain embodiments, a battery is probed, in situ, by applying a signal of various harmonic frequencies during battery charging or during some other time. As with conventional EIS, the applied pulses may include a wide range of frequencies, which may be provided over a continuous or near continuous range. Alternatively, discrete ranges of frequency can be applied. In all cases, the response of the battery is monitored. Together the voltage and current values provide impedance information used to characterize the battery. In some scenarios, the stimulus is current and the measured response voltage. However, the reverse can be employed.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0121">As mentioned, lithium-ion transport in an electrolyte is a relatively fast process, which means that it is reflected in high-frequency data determined with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Examples of such frequencies are in the range of about 100 Hz to 2 kHz, or equivalently short durations of time, e.g., about 10 ms to 100 ms. Kinetics of reactions taking place at the interface of the electrode are noticeable in data acquired at intermediate frequencies, e.g., frequencies in the range of about 10 Hz to 0.5 kHz, or equivalently short durations of time, e.g., about 2 ms to 100 ms. Diffusion of lithium ions in the solid anode material such as carbon or silicon can be characterized at relatively low excitation frequencies, e.g., frequencies in the range of about 1 mHz to 1 Hz, or equivalently longer durations of time, e.g., about 1 second to 1,000 seconds.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0122">Data collected over a range of frequencies in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is commonly presented in a Bode plot or a Nyquist plot; the latter shows the value of the imaginary component of impedance as a function of the real component of impedance. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows an example Nyquist plot for a lithium ion battery (adapted from Comsol Blog, Tommy Zavalis, July 2015, comsol.com/blogs/studying-impedance-to-analyze-the-li-ion-battery-with-an-app/). As can be seen, the plot includes distinct portions that are associated with the three relevant battery physical-chemical phenomena. The curves in the mid and high-frequency ranges may reflect ion transport in a liquid electrolyte, charging of double layers on the materials within the electrode, and resistances of the electrode materials and resistive films. The mid-frequency curve reflects the rate of a charge transfer reaction. The lower frequencies curve or tail reflects ionic diffusion within the active electrode materials. The location and size of the tail may be controlled by the diffusion constants and the particle size for the electrode material. Each such zone reflects physical and material properties underlying the relevant physical-chemical phenomena. As a battery ages or otherwise changes, the impedance information in one or more of these regimes correspondingly changes.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0123">The impedance measurements can be used with a battery model to characterize the battery phenomena. In certain embodiments, one may vary model parameters to determine what features of a battery affect the impedance at a particular frequency or particular frequencies. Alternatively, one can fit the model to experimental impedance data through an optimization procedure and examine the properties.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0124">In certain embodiments, a battery system is designed or configured to conduct EIS in situ, i.e., while the battery is installed in a device such as a consumer electronics device (phone, camera, etc.) or a vehicle (e.g., a car, truck, airplane, boat, or motorcycle). In certain embodiments, the system conducts EIS at times when battery is being charged and/or is not being used (e.g., when the battery is not being discharged; typically when an end user is not using the device). The system may conduct EIS by applying current pulses at different frequencies and measuring the resulting terminal voltage amplitude and phase. It may scan an entire spectrum of frequencies, from mHz to kHz, or a subset. In some implementations, the system applies voltage pulses and measures the battery's current response (at one or both of the battery's terminals). The battery system may be designed or configured to conduct EIS in a way that captures information spanning a range of battery conditions: e.g., the system conducts EIS at different states of charge, different temperatures, etc.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0125">The system may be configured to analyze EIS results (e.g., magnitude and phase of voltage) as a function of at least the applied current frequency and magnitude. It may also analyze these results in terms of one or more of the following battery parameters: temperature, state of charge, and health or age (e.g., number of charge cycles, days in service, etc.). From the EIS results, the system may determine whether a battery is behaving (a) as expected for a normal battery of similar age, (b) in a way suggesting a premature degradation or failure risk, or (c) in a way that poses a safety risk. For example, a measurement of the ionic diffusion in an electrode at a particular SOC and/or temperature is reflective of the integrity of the electrode material and battery design. Mechanical stress in the electrode or fracture of the electrode material grains may lead to slower detected diffusion as observed from low frequency information. Similarly, thickening of the solid-electrolyte-interface (SEI) layer may be reflected in slower detected diffusion as well as worsening surface properties measured as observed from mid frequency information. If the battery is behaving as expected, the system may consider adapting the charging protocol to permit faster charging. If the battery is behaving in a way suggesting that it might fail prematurely, the system may send an alert to the user and/or the manufacture. If such alert is sent, it might trigger a warranty clause for the device and/or battery, and/or it might suggest early replacement of the battery. Alternatively or in addition, if the battery is behaving in a way suggesting that it might fail prematurely, the system may adapt the charging protocol to extend the battery life. If the battery is behaving in a way that poses a safety risk, the system might shut down the device and send a warning to immediately replace the battery or device or take some other precaution. A safety risk might arise if the system detects significant plating of lithium, a high temperature excursion, significant electrolyte degradation, or the like.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>a </i></figref>presents an example process flow for implementing an in situ frequency domain analysis of a battery.

Analysis of the resulting data may be conducted in the frequency domain as is conventional in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. For example, rather than applying current pulses at various frequencies, a battery system may apply discrete current pulses (e.g., charge and discharge pulses) and measure voltage at various times after the current pulse(s). The current pulse(s) and resulting voltage variations can be decomposed into its various frequency (or harmonic) components that constitute the pulse(s).

In this manner, the system can perform all calculations in the time domain, without ever transitioning to the frequency domain. The timescale of particular data obtained in the time domain corresponds to the inverse values of particular frequencies, which correlate with different classes of battery physical phenomena as discussed above. When conducting battery analyses in the time domain, an edge of an applied current signal, which edge might or might not begin or end at 0 Amps, serves as a stimulus that allows measurement of response voltage across the battery terminals at various times after the edge is applied, with those various times corresponding to various frequencies.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0133"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b><i>b </i></figref>presents an example process flow for implementing an in situ time domain analysis, at least partially, of a battery.
