free nucleic acids from a test sample obtained from an individual are analyzed to identify possible fusion events. Cell free nucleic acids are sequenced and processed to generate fragments. Fragments are decomposed into kmers and the kmers are either analyzed de novo or compared to targeted nucleic acid sequences that are known to be associated with fusion gene pairs of interest. Thus, kmers that may have originated from a fusion event can be identified. These kmers are consolidated to generate gene ranges from various genes that match sequences in the fragment. A candidate fusion event can be called given the spanning of one or more gene ranges across the fragment.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="182.03mm" wi="109.81mm" file="US20230002824A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00001" num="00001"><img id="EMI-D00001" he="211.50mm" wi="111.84mm" file="US20230002824A1-20230105-D00001.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00002" num="00002"><img id="EMI-D00002" he="238.51mm" wi="157.48mm" file="US20230002824A1-20230105-D00002.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00003" num="00003"><img id="EMI-D00003" he="193.55mm" wi="120.06mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230002824A1-20230105-D00003.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00004" num="00004"><img id="EMI-D00004" he="230.80mm" wi="141.14mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230002824A1-20230105-D00004.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00005" num="00005"><img id="EMI-D00005" he="191.77mm" wi="135.13mm" file="US20230002824A1-20230105-D00005.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00006" num="00006"><img id="EMI-D00006" he="200.07mm" wi="103.46mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230002824A1-20230105-D00006.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00007" num="00007"><img id="EMI-D00007" he="218.86mm" wi="115.06mm" orientation="landscape" file="US20230002824A1-20230105-D00007.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00008" num="00008"><img id="EMI-D00008" he="222.93mm" wi="110.15mm" file="US20230002824A1-20230105-D00008.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00009" num="00009"><img id="EMI-D00009" he="206.16mm" wi="168.99mm" file="US20230002824A1-20230105-D00009.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00010" num="00010"><img id="EMI-D00010" he="194.48mm" wi="164.76mm" file="US20230002824A1-20230105-D00010.TIF" alt="embedded image" img-content="drawing" img-format="tif"/></figure></drawings><description id="description"><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of U.S. application Ser.

Most of the existing methods have been developed for calling fusions from sequencing data obtained from a tissue sample. These methods may not be suitable for calling fusions from sequencing data obtained from a cell-free nucleic acid sample.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">For non-invasive diagnostic and monitoring of cancer, cell free nucleic acid data serve as an important bio-source. However, fusion detection in such data type poses distinct challenges: the number of sequenced molecules could be at least an order of magnitude larger (&#x2dc;400M cell free nucleic acid molecules vs. &#x2dc;20M nucleic acid molecules derived from tissue), debilitating most of the existing fusion callers in compute-time and memory usage. Cancer allele fraction has been shown to be low in cell free nucleotide data compared to tissue biopsy which requires pushing the sensitivity to be significantly higher than the state-of-art methods, all of which currently have lower than a 75% true positive rate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Generally speaking, existing fusion detection methods share common paradigms of relying on alignment of input reads against the reference genome to identify discordant alignments that may be the result of fusion events. However, when relying on alignment, once a fusion supporting read is misaligned (such as been reported as soft-clipped event), it can no longer be recovered downstream, thereby leading to reading inaccuracies. Some may further try assembling these input reads to obtain longer contigs (e.g., overlapping nucleic acid segments representing a consensus region) in hopes of more accurate alignment. The retained discordant reads are further inspected to determine the support of each fusion event. One of the important goals of these methods is to identify novel fusions that may be potentially interesting, however, this makes them very vulnerable to false positive discoveries that are of unknown clinical relevance.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Disclosed herein are methods for analyzing nucleic acid sequencing data to identify and call candidate fusion events. The nucleic acid sequencing data may be generated from cell free DNA (cfDNA) or cell free RNA (cfRNA). Embodiments of the method involve processing sequencing data into fragments and further decomposing fragments into kmers. Generally, the kmers are analyzed to call a candidate fusion event. More specifically, identified kmers are consolidated to generate gene ranges from various genes that match sequences in the fragment from the sequencing data. A candidate fusion event can be called given the spanning of one or more gene ranges across the fragment.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The disclosed method enables the targeting of data (e.g., &#x2dc;400M nucleic acid molecules) that is an order of magnitude larger than molecules sequenced from solid tissue biopsies. In one embodiment, fusion events are identified from fusion gene pairs that have been previously reported. This process is hereafter referred to as the targeted method. The targeted method enables the identification of fusion events that are relevant for diseases (e.g., related to cancer). The method is efficient and scalable (in terms of input number of reads) which provides for a low compute cost in terms of both computer process power and time required to run the method. In a different embodiment, fusion events are identified de novo (e.g., without guidance from previously known fusion gene pairs). This process is hereafter referred to as the de novo method. The de novo method enables the identification of new fusion events that can be indicative of disease.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Advantages of the disclosed alignment-free method of detecting fusion events include 1) improved speed (e.g., reduced runtime) in detecting fusion events and 2) reduced consumption of computer resources, such as computer memory. As an example, the method disclosed herein enables the processing of &#x2dc;4000 sequence reads per thread on a computing device and consumes an estimated 15 Gigabytes/1 million read pairs. This represents an improvement in comparison to conventional alignment fusion callers, an example of which is the STAR-Fusion caller that consumes &#x3e;40 Gigabytes to perform the alignment process.

The method <b>100</b> includes, but is not limited to, the following steps.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">At step <b>105</b>, nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) are extracted from a test sample. In various embodiments, the test sample may be a sample selected from the group consisting of blood, plasma, serum, urine, fecal, and saliva samples. Alternatively, the biological sample may comprise a sample selected from the group consisting of whole blood, a blood fraction, a tissue biopsy, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, and peritoneal fluid. In one embodiment, the test sample may comprise cell-free nucleic acids, examples of which are cell-free DNA and/or cell-free RNA. For example, the test sample can be a cell-free nucleic acid sample taken from a subject's blood. In one embodiment, the cell free nucleic acid sample is extracted from a test sample obtained from a subject known to have cancer (e.g., a cancer patient), or a subject suspected of having cancer.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The following description related to fusion calling may be applicable to both DNA and RNA types of nucleic acid sequences. In various embodiments, nucleic acids are extracted from the test sample through a purification process. In general, any known method in the art can be used for purifying nucleic acids. For example, nucleic acids can be isolated by pelleting and/or precipitating the nucleic acids in a tube. In some embodiments, nucleic acids can be further processed. For example, the cell free nucleic acid extracted from the test sample can be RNA that is then converted to DNA using reverse transcriptase.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">At step <b>110</b>, a sequencing library is prepared. During library preparation, adapters, for example, include one or more sequencing oligonucleotides for use in subsequent cluster generation and/or sequencing (e.g., known P5 and P7 sequences for used in sequencing by synthesis (SBS) (Illumina, San Diego, Calif.)) are ligated to the ends of the nucleic acid molecules through adapter ligation. In one embodiment, unique molecular identifiers (UMI) are added to the extracted nucleic acids during adapter ligation. The UMIs are short nucleic acid sequences (e.g., 4-10 base pairs) that are added to ends of nucleic acids during adapter ligation. In some embodiments, UMIs are degenerate base pairs that serve as a unique tag that can be used to identify sequence reads obtained from nucleic acids. As described later, the UMIs can be further replicated along with the attached nucleic acids during amplification, which provides a way to identify sequence reads that originate from the same original nucleic acid segment in downstream analysis.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">Steps <b>115</b> and <b>120</b> may be optionally performed. As one example, steps <b>115</b> and <b>120</b> are performed when generating sequence reads through a targeted gene panel. As another example, steps <b>115</b> and <b>120</b> are performed when generating sequence reads through whole exome sequencing. Conversely, steps <b>115</b> and <b>120</b> are not performed when generating sequence reads through whole genome sequencing.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">Specifically, at step <b>115</b>, hybridization probes are used to enrich a sequencing library for a selected set of nucleic acids. Hybridization probes can be designed to target and hybridize with targeted nucleic acid sequences to pull down and enrich targeted nucleic acid molecules that may be informative for the presence or absence of cancer (or disease), cancer status, or a cancer classification (e.g., cancer type or tissue of origin). In accordance with this step, a plurality of hybridization pull down probes can be used for a given target sequence or gene. The probes can range in length from about 40 to about 160 base pairs (bp), from about 60 to about 120 bp, or from about 70 bp to about 100 bp. In one embodiment, the probes cover overlapping portions of the target region or gene. For targeted gene panel sequencing, the hybridization probes are designed to target and pull down nucleic acid molecules that derive from specific gene sequences that are included in the targeted gene panel. For whole exome sequencing, the hybridization probes are designed to target and pull down nucleic acid molecules that derive from exon sequences in a reference genome.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">After a hybridization step <b>115</b>, the hybridized nucleic acid molecules are enriched <b>120</b>. For example, the hybridized nucleic acid molecules can be captured and amplified using PCR. The target sequences can be enriched to obtain enriched sequences that can be subsequently sequenced. For example, as is well known in the art, a biotin moiety can be added to the 5&#x2032;-end of the probes (i.e., biotinylated) to facilitate pulling down of target probe-nucleic acids complexes using a streptavidin-coated surface (e.g., streptavidin-coated beads). This improves the sequencing depth of sequence reads.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In step <b>125</b>, the nucleic acids are sequenced to generate sequence reads. Sequence reads may be acquired by known means in the art. For example, a number of techniques and platforms obtain sequence reads directly from millions of individual nucleic acid (e.g., DNA such as cfDNA or gDNA or RNA such as cfRNA) molecules in parallel. Such techniques can be suitable for performing any of targeted gene panel sequencing, whole exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing, targeted gene panel bisulfite sequencing, and whole genome bisulfite sequencing.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">As a first example, sequencing-by-synthesis technologies rely on the detection of fluorescent nucleotides as they are incorporated into a nascent strand of DNA that is complementary to the template being sequenced. In one method, oligonucleotides 30-50 bases in length are covalently anchored at the 5&#x2032; end to glass cover slips. These anchored strands perform two functions. First, they act as capture sites for the target template strands if the templates are configured with capture tails complementary to the surface-bound oligonucleotides. They also act as primers for the template directed primer extension that forms the basis of the sequence reading. The capture primers function as a fixed position site for sequence determination using multiple cycles of synthesis, detection, and chemical cleavage of the dye-linker to remove the dye. Each cycle consists of adding the polymerase/labeled nucleotide mixture, rinsing, imaging and cleavage of dye.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an alternative method, polymerase is modified with a fluorescent donor molecule and immobilized on a glass slide, while each nucleotide is color-coded with an acceptor fluorescent moiety attached to a gamma-phosphate. The system detects the interaction between a fluorescently-tagged polymerase and a fluorescently modified nucleotide as the nucleotide becomes incorporated into the de novo chain.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Any suitable sequencing-by-synthesis platform can be used to identify mutations. Sequencing-by-synthesis platforms include the Genome Sequencers from Roche/454 Life Sciences, the GENOME ANALYZER from Illumina/SOLEXA, the SOLID system from Applied BioSystems, and the HELISCOPE system from Helicos Biosciences. Sequencing-by-synthesis platforms have also been described by VisiGen Biotechnologies. In some embodiments, a plurality of nucleic acid molecules being sequenced is bound to a support (e.g., solid support). To immobilize the nucleic acid on a support, a capture sequence/universal priming site can be added at the 3&#x2032; and/or 5&#x2032; end of the template. The nucleic acids can be bound to the support by hybridizing the capture sequence to a complementary sequence covalently attached to the support. The capture sequence (also referred to as a universal capture sequence) is a nucleic acid sequence complementary to a sequence attached to a support that may dually serve as a universal primer.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">As an alternative to a capture sequence, a member of a coupling pair (such as, e.g., antibody/antigen, receptor/ligand, or the avidin-biotin pair) can be linked to each molecule to be captured on a surface coated with a respective second member of that coupling pair. Subsequent to the capture, the sequence can be analyzed, for example, by single molecule detection/sequencing, including template-dependent sequencing-by-synthesis. In sequencing-by-synthesis, the surface-bound molecule is exposed to a plurality of labeled nucleotide triphosphates in the presence of polymerase. The sequence of the template is determined by the order of labeled nucleotides incorporated into the 3&#x2032; end of the growing chain. This can be done in real time or can be done in a step-and-repeat mode. For real-time analysis, different optical labels to each nucleotide can be incorporated and multiple lasers can be utilized for stimulation of incorporated nucleotides.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Massively parallel sequencing or next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques include synthesis technology, pyrosequencing, ion semiconductor technology, single-molecule real-time sequencing, sequencing by ligation, or paired-end sequencing. Examples of massively parallel sequencing platforms are the Illumina HISEQ or MISEQ, ION PERSONAL GENOME MACHINE, the PACBIO RSII sequencer or SEQUEL System, Qiagen's GENEREADER, and the Oxford MINION. Additional similar current massively parallel sequencing technologies can be used, as well as future generations of these technologies.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In various embodiments, a sequence read is comprised of a read pair denoted as R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2</sub>. For example, the first read R<sub>1 </sub>may be sequenced from a first end of a nucleic acid molecule whereas the second read R<sub>2 </sub>may be sequenced from the second end of the nucleic acid molecule.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Optionally, at step <b>130</b>, the sequence reads generated at step <b>125</b> undergo a pre-filtering step to remove sequence reads. Generally, step <b>130</b> is performed depending on whether DNA or RNA is extracted from the test sample at step <b>105</b>. For example, if the flow process <b>100</b> is a DNA fusion caller, then step <b>130</b> is performed to pre-filter sequence reads that are generated from DNA extracted from the test sample. Alternatively, if the flow process <b>100</b> is a RNA fusion caller, then step <b>130</b> is not performed. The pre-filtering process is described in further detail below in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Following step <b>130</b>, sequence reads are processed using a computational analysis to call a fusion event. Such a computational analysis is now described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, which depicts an overall workflow of identifying fusion pair events, in accordance with an embodiment. Generally, the computational analysis is an alignment-free filtering fusion fragment (AF4) caller where the sequence reads generated at step <b>125</b> need not be aligned to a reference genome. In one embodiment, the computational analysis is an AF4 caller that uses the targeted method (e.g., targeted AF4 caller) to predict the presence of gene fusion event(s) in the individual by utilizing previously known gene fusion events. Thus, the targeted AF4 caller need not analyze the entire genome to identify fusion events. In another embodiment, the computational analysis is an AF4 caller that uses the de novo method (e.g., de novo AF4 caller) to predict the presence of gene fusion event(s) in the individual without prior knowledge. Here, the de novo AF4 caller can potentially identify fusion events at different locations in the genome that the targeted AF4 caller may miss. Particular differences between the targeted AF4 caller and the de novo AF4 caller are described in further detail below in relation to steps <b>215</b> and <b>220</b>.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">At step <b>205</b>, sequence reads are obtained (e.g., from step <b>125</b>). At step <b>210</b>, given sequencing data, the sequencing data are streamed in batches such that a limited number of records of the sequencing data are loaded in the memory that can be processed in parallel. Records may include a sequence read, an example of which is a pair of sequence reads, hereafter referred to as read pair (e.g., r<sub>1 </sub>and r<sub>2</sub>).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Steps <b>215</b> and <b>220</b> are optionally performed and utilize information previously known to be associated with fusion events. Namely, steps <b>215</b> and <b>220</b> are performed for the targeted AF4 caller whereas steps <b>215</b> and <b>220</b> are not performed for the de novo AF4 caller. Specifically, at step <b>215</b>, known cancer-related fusion events can be obtained. For example, a target list of known gene fusions (herein referred to as &#x201c;fusion-related genes&#x201d;) can be obtained from one or more publicly available databases and the gene pairs associated with each fusion event identified (e.g., identified by their gene symbols). In one example, the targeted fusions are cancer-related fusion events and the list of fusion-related genes and associated fusion-related gene pairs are obtained from the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">At step <b>220</b>, the cancer-related fusion events are analyzed to obtain fusion genes and gene pairs. Fusion genes refer to hybrid genes that are formed from two previously separate genes. A gene pair refers to the two previously separate genes that lead to a fusion gene. Here, the fusion genes and the gene pairs correspond to cancer-related fusion events and as such, can be informative for predicting cancer-related activity in an individual. The fusion gene and gene pair can be subsequently used (e.g., at step <b>230</b>) to guide the generation of an indexing structure.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Steps <b>225</b> and <b>230</b> generally establish the search space for subsequent identification of fusion events in newly acquired RNA or DNA sequencing data from a test sample of interest. For example, for a targeted AF4 caller, steps <b>225</b> and <b>230</b> use the obtained fusion gene and gene pairs corresponding to the known cancer-related fusion events determined at step <b>220</b> to establish a reduced search space. Therefore, candidate fusion events identified using the targeted AF4 caller correspond to known cancer-related fusion events. On the contrary, for a de novo AF4 caller, steps <b>225</b> and <b>230</b> establish a search space that can include the entirety of the genome. Therefore, candidate fusion events identified using the de novo AF4 caller can be fusion events across the entirety of the genome.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">At step <b>225</b>, reference nucleic acid sequences are generated. A reference nucleic acid sequence can include one of RNA sequences or DNA sequences depending on whether the AF4 caller is a RNA fusion caller or a DNA fusion caller. Generally, the totality of reference nucleic acid sequences represent an initial search space that possible fusion events are subsequently searched against. In particular embodiments, if the AF4 caller is a RNA fusion caller, a reference nucleic acid sequence includes messenger RNA sequences of a transcriptome. Therefore, the reference nucleic acid sequence includes sequences that encode for proteins, which enables subsequent identification of candidate fusion events that affect encoded proteins. In some embodiments, if the AF4 caller is a DNA fusion caller, a reference nucleic acid sequence includes DNA sequences across a region of the genome, such as a chromosome. The reference nucleic acid sequence including DNA sequences across the region of the genome can be used to identify candidate fusion events that affect that particular region of the genome.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">For a DNA AF4 caller, in some embodiments, a reference nucleic acid sequence can include exonic DNA sequences. Thus, this reference nucleic acid sequence can be used to identify candidate fusion events that affect exonic DNA sequences. Such an embodiment is described below in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. In some embodiments, the reference nucleic acid sequence includes, in addition to exonic DNA sequences, intronic DNA sequences.

Each kmer can then be used as a key to look up in the indexing structure a possible geneID (e.g., g&#x2032;) and position (e.g., p&#x2032;). The kmer length (k) is selected such that a kmer does not randomly occur in sequences corresponding to the targeted fusions and meanwhile, it is trusted to be the minimum length evidence of a fusion event. In one example, a kmer length range is from about 5 bases to about 20 bases, from about 7 bases to about 18 bases, or from about 10 bases to about 17 bases. In some embodiments, a kmer size range from about 12 bases to about 15 bases is sufficient to cover one side of a junction in a fusion sequence.

In various embodiments, the sequencing data includes a single read or a read pair (r<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub>).

As an example, a gene map corresponding to the kmers can be created as follows in Table 1:</p><p id="p-0090" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Example kmer to gene mapping table</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>i<sup>th </sup></entry><entry>kmer Position </entry><entry>Position [Beginning, </entry><entry/></row><row><entry>kmer</entry><entry>on Fragment</entry><entry>End] on Fragment</entry><entry>Gene</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>1</entry><entry>p<sub>1</sub></entry><entry>[p<sub>b1</sub>, p<sub>e1</sub>]</entry><entry>g</entry></row><row><entry>2</entry><entry>p<sub>2</sub></entry><entry>[p<sub>b2</sub>, p<sub>e2</sub>]</entry><entry>g, g&#x2032;</entry></row><row><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry/><entry>.</entry></row><row><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry/><entry>.</entry></row><row><entry>.</entry><entry>.</entry><entry/><entry>.</entry></row><row><entry>N</entry><entry>p<sub>N</sub></entry><entry>[p<sub>bN</sub>, p<sub>eN</sub>]</entry><entry>g&#x2032;</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables><br/>In various embodiments, each kmer is one base pair shifted from the previous kmer. For example, the 1<sup>st </sup>kmer (e.g., i=1) can correspond to a position p1 of [1, k] where k is the length of the kmer. The 2<sup>nd </sup>kmer (e.g., i=2) can corresponds to a position p2 of [2, k+1] and so on for the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th </sup>. . . and Nth kmer.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0089">The data in Table 1 is indexed by kmer (e.g., the ith kmer). The data in Table 1 can be similarly expressed using a gene as the index. Then for each gene g so identified, all positions on fragment s that corresponds to a kmer that is found on gene g can be accumulated.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0090">Given all positions on fragment s that include a kmer that is found on a gene g, gene ranges that correspond to positions on fragment s can be constructed. For example, multiple kmers that are overlapping with one another (also referred to as overlapping kmers) on both the fragment s and a gene g can be combined to generate a gene range. Specifically, the gene ranges on gene g that correspond to kmers of fragment s can be represented as a list of ranges R<sub>g</sub>=(R<sub>g0</sub>, R<sub>g1</sub>, . . . , R<sub>gn&#x2212;1</sub>), where the i<sup>th </sup>range R<sub>gi</sub>=[p<sub>bi</sub><sup>g</sup>,p<sub>ei</sub><sup>g</sup>] for 0&#x2264;p<sub>ei</sub><sup>g</sup>&#x2264;|s|. The length of each range R<sub>gi </sub>can be expressed as L<sub>i</sub><sup>g</sup>=(p<sub>ei</sub><sup>g</sup>&#x2212;p<sub>bi</sub><sup>g</sup>+1). The notation p<sub>bi</sub><sup>g </sup>represents the beginning position of the i<sup>th </sup>range on fragment s that is correspondingly found on gene g. The notation p<sub>ei</sub><sup>g </sup>represents the end position of the i<sup>th </sup>range on fragment s that can be found on gene g. The notation Is denotes the length of string s.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0091">The ranges included in the list of ranges R<sub>g </sub>are sorted in an increasing order according to their increasing position on the fragment s.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0092">Referring again to the example shown in Table 1, an example range R<sub>g0 </sub>of gene g can be expressed as R<sub>g0</sub>=[p<sub>b1</sub>&#x2212;p<sub>e2</sub>] given that gene g has been identified to correspond to both the first and second kmer in fragment s. In other words, the range R<sub>g0 </sub>of gene g can be consolidated from overlapping kmers that have each been identified to correspond to the common gene g.</p><p id="p-0095" num="0093">As pointed out earlier, kmers of a given range of fragment s may come from different regions of a sequence of gene g, causing false positive association of the range with gene g. To reduce the false positive rate, a spanning criterion can be imposed (1): any gene that spans a large portion of either r<sub>1 </sub>or r<sub>2 </sub>is identified, where each of these genes then can be paired with the remaining genes to be considered further. As an example, the spanning criterion is a threshold length of nucleotide bases (e.g., large portion refers to greater than 50% of a single nucleotide strand) of either r<sub>1 </sub>or r<sub>2 </sub>should belong to one of a fusion genes involved in the fusion event.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0094">In various embodiments, an upper bound of spanning criterion is imposed. An upper-bound is imposed because the overlapping regions of g and g&#x2032; on s could be double counted. This upper-bound serves as a filtering strategy to eliminate unnecessary inference of how the fragment s may be spanned by both genes. Additionally, imposing an upper bound reduces the search space and speeds up subsequent computations. Meanwhile, the gene pairs under consideration are constrained to have known associations to form fusion pairs but do not expect them to have the exact breakpoints as identified in the literature. Once this upper-bound is satisfied, a tighter bound is calculated by deriving the maximum span of fragment s by combining two range lists of g and g&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0095">For ease of understanding, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts an example embodiment of inferring regions of read fragment s <b>405</b> spanned by gene fragments from two genes g <b>510</b> and g&#x2032; <b>515</b>. In this particular example, fragment s is shown as an arrow and g <b>510</b> and g&#x2032; <b>515</b> are two genes inferred to span certain regions of s with each region represented by a short line positioned at the part of s it spans (the range is confined by dotted lines). In various embodiments, further comparisons can be conducted using gene ranges by comparing each gene g and g&#x2032; with additional genes represented as g&#x2033;, g&#x2032;&#x2033;, and the like.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0096">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the fragment s <b>405</b> is spanned by two ranges on gene g&#x2032; <b>515</b> (e.g., Range R<sub>g&#x2032;0 </sub>and R<sub>g&#x2032;1</sub>) and is further spanned by four ranges on gene g <b>510</b> (e.g., Ranges R<sub>g0</sub>, R<sub>g1</sub>, R<sub>g2</sub>, and R<sub>g3</sub>).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Determining Maximum Gene Span Using a Support Value</heading><p id="p-0099" num="0097">At step <b>275</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the maximum gene span is inferred for each pair of genes, such as gene pair g and g&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Generally, the maximum gene span for a pair of genes is determined by analyzing the gene ranges on each of the genes in the pair that map to fragment s. The maximum gene span represents the longest spanning gene ranges found on the two genes in the pair (e.g., g and g&#x2032;).</p><p id="p-0100" num="0098">As an example, the gene ranges of gene g and gene g&#x2032; that have been identified as corresponding to various kmers of fragment s are represented as R<sub>g</sub>=(R<sub>g0</sub>, R<sub>g1</sub>, . . . , R<sub>gn&#x2212;1</sub>) and R<sub>g&#x2032;</sub>=(R<sub>g&#x2032;0</sub>, R<sub>g&#x2032;1</sub>, . . . , R<sub>gm&#x2212;1</sub>), respectively. Gene ranges R<sub>g </sub>and R<sub>g</sub>, are sorted in the increasing order according to their increasing position on the fragment s. The directionality of s is arbitrary as long as it is consistent. Any pair of ranges R<sub>gi</sub>=[p<sub>b1</sub><sup>g</sup>,p<sub>ei</sub><sup>g</sup>]&#x3f5;R<sub>g </sub>and R<sub>g&#x2032;</sub>=[p<sub>bj</sub><sup>g&#x2032;</sup>,p<sub>ej</sub><sup>g&#x2032;</sup>]&#x3f5;R<sub>g&#x2032;</sub> defines a possible fusion event.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0099">The maximum gene span is determined based on a support value (e.g., a score) corresponding to each pair of gene ranges, where the two gene ranges in the pair are from differing genes. Generally, the support value determined for a pair of gene ranges is based on the ordering of the gene ranges. For example, given a first gene range from a first gene (e.g., gene g) and the next gene range in the ordering from the second gene (e.g., gene g&#x2032;), the calculated support value is the sum of the lengths of 1) the first gene range from the first gene, 2) the next gene range in the ordering from the second gene, and 3) all gene ranges on the first gene that are lower ordered in comparison to the first gene range from the first gene. Of note, if the first gene range from the first gene and the next gene range from the gene range overlap, then the overlapping region is eliminated from the support value. Therefore, a support value can be calculated for any two gene ranges, where one of the two gene ranges is from a first gene and the second of two gene ranges is from a second gene.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0100">As a first scenario (referred to hereafter as scenario (1)), the two gene ranges do not overlap with one another on fragment s. Therefore, given that p<sub>ei</sub><sup>g</sup>&#x3c;p<sub>bj</sub><sup>g&#x2032;</sup>, the support is &#x3a3;<sub>l=0</sub><sup>i</sup>L<sub>l</sub><sup>g</sup>+&#x3a3;<sub>l=j</sub><sup>m&#x2212;1 </sup>L<sub>l</sub><sup>g&#x2032;</sup>. For example, the support of R<sub>g1 </sub>and R<sub>g&#x2032;1 </sub>is equal to L<sub>0</sub><sup>g</sup>+L<sub>1</sub><sup>g</sup>+L<sub>1</sub><sup>g&#x2032;</sup> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). Put into words, the support value calculated between the gene range R<sub>g1 </sub>from gene g and R<sub>g&#x2032;1</sub>, which is the next ordered gene range from gene g&#x2032;, includes the length of gene range R<sub>g0 </sub>(e.g., L<sub>0</sub><sup>g</sup>) that has a lower (e.g., earlier) order than gene range R<sub>g1</sub>. Additionally, the support value includes the length of R<sub>g1 </sub>(e.g., L<sub>1</sub><sup>g</sup>) and the length of R<sub>g&#x2032;1 </sub>(e.g., L<sub>1</sub><sup>g&#x2032;</sup>).</p><p id="p-0103" num="0101">As a second scenario (referred to hereafter as scenario (22)), the two gene ranges overlap with one another on fragment s. Therefore, given that p<sub>ei</sub><sup>g</sup>&#x2265;p<sub>bi</sub><sup>g&#x2032;, the support is L</sup><sub>0</sub><sup>g</sup>+L<sub>1</sub><sup>g</sup>+(p<sub>ej</sub><sup>g&#x2032;</sup>&#x2212;p<sub>bi</sub><sup>g</sup>+1). For example, the support of R<sub>g2 </sub>and R<sub>g&#x2032;1 </sub>is equal to L<sub>0</sub><sup>g</sup>+L<sub>1</sub><sup>g</sup>+(p<sub>e1</sub><sup>g&#x2032;</sup>&#x2212;p<sub>b2</sub><sup>g</sup>+1) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). Put into words, the support value calculated between R<sub>g2 </sub>and R<sub>g&#x2032;1 </sub>also includes the lengths of gene ranges R<sub>g0 </sub>and R<sub>g1 </sub>that each are ordered lower (e.g., earlier) than gene range R<sub>g2</sub>. Additionally, given that the gene ranges R<sub>g2 </sub>and R<sub>g&#x2032;1 </sub>overlap, the support value includes the lengths of gene ranges R<sub>g2 </sub>and R<sub>g&#x2032;1 </sub>without the overlapping region (e.g., (p<sub>e1</sub><sup>g&#x2032;</sup>&#x2212;p<sub>b2</sub><sup>g</sup>+1)).</p><p id="p-0104" num="0102">Of note, in each of scenario (1) and (2), the lower ordered gene ranges (e.g., R<sub>g0 </sub>in scenario 1, and R<sub>g0 </sub>and R<sub>g1 </sub>in scenario 2) are from a common gene (e.g., gene g). Additionally, although examples (1) and (2) above describe comparisons between a gene range on gene g and a gene range on gene g&#x2032;, a similar comparison to determine a support value can be made between two gene ranges on the same gene.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0103">The maximum span is given by the pair of gene ranges that have the largest support value. Note that either R<sub>gi </sub>or R<sub>g&#x2032;j </sub>is determined to be empty when fragment s is considered to be maximally spanned by either g&#x2032; or g alone, and the corresponding supports are defined as &#x3a3;<sub>j=0</sub><sup>m&#x2212;1 </sup>L<sub>j</sub><sup>g&#x2032;</sup> and &#x3a3;<sub>i=0</sub><sup>n&#x2212;1 </sup>L<sub>i</sub><sup>g</sup>, respectively. In various embodiments, gene range comparisons can occur between numerous pairs of genes. For example, if a third gene is represented as g&#x2033;, then gene range comparisons can additionally be conducted between gene ranges in g and g&#x2033; as well as between gene ranges in g&#x2032; and g&#x2033;. Therefore, the maximum span can be determined as the gene range comparison between any pair of genes that has the largest support value.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0104">Calculating a maximum span using the support value between a pair of gene ranges provides advantages in processing speed and resource consumption. For example, to calculate all pairwise supports between any two ranges from R<sub>g </sub>and R<sub>g&#x2032;</sub> would take &#x3a6;(n*m) time which is a function of the n total ranges from R<sub>g </sub>and m total ranges from R<sub>g&#x2032;</sub>. However, based on the following two steps, the time complexity could be reduced to &#x3a6;(n+m): (1) pre-compute prefix and suffix summation of range lengths for R<sub>g </sub>and R<sub>g</sub>, in &#x3a6;(n) and &#x3a6;(m) time, respectively, which can be directly used to calculate support value for each pair, and (2) calculate support only for adjacent pairs in the merged range list of R<sub>g </sub>and R<sub>g&#x2032;</sub> that are sorted in an increasing order. This can be achieved in &#x3a6;(n)+&#x3a6;(m) time.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0105">Assigning Candidate Fusions</p><p id="p-0108" num="0106">At step <b>280</b>, candidate gene fusions are assigned. For example, the gene pair that yields the maximum gene span inferred for gene pair g and g&#x2032; can be assigned as a candidate gene fusion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts an example assignment of a candidate gene fusion event between genes g <b>510</b> and g&#x2032; <b>515</b> that correspond to fragment s <b>405</b>, in accordance with an embodiment. Here, the maximum gene span may be determined to be the ranges of R<sub>g0</sub>, R<sub>g1</sub>, and R<sub>g2 </sub>from gene g and R<sub>g&#x2032;1 </sub>from gene g&#x2032;. Therefore, a candidate gene fusion is assigned between gene pair g <b>510</b> and g&#x2032; <b>515</b> given the adjacency of R<sub>g2 </sub>from gene g and R<sub>g&#x2032;1 </sub>from gene g&#x2032;.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0107">At step <b>285</b>, each candidate fusion pair can be further filtered. Filtering includes enforcing one or more additional criteria. One such additional criterion includes that when selecting joint span by two genes, the combined spanning distance (e.g., the length R<sub>g0</sub>, R<sub>g1</sub>, R<sub>g2</sub>, R<sub>g&#x2032;1 </sub>in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) needs to be at least a threshold length longer than the span by one of the genes alone. As one example, the threshold length is 25 nucleotide base pairs. As another example, the threshold length is the length of a kmer, as previously described (e.g., length of k nucleotide bases). Another such additional criteria includes that a candidate fusion pair needs to be supported by a minimum number of read pairs such as two.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0108">As another example, filtering criteria can specify a threshold number of genes that a fragment (e.g., fragment s) maps to. For example, if the fragment maps to more than the threshold number of genes, then it may be unlikely that the candidate fusion pair truly reflects a fusion event and the candidate fusion pair can be filtered out.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0109">As yet another example, filtering criteria can specify a threshold overlap between gene ranges of a first gene and a second gene. False positive fusion events can arise from gene ranges of closely related genes. For example, if a range of gene g, which maps to fragment s, shares an overlapping nucleotide sequence that is beyond the threshold overlap with a range of gene g&#x2032;, which also maps to fragment s, then the candidate fusion event identified between gene g and gene g&#x2032; can be filtered out.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0110">In various embodiments, chimeric reads arising from library preparation artifacts (e.g., PCR template switching, incomplete template extension and mis-hybridization, or other library preparation artifacts) may be identified as candidate fusion events. Therefore, step <b>285</b> may employ an exon boundary filter that queries the sequence reads that support a candidate fusion event. The exon boundary filter can be applied in conjunction with either a targeted fusion caller or a de novo fusion caller.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0111">In particular, the exon boundary filter determines whether a breakpoint identified on the sequence read corresponds to an RNA fusion event that likely derived from an in vivo DNA breakpoint and not a library preparation artifact. Generally, if the breakpoint of the sequence read occurs at the boundary between two exon junctions, then the sequence read can be maintained. Conversely, if a breakpoint of the sequence read occurs within the exon bodies, then the sequence read corresponding to the breakpoint is more likely to be an artifact and can be filtered out and removed.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0112">More specifically, the exon boundary filter identifies a threshold number of nucleotide bases adjacent to the breakpoint of the sequence read. In one embodiment, the exon boundary filter may identify a threshold number of nucleotide bases upstream to the breakpoint and further identifies a threshold number of nucleotide bases downstream to the breakpoint. In various embodiments, the threshold number of nucleotides is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more nucleotide bases. Given the identified nucleotide bases within the threshold number of nucleotides of the breakpoint, the identified nucleotide bases are compared to regions in each gene identified by the AF4 caller as involved in the candidate fusion event. In various embodiments, the identified nucleotide bases are compared to exonic regions in each gene. For example, the identified nucleotide bases upstream to the breakpoint can be compared to the 3&#x2032; ends of all annotated exons for the upstream gene partner, and the identified nucleotide bases downstream to the breakpoint can be compared to 5&#x2032; ends of all annotated exons for the downstream gene partner. If the comparison yield an alignment in the correct orientation (e.g., the comparison yields a match or the comparison yields a match between at least a threshold number of base pairs), the sequence read is re-annotated to denote the presence of the alignment. In one embodiment, if either the identified nucleotide bases upstream to the breakpoint match the 3&#x2032; ends of exons for the upstream gene partner or the identified nucleotide bases downstream to the breakpoint match the 5&#x2032; ends of exons for the downstream gene partner, then the sequence read is re-annotated to denote the alignment. In some embodiments, the sequence read is annotated to denote an alignment if both the identified nucleotide bases upstream to the breakpoint match the 3&#x2032; ends of exons for the upstream gene partner and the identified nucleotide bases downstream to the breakpoint match the 5&#x2032; ends of exons for the downstream gene partner. An annotated sequence read that denotes an alignment indicates that the breakpoint in the sequence read that supports the candidate fusion event is more likely to have arisen from an in vivo DNA breakpoint. Sequence reads corresponding to candidate fusion events that are not annotated can be filtered and removed as it is possible that these sequence reads arose from a library preparation artifact.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0113">By applying the exon boundary filter, a candidate fusion event is deemed as a false positive fusion event if less than a threshold number of sequence reads support the candidate fusion event after applying the exon boundary filter. In some embodiments, the threshold number of sequence reads supporting a candidate fusion event is two. In other embodiments, the threshold number of sequence reads support a candidate fusion event is one, three, four, five, or more sequence reads.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0114">Candidate fusion pairs that remain after filtering can be the basis for calling a candidate fusion event.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Pre-Filtering Sequence Reads</heading><p id="p-0117" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts a pre-filtering process <b>130</b> for removing sequence reads that meet one or more criteria, in accordance with an embodiment. Examples of the criteria include, but are not limited to: identifying whether a sequence read is a singleton, identifying whether a sequence read is a hard clip, filtering based on a template length (TLEN) (e.g., a threshold TLEN), filtering based on an alignment score (e.g., a threshold alignment score), or filtering based on a base quality score (e.g., a threshold of a median or mean base quality score). Another criteria includes determining that if a sequence read pair meets the criterion that the reads of the read pair are from differing chromosomes, then the sequence read pair is maintained and not filtered out. Additional examples of criteria include filtering based on a bit flag, a cigar, an edit distance (e.g., a minimum or maximum edit distance), a suboptimal alignment score, or a supplementary alignment measure.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0116">In some embodiments, the pre-filtering process <b>130</b> involves removing sequence reads generated at step <b>125</b> that meet one or more criteria to identify a subset of filtered sequence reads that can be used at step <b>135</b> to call fusion events.

A singleton refers to a single read of a read pair. Without the second read of a read pair, a singleton is not informative for identifying a fusion event and can be readily filtered out. A hard clip refers to a sequence read that has been truncated. Here, a hard-clipped sequence read can lead to the identification of false positive fusion events and therefore, are filtered out.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0118">At step <b>710</b>, sequence read pairs where the first read and the second read are from differing chromosomes are maintained. In various embodiments, the first read and the second read can be determined to be from differing chromosomes by aligning the first read and the second read to known sequences of chromosomes (e.g., a reference genome). Given that sequence read pairs where the first read and the second read are from differing chromosomes are likely indicative of a fusion event, such sequence read pairs are maintained so that they can be subsequently analyzed. In various embodiments, sequence read pairs that are identified and maintained here at step <b>710</b> are further maintained through steps <b>715</b>, <b>720</b>, and <b>725</b>. This ensures that these sequence read pairs are definitively analyzed for a likelihood of a fusion event as opposed to being filtered out.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0119">At step <b>715</b>, sequence reads are filtered based on the template length (TLEN) for each sequence read.

Each of ChimerScope, Pizzly, and the AF4 caller (through either targeted or de novo methods) were employed to detect gene fusions in synthetically generated data that includes two types of fusions: broken exon fusions and intact exon fusions.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0132">Specifically, the synthetically generated data included a total of 70 broken exon fusions and 80 intact exon fusions for a total of 150 detectable fusion events. Additionally, synthetic data were generated with five different coverages (5&#xd7;, 20&#xd7;, 50&#xd7;, 100&#xd7;, and 200&#xd7;), each with three different read lengths (50 base pairs, 75 base pairs, and 100 base pairs). Each synthetic dataset with lower coverage (e.g., 5&#xd7;, 20&#xd7;, 50&#xd7;, and 100&#xd7; coverage) were generated by subsampling the 200&#xd7; synthetic dataset.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0133">Each of the fusion callers was applied to the different synthetic datasets to identify the 150 fusions. Tables 1-4 depict the performance of each of the fusion callers. Specifically, the performance of each of the fusion callers was evaluated according to measurable parameters including true positive (TP), false negative (FN), false positive (FP), precision, recall, false discovery rate (FDR), and F1 score. Generally, the AF4 caller, specifically both the de novo and the targeted fusion callers described herein, outperformed both the ChimerScope and Pizzly fusion callers.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0134">First, both the targeted and de novo AF4 caller exhibited higher sensitivity in detecting fusion events. Specifically, of the 150 detectable fusions events in the dataset, the de novo AF4 caller detected an average of 147.1 fusion events and the targeted AF4 caller detected an average of 146.5 fusion events. In comparison, the ChimerScope fusion caller detected an average of 132.4 fusion events whereas the Pizzly fusion caller detected an average of 117.2 fusion events.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0135">Second, both the targeted and de novo AF4 caller exhibited higher specificity in comparison to ChimerScope and Pizzly. Specifically, the de novo AF4 caller identified, on average, 2.87 false negatives and 1.33 false positives and the targeted AF4 caller identified, on average, 3.5 false negatives and 0 false positives. In contrast, ChimerScope identified, on average, 17.6 false negatives and 12.67 false positives whereas Pizzly identified, on average, 32.8 false negatives and 12.5 false positives. Finally, both the targeted and de novo AF4 caller achieved a 0.99 F1 score. Here, the F1 score is a measure of the accuracy of the fusion caller and represents a weighted average of the precision and recall (e.g., F1 score=2*(precision*recall)/(precision+recall)). The F1 score achieved by the AF4 caller represents a significant improvement over ChimerScope, which achieved a 0.90 F1 score, and Pizzly, which achieved a 0.84 F1 score.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0136">Of note, the targeted AF4 caller exhibited an average runtime of 14.8 seconds. This is significantly faster than ChimerScope and Pizzly. The de novo AF4 caller exhibited a longer runtime of 14 minutes and 20 seconds, though this is expected given the extensive search performed by the algorithm across the full genome.</p><heading id="h-0014" level="1">Example 2: DNA Fusion Caller</heading><p id="p-0141" num="0137">The performance of the targeted DNA fusion caller described above (e.g., the process <b>135</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) was compared to the performance of state of the art DNA fusion callers such as Manta. Specifically, Table 5 details the performance of the targeted AF4 caller and Manta fusion caller for detecting fusion events in DNA samples (e.g., samples 1-14). In particular, the targeted AF4 caller was implemented with pre-filtering (e.g., the pre-filtering process <b>130</b> described above in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>) or without pre-filtering. The performance of each fusion caller was measured according to the number of detected true positives (TP), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN).</p><p id="p-0142" num="0138">DNA samples were prepared by spiking concentrations of known fusion events. The reference standard used for the study was Horizon Discovery control HD753 (Horizon Discovery Group PLC, Cambridge, United Kingdom) titrated into a human cell line DNA samples from the Coriell Cell Repository (Coriell Institute, New Jersey, USA) that was characterized by the Genome in a Bottle Consortium (GIAB), GIAB sample NA12878. Horizon control HD753, which includes two known fusion events (RET, chr. 10, CCDC6/RET fusion; and ROS1, chr.4:chr.6, SLC34A2/ROS1 fusion), was titrated into NA 12878 at 6 defined concentration levels (0.1%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8%, and 1%).</p><p id="p-0143" num="0139">In general, the targeted AF4 caller, when implemented with either a pre-filter or without a pre-filter, outperformed the Manta fusion caller. First, on average, the targeted AF4 caller, when implemented with either a pre-filter or without a pre-filter, successfully called 1.9 of the 2 expected fusion events whereas the Manta fusion caller successfully called, on average, 1.6 of the 2 expected fusion events. Additionally, the targeted AF4 caller, when implemented without a pre-filter, exhibited an average of 10.8 false positives per sample whereas the targeted AF4 caller, when implemented with a pre-filter, exhibited an average of 4.1 false positives per sample. In contrast, the Manta fusion caller exhibited a large number of false positives (e.g., &#x2dc;16,380) per sample. Therefore, when benchmarked against the Manta fusion caller, the targeted AF4 caller (with or without prefiltering) is able to deliver improved sensitivity without sacrificing specificity.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0140">The implementation of the targeted AF4 caller with prefiltering also significantly reduced the runtime of the targeted AF4 caller in comparison to the targeted AF4 caller without prefiltering. Specifically, in comparison to the targeted AF4 caller implemented without prefiltering, the targeted AF4 caller implemented with prefiltering exhibited a nearly 80% reduction in runtime (e.g., 24 hour runtime vs. 5 hour runtime).</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Example 3: Exon Boundary Filter Applied for the RNA AF4 Caller</heading><p id="p-0145" num="0141">A healthy cfRNA sample was divided into eight separate samples and each separate sample was spiked with differing concentrations of a H2228 cell line, which contains an echinoderm microtubule associated protein like 4 (EML4)&#x2014;anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion event. Specifically, the eight separate cfRNA samples were spiked at concentrations of 0%, 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 10%, and 100% H2228 cell line RNA. The eight separate cfRNA samples were analyzed using the targeted RNA AF4 caller, either with the exon boundary filter or without the exon boundary filter, to identify candidate fusion events present in each of the eight separate cfRNA samples.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0142">The exon boundary filter identifies a breakpoint in sequence reads that support a candidate fusion event and matches the 19 nucleotide bases upstream to the breakpoint and 19 nucleotide bases downstream to the breakpoint to the 3&#x2032; ends of exons for the upstream gene partner and the 5&#x2032; ends of exons for the downstream gene partner, respectively. If the comparison yields that neither the 19 upstream nucleotide bases nor the 19 downstream nucleotide bases match the sequences in the upstream and downstream gene partners, respectively, the sequence read is removed as a false positive. Candidate fusion events that are supported by two or greater supporting sequence reads are deemed true positive fusion events.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> includes two panels that depicts true and false positive fusion events identified in the eight separate cfRNA samples by the RNA AF4 caller that additionally includes or withholds the exon boundary filter. The y-axis of each panel shows the coverage (e.g., read counts) of identified fusion events whereas the x-axis of each panel denotes the % H2228 cell line RNA in each separate cfRNA sample.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0144">The top panel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts the identification of true positive fusion events. Specifically, the EML4:ALK is detected in the 100/a H2228 cell line sample and the 10% diluted, 10% H2228 cell line sample with and without implementation of the exon boundary filter. Here, the implementation of the exon boundary filter results in minimal loss in read counts.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0145">The bottom panel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts the identification and filtering of false positive fusion events, categorized as false positives because they are not annotated as being present in the background cfRNA or the spike-in H2228 cell line RNA. Specifically, when the exon boundary filter is not implemented, the AF4 caller identified 27 false positive fusion events across the eight separate samples. The additional implementation of the exon boundary filter reduced the number of identified false positive fusion events to a total of 3 false positive fusion events.</p><heading id="h-0016" level="2">Additional Considerations</heading><p id="p-0150" num="0146">The foregoing detailed description of embodiments refers to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate specific embodiments of the present disclosure.
