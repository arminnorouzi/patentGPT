Using a considerable amount of energy, the material, which is usually in the form of logs, is chopped into wood chips. The wood chips are transported from the woodyard to a tank, in which they are typically impregnated with steam and alkali for further processing.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Following the impregnation, the wood chips are usually transferred to a continuous digester. In this digester, the lignin is dissolved by means of pressure, temperature and white liquor (sodium hydroxide and sodium sulphide) in a chemical/thermal pulping process in order to expose the pulp fibres. The raw fibre obtained then exists as unbleached, not yet sufficiently finely shredded pulp, which is then subjected to various cleaning and washing steps in order to free it from impurities. The resulting wash liquor (also called black liquor) represents a significant environmental burden that requires complex technical measures in effluent treatment, including the incineration of thickened liquor.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Besides undissolved and/or mineral components such as phosphates and silicates, these impurities to be removed also include, in particular, organic substances such as hemicellulose, which is present as dissolved sugar, and lignin. In the course of conventional effluent treatment, the organic substances are mineralized, and mineral substances are converted into non-reactive, harmless substances. The cleaned effluent is then discharged into bodies of water, and organic residues are burned.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The unbleached pulp can be bleached in different bleaching processes, most of which are nowadays chlorine-free. Depending on grade requirements, the finished pulp is transported directly to paper machines for integrated paper production or is dried in web dryers or flash dryers in order to be made transportable as bales or rolls.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This established method for producing pulp therefore requires a high input of expensive, slow-growing raw materials, chemicals and energy.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The object of the invention is therefore to provide an alternative method for producing pulp, which is environmentally friendly, sustainable, energy-saving and at the same time economical.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This object is achieved according to the invention by a method of the type mentioned in the introduction in that the fibres of the biomass are first subjected to thermo-pressure hydrolysis, preferably with steam explosion, in a thermo-pressure hydrolysis plant, and then a separation of the fibrous sludge obtained from the thermo-pressure hydrolysis plant takes place in at least one separation plant, wherein a press cake formed of cellulose fibres, preferably having a dry matter content of more than 20%, and a filtrate formed of a flowable, high-solids, thin sludge are obtained, and wherein the thin sludge is fed to a biogas plant as a fermentation substrate in order to obtain biogas.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the invention, it is preferably provided that the fibrous biomass is first pulped by means of thermo-pressure hydrolysis with steam explosion. The pulp fibres are exposed during this method step, in a manner analogous to digesting the wood chips with white liquor and then with black liquor according to the prior art. Thermo-pressure hydrolysis with subsequent steam explosion has already proven itself in the production of fermentation substrates from energy crops, wherein these fermentation substrates are then converted into biogas by anaerobic fermentation in a biogas plant. One such method can be found, for example, in EP 2 177 280 B1.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The generation of biogas from plant biomass by anaerobic fermentation is an established technology. The raw materials used for this are mainly so-called energy crops, usually in the form of silage. These raw materials contain different proportions of fibrous materials consisting of lignocellulose bonds, which are difficult to break down in a biogas plant. The residues from the fermentation therefore still contain large proportions of stable fibrous materials, which after being discharged from the fermentation process are disposed of without being used for energy.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The greater the proportion of these stable fibres in the biomass, the lower the success and thus the economic efficiency of the fermentation. As a result, most biogas plants use only crops that have a relatively low fibre content, such as maize, but the intensive cultivation of these crops is expensive and is not without controversy from an ecological standpoint. In general, biogas plants based on energy crops are under increasing pressure, in particular because the costs of producing the preferred raw materials are increasing and the revenues based on state-subsidized tariffs are time-limited or are even degressive in some models.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Under these circumstances, it is difficult for the operators of biogas plants to use alternative biomass sources which are also more environmentally friendly, since these usually have lower yields per hectare and at the same time higher fibre contents than the usual silage from energy crops.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The use of suitable technologies, in particular thermo-pressure hydrolysis with steam explosion, makes it possible for biogas plants to use woodier, i.e. lignocellulose-containing, raw materials as an alternative to energy crops since, after being treated by thermo-pressure hydrolysis, these can be fermented and converted into biogas with a high degree of efficiency.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">However, this superior technology is to date established only in individual cases in biogas plant technology because it entails high investment and increased operating costs. Against the background of expiring subsidized feed-in tariffs and a lack of other incentives, there is a need for optimized processes with higher added value.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Studies by the applicant have now shown that the known method of thermo-pressure hydrolysis lends itself as a first method step in the production of pulp, wherein according to the invention the fibrous sludge obtained in this first method step is still mechanically separated into cellulose fibres and filtrate in the form of thin sludge. The method according to the invention therefore makes it possible to produce a pulp from fibre-rich biomass without using environmentally harmful chemicals and with lower energy consumption, wherein the biomass can be selected from a large number of different plant materials. In the context of this disclosure, the term &#x201c;pulp&#x201d; will be understood to mean a fibre cake obtained from biomass by thermo-pressure hydrolysis and cleaned, wherein the biomass used may be not only wood, but also any suitable crops or crop residues.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">At the same time, a fermentation substrate is produced which is suitable for generating energy in a biogas plant. The impurities separated in the form of thin sludge from the fibres in the method according to the invention contain the bulk of the proportion of biomass that can be used for energy in a biogas plant. Studies have revealed a proportion of more than 60% of the usable energy potential. In order to avoid long transport routes, it is particularly preferred that this biogas plant is located in the immediate vicinity of the pulp production plant, wherein the biogas obtained in the biogas plant is advantageously used as an energy source for the method according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">After suitable conditioning (shredding, ensiling, etc.), the biomass, which is preferably produced regionally as a field crop or by-product, is first subjected to a pre-treatment at elevated pressure and elevated temperature (thermo-pressure hydrolysis, preferably with steam explosion), namely on site or in the immediate vicinity of a biogas plant. Immediately thereafter, the treated product is separated into a processed fibre fraction (cellulose), which is used as a raw material for paper production, and a highly contaminated sub-stream, which is used as a fermentation substrate in the biogas plant.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Fermentation residues occur as a residual product of biogas production and contain, in addition to mineral and organic residues of the fermented substances, also mineral fertilizer components (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, trace elements) and a high concentration of lignin, which is inert in the fermentation process. As part of sustainable agriculture, these nutrient-rich fermentation residues from the biogas plant are returned as fertilizing agents to the areas being cultivated for the plant-based raw materials, thereby also achieving, in particular, an improvement in the humus balance.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">By combining the described fibre processing with a biogas plant, a number of advantageous effects are achieved:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0022">Since the fibre pulping is not carried out in a paper mill, where the thin sludge that occurs during the subsequent separation has to be disposed of or treated as effluent, the ecological balance of paper production is significantly improved.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0023">In addition, the transport costs are significantly reduced due to the regional approach to extracting raw materials, in which raw material cultivation and pulp production take place locally, and due to the fact that the finished product (compressed pulp fibres), instead of the considerably more voluminous raw material (biomass), is transported for example to a paper mill that is situated as close as possible.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0024">The use of regionally obtained pulp also reduces the use of pulp imported from overseas, which is produced for example from plantation-grown wood.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0025">By returning lignin to the agricultural cultivation areas in a targeted manner, the fertility of the soil is maintained or even improved due to the effect thereof on the humus, so that intensive and yet sustainable agricultural production of raw materials is possible.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0026">By returning to the agricultural land the silicates that have dissolved out of the plant structure, which are likewise contained in the fermentation substrate produced and thus also in the fermentation residue, a substance that acts as a nutrient store is added to the soil, which improves the soil quality over the long term.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0027">By returning the mineral fertilizing substances nitrogen, phosphate, potassium and trace elements, which have likewise dissolved out of the plant-based raw material and are contained in the fermentation substrate, this reduces the need for artificial fertilizers in raw material production.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0028">The use of the thermo-pressure treatment plant as a pre-treatment for the biomass in the biogas plant permits the use of alternative raw materials which contain more fibres, the production or extraction of which may be ecologically more sustainable than that of the usual energy crops, as well as the use of by-products such as unused straw or harvested residual plants of various field crops (so-called co-products).</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0023" num="0029">It should also be noted that the production of pulp from grasses and other fast-growing plants cultivated in fields can bind significantly larger amounts of carbon dioxide than biomass production from wood, for example in plantation economy, and can thus make a significant positive contribution to climate protection.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0030">For the value chain of a biogas plant, the economically separate use of the pulp fibres opens up the possibility of generating additional income in addition to generating energy, for example by selling the pulp fibres to the paper industry. These fibres, which are difficult to convert into biogas, have until now largely been output as residue (solid fermentation residue).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0031">In order to obtain additional cleaning and thus an improvement in the quality of the pulp, it is provided in one particularly preferred embodiment of the invention that the fibrous sludge obtained after the thermo-pressure hydrolysis is adjusted in a first mashing tank to a dry matter content of preferably 3% to 20%, and then the separation of the fibrous sludge takes place in at least one separation plant. Due to the intermediate step of mashing the fibrous sludge obtained from the thermo-pressure hydrolysis in a mashing tank, a value for the dry matter content that is optimal for the subsequent separation is obtained.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0032">In order to obtain finer pulp, it is provided in a further embodiment of the method according to the invention that, before the mashed fibrous sludge from the mashing tank is separated, a fibre separation or singulation of fibre bundles takes place in at least one disintegrator, and then the separation takes place in the first separation plant. For this purpose, the dry matter content of the fibrous sludge is preferably adjusted to 3% to 10% before the latter is fed to the disintegrator.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0033">In an alternative embodiment of the invention, it is provided that, after the fibrous sludge has been separated in a first separation plant, the press cake obtained is fed to a mashing tank in order to set a dry matter content of preferably 3% to 20%, particularly preferably 3% to 10%, and then the fibrous sludge is fed to at least one disintegrator in order to obtain a fibre separation of the fibre bundles contained in the fibrous sludge, and thereafter a separation of the fibrous sludge takes place in at least one further separation plant.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0034">In the fibrous sludge drawn off from the thermo-pressure hydrolysis plant, the desired pulp is present in the form of fibre bundles which are bonded to one another by natural polymers, in particular lignin and the like. By mashing the fibrous sludge in the mashing tank, a first dissolving-out of undesired components already takes place, as well as the physical separating-out of any insoluble components by sedimentation. At the same time, adjusting the dry matter content to 3% to 10% permits an improved fibre separation in the at least one disintegrator.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0035">Depending on the type of biomass used, it may be necessary for the fibrous sludge to pass through the at least one disintegrator multiple times. In this case, preferably the fibrous sludge is mashed again in the mashing tank, and the fibre separation in the disintegrator is repeated at least once, preferably multiple times, in a cyclic process between the mashing tank and the disintegrator. As an alternative or in addition, it may be provided that additional fibrous sludge, which has not yet been treated in the disintegrator, is added to the material located in the mashing tank.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0036">Depending on the desired quality and properties of the end product, fibre shredding may be provided in addition to or as an alternative to fibre separation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0037">Besides a high pulp quality, the method described above using at least one, preferably two or more separation plants makes it possible to obtain thin sludge as a waste product of pulp production, wherein the filtrate is at least in part fed to a biogas plant as a fermentation substrate.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0038">It is particularly preferably provided that the filtrate from the separation plants, which is in the form of a thin sludge, is at least in part returned to the process. In this case, it is particularly preferably fed to the mashing tank in order to adjust the dry matter content of the fibrous sludge. As an alternative or in addition, the filtrate may also be added directly to the fibrous sludge before the latter is conveyed into a separation plant.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0039">The thin sludge fed to the biogas plant as a fermentation substrate may be thickened, preferably by filtration (for example fine filtration, microfiltration or ultrafiltration) in order to reduce the volume flow. The resulting filtrate, a sub-stream having a lower solids content, is advantageously fed into the method according to the invention as mashing water for the thermo-pressure hydrolysis plant and/or elsewhere, thereby further reducing the water consumption in the method according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0040">In one particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, it is provided that the thin sludge is collected in two sub-fractions, wherein a first sub-fraction having a lower solids content is returned to the process, while a higher-solids fraction is fed to the biogas plant as a fermentation substrate. These different fractions are withdrawn for example from different areas of the at least one separation plant and are preferably collected in separate collection tanks.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0041">In order to be better able to store and transport the pulp produced by the method according to the invention, it may be provided that, prior to being stored as an end product, the press cake obtained from the at least one separation plant is subjected to a stabilization step, in particular by adding preserving chemicals, and/or to a heat treatment.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0042">In order to further improve the quality of the end product, it is provided in a further variant of the invention that the press cake obtained from the at least one separation plant is subjected to a further cleaning step in a mixing reactor, wherein the wash water is separated from the cleaned fibre cake in a further separation plant. The mechanically treated and dewatered fibres are thus subjected to a further, additional washing step, wherein the wash water used here is advantageously clean water that is free of contaminants. It is particularly advantageous if the wash water is added to the press cake obtained from the previous separation step, for example in a ratio of fibrous sludge to wash water of 1:1 to 1:2. After sufficient contact with the wash water, the cleaned fibre is subjected to a final dewatering step in order to restore the desired solids content in the end product.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0043">The slightly contaminated wash water obtained after this cleaning step is preferably returned to the process according to the invention, wherein it is particularly preferably provided that said wash water is added to dry biomass, requiring the addition of water, in order then to be able to process said biomass in the thermo-pressure hydrolysis plant. This results in a water cycle that is particularly advantageous both in terms of the method and ecologically.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0044">One significant advantage of the method according to the invention lies in particular in that a large number of fibrous materials in the form of plant biomass can be used. Energy crops such as maize, <i>Silphium perfoliatum</i>, and/or harvest residues with a sufficient cellulose or lignocellulose content have proven to be particularly suitable here, as well as by-products such as straw and/or green cuttings. Regional raw materials and/or residues such as harvest by-products or green cuttings can therefore be used to obtain pulp while at the same time generating energy in the form of biogas. It is particularly preferably provided that the biogas obtained in the biogas plant is used as an energy source in the method according to the invention, in particular for the thermo-pressure hydrolysis plant.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0045">At the same time, it is particularly preferably provided that the non-recyclable residues occurring in the biogas plant are used as fertilizing agents in agriculture. Besides the usable organic components, the fermentation substrate obtained in the method according to the invention contains in particular lignin and silicates, which cannot be converted in the biogas plant. However, these residues from the biogas plant can significantly improve the condition of the soil. For instance, lignin forms an important basic building block for the formation of humus, while silicates act as a mineral adsorbent that significantly influences the nutrient balance of the soil.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0046">The object mentioned above is further achieved by a plant according to the invention in that a thermo-pressure hydrolysis plant is provided for subjecting the fibres of the biomass firstly to thermo-pressure hydrolysis with steam explosion, wherein the thermo-pressure hydrolysis plant is connected via at least one feed line to at least one first separation plant, preferably a screw press, into which the fibrous sludge drawn off from the thermo-pressure hydrolysis plant can be fed by means of at least one conveying device, preferably a screw conveyor and/or a thick-matter pump, wherein the filtrate obtained from the first separation plant in the form of a flowable, high-solids, thin sludge can be fed to a biogas plant via at least one further feed line.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0047">An improved separation of the fibrous sludge into pulp fibres and filtrate in the form of thin sludge is obtained if additionally a mashing tank is provided, which is arranged between the thermo-pressure hydrolysis plant and the first separation plant.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0048">Particularly in the case of biomass having a high lignin content, the pulp fibres are in the form of bonded pulp bundles after the thermo-pressure hydrolysis with steam explosion, which impairs the efficiency of the subsequent separation step and consequently the quality of the pulp. It is therefore particularly preferably provided that the mashing tank is connected to at least one disintegrator, wherein the at least one disintegrator is connected to the first separation plant preferably via storage tanks, in which the singulated cellulose fibres can be intermediately stored.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0049">It may alternatively be provided that the mashing tank is arranged downstream of the at least one first separation plant, wherein preferably the mashing tank is connected to the at least one disintegrator, and wherein the at least one disintegrator is connected to at least one further separation plant preferably via at least one storage tank.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0050">For easier processing and further use, the filtrate obtained from the first separation plant and/or second separation plant is collected in at least one collection tank, wherein preferably the at least one collection tank is connected to the mashing tank via at least one recirculation line. Furthermore, the at least one collection tank is connected to the biogas plant via at least one further feed line.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0045" num="0051">The invention will be explained in greater detail below on the basis of non-limiting exemplary embodiments together with associated figures, in which:</p><p id="p-0046" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a schematic illustration of a first embodiment variant of the plant according to the invention,</p><p id="p-0047" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows a variant of the plant from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>,</p><p id="p-0048" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> shows a further variant of the plant from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>,</p><p id="p-0049" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows a schematic illustration of a second embodiment variant of the plant according to the invention,</p><p id="p-0050" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows a variant of the plant from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>,</p><p id="p-0051" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows a schematic illustration of a third embodiment variant of the plant according to the invention,</p><p id="p-0052" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> shows a variant of the plant from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>,</p><p id="p-0053" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a schematic detail view of one particular embodiment of the second separation plant from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>,</p><p id="p-0054" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a schematic detail view of a post-treatment stage,</p><p id="p-0055" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a schematic view of a further post-treatment stage, and</p><p id="p-0056" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a schematic illustration of a packaging plant.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0057" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> schematically shows a first embodiment variant of the plant <b>1000</b> according to the invention.
