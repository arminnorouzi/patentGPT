Any feature of any of the embodiments disclosed herein may be applied to any other embodiment, wherever appropriate. Likewise, any advantage of any of the embodiments may apply to any other embodiments, and vice versa. Other objectives, features and advantages of the enclosed embodiments will be apparent from the following description.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">5G is a next generation of mobile networks developed by a standards developing organization called the 3GPP. The earlier generations of mobile networks were called 4G/LTE, 3G/UMTS, and 2G/GSM. A 5G network is maintained and its services are offered by the so-called Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). MNOs are distinguishable from each other by two types of codes, namely the Mobile Country Code (MCC) and the Mobile Network Code (MNC). To use a particular 5G network offered by a particular MNO, users are required to have a sort of contractual relationship with that MNO, that relationship being generally called the subscription. In cases when the user lacks a subscription to some particular MNO (e.g., in a so-called roaming scenario), the relationship is achieved by roaming agreements between the MNO where the user has a subscription, i.e., the user's Home Network (HN) and the MNO that the user is being served, i.e., the Visited Network (VN). Each subscription in a MNO's 5G network is identified by a unique long-term identifier called the Subscription Permanent Identifier (SUPI). Users wirelessly access a 5G network over-the-air using wireless device known as User Equipment (UE). Before providing any service, a 5G network needs to identify a user, i.e., the user's subscription, behind a UE. For this purpose of identification, UEs in earlier generation of mobile networks (4G, 3G, and 2G) used to send users' unique long-term identifier over-the-air. This was considered a privacy issue because users could be tracked or identified by any unauthorized entity capable of intercepting message or acting as man-in-the-middle over-the-air. However, in a 5G network, its MNO has an ability to offer better privacy to its users so that their unique long-term identifiers (i.e., SUPIs) are not visible over-the-air. That ability comes from a mechanism in which UEs, instead of sending SUPIs, calculate and send concealed identifiers over-the-air, which is called the Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI). The MNO makes available to UEs all information that are necessary for the calculation of SUCI.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The calculation of SUCI means the UE encrypting the SUPI. This is done before the SUCI is transferred over-the-air between the UE and the 5G network. The encryption is of asymmetric type and uses the HN's public key (denoted HN public key). The HN makes the HN public key available to the UE. There could be multiple ways of doing the asymmetric encryption of the SUPI for calculating the SUCI, these ways denoted as encryption schemes. Some example of the encryption schemes are ElGamal encryption scheme, Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES), and RSA encryption. There could also be multiple variants of the same scheme, e.g., different elliptic curves could be used with an ECIES scheme like SECP256R1, SECP384R1, and CURVE25519. These encryption schemes could either be standardized, say by the 3GPP, or be proprietary, decided by each MNO on its own. On one hand, the advantage of standardized encryption schemes is that those encryption scheme becomes publicly available or known, which increases inter-operability, e.g., all UE vendors could support the standardized schemes. On the other hand, the advantage of proprietary encryption schemes is that each MNO can independently choose and use any encryption scheme suitable to its operational efficiency, security and privacy offerings, or regulatory requirements.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Before going into further details, it is important to understand some technical aspects of a UE. The UE consists of several parts or components that altogether enables the users of the UE to access the services provided by the network. We are mainly interested in distinguishing two parts on a high level, which will assist in understanding the rest of the document. Those two parts are the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) and the Mobile Equipment (ME).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">First, the USIM part is a special software application that provides various functions like providing identifier and authentication of the user's subscription, security key generations, etc. The USIM runs on a tamper resistant secure hardware component, e.g., Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC). Second, the ME part denotes the wireless device comprising of hardware and software needed to communicate with the network. The ME is popularly known as a mobile phone, or smart phone.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above mentioned HN public key, along with other information, i.e., encryption scheme parameters are stored in the USIM part of the UE by the MNO. The process of the said storing is generally called provisioning. Over-the-air (OTA) updates is one example of the provisioning.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Whereas the information necessary for calculating the SUCI is stored or provisioned in the USIM part of the UE, in the UE there are two parts that may actually calculate the SUCI (i.e., computation or implementation of the encryption), either the USIM part or the ME part.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">There currently exist certain challenge(s). The HN has tight control and strong trust on its USIM deployments and USIM vendors. Through the USIM, the HN controls the offering of the privacy improvements of its users. This is done by providing the USIM with information used for calculation of the SUCI, e.g., the HN public key, and encryption scheme parameters. However, the SUCI calculation can be performed not only in the USIM, but also in the ME part of the UE. In the ME, the SUCI calculation is not in control of the HN because the HN has little control over ME deployments and ME vendors. In other words, the HN is not in tight control of the offering of the privacy improvements to its users.

In this document, we are mainly interested in distinguishing between two parts on a high level, namely the Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) <b>110</b> and the Mobile Equipment (ME) <b>120</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a high level distinction of these parts of a UE.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">First, the USIM part is a special software application that provides various functions like providing identifier and authentication of the user's subscription, security key generations, etc. The USIM runs on a tamper resistant secure hardware component, e.g., Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC). Second, the ME part denotes the wireless device comprising of hardware and software needed to communicate with the network. The ME may for example be a mobile phone, or smart phone, which can obtain network service when a UICC running the USIM is inserted into it.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The above mentioned HN public key, along with other information, i.e., encryption scheme parameters are stored in the USIM part of the UE by the MNO. The process of the said storing is generally called provisioning. Over-the-air (OTA) updates is one example of the provisioning.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Whereas the information necessary for calculating the SUCI is stored or provisioned in the USIM part of the UE, in the UE there are two parts that may actually calculate the SUCI (i.e., computation or implementation of the encryption), either the USIM part or the ME part.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As described earlier, with both the USIM and the ME parts of the UE allowed to calculate the SUCI, it becomes challenging for the HN to ensure that the SUCI is calculated in USIM or ME, wherever intended.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">One potential solution is to make use of an indication. The indication, denoted SUCI-Calculation-Indicator, would be provisioned by the HN in the USIM and would determine which part of the UE calculates the SUCI. It could have values, e.g., &#x201c;calculate in USIM&#x201d;, or &#x201c;calculate in ME&#x201d;. The ME would read the value of the said SUCI-calculation-indicator from the USIM and depending on the read value, would either ask the USIM to calculate SUCI (if the value is &#x201c;calculate in USIM&#x201d;), or calculate the SUCI itself (if the value is &#x201c;calculate in ME&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">However, the above mentioned solution using the said SUCI-Calculation-Indicator is ineffective on its own. It is so because, in that solution, the ME is in control of the decision regarding where the SUCI calculation is performed. Misbehaving MEs (due to poor implementation or with malicious intent) cannot be prevented from calculating the SUCI themselves even though the SUCI-calculation-indicator had the value &#x201c;calculate in USIM&#x201d; as provisioned by the HN. Mind that it is the users who choose which UE (comprising the ME) to buy and use. Therefore, it is the choice of users and not the HN who decide which MEs are used. It is neither practical for the HN to audit and verify all the MEs, nor can the HN update any misbehaving MEs. As UEs become cheaper and increasingly mass produced without sufficient testing, the chances of misbehaving ME parts in the UE are likely to increase, meaning that those misbehaving MEs would behave incorrectly and not according to the 3GPP standard. As said, such incorrect behavior could lead to the ME calculating the SUCI even though the HN had chosen that the SUCI should be calculated in the USIM part of the UE. While the lack of actual HN control is an issue in itself, the issue becomes more apparent when a misbehaving ME also incorrectly implements the SUCI calculation itself, i.e., the encryption schemes, thus possibly compromising the user's privacy. To make thing worse, since incorrectly implemented encryption schemes may not lead to interoperability issues (e.g., when the calculated SUCI is technically valid, but the underlying random numbers are poorly generated), such incorrect implementations might go unnoticed leaving user's privacy at risk for a long time.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the following, we are going to describe methods that mitigate the above mentioned problems. We propose that the USIM only conditionally facilitates SUCI calculation in ME by conditionally providing information necessary for the SUCI calculation, for example the public key of the HN, or information identifying the encryption scheme that is to be used in the SUCI calculation. For example, the USIM could avoid providing the HN public key or the encryption scheme identifier to the ME when the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value is &#x201c;calculate in USIM&#x201d;. The USIM would provide the HN public key or the encryption scheme identifier to the ME only when the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value is &#x201c;calculate in ME&#x201d;. This way, the ME would not have necessary information for the calculation of the SUCI when the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value is &#x201c;calculate in USIM&#x201d;. Mind that the USIM is the location where information required for calculating SUCI is stored. In this solution the USIM itself determines whether it should do the SUCI calculation according to the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value. If the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value is &#x201c;calculate in USIM&#x201d;, the USIM would calculate the SUCI itself, and only provide the calculated SUCI to the ME. If the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value is &#x201c;calculate in ME&#x201d;, the USIM would provide the HN public key and other information required for SUCI calculation to the ME.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The intended processes are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b></figref> by way of illustration.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a situation in which the ME sends a message <b>210</b> to the USIM, requesting the SUCI calculation information to allow it to calculate the SUCI. However, the USIM identifies that it is set to calculate SUCI, i.e., that the said SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value is &#x201c;calculate in USIM&#x201d;. The USIM then sends a message <b>220</b> rejecting the request for the SUCI calculation information.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a situation in which the ME sends a message <b>310</b> to the USIM, requesting the SUCI calculation information to allow it to calculate the SUCI. In this case, the USIM identifies that the calculation of the SUCI can be performed in the ME, i.e., that the said SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value is &#x201c;calculate in ME&#x201d;. The USIM then replies to the request by sending the SUCI calculation information <b>320</b>.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a situation in which the ME sends a message <b>410</b> to the USIM, requesting the SUCI value. The USIM identifies that it is set to calculate SUCI, i.e., that the said SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value is &#x201c;calculate in USIM&#x201d;. The USIM therefore calculates the SUCI and transmits it to the ME in a reply message <b>420</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows a situation in which the ME sends a message <b>510</b> to the USIM, requesting the SUCI value. However, the USIM identifies that the calculation of the SUCI can be performed in the ME, i.e., that the said SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value is &#x201c;calculate in ME&#x201d;. The USIM then replies to the request by sending a message <b>520</b> rejecting the request for the SUCI.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Note that when the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value is &#x201c;calculate in ME&#x201d;, the ME could be prevented from invoking the calculation in SUCI calculation in the USIM in other ways than shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, e.g., dynamically removing the module for SUCI calculation, i.e., encryption scheme module, from the USIM, dynamically changing the module for SUCI calculation in the USIM to return an error or returning information necessary for SUCI calculation (denoted as SUCI calculation information) instead of a reject message. Depending on some consciously designed or allowed configuration or policy, the USIM could as well calculate SUCI when requested by the ME, even when the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value is &#x201c;calculate in ME&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">It is also our teaching that the USIM could as well always provide to ME at least the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value. Referring to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b></figref>, doing so would allow the ME to first read or check the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value and perform the shown &#x201c;Request SUCI calculation information&#x201d; only if the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value is &#x201c;calculate in ME&#x201d;. In addition, doing so enables the ME to delete any cached or stored information from earlier time.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">Having the USIM conditionally provide the information necessary for SUCI calculation to the ME works. Nevertheless, it is still not sufficient on its own. Mind that the said information that the USIM would not provide to the ME (e.g., SUPI, HN public key, encryption scheme parameters, etc.) is not strictly meant to be hidden from the ME. For example, asymmetric encryption schemes are not designed to hide the public key. The name HN public key itself suggests that said key is public and not private. Therefore, theoretically, it could be assumed that the ME would somehow have access to the information necessary for SUCI calculation, even though the USIM does not provide them.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Another scenario in which the ME would have access to information necessary for SUCI calculation is when the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value was originally provisioned as &#x201c;calculate in ME&#x201d; by the HN in the USIM. So, the USIM would provide the information necessary for SUCI calculation to the ME. Next, for some reason, the HN could decide to change or re-provision the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value in the USIM to &#x201c;calculate in USIM&#x201d;. The HN might do this to avoid incorrect implementation of a SUCI calculation in a misbehaving ME. In such case, the ME could have cached the information necessary for SUCI calculation from earlier time. Thus, although the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value is now &#x201c;calculate in USIM&#x201d;, the ME has access to the information necessary for SUCI calculation. It is therefore our teaching that, when the HN provisions or re-provisions the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value in the USIM to &#x201c;calculate in USIM&#x201d;, the HN changes any pre-existing, if any, HN public key and preferably other relevant information as well like identifier of the HN public key, so that any earlier caching done by the ME becomes invalid.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">However, changing the HN public key could be a demanding and operationally complex procedure. Next, we describe a more efficient mechanism. Mind that in order for the 5G network to decrypt the SUCI that was calculated by the UE, both the UE and the 5G network would need to be able to mutually identify the encryption scheme that the UE used when calculating the SUCI. This mutual identification could be done by an identifier called the encryption scheme identifier. Again, recall that the encryption schemes are either standardized or proprietary. So correspondingly, the standardized encryption scheme would need standardized encryption scheme identifiers, and the proprietary encryption schemes would need proprietary encryption scheme identifiers. We point out that among standardized and proprietary encryption schemes, it is the standardized encryption schemes that could have been implemented in ME, meaning that it is the standardized encryption schemes that the ME could use on its own even when the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value is &#x201c;calculate in USIM&#x201d;. It is so because the ME would not know what proprietary encryption schemes are and therefore could not have implemented them, meaning that the ME would not be able to use proprietary encryption schemes on its own when the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value is &#x201c;calculate in USIM&#x201d;. So, it is our teaching that when the HN provisions or re-provisions the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value in the USIM to &#x201c;calculate in USIM&#x201d;, a proprietary encryption scheme identifier is chosen and provisioned by the HN even when the encryption scheme is a standardized one. The effect will be that even though the ME has the information necessary for calculating the SUCI, the ME would not know which encryption scheme to use, because the encryption scheme identifier is not a standardized one. The relationship between the encryption scheme and the encryption scheme identifier is therefore proprietary information that is required for calculation of the SUCI, but the ME does not know how to use said proprietary information for calculation of the SUCI because it does not know this relationship. Therefore, the ME would have to let the USIM calculate the SUCI.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Another possibility is that, when the HN provisions or re-provisions the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value in the USIM to &#x201c;calculate in USIM&#x201d;, a proprietary encryption scheme is chosen and correspondingly a proprietary encryption scheme identifier. In this case, the proprietary encryption scheme is set as required for calculation of the SUCI, and the ME does not know how to use said proprietary information for calculation of the SUCI.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Additionally, it is also our teaching that when the HN provisions or re-provisions the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value in the USIM the USIM informs or notifies the ME about the said change. The USIM could use USIM application Toolkit (USAT) command called REFRESH to the ME so that the ME could be triggered to re-read the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value from the USIM. Doing so avoids the situation when the ME would have read the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator value &#x201c;calculate in ME&#x201d; and would continue to itself calculate SUCI even when the SUCI-Calculation-Indicator has changed to &#x201c;calculate in USIM&#x201d;.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">It should be appreciated that with our proposals or teachings, the ME would not be able to calculate the SUCI even when the ME can read or has access to the information necessary for SUCI calculation. This gives the HN an effective control over whether the ME or USIM does the actual calculation of the SUCI. Further, with our proposals, misbehaving MEs would be easily detectable both by the HN and the user as those MEs would not be able to receive the network service.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a wireless network in accordance with some embodiments.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Although the subject matter described herein may be implemented in any appropriate type of system using any suitable components, the embodiments disclosed herein are described in relation to a wireless network, such as the example wireless network illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.

Unless otherwise noted, the term WD may be used interchangeably herein with user equipment (UE). Communicating wirelessly may involve transmitting and/or receiving wireless signals using electromagnetic waves, radio waves, infrared waves, and/or other types of signals suitable for conveying information through air. In some embodiments, a WD may be configured to transmit and/or receive information without direct human interaction. For instance, a WD may be designed to transmit information to a network on a predetermined schedule, when triggered by an internal or external event, or in response to requests from the network. Examples of a WD include, but are not limited to, a smart phone, a mobile phone, a cell phone, a voice over IP (VoIP) phone, a wireless local loop phone, a desktop computer, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless cameras, a gaming console or device, a music storage device, a playback appliance, a wearable terminal device, a wireless endpoint, a mobile station, a tablet, a laptop, a laptop-embedded equipment (LEE), a laptop-mounted equipment (LME), a smart device, a wireless customer-premise equipment (CPE). a vehicle-mounted wireless terminal device, etc. A WD may support device-to-device (D2D) communication, for example by implementing a 3GPP standard for sidelink communication, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and may in this case be referred to as a D2D communication device. As yet another specific example, in an Internet of Things (IoT) scenario, a WD may represent a machine or other device that performs monitoring and/or measurements, and transmits the results of such monitoring and/or measurements to another WD and/or a network node. The WD may in this case be a machine-to-machine (M2M) device, which may in a 3GPP context be referred to as an MTC device. As one particular example, the WD may be a UE implementing the 3GPP narrow band internet of things (NB-IoT) standard. Particular examples of such machines or devices are sensors, metering devices such as power meters, industrial machinery, or home or personal appliances (e.g. refrigerators, televisions, etc.) personal wearables (e.g., watches, fitness trackers, etc.). In other scenarios, a WD may represent a vehicle or other equipment that is capable of monitoring and/or reporting on its operational status or other functions associated with its operation.
