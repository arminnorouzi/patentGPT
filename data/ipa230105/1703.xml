FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to manufacturing methods of printed corrugated cardboard.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Corrugated cardboard is a preferred packaging material as it is low cost and lightweight. Lightweight packaging material reduces transportation costs and facilitates the handling during delivery to the customer. A further benefit is that corrugated cardboard boxes are stackable, making them easy to store and transport.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Corrugated cardboard is a packaging material formed by gluing one or more fluted sheets of paperboard (called corrugating medium) to one or more flat sheets of linerboard (called facings). It comes in four common types: (1) Single face: one fluted sheet glued to one facing (total two sheets); (2) Single wall: one fluted sheet sandwiched between two facings (total three sheets), also called double face or single ply; (3) Double wall: one single-face glued to one single wall so that two fluted sheets are alternatively sandwiched between three flat sheets (total five sheets), also called double cushion or double ply; and (4) Triple wall: two single-face glued to one single wall so that three fluted sheets are alternatively sandwiched between four flat sheets (total seven sheets), also called triple ply.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditionally, images have been printed on corrugated cardboard using flexographic and offset printing technologies. With the role of e-commerce becoming more and more significant, the direct contact of the seller with the customer decreases. Companies are investigating ways to maintain and enhance customer experience and customer engagement. The packaging is becoming the way to realize this by customized or even personalized messaging. Such messaging is however extremely expensive to print by flexography or offset. A preferred alternative technology is inkjet that has no-press set-up time (no plates and plate changes) and allows for short lead times.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">As packaging can have a significant influence on consumer purchasing, there is a demand for increased image quality. For example, EP 3360934 A (FUJIFILM) discloses an inkjet ink set for corrugated cardboard that comprises inks of five colors with different color tones, while generally four-color ink sets composed of a yellow (Y) ink, a magenta (M) ink, a cyan (C) ink, and a black (K) ink have been hitherto used.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to image quality, also a high productivity is required in an industrial environment. Reliability of inkjet printing, especially when using single-pass inkjet printing systems is of the uttermost importance. Single pass inkjet machines run at very high speeds, some even up to 150 m/min. For example, the clogging of one or more nozzles by inkjet ink results in line artefacts in the printed image, waste of materials and interruptions of the printing process. This represents not only a financial loss, but also a loss in productivity.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is still a need for improved methods for manufacturing printed corrugated cardboard in an economical manner with an inkjet printing process having high reliability and improved image quality.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to overcome the problems described above, preferred embodiments of the present invention have been realized with a method of manufacturing printed corrugated cardboard as defined in claim <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It was surprisingly found that for certain piezoelectric print heads a relation exists between the outer nozzle surface area of the nozzles in a print head and the water content in the aqueous inkjet ink, so that reliable inkjet printing is achieved.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is an objection of the invention to provide an improved method of manufacturing printed corrugated cardboard using specific aqueous inkjet inks in piezoelectric through-flow print heads having nozzles with an outer nozzle surface area NS smaller than 500 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another object of the invention is to provide a combination of piezoelectric through-flow print heads having nozzles with an outer nozzle surface area NS smaller than 500 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>and specific pigmented aqueous inkjet inks from an aqueous inkjet ink set for producing printed corrugated cardboard with high image quality and reliability.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">These and other objectives will become apparent from the detailed description hereinafter.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the structure of a corrugated cardboard formed by gluing a fluted paperboard (<b>1</b>) with glue (<b>4</b>) to a paper linerboard (<b>2</b>) and a paper linerboard (<b>3</b>).</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.A shows a cross-section of an end shooter print head, where the print head walls (<b>10</b>) encompass an ink channel (<b>14</b>) supplied with inkjet ink via an ink inlet (<b>12</b>), which can only leave the print head as an ejected ink droplet (<b>17</b>) via ink ejection (<b>11</b>) through a nozzle (<b>16</b>) in the nozzle plate (<b>15</b>) of the print head.

An amount of 40 wt % is required in order to avoid mist formation and have acceptable drying speed. Preferably A wt %&#x2265;44 wt %, more preferably A wt %&#x2265;45 wt %.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0033">The manufacturing method preferably includes a step c) of laminating the inkjet printed paper linerboard onto a fluted paperboard of a corrugated cardboard. This method, visualized by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, is advantageous for image quality. In the alternative method of printing directly on the corrugated cardboard, visualized by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the flexographic printing rolls (<b>24</b>, <b>26</b>) may create a so-called washboard effect by the pressure applied to the corrugated card board. The latter is not obtained when the flexographic printing rolls (<b>24</b>, <b>26</b>) apply the ink receiving layer and protective varnish layer onto an inkjet printed paper linerboard, which is then afterwards glued to a single face. The smaller pressure applied by lamination rollers is homogeneously applied and does not create a washboard effect, contrary to flexographic printing rolls which can print a layer image-wise.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0034">In a preferred embodiment of the manufacturing method, the inkjet printing is performed according to a single pass printing process. This results in a much higher productivity.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0035">The manufacturing method preferably also includes a step of applying a protective varnish layer on the inkjet printed image. Such a protective varnish layer generally also increases the glossiness of the inkjet printed image, which is beneficial for the image quality.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0036">In a particularly preferred embodiment of the manufacturing method, the ink receiving layer and/or the protective varnish layer are applied by flexographic printing. This is beneficial for productivity. The ink receiving layer and protective varnish layer can also be applied by coating, e.g. using a bar-coater or a knife coater. However, coating methods generally create more waste as it takes some time to reach a stable coating state of good quality. Flexographic printing has the advantage that the flexographic printing rolls can be easily incorporated in the inkjet printing system and operated at the same printing speed.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0037">In a particularly preferred embodiment, the manufacturing method of printed cardboard according the invention is used for manufacturing corrugated cardboard packaging boxes wherein the inkjet printed image is located on the inside of corrugated cardboard packaging box. Such a packaging box may be inside-only print, or alternatively the outside of the packaging box may be printed, for example, with the brand of the e-commerce company selling the goods for a manufacturer.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0038">By printing inside the box, or inside-only print, it is chosen to skip printing customized or personalized messaging for enhancing customer experience and customer engagement on the exterior of the packaging box. The result of printing inside the box is a great unboxing experience offering a wow factor by cleverly placed branding and messaging that can surprise and delight customers. In addition, it reduces theft and provides privacy. Since printing inside is nondescript, people may be less likely to steal a package that doesn't reveal its contents. Furthermore, many delivered packages end up with wear and tear on the outside. The unscathed interior will be the focus when the customer opens it.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0039">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the above described manufacturing method of printed cardboard is used for manufacturing a corrugated cardboard packaging box, wherein the inkjet printed image is located on the inside of the corrugated cardboard packaging box.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0040">When inkjet printing an image, the one or more pigmented aqueous inkjet inks are preferably not of the aqueous UV curable inkjet ink type. This means that the one or more pigmented aqueous inkjet inks do not contain a photoinitiator or polymerizable compounds, which can migrate into to content (e.g. foodstuffs) of the corrugated cardboard packaging box and thus create a health risk, especially when the inkjet printed image is located on the inside of the corrugated cardboard packaging box.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Corrugated Cardboard</heading><p id="p-0044" num="0041">Cardboard can come in a variety of constructions, such as e.g. honeycomb cardboard. However, for easy creasing into packaging boxes a cardboard using a paper fluting medium is used. Such a cardboard is referred to as corrugated cardboard. The fluted paperboard provides strength to the cardboard. This is important for deliverability, as if merchandise doesn't arrive intact in the hands of the customers, then a company risks its reputation with them.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0042">The preferred corrugated cardboard in the present invention is single wall or double wall, more preferably single wall corrugated cardboard as this is sufficiently strong and easy to crease. Single face corrugated cardboard generally has insufficient strength to hold the merchandise articles, while triple wall cardboard is often more difficult to crease into a packaging box.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0043">The paper board used in corrugated cardboard, such as Kraft paper, has usually a brownish colour. In a preferred embodiment of the manufacturing method described above, the paper liner board (<b>23</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> has a white colour. By having a white background, an enhanced image quality is obtained. Inkjet printed colours on the white paper liner board (<b>23</b>) have a much higher vibrancy then when printed on brownish Kraft paper linerboard. The white colour background also contributes to the customer experience as the customer regards this as a more luxurious product. Alternatively, the white background may be applied as a layer by coating or printing prior to inkjet printing. However, a white paper liner board is preferred, as this enhances reliability of the printing process by eliminating possible problems that may occur during coating or printing the white layer.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0044">Suitable paper liner board having a white background include white top kraftliner and white coated kraftliner.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0045">In the preferred embodiment of manufacturing printed corrugated cardboard, as illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the single face corrugated cardboard is used in the form of a roll instead of sheets. The use of single face supplied in rolls contributes to gains in productivity and reliability, as gluing the inkjet printed paper linerboard onto the single face can go faster with less errors, than it would with individual single face sheets.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0046">Also the corrugated cardboard as used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is preferably used in the form of corrugated rolls. Alternatively, a corrugated cardboard can be used in the form of a fanfold. Fanfold is a continuous sheet of corrugated board that has been scored and folded like a fan.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0047">Corrugated board in rolls usually has an elastic property due to a special soft inner liner allowing it to be delivered in rolls.

The application of a voltage changes the shape of the piezoelectric ceramic transducer in the print head creating a void, which is then filled with ink. When the voltage is again removed, the ceramic expands to its original shape, ejecting a drop of ink from the print head.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0061">The difference between piezoelectric through-flow print heads and other piezoelectric print heads is shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.

Mixed crystals are also referred to as solid solutions. For example, under certain conditions different quinacridones mix with each other to form solid solutions, which are quite different from both physical mixtures of the compounds and from the compounds themselves. In a solid solution, the molecules of the components enter into the same crystal lattice, usually, but not always, that of one of the components. The x-ray diffraction pattern of the resulting crystalline solid is characteristic of that solid and can be clearly differentiated from the pattern of a physical mixture of the same components in the same proportion. In such physical mixtures, the x-ray pattern of each of the components can be distinguished, and the disappearance of many of these lines is one of the criteria of the formation of solid solutions.

Preferably the concentration is 1.5 to 6.0 wt %, and more preferably 2.0 to 5.0 wt % based on the total weight of the pigmented inkjet ink. A pigment concentration of at least 2 wt % is preferred to reduce the amount of inkjet ink needed to produce the desired inkjet image leading to an enhanced productivity as less water and solvent have to be removed by drying. A pigment concentration higher than 5 wt % leads to graininess when light colours have to be printed, which is detrimental to image quality.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="2">Polymeric Dispersants</heading><p id="p-0091" num="0091">The aqueous inkjet inks preferably contain a polymeric dispersant for dispersing the pigment.

The liquid components form the dispersion medium, which in the present invention contains at least water and preferably one or more water-soluble organic solvents. Regarding the water-soluble solvent, known solvents can be used without particular limitations.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0107">When an inkjet print head or certain nozzles thereof are in non-printing mode (printing idle time) then evaporation of the liquid components may take place. Upon activating the print head or the idle nozzles after a prolonged non-printing time, some nozzles can be clogged (=failing nozzles). This phenomenon is called latency. Latency due to evaporation can be addressed by including one or more organic solvents having a higher boiling point than water. However, large amounts of such organic solvents also reduce the productivity as it takes longer time to dry the inkjet printed samples.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0108">Another cause of latency is a sub-optimal dispersion of the colour pigment. Colour pigments are usually dispersed with polymeric dispersants having hydrophobic anchor parts adhering to the hydrophobic surface of the colour pigment particles and hydrophilic parts dissolved in the aqueous dispersion medium for realizing steric stabilization of the colour pigment. The addition of large amounts of organic solvents tend to dissolve the hydrophobic parts from the pigment surface and to reduce the dissolution of the hydrophilic parts of the dispersant, resulting in a precipitation of the pigment.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0109">Usually latency is evaluated on a long term of hours or days. However, there exists also a so-called short term latency, which occurs during printing and is evaluated on a short term of seconds or even fractions of seconds. After a certain print idle time of, for example, half a second, a nozzle tends to fire the first ink droplets at a much lower drop velocity than when in a steady-state of continuously printing ink droplets. This is illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> showing a better short term latency for ink A than for ink B after a printing idle time of 0.5 seconds. The curves for ink A and B are determined by consecutively measuring the drop velocity of the n-th droplet fired by the inkjet print head, with n being 1, 2, 3, 4 and 10.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0110">In the present invention, it was found that the printing reliability of aqueous inkjet inks could be enhanced by controlling the water content in a certain range for piezoelectric through-flow print heads having an outer nozzle surface area NS smaller than 500 &#x3bc;m<sup>2</sup>.

The contents of the milling mixture comprise the mill grind and the milling media. The mill grind comprises pigment, dispersant and a liquid carrier, preferably water. For aqueous ink-jet inks, the pigment is usually present at 10 to 30 wt % in the mill grind, excluding the milling media.

Often the sieve is built into the mill, e.g. for a bead mill. The milled pigment concentrate is preferably separated from the milling media by filtration.</p><p id="p-0159" num="0154">In general, it is desirable to make the colour ink in the form of a concentrated mill grind, which is subsequently diluted to the appropriate concentration for use in the ink-jet printing system. This technique permits preparation of a greater quantity of pigmented ink from the equipment. If the mill grind was made in a solvent, it is diluted with water and optionally other solvents to the appropriate concentration. If it was made in water, it is diluted with either additional water or water miscible solvents to make a mill grind of the desired concentration. By dilution, the ink is adjusted to the desired viscosity, colour, hue, saturation density, and print area coverage for the particular application. Viscosity can also be adjusted by using low molecular weight polyethylene glycols, for example having an average numerical molecular weight between 200 and 800.

The aqueous inkjet inks are jetted by these print heads ejecting small droplets in a controlled manner through nozzles onto a substrate, which is moving relative to the print heads. In a multi-pass inkjet printing process, the inkjet print head scans back and forth in a transversal direction across the moving ink-receiver surface. Sometimes the inkjet print head does not print on the way back. However, bi-directional printing is preferred for productivity. However, for optimal productivity, printing is preferably performed by a single pass printing process. This can be executed by using page wide inkjet print heads or multiple staggered inkjet print heads, which cover the entire width of the ink-receiving surface. In a single pass printing process, the inkjet print heads usually remain stationary while the substrate surface is transported under the inkjet print heads. Preferably multiple staggered inkjet print heads are used, as this is more cost-effective than page wide inkjet print heads when a print head contains one or more failing nozzles and has to be replaced.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0184">In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the inkjet printer is a single pass inkjet printing device including the above described combination of piezoelectric through-flow print heads having nozzles with an outer nozzle surface area NS smaller than 500 &#x3bc;m<sup>2 </sup>and the above described aqueous inkjet inks.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0185">A dryer may be included in the inkjet printing device for removing at least part of the aqueous dispersion medium.

The drop velocity of a second ink drop was determined for a printing idle time of 0.5 s and of 1.0 s. The print head was set with the appropriate voltage and ink temperature in order to achieve a steady-state drop velocity of 6 m/s. A loss in drop velocity for the second ink drop of less than 20% is considered as a good short term latency.</p><heading id="h-0029" level="2">5.

For example, the combinations COMP-3, INV-1 and INV-3 all used the same ink Ink-3 containing 48.1 wt % of water. The end shooter print head of COMP-3 had an outer nozzle surface area in between that of the through-flow heads of INV-1 and INV-3, yet failed in short term latency by having a drop velocity of less than 1 m/s for the second drop at 0.5 s and 1.0 s printing idle time. The combinations INV-1 and INV-3 both had a drop velocity of 5.7 m/s at 0.5 s printing idle time, while they had a drop velocity of 5.5 m/s respectively 5.1 m/s at 1.0 s printing idle time. If the water content is increased too much, then the jetting becomes unstable as illustrated by combination COMP-5 versus INV-1 and combination COMP-6 versus INV-3. Replacing too much water in the ink of combination INV-3 by organic solvent results in mist formation and unacceptable drying speed as shown by combination COMP-7, although the short term latency could be maintained (drop velocity of 5.6 m/s at 0.5 s printing idle time and of 5.0 m/s at 1.0 s printing idle time).
