No. 16/902,432, filed Jun. 16, 2020, and entitled &#x201c;Coordination Platform For Generating and Managing Authority Tokens,&#x201d; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Aspects of the disclosure relate to data processing systems, information security, and electronic event processing. In particular, one or more aspects of the disclosure relate to computing platforms that implement token generation and validation methods in coordinating, delegating, and granting authority, as well as verifying such grants of authority.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some cases, an individual may be indisposed or otherwise unavailable to perform a task that requires in person performance by the individual or another individual granted power of attorney, and may grant the power of attorney to the other individual accordingly. In some instances, however, such grant of power of attorney may raise various security concerns, including information security concerns, because the grant of power of attorney may be misused to perform tasks beyond the scope of the granted authority and/or used by a bad actor impersonating the true recipient of the power of attorney. Accordingly, these security concerns may limit willingness to grant power of attorney from a remote or otherwise different location than a law office, an enterprise organization at which the task may be performed (e.g., a financial institution, medical facility, utility company, or the like), or the like. This sparse grant of power of attorney may result in technical inefficiencies such as an inability to perform tasks, process and/or execute various events, or the like until an individual is able to physically return to the enterprise organization. Furthermore, these security concerns may limit transfer of power of attorney in an electronic manner.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aspects of the disclosure provide effective, efficient, scalable, and convenient technical solutions that address and overcome the technical problems associated with granting and validating authority tokens, such as power of attorney tokens. For example, some aspects of the disclosure provide techniques that may enable computing devices to identify a power of attorney recipient, generate an authority token granting a limited power of attorney to that recipient, and subsequently validate the authority token. In some instances, this authority token may be encrypted and/or may be validated using biometric data. In doing so, various technical advantages may be realized. For example, one technical advantage is increased security of electronic transfer of power of attorney (e.g., by encrypting the token for decryption exclusively by an event processing system configured to perform a specific task corresponding to the power of attorney). Another technical advantage is improved power of attorney validation by implementing multi-layer validation that includes validating the authority token (e.g., based on successful decryption), validating task information (e.g., ensuring that tasks performed are limited to those for which power of attorney has been granted), and/or validating identity (e.g., using biometrics to verify that the individual attempting to perform the task is the true recipient of the authority token). Accordingly, these advantages may result in increased enterprise efficiencies (e.g., task performance, event processing, or the like) and/or increased security of electronic power of attorney grants and utilization.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with one or more embodiments of the disclosure, a computing platform comprising at least one processor, a communication interface, and memory storing computer-readable instructions may receive, from a user device corresponding to a first individual, contact information for a second individual. The computing platform may store the contact information in a user profile corresponding to the second individual. The computing platform may receive user input indicating a task to be performed and requesting that a power of attorney be granted to the second individual, where the task is required to be performed in person by one of: the first individual or an individual who has been granted power of attorney by the first individual. The computing platform may generate an authority token granting the second individual the power of attorney for the first individual to perform the task. Using the contact information, the computing platform may send the authority token and task information indicating the task to a user device corresponding to the second individual. After sending the authority token and the task information indicating the task to the user device corresponding to the second individual, the computing platform may receive, from an event processing system, a validation request comprising the authority token and the task information indicating the task. The computing platform may validate the authority token and the task information indicating the task. Based on successful validation of the authority token and the task information indicating the task, the computing platform may send authority validation information to the event processing system. The computing platform may receive confirmation information from the user device corresponding to the second individual indicating that the task has been completed. After receiving confirmation that the task has been performed by the second individual, the computing platform may update client dashboard information to indicate that the task has been completed, which may cause the user device to display a client dashboard indicating that the task has been completed.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one or more instances, the first individual may be located in a first state, and the task may be limited to performance in a second state. In one or more instances, the task may be performed at a first enterprise organization, and the authority token may be formatted for use exclusively by the first enterprise organization.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one or more instances, the computing platform may generate the authority token by: 1) sending, to the user device corresponding to the second individual, a request to input biometric data, 2) receiving biometric information corresponding to the second individual, and 3) generating, based at least in part on the biometric information, the authority token.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one or more instances, the computing platform may send, to the user device corresponding to the second individual, a request to display an indication of the task and prompt for acceptance of the task. The computing platform may receive, from the user device corresponding to the second individual, task acceptance information indicating that the second individual will perform the task. In these instances, the computing platform may generate the authority token based on receipt of the task acceptance information.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one or more instances, the request to input the biometric data may be sent along with the request to display the indication of the task and the biometric data may be received along with the task acceptance information. In one or more instances, the request to input the biometric data may be sent along with the authority token.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one or more instances, the computing platform may receive additional biometric data from the user device corresponding to the second individual. By comparing the additional biometric data to the biometric data, the computing platform may identify a biometric match for the second individual. Based on identifying the biometric match for the second individual, the computing platform may send biometric validation information to the event processing system.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one or more instances, sending the authority validation information and the biometric validation information to the event processing system may cause the event processing system to perform one or more actions corresponding to the task. In one or more instances, the client dashboard may include a status of one or more tasks including the task, where each of the one or more tasks are performed by one or more individuals including the second individual.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">These features, along with many others, are discussed in greater detail below.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present disclosure is illustrated by way of example and not limited in the accompanying figures in which like reference numerals indicate similar elements and in which:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> depict an illustrative computing environment for implementing techniques for generation and validation of a power of attorney token in accordance with one or more example embodiments;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>J</figref> depict an illustrative event sequence for implementing techniques for generation and validation of a power of attorney token in accordance with one or more example embodiments;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an illustrative method for implementing techniques for generation and validation of a power of attorney token in accordance with one or more example embodiments; and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>8</b></figref> depict illustrative graphical user interfaces for implementing techniques for generation and validation of a power of attorney token in accordance with one or more example embodiments.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the following description of various illustrative embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, various embodiments in which aspects of the disclosure may be practiced. In some instances, other embodiments may be utilized, and structural and functional modifications may be made, without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is noted that various connections between elements are discussed in the following description. It is noted that these connections are general and, unless specified otherwise, may be direct or indirect, wired or wireless, and that the specification is not intended to be limiting in this respect.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">As a brief introduction to the concepts described further herein, one or more aspects of the disclosure describe a secure vault that provides a centralized place where authority tokens may be stored. The authority tokens may, for instances, may provide consent by a first individual to one or more other individuals to handle actions on the first individual's behalf. The secure vault may operate as a certificate authority and may provide an individual with a single place to create, manage, and/or revoke authority delegations. For example, if an individual is using DNA identification or other multi-factor authentication to conduct business, but is indisposed, he or she may be able to delegate authority to a family member (e.g., to give power of attorney) to handle matters on the disposed individuals behalf. Aspects of the disclosure may be applied in use cases involving finance, natural disasters, emergences, medical events, life events, and/or other instances.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Accordingly, by performing one or more of the methods described herein, power of attorney may be granted in a remote and secure manner and may be verified using multi-factor authentication. This may allow for indisposed or otherwise unavailable individuals to perform tasks that may require in person performance (e.g., by the individuals or one granted a power of attorney) while minimizing security risks. For example, a secure token may be created in the secure vault and rights associated with the token may be granted from one user to another as a representation of the power of attorney. This secure token may be validated along with an indication of the task to be performed (e.g., a holder of the token is limited to perform a particular task), biometric information (e.g., to further verify the identity of the holder of the power of attorney), or the like. Furthermore, in some instances, the time limited nature of the secure token may contribute to increased security.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref> depict an illustrative computing environment that implements generation and validation of a power of attorney token in accordance with one or more example embodiments.
