The wearable device mainly includes: a housing <b>10</b>, a rotary disk <b>20</b>, a position detecting unit (not shown), a processor (not shown), and a knob <b>30</b>. Structures and a connection relationship of main components of the wearable device will be introduced below.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The rotary disk <b>20</b> may be a cover body having a roughly circular shape entirely, which covers an upper surface of the housing <b>10</b>. The rotary disk <b>20</b> is rotatably connected the housing <b>10</b>. In an example, a connecting shaft is disposed at a center of the housing <b>10</b> and the rotary disk <b>20</b>, so that the rotary disk <b>20</b> is rotatably connected to the housing <b>10</b>. In another example, an accommodating groove is disposed on the housing <b>10</b>, and an edge of the rotary disk <b>20</b> is located in the accommodating groove, so that the rotary disk <b>20</b> is rotatably connected to the housing <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a first returning body <b>201</b> is disposed at the rotary disk <b>20</b>, and a second returning body <b>101</b> is disposed on the housing <b>10</b>. The first returning body <b>201</b> and the second returning body <b>101</b> are configured to enable the rotary disk <b>20</b> to be rotated for returning to an original position, that is, enable the rotary disk <b>20</b> to be returned to an initial position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an example, the first returning body <b>201</b> is a magnet, the second returning body <b>101</b> is also a magnet, and magnetic poles of the first returning body <b>201</b> are opposite to those of the second returning body <b>101</b>, so that an attractive force can be generated between the first returning body <b>201</b> and the second returning body <b>101</b>. The attractive force is used for the rotary disk <b>20</b> to be returned to the original position.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an indicator <b>202</b> is disposed at the rotary disk <b>20</b>, and the indicator <b>202</b> is configured to indicate to a user a position to which the rotary disk <b>20</b> is rotated along the housing <b>10</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the rotary disk <b>20</b> is rotated clockwise to the right, so as to be rotated to a 1 o'clock position of the housing <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The indicator <b>202</b> may be a luminous bump, so that the user can check, in a case of insufficient light, a position to which the rotary disk <b>20</b> is rotated along the housing <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a schematic diagram of a connection relationship between the housing <b>10</b> and the rotary disk <b>20</b>. In this embodiment, a position detecting unit includes a rolling body <b>204</b> and a pressure-sensitive composite layer <b>102</b>. The rolling body <b>204</b> may be spherical, is disposed between the rotary disk <b>20</b> and the housing <b>10</b>, and is connected to the rotary disk <b>20</b> and the housing <b>10</b> in a rolling manner. In addition, the pressure-sensitive composite layer <b>102</b> is disposed on a rolling track of the rolling body <b>204</b>, the pressure-sensitive composite layer <b>102</b> may be electrically connected to a processor, and the rolling track of the rolling body <b>204</b> may be a circular ring.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">It can be further seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> that a limiting disk <b>203</b> is also disposed on the rotary disk <b>20</b>, the limiting disk <b>203</b> is fixedly connected to a body of the rotary disk, and a position of the limiting disk <b>203</b> corresponds to a position of the indicator <b>202</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the indicator <b>202</b> is disposed at an upper surface of the rotary disk <b>20</b>, the limiting disk <b>203</b> is disposed at a lower surface of the rotary disk <b>20</b>, and the indicator <b>202</b> and the limiting disk <b>203</b> are disposed to be opposite to each other at a same position of the rotary disk <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> that the limiting disk <b>203</b> includes a roughly bowl-shaped accommodating cavity, the rolling body <b>204</b> is accommodated in the accommodating cavity of the limiting disk <b>203</b>, and the rolling body <b>204</b> is rotatably connected to the rotary disk <b>20</b> in the limiting disk <b>203</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">It can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> that the pressure-sensitive composite layer <b>102</b> is disposed on the rolling track of the rolling body <b>204</b>, and a lower part of the pressure-sensitive composite layer <b>102</b> is a base <b>103</b> of the housing <b>10</b>. This way, through the rolling body <b>204</b> and the pressure-sensitive composite layer <b>102</b>, a position to which the rotary disk <b>20</b> is rotated along the housing <b>10</b> can be detected in real time, and the position (information) can be sent to the processor.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">For the pressure-sensitive composite layer <b>102</b>, in an example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the pressure-sensitive composite layer <b>102</b> sequentially includes from top to bottom: a non-slip plastic layer <b>1021</b>; an oxidized metal conductive layer <b>1022</b> contacting the non-slip plastic layer <b>1021</b>; an isolating particulate matter layer <b>1023</b> contacting the oxidized metal conductive layer <b>1022</b>, and a conductive coating <b>1024</b> contacting the isolating particulate matter layer <b>1023</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this embodiment of this present application, multiple positions on the housing <b>10</b> correspond to multiple shortcut functions. In an example, each integer number represents a shortcut function. For example, the rotary disk <b>20</b> is rotated clockwise to the right (that is, rotated relative to the housing <b>10</b>, and the rest is similar) to enable a calling function, 1 represents calling Zhang San, 2 represents calling Li Si . . . ; and the rotary disk <b>20</b> is rotated counterclockwise to the left to enable other shortcut functions except the calling function, for example, 11 represents enabling music, and 10 represents enabling positioning . . . .</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Through the foregoing settings, the processor disposed in the wearable device can detect a target position to which the rotary disk <b>20</b> is rotated along the housing <b>10</b>, and enable a shortcut function corresponding to the target position based on the target position.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the wearable device introduced in each of the foregoing embodiments further includes a display unit (not numbered) electrically connected to the processor, and the display unit is configured to show (or display) prompt information corresponding to the target position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the prompt information displayed by the display unit includes: &#x201c;Call Zhang San&#x201d; and a telephone number corresponding to Zhang San.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The wearable device provided in an embodiment of this application includes the rotary disk, the housing, the position detecting unit, and the processor, the rotary disk is rotatably connected to the housing, and multiple positions on the housing correspond to multiple shortcut functions. This way, the position detecting unit is configured to detect the target position to which the rotary disk is rotated along the housing, and the processor can enable, based on the target position to which the rotary disk is rotated along the housing, a shortcut function corresponding to the target position.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In this embodiment of this application, shortcut operations for some functions of the wearable device can be implemented through the rotary disk and a preset corresponding program, and some shortcut buttons can be canceled, so that the wearable device has simple design, brief and elegant appearance, and can be operated easily and practically.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The foregoing embodiments mainly introduce a main structure of the wearable device, and a working principle thereof will be introduced below.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">A structure of the pressure-sensitive composite layer <b>102</b> disposed on the housing <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, which may be a resistance-type touch screen. A pressure of the rolling body <b>204</b> (including gravity of the rolling body <b>204</b> and a pressing force of a user's finger) enables a part of the pressure-sensitive composite layer <b>102</b> to deform. Therefore, conductive layers on a top/bottom of the isolating particulate matter layer <b>1023</b> are connected, a resistance value is changed, and a corresponding electrical signal is transmitted through a sensor and sent to the processor through a conversion circuit. Then, the processor can determine a position to which the rotary disk <b>20</b> is rotated along the housing <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Multiple shortcut functions are preset in the wearable device provided in the embodiment of this application. For example, when the rotary disk is rotated clockwise to the right, a function of quick dial is enabled, and when the rotary disk is rotated counterclockwise to the left, functions such as music and positioning are enabled.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">For example, the function of the quick dial is enabled if the rotary disk <b>20</b> is rotated clockwise to the right. A name, photo, or phone number of a contact person indicated by 1, 2, or 3 . . . in the system can be stored in turn. Other shortcut functions are enabled if the rotary disk <b>20</b> is rotated to the left. Each integer number represents one function, for example, 11 represents enabling music, 10 represents enabling positioning, 9 represents enabling another function . . . .</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the user needs to implement a shortcut function (or a shortcut operation), the user can press the rotary disk <b>20</b> with a finger to rotate the rotary disk to a specific direction. During rotation, the rolling body <b>204</b> (such as a ball) under the rotary disk <b>20</b> will roll on the pressure-sensitive composite layer <b>102</b>, the processor of the wearable device determines a position of the rolling body <b>204</b> according to a signal generated by the rolling body <b>204</b>, converts information about the position into a corresponding value, and determines, according to a range of the value, a shortcut operation that the user desires.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, the user rotates the rotary disk <b>20</b> clockwise to the right, and detects that a position of the rolling body <b>204</b> is between 0.5 and 1.5, then the system recommends <b>1</b> by default, and the system displays at least one of a portrait, name, or phone number of a contact person indicated by 1. In addition, the user can determine whether a position of the indicator <b>202</b> is a serial number stored for a frequent contact person. If yes, this image will be kept for a certain time, that is, the rotary disk <b>20</b> stays at the position for a certain time, and the system automatically dials a telephone number of the frequent contact person.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">After the shortcut function is enabled, the user can release the rotary disk <b>20</b> with a finger and swing a wrist (to make an action that enables a 12 o'clock position in the rotary disk <b>20</b> to be in a vertical downward status), the rotary disk <b>20</b> will be returned to an original position due to local mass and a principle of using different magnetic poles to attract each other (the first returning body <b>201</b> contains a weak S pole, and the second returning body <b>101</b> contains a weak N pole). Mass of the rolling body <b>204</b> may be slightly larger than mass of the rotary disk <b>20</b> that is partially thickened, so that during swinging, the rolling body <b>204</b> can be quickly returned to the original position under the action of gravity, that is, the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The rotary disk <b>20</b> that is partially thickened is the rotary disk <b>20</b> on which the first returning body <b>201</b> with an additional thickness and mass is disposed.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the wearable device provided according to an embodiment of this application is operated at night, the indicator <b>202</b> may be, for example, a luminous bump, may shine to a certain extent to facilitate nighttime operation by the user.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Embodiments of this application can implement quick operations for some functions of the wearable device, especially the dialing function, which is very convenient and practical for the elderly and children to operate the wearable device by using the quick dial function due to relatively small watch screens.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The wearable device according to the embodiments of this application has been described in detail above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. A control method according to another embodiment of this application will be described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The control method can be applied to the wearable device described in any of the foregoing embodiments.

For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the prompt information includes an identity of a called person, Zhang San, and a phone number of the called person; and in a case that duration for which the rotary disk stays at the target position reaches preset duration, a shortcut function corresponding to the target position is enabled, for example, a shortcut function of calling Zhang San is enabled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this embodiment, through the foregoing displayed prompt information and the operation of enabling the shortcut function after preset duration, a user's misoperation can be prevented (for example, if the rotary disk is returned after the rotary disk is rotated mistakenly, no corresponding shortcut function will be enabled), which can improve user experience.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The embodiments in this specification are described in a progressive manner. Each embodiment usually focuses on a difference from other embodiments. For a same or similar part of the embodiments, please refer to each other.
