vehicles allowing heat energy to be exchanged between two distinct heat-transfer fluids and a third heat-transfer fluid.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Plate heat exchangers generally comprise a stack of plates forming various superposed circulation spaces through which the various heat-transfer fluids pass. A separate heat-transfer fluid circulates in each circulation space. A first heat-transfer fluid generally circulates in circulation spaces in alternation over the entire height of the stack of plates. The second and third heat-transfer fluids then circulate in distinct circulation spaces between two circulation spaces in which the first heat-transfer fluid circulates. The second and third heat-transfer fluids thus each circulate over part of the height of the stack of plates.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, this type of architecture may result in the three-fluid heat exchanger being of large size, which may present a problem for integration within the motor vehicle.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One of the objects of the present invention is therefore to at least partially overcome the drawbacks of the prior art and to provide an improved three-fluid heat exchanger.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention therefore relates to a
