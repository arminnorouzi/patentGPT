Diesel engines, in particular, are regulated to reduce the amount of polluting gases they emit. The standards limiting the levels of nitrogen oxides emitted are an example of this, and tend to be increasingly restrictive.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the particular case of vehicles fitted with a diesel engine, the depollution of the engine exhaust gases can be carried out by means of a gas treatment device implementing a depollution method such as the selective catalytic reduction method (or SCR method). The SCR method uses a liquid depolluting additive to selectively reduce the nitrogen oxides (NOx) contained in the exhaust gases. Depolluting liquid additive means a depolluting product which can be injected into an exhaust gas treatment device of an engine for the purpose of depolluting the exhaust gases before they are discharged into the atmosphere.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The liquid additive commonly used in the SCR method is a diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) which is an aqueous solution of urea at 32.5% (by weight), also marketed under the AdBlue&#xae; brand. The aqueous solution of urea is a precursor of ammonia (NH3). This ammonia reacts with the nitrogen oxides (NOx) of the exhaust gases to produce less polluting species, namely dinitrogen (N2), water, and carbon dioxide (CO2). Thus, the ammonia used in the SCR method is a reducing agent, supplied as a liquid additive.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In vehicles, the liquid additive is stored in a dedicated reservoir, which is equipped with a metering module also called a liquid additive dispensing device. The liquid additive dispensing device is suitable for withdrawing the liquid additive, metering a determined amount thereof and injecting it into the exhaust gas treatment device with a view to depolluting said gases. For this, the liquid additive dispensing device comprises a casing in which are arranged functional components such as in particular means for pumping, for filtering and/or for metering the liquid additive, means for measuring the amount of liquid additive present in the reservoir, sensors such as a temperature sensor for the liquid additive present in the tank, means for heating the liquid additive adapted to thaw it if necessary, etc.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">This dedicated tank represents additional bulk for the vehicle. Thus, advantageously, the metering module can be placed inside the liquid additive reservoir so that its casing occupies part of the space in the reservoir.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Documents DE 102006040411A1 and DE 102012003156A1 disclose filter cartridges for SCR devices. Such filter cartridges are generally removable, so that they can be replaced during the lifetime of the SCR device.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It appears that it is desirable to be able to use filter cartridges offering different filtration capacities without the need, however, to modify the design of an existing metering module. Indeed, depending on the vehicle, certain applications require the use of a filter having, for example, better dust-holding capacity and/or a lower pressure drop than other applications. Obtaining such improved characteristics may require the use of a larger filter cartridge than a cartridge of standard dimensions for which a metering module may have been designed.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A technical problem which then arises is the lack of flexibility of the filtration capacities for a given metering module, having a casing with specific dimensions and shapes.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention aims to eliminate, or at least attenuate, all or part of the aforementioned drawbacks of the prior art.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">To this end, a first aspect of the invention proposes an extension part of a hollow housing provided in a casing to receive a first filter cartridge, said housing extending along a specific longitudinal axis between a first axial end and a second opposite axial end, and having an opening at the first axial end for inserting said first filter cartridge into the housing parallel to the direction of the longitudinal axis of the housing, and a bottom at the second axial end, said housing having a specific axial depth, between said opening and said bottom, and having at least one circumferential wall extending substantially parallel to said direction and forming an envelope of a specific shape, said extension part having a longitudinal axis and comprising:</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">a) a first axial end by which the part can be inserted into the housing of the casing, and a second axial end provided with an opening through which a second filter cartridge, of greater axial length than the axial depth of the housing, can be inserted and sealed in the part when said part is mounted in the housing of the casing;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">b) a first axial section of substantially equal axial length, by lower values, to the axial depth of the housing of the casing, having a perforated bottom at the level of the first axial end of the part, and having at least one circumferential wall forming a perforated envelope substantially conforming to the envelope of the housing of the casing so as to be able to be placed in said housing;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">c) a second axial section, extending in the axial direction in an extension of the first axial section on the side opposite the first axial end of the part and as far as the second axial end of the part, and having at least one circumferential wall forming a non-perforated envelope which axially extends the perforated envelope of the first section;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">d) a first connection zone, at an axial position between the first axial section and the second axial section of the part, and having first connecting means cooperating with complementary connecting means of the casing at the level of the opening of the housing of the casing, for the leaktight fastening of the part to the casing;

The motor vehicle <b>100</b> is for example a passenger car, a utility vehicle, a lorry or a coach. The motor vehicle <b>100</b> also includes a device <b>120</b> for treating exhaust gases with a module <b>130</b> for implementing the pollution control method known as the SCR method. The vehicle <b>100</b> also comprises a reservoir <b>140</b> for the liquid additive <b>150</b>, coupled to an injector <b>170</b> for introducing the liquid additive <b>150</b> into the gas treatment device <b>120</b> by means of a liquid additive metering module <b>160</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0040">The metering module <b>160</b>, or liquid additive dispensing device, comprises a casing in which are arranged, in particular, functional components for withdrawing the liquid additive and sending it towards the injector <b>170</b>, heating it if necessary, and filtering it, as well as sensors to deliver various information on the quantity and quality of the liquid additive present in the reservoir <b>140</b>. Among the elements thus arranged in the casing, there are for example: a pump for withdrawing liquid additive from the reservoir, conduits for sending the liquid additive withdrawn by the pump to the injector <b>170</b>, at least one valve, various sensors such as level, pressure, temperature and/or flow sensors, an electronic control unit, at least one filter, a device for heating the liquid additive, etc.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0041">The liquid additive can be an aqueous solution of urea at 32.5% such as the solution known under the AdBlue&#xae; brand.

The casing can be made of aluminium, for example, and can be coated with a non-technical polymer material such as high density ethylene polymer (HDPE), which offers the advantage of not reacting with Adblue&#xae;, which is a corrosive solution. Thus, a heating device can be connected to parts of the aluminium casing which are in contact with the liquid additive in the reservoir in order to transmit heat to the liquid additive by conduction. This makes it possible in particular to thaw the liquid additive more easily, if necessary.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0043">As a variant, the casing can be made of HDPE. This polyethylene is the basic polymer of mechanical construction and one of the least expensive. It is an inert plastic, that is, a material which does not react chemically and/or does not deteriorate when it comes into contact with a solution of chemical agent such as a solution of urea. In addition, it is easy to handle and cold-resistant.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0044">Alternatively, again, the casing can also be made of a technical polymer material, such as for example a polyoxymethylene (POM), polyamide, polyimide or a mixture thereof. Such a technical material has better mechanical properties that allow the creation of interfaces of complex shapes on the body of the casing with a relatively low tolerance, that is, dimensional uncertainty, for example of the order of &#xb1;0.05 millimetres (mm).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0045">In all cases, the liquid additive reservoir and the casing of the metering module advantageously form a compact assembly, thus saving space in the motor vehicle. In the configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, for example, the casing does not protrude outward from the reservoir <b>140</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows, in section, a portion of the casing <b>10</b> of a liquid additive metering module such as the module <b>160</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. This portion of the casing <b>10</b> is part of the fluid manifold. It more particularly comprises a hollow housing <b>11</b> provided in the casing to receive a filter cartridge, which may be removable. Such a filter cartridge, not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, has the function of, and is suitable for, filtering impurities in a fluid. In the application envisaged, the fluid is Adblue&#xae; liquid additive, which is pumped into the tank <b>140</b>, and which must be filtered before its injection by the injector <b>170</b> into the exhaust gas treatment device <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0047">For the purposes of the present description, the filter cartridge concerned will be considered to be a standard cartridge, that is, a cartridge of standard dimensions.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the housing <b>11</b> extends along a specific longitudinal axis X, between a first axial end and a second opposite axial end. It has an opening <b>14</b> at the first axial end for inserting the standard filter cartridge (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The filter cartridge is inserted into the housing <b>11</b> via the opening <b>14</b> in parallel to the direction of the longitudinal axis X of the housing. The housing <b>11</b> also has a bottom <b>15</b> at the second axial end. In what follows and unless expressly stated otherwise, the terms &#x201c;front&#x201d;, &#x201c;rear&#x201d;, &#x201c;in front of&#x201d;, &#x201c;behind&#x201d; and &#x201c;depth&#x201d; are used in reference to the direction of insertion into the housing according to the direction of the longitudinal axis X, from the opening <b>14</b> towards the bottom <b>15</b> of the housing <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0049">The housing <b>11</b> has a specific axial depth. Axial depth means a depth along the direction of the longitudinal axis X. This axial depth can be measured, for example, between the opening <b>14</b> and the bottom <b>15</b> of the housing <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0050">Furthermore, the housing <b>11</b> has at least one circumferential wall <b>16</b>. Circumferential wall means a wall extending substantially parallel to the direction of the longitudinal axis X, around said axis, and forming the envelope of the housing <b>11</b>. This envelope has a specific shape, for example the shape of a cylinder. In other words, the section of the envelope of the housing <b>11</b> is, according to this example, a circle. In other examples, it can be a polygon, when the housing has several flat walls, adjacent in pairs, and extending parallel to the direction of the longitudinal axis X. Envelopes of more complex shapes are obviously possible, depending on the needs of the application. However, a cylindrical envelope is the most general case because the filter cartridges intended to be placed in the housing are generally cylindrical.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0051">The housing <b>11</b> has a connection zone at the opening <b>14</b>, in which zone connecting means <b>19</b> are provided for a sealed connection with a cap <b>21</b> for closing the housing. In the example shown of a housing of cylindrical shape, the connecting means <b>19</b> of the housing <b>11</b> comprise an inner thread, adapted to cooperate with complementary connecting means of the cap <b>21</b> comprising a thread <b>22</b>. The tightness of the closure of the housing <b>11</b> by the cap <b>21</b> via these connecting means can be ensured by an O-ring <b>18</b>, not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> but visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, which is placed in the connection zone of the housing <b>11</b> comprising the inner thread <b>19</b>, or of the end of the cap <b>21</b> comprising the thread <b>22</b>, for example after insertion of the filter cartridge and before assembly of the cap. As a variant, in particular if the housing has a non-cylindrical envelope, the complementary connecting means of the housing <b>11</b> and the cap <b>21</b> can comprise bayonet connecting means, for example, or any other equivalent means within the reach of the person skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0052">The fluid collector represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> comprises an inlet conduit <b>12</b> leading into the housing <b>11</b> for entry of the unfiltered fluid into the housing, and a discharge conduit <b>13</b> for outlet of the filtered fluid from the housing <b>11</b>. Admission of the fluid through the conduit <b>12</b>, its passage through the filter cartridge in the housing <b>11</b>, and its discharge through the conduit <b>13</b>, are carried out by pressure difference between the admission circuit comprising the conduit <b>12</b> and the discharge circuit including the conduit <b>13</b>. This pressure difference is obtained thanks to a fluid suction pump arranged upstream of the conduit <b>12</b> or downstream of the conduit <b>13</b>, that is, on the side of the liquid additive tank <b>140</b> or on the side of the exhaust gas treatment device <b>120</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, respectively, with respect to the filter.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0053">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, arrows illustrate the flow of fluid from the visible inlet of the inlet conduit <b>12</b> to the visible outlet of the discharge conduit <b>13</b>, through a standard filter cartridge <b>20</b> when it is in place in the housing <b>11</b> and said housing is closed by the cap <b>21</b>. As can be seen in the figure, an O-ring <b>16</b> is placed slightly in front of the bottom <b>15</b> of the housing <b>11</b> of the casing, and the front end of the filter cartridge <b>20</b> rests against it. Thus, a discharge chamber <b>17</b> is formed between said front end of the standard filter cartridge <b>20</b> and the bottom <b>15</b> of the housing <b>11</b>, in which filtered fluid exits through the front of the filter cartridge <b>20</b>. The discharge conduit <b>13</b> evacuates the filtered fluid from said chamber <b>17</b>. In addition, the O-ring <b>18</b> already mentioned above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is placed at the level of the connection zone of the housing <b>11</b> with the inner thread <b>19</b>, against which the front end of the cap <b>21</b> rests when the thread <b>22</b> engages with the inner thread <b>19</b>. Thus, an intake chamber <b>17</b><i>a </i>is created between the cylindrical body of the filter cartridge and the envelope of the housing <b>11</b>. The inlet conduit <b>12</b> opens into said chamber <b>17</b><i>a</i>. The fluid enters the filter cartridge <b>20</b> through its circumferential envelope and comes out filtered through the aforementioned front end of said cartridge <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0054">Finally, the casing <b>10</b> comprises heating means <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> arranged around the housing <b>11</b>, in the body of the casing, which are adapted to selectively heat the fluid in said housing, for example when the temperature of the fluid or a surrounding temperature is measured below a certain threshold. These heating means can be heating resistors, for example. In particular, they make it possible to thaw the AdBlue&#xae; liquid additive when it is frozen.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0055">The compactness sought for the assembly formed by the liquid additive tank <b>140</b> and the metering module <b>160</b>, which has already been mentioned above with reference to the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, leads to designing a metering module with minimum dimensions, that is, just sufficient to meet the needs of standard applications. This concerns in particular the housing <b>11</b> provided in the casing <b>10</b> of the dosing module to receive the standard filter cartridge <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0056">However, certain applications require the use of a filter having, for example, better dust-holding capacity and/or a lower pressure drop. Obtaining such improved characteristics may require the use of a larger filter cartridge than a cartridge of standard dimensions for which a metering module may have been designed. In such a case, a person skilled in the art who does not benefit from the teaching of the invention will have to modify the design of the casing in order to provide a larger housing capable of receiving a filter cartridge of larger dimensions.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0057">In order to allow the use of another filter cartridge of larger dimensions than those of the standard filter cartridge for which the housing <b>11</b> in the casing <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> has been designed, embodiments of the invention propose the use of a housing <b>11</b> extension part. This is more particularly an axial extension of the housing <b>11</b>, that is, an extension along the direction of the longitudinal axis X. This extension makes it possible to enlarge the axial depth (in the aforementioned sense) of the space intended to receive the other filter cartridge beyond the distance between the opening <b>14</b> and the bottom <b>15</b> of the housing <b>11</b>. In this sense, the extension part is an adapter because it allows adapting a filter cartridge of larger axial dimensions for use in the housing <b>11</b> of smaller axial dimensions.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0058">The simplified diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> show respectively, in section, the extension part <b>40</b> alone and said extension part <b>40</b> in the housing <b>11</b> of the casing <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Furthermore, in the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the larger filter cartridge <b>25</b> is fitted into the adapter <b>40</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a three-dimensional view, in perspective, of an embodiment of the extension part <b>40</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a sectional view of the part <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and of the housing <b>11</b> in the casing <b>10</b>. In these figures, the same elements as those already described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> bear the same references and their description will not be repeated.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0059">The extension part <b>40</b> is a hollow part adapted to receive the larger filter cartridge <b>25</b>. The extension part <b>40</b> has a longitudinal axis, which coincides with the longitudinal axis X of the housing <b>11</b> in the casing <b>10</b> when the part <b>4</b> is mounted in said housing. For the sake of simplicity, reference will be made to the longitudinal axis X to designate both the longitudinal axis of the housing <b>11</b> of the casing <b>10</b> on the one hand, and the longitudinal axis of the part <b>40</b>, on the other hand.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0060">Part <b>40</b> comprises a first axial end through which the part can be inserted into the housing <b>11</b> of the casing <b>10</b>, called the &#x201c;front end&#x201d; in what follows. It also comprises a second axial end, opposite the front end, and called the &#x201c;rear end&#x201d; in what follows. Part <b>40</b> is provided with an opening <b>44</b> at its rear end, through which the filter cartridge <b>25</b> can be inserted into the part <b>40</b> even when the latter is engaged in the housing <b>11</b> by its front end.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0061">As shown in particular in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the part <b>40</b> comprises two axial sections <b>41</b> and <b>42</b>, which extend along the axial extension of one another.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0062">On the side of the front end, the part thus comprises a first axial section <b>41</b>, or front section, of axial length substantially equal, by lower values, to the axial depth of the housing <b>11</b> of the casing <b>10</b>. The front section <b>41</b> has a perforated bottom, to produce an opening <b>47</b> at the front end of the part <b>40</b>. The front section <b>41</b> has at least one circumferential wall forming an envelope substantially conforming to the envelope of the housing <b>11</b> of the casing so as to be able to be placed in said housing <b>11</b>. This envelope is perforated, due to the presence of side openings <b>45</b> and <b>46</b>. Preferably, the openings <b>45</b> and <b>46</b> extend parallel to the direction of the longitudinal axis X and have a length substantially equal to the axial length of the front section <b>41</b>, in order to offer the greatest possible passage to the fluid without too much of an effect the rigidity of the part <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0063">On the side of the rear end, the part <b>40</b> further comprises a second axial section <b>42</b>, or rear section. This section extends in the axial direction along the extension of the first front section <b>41</b>, on the side opposite the front end of part <b>40</b>, and as far as the rear end of the part <b>40</b>. The rear section <b>42</b> has at least one circumferential wall forming a non-perforated envelope, which axially extends the perforated envelope of the front section <b>41</b>. When the front section <b>41</b> is completely inserted into the housing <b>11</b> of the casing <b>10</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the rear section <b>42</b> projects axially outside of said casing <b>10</b>, in the opposite direction to the bottom <b>15</b> of the housing <b>11</b> of the casing <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0064">Sections <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> are delimited between them, axially, by a first connection zone comprising means for connecting the part <b>40</b> to the casing <b>10</b>. These connection means comprise for example a thread <b>48</b> of the part <b>40</b> able to cooperate with the inner thread <b>19</b> of the casing <b>10</b> at the level of the opening <b>14</b> of the housing <b>11</b> of the casing <b>10</b>. In other words, the means for connecting the part <b>40</b> to the casing <b>10</b> are arranged at an axial position substantially corresponding to the junction between the first axial section <b>41</b> and the second axial section <b>42</b> of part <b>40</b>. The above-mentioned connecting means <b>48</b>, <b>19</b> are capable of producing a sealed fastening of the part <b>40</b> to the casing <b>10</b>. To obtain this tightness, the connecting means can include and cooperate with a seal <b>38</b>. In the example shown, the seal <b>38</b> is an annular seal, for example an O-ring.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0065">In other words, and assuming that the housing <b>11</b> of the casing is cylindrical in shape, the means for connecting the part <b>40</b> to the casing <b>10</b>, provided at the level of the opening <b>14</b> of the housing <b>11</b> of the casing <b>10</b>, comprise the inner thread <b>19</b> in the casing <b>10</b> which is provided for fastening by screwing the sealing cap <b>21</b> of the housing <b>11</b> when a standard filter cartridge <b>20</b> is used (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), on the one hand, as well as the first connecting means of the part <b>40</b> comprising the thread <b>48</b> which is complementary to said inner thread <b>19</b>, on the other hand.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0066">The part <b>40</b> comprises a second connection zone, at the level of the rear end of the part, with second connecting means for the leaktight fastening of a cap capable of ensuring the leaktight sealing of the part. The cap can advantageously be the cap <b>21</b> used to close the housing <b>11</b> of the casing <b>10</b> when it contains the standard filter cartridge <b>20</b>, or an identical cap also comprising a thread <b>22</b>. Whereby the connecting means of the cap <b>21</b> comprise, on the one hand, the thread <b>22</b> of the cap <b>21</b> and, on the other hand, a second connecting means of the part <b>40</b> comprising an inner thread <b>49</b> complementary to the thread <b>22</b> at the rear end of the part <b>40</b>. The inner thread <b>49</b> is preferably identical to the inner thread <b>19</b> of the casing <b>10</b> at the opening <b>14</b> of the housing <b>11</b> of the casing <b>10</b>, to allow reusing the cap <b>21</b>. The tightness of this connection between the part <b>40</b> and the cap <b>21</b> can be ensured by an annular seal, for example an O-ring, such as for example the seal <b>18</b> already described above with reference to the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, or an identical or similar seal.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0067">In other words, and still assuming that the housing <b>11</b> of the casing is cylindrical, the second connecting means of the part <b>40</b> comprise, at the rear end of the part, an inner thread <b>49</b> identical to the inner thread <b>19</b> of the casing <b>10</b> at the level of the opening <b>14</b> of the housing <b>11</b> of the casing <b>10</b>. This allows reusing the same cap <b>21</b> as that provided for uses in which a standard filter cartridge is used, if necessary with the same seal <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0068">In one embodiment, the circumferential wall of the first section <b>41</b> comprises a first external annular groove (that is, open on the side of the wall opposite to the longitudinal axis X), extending circumferentially around the first section in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis which is adjacent to the front end of said first section, as well as a first annular seal <b>36</b> extending along said first annular groove. This seal <b>36</b>, for example an O-ring as shown, is able to provide sealing between the circumferential wall of the first section <b>41</b> of the part <b>40</b> and the circumferential wall <b>16</b> of the housing <b>11</b>, substantially at the bottom <b>15</b> of the housing, when the part <b>40</b> is mounted in the housing with the section <b>41</b> fully housed in the housing <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0069">In another embodiment, the circumferential wall of the first section <b>41</b> may also comprise a second outer annular groove (that is, open on the side of the wall which is opposite to the longitudinal axis X), extending circumferentially around the first section <b>41</b> in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal axis which is adjacent to the first connection zone (i.e., the connection zone with the thread <b>48</b>) of the part <b>40</b>, on the side of the rear end of the first section <b>41</b> of said part <b>40</b> with respect to said connection zone, as well as the annular seal <b>38</b> (already presented above) extending along said annular groove. Thus arranged, the seal <b>38</b>, for example an O-ring as shown, is able to provide sealing between the circumferential wall of the first section of the part and the circumferential wall of the housing <b>11</b>, substantially at the opening <b>14</b> of the housing, when the part <b>40</b> is mounted in the housing with section <b>41</b> fully housed in the housing <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0070">Referring to the simplified diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the flow of fluid in the collector is as follows when the larger cartridge <b>25</b> is used in combination with the extension part or adapter <b>40</b>. As shown by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the fluid is admitted into the housing <b>11</b> and enters the part <b>40</b> via the side openings <b>45</b>, <b>46</b> made in the front section <b>41</b>. It is prevented from passing directly into the discharge chamber <b>17</b>, due to the O-ring <b>36</b>. Under the effect of the pressure, it then passes through the circumferential envelope of the filter cartridge <b>25</b>, and this not only at the level of the front section <b>41</b> but also at the level of the rear section <b>42</b> of the part <b>40</b>. As a result, the exchange surface between the fluid and the envelope of the filter cartridge <b>25</b> is increased compared to the use of the standard filter cartridge <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. As a result, in particular, the pressure drop due to the filter can be reduced, and/or it can be compensated or limited even when the filter cartridge <b>25</b> comprises smaller pores than the pores of the standard cartridge <b>20</b> in order to provide better dust-holding capacity. The fluid then leaves the filter cartridge <b>25</b> at the front end of the part <b>40</b>, towards the bottom <b>15</b> of the housing <b>11</b> of the casing <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0071">In some embodiments, the part <b>40</b> can comprise active heating elements <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>, arranged for example in the walls of the second section <b>42</b>. These means <b>33</b> and <b>34</b>, visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, are adapted to heat the fluid in part <b>40</b> and/or in the housing <b>11</b> when the part <b>40</b> is mounted in the housing <b>11</b> of the casing <b>10</b>. This is particularly useful because, since the second section <b>42</b> of the part <b>40</b> projects outwards from the casing <b>10</b>, the risk of the Adblue&#xae; liquid additive freezing in winter is increased compared to the use of the standard filter cartridge <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). These elements <b>33</b> and <b>34</b> can be controlled by the same means as those which control the heating elements <b>31</b> and <b>32</b> of the casing <b>10</b>. For this purpose, connecting wires (not shown) can connect the part <b>40</b> to a connector (not shown) of the casing <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0072">In another embodiment, the rear section <b>42</b> of the part <b>40</b> can comprise portions <b>50</b> that can be deformed towards the outside of the part <b>40</b> (that is, away from the longitudinal axis X). Such portions <b>50</b> are suitable for, when the part <b>40</b> is mounted in the housing <b>11</b> of the casing <b>10</b>, compensating for any increase in the volume of fluid in the part <b>4</b> and/or in the housing <b>11</b> due to the freezing of said fluid. To this end, the portions <b>50</b> may have less thickness, and/or not have ribbed reinforcements unlike the other portions of the rear section <b>42</b> of the part <b>40</b>, visible for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, between the deformable portion <b>50</b> and the opening <b>44</b> at the rear end of the part <b>40</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0073">As has been understood, the extension part <b>40</b> makes it possible to use a filter cartridge <b>25</b> of larger axial dimensions than the standard filter cartridge <b>20</b>, while retaining the casing <b>10</b> with the housing <b>11</b>, the axial depth of which has been designed to receive a standard filter cartridge <b>20</b>.
