Software applications typically generate navigation data in response to receiving input from a user, and may recommend POIs to the user. However, POIs typically may be ranked according to popularity which may lead to a preference for national/global businesses over local businesses, due to their larger customer bases. Accordingly, local businesses may go unnoticed.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To promote local businesses and generate awareness about the local businesses in a particular geographic area, a local business display system receives location data and movement data for a user over a time period. For example, the local business display system may receive the location data from a positioning sensor such as a global positioning sensor (GPS), and the movement data from an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a compass, etc. The local business display system may also obtain locations of POIs within the geographic area and identify POIs visited by the user based on the location data, and the amount of time the user is in or around a particular location. For example, if the location data indicates that the user is within a threshold distance of a POI (e.g., within 100 m) for more than a threshold amount of time (e.g., five minutes), the local business display system may determine that the user visited the POI. Additionally, in response to determining that the user visited a POI, the local business display system may identify the route the user took from a starting location to the POI. The starting location may be determined as the last location from which the user stayed within a threshold range (e.g., 100 m) for more than a threshold amount of time (e.g., five minutes). Then the local business display system may determine the route the user took based on the location data and movement data from the starting location to the POI.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, for each POI, the local business display system may determine whether the POI is a local business or a national/global business, and may determine the type of business (e.g., restaurant, gas station, hotel, gym, concert hall, etc.) for the POI. Then the local business display system may determine the number of local businesses the user visited within a particular time period, the number of national/global businesses the user visited within the particular time period, the number of local businesses the user passed over and did not visit on her route to a national/global business, and the number of national/global businesses the user passed over and did not visit on her route to a local business. The local business display system may then generate a local business metric which may be a score based on how frequently the user visits local businesses and passes over national/global businesses in favor of the local businesses. The local business metric may also be based on how frequently the user visits local businesses relative to how frequently other users visit local businesses in the same geographic area. For example, users in a large city may visit local businesses less frequently than users in a small town. The local business display system may increase the score for each local business the user visits and for each national/global business the user passes over on her way to the local businesses. The local business display system may decrease the score for each national/global business the user visits and for each local business the user passes over on her way to the national/global businesses.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, the local business display system may provide rewards to the user based on her local business metric, such as discounts at the local businesses, or may present positive indicators on the user's client device, such as badges, high fives, etc. Additionally, the local business display system may generate a heat map that includes a digital map of the geographic area and depicts frequencies in which the user visited businesses within the geographic area. For example, the heat map may overlay colors over locations on the map, where warmer or darker colors indicate the locations that have been visited the most frequently. A heat map with warm colors overlaying the locations of several local businesses may indicate that the user is frequently visiting local businesses in the geographic area. Still further, the local business display system may generate a reverse heat map or cool map that includes the digital map of the geographic area and depicts frequencies in which the user passed over businesses on her way to other businesses. For example, the cool map may overlay colors over locations on the map, where colder or lighter colors indicate the locations have been passed over the most frequently. In this manner, the user may be provided with a graphic depiction of the businesses she frequents and the businesses she frequently passes over to see whether she has a preference for local businesses or national/global businesses. Accordingly, the local business display system encourages the user to visit the local businesses more frequently. The present embodiments advantageously provide a user interface that presents the user's location history in a manner that is easily understandable, and which highlights areas with local businesses that the user frequents and areas with local businesses that the user frequently passes over in favor of national/global businesses. The present embodiments improve the user experience by emphasizing local businesses which typically go unnoticed in alternative systems.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an embodiment, a method for identifying local businesses visited by a user is provided. The method includes receiving location data and movement data for a user over a time period, and analyzing the location and movement data to identify one or more points of interest (POIs) visited by the user during the time period. For each of the one or more POIs, the method includes determining whether the POI is a local business having less than a threshold number of retail locations or having each retail location within the same local area. For each local business visited by the user, the method includes identifying national/global businesses which the user did not visit along a route to the local business. The method further includes generating a local business metric for the user according to the one or more POIs visited by the user during the time period including the local businesses visited by the user and the national/global businesses which the user did not visit along the routes to the local businesses, generating a heat map including a digital map of a geographic area for the user during the time period and depicting frequencies in which the user visited the local businesses within the geographic area, and providing the heat map for display on a client device of the user.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, a computing device for identifying local businesses visited by a user is provided. The computing device includes one or more processors and a non-transitory computer-readable memory coupled to the one or more processors and storing instructions thereon. When executed by the one or more processors, the instructions cause the computing device to receive location data and movement data for a user over a time period, and analyze the location and movement data to identify one or more points of interest (POIs) visited by the user during the time period. For each of the one or more POIs, the instructions cause the computing device to determine whether the POI is a local business having less than a threshold number of retail locations or having each retail location within the same local area. For each local business visited by the user, the instructions cause the computing device to identify national/global businesses which the user did not visit along a route to the local business. The instructions further cause the computing device to generate a local business metric for the user according to the one or more POIs visited by the user during the time period including the local businesses visited by the user and the national/global businesses which the user did not visit along the routes to the local businesses, generate a heat map including a digital map of a geographic area for the user during the time period and depicting frequencies in which the user visited the local businesses within the geographic area, and provide the heat map for display on a client device of the user.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In yet another embodiments, non-transitory computer-readable memory coupled to one or more processors and storing instructions thereon is provided. When executed by the one or more processors, the instructions cause the one or more processors to receive location data and movement data for a user over a time period, and analyze the location and movement data to identify one or more points of interest (POIs) visited by the user during the time period.

The detailed description is to be construed as example only and does not describe every possible embodiment since describing every possible embodiment would be impractical. Numerous alternative embodiments could be implemented, using either current technology or technology developed after the filing date of this patent, which would still fall within the scope of the claims.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should also be understood that, unless a term is expressly defined in this patent using the sentence &#x201c;As used herein, the term &#x2018;______&#x2019; is hereby defined to mean . . . &#x201d; or a similar sentence, there is no intent to limit the meaning of that term, either expressly or by implication, beyond its plain or ordinary meaning, and such term should not be interpreted to be limited in scope based on any statement made in any section of this patent (other than the language of the claims). To the extent that any term recited in the claims at the end of this patent is referred to in this patent in a manner consistent with a single meaning, that is done for sake of clarity only so as to not confuse the reader, and it is not intended that such claim term be limited, by implication or otherwise, to that single meaning. Finally, the patent claims at the end of this patent application are not intended to be construed under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 112(f) unless traditional means-plus-function language is expressly recited, such as &#x201c;means for&#x201d; or &#x201c;step for&#x201d; language being explicitly recited in the claim(s). The systems and methods described herein are directed to an improvement to computer functionality, and improve the functioning of conventional computers.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Accordingly, as used herein, the term &#x201c;local business&#x201d; may be used to refer to a business having less than a threshold number of retail locations, or where each of the retail locations is within a threshold geographic range (e.g., the same city, the same state, within a 100 mile radius, etc.). The term &#x201c;national/global business,&#x201d; as used herein, may refer to any business which is not a local business.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Generally speaking, techniques for identifying local businesses visited by a user may be implemented in one or several client devices, one or several network servers or a system that includes a combination of these devices. However, for clarity, the examples below focus primarily on an embodiment in which a client device generates location data and movement data for a user via sensors at the client device, such as an accelerometer, global positioning system (GPS) module, inertial measurement unit (IMU), gyroscope, compass, etc. The client device then provides the location data and movement data to a local business server that analyzes the location data and movement data for the user over a time period (e.g., the previous week, month, year, etc.). The local business server analyzes the location data and movement data to identify POIs or business locations the user visited, routes the user traveled along from starting locations to POIs, and POIs or business locations that the user passed over and did not visit while travelling along the routes to other POIs. For each POI, the local business server may determine whether the POI is a local business or a national/global business. Then the local business server generates a local business metric based on the frequency in which the user visited local businesses, the frequency in which the user visited national/global businesses, the frequency in which the user passed over and did not visit local businesses along routes to national/global businesses, and/or the frequency in which the user passed over and did not visit national/global businesses along routes to local businesses.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition to the local business metric, the local business server may generate a heat map that includes a digital map of the geographic area and depicts frequencies in which the user visited businesses within the geographic area. For example, the heat map may overlay colors over locations on the map, where warmer or darker colors indicate the locations that have been visited the most frequently. A heat map with warm colors overlaying the locations of several local businesses may indicate that the user is frequently visiting local businesses in the geographic area. Still further, the local business display system may generate a reverse heat map or cool map that includes the digital map of the geographic area and depicts frequencies in which the user passed over businesses on her way to other businesses. For example, the cool map may overlay colors over locations on the map, where colder or lighter colors indicate the locations have been passed over the most frequently. The local business server may provide the local business metric, the heat map, and/or the cool map to the client device for display on the client device. The local business server may also provide rewards to the user based on the local business metric, such as discounts at the local businesses, or positive indicators for display on the user's client device, such as badges, high fives, etc.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an example local business display system <b>100</b> includes a local business server <b>102</b> and a plurality of client computing devices <b>106</b>-<b>116</b> which may be communicatively connected through a network <b>130</b>, as described below.

For example, the local business server <b>102</b> may obtain map data from a map database and compare the GPS coordinates to the GPS coordinates of street addresses and POIs in the map database. In another example, the local business server <b>102</b> may invoke a mapping application programming interface (API) to retrieve a street address or POI corresponding to a set of GPS coordinates. The local business server <b>102</b> may also identify a date and time <b>310</b> when the user visited the location based on the date and time when the GPS coordinates were received.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the client computing device <b>106</b>-<b>116</b> may provide location data and movement data including GPS coordinates to the local business server <b>102</b> periodically (e.g., every second, every ten seconds, every 30 seconds, every minute, etc.). The local business server <b>102</b> may determine the duration <b>312</b> in which the user visited the location based on the amount of time in which the user was at the same location or within a threshold distance of the same location. For example, the data table <b>300</b> indicates that John Doe was at 66 E Lafayette Street, Bloomington, Ill. for one hour. During that time frame, the local business server <b>102</b> may receive location data from John Doe's client computing device indicating that John was anywhere between 40 E Lafayette Street and 70 E Lafayette Street. Accordingly, the local business server <b>102</b> may determine that John was at 66 E Lafayette Street during the entire time frame.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In addition to receiving location and movement data from the user's client computing device <b>106</b>-<b>116</b>, the local business server <b>102</b> may also obtain additional information to corroborate that the user went to a particular location. This additional information may include an online check-in at the particular location, a review of the particular location, a social media post involving the particular location, a financial statement indicating a purchase at the particular location, etc. To obtain this information, the user may share social media data and/or financial data with the local business server <b>102</b>, and the local business server <b>102</b> may subscribe to a feed for the user, such as a Rich Site Summary (RSS) feed or invoke an API. For example, if the user shares social media data, online check-ins, and/or reviews, the local business server <b>102</b> may obtain Facebook&#xae; posts and check-ins, Instagram&#xae; posts, Twitter&#xae; tweets, Yelp&#xae; reviews, etc., made by the user. If the user shares financial data, the local business server <b>102</b> may obtain portions of credit card statements or bank statements indicating the locations, dates, and/or times of purchases made by the user. In other implementations, the user may send pictures of receipts or other financial statements to the local business server <b>102</b> via the client application <b>266</b>. The local business server <b>102</b> may then analyze the user's online check-ins, reviews, social media posts, and/or financial statements and their corresponding dates and times to verify that the user visited the location detected by the client computing device <b>106</b>-<b>116</b> sensors. If the user visited a different location than the location determined from the sensor data, the local business server <b>102</b> may remove the detected location from the database <b>124</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In any event, the local business server <b>102</b> may analyze the location data from the data table <b>300</b> to identify POIs the user visited, routes the user travelled along to reach the POIs, and POIs the user passed over and did not visit on her way to the visited POI. The local business server <b>102</b> may determine that the user visited a POI when the user is at the POI for more than a threshold duration (e.g., two minutes, five minutes, 10 minutes, etc.). Additionally, the local business server <b>102</b> may identify a route the user travelled along to reach a POI (the destination location) by determining that a starting location is the previous location in which the user stayed for more than a threshold duration. The local business server <b>102</b> may then construct the route by using locations in between the starting location and the destination location which the user passed for less than a threshold duration as waypoints along the route.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The local business server <b>102</b> may also obtain navigation data from a navigation database or may invoke a navigation API to retrieve the navigation data. For example, according to the data table <b>300</b> John Doe was at Tony's Diner for 10 minutes at 1:30 p.m. on Jun. 21, 2019. On the same day, John Doe was at 66 E Lafayette Street, Bloomington, Ill. for one hour from 12:00 p.m. until 1:00 p.m. prior to arriving at Tony's Diner. Accordingly, the local business server <b>102</b> may determine that 66 E Lafayette Street, Bloomington, Ill. was the starting location for traveling to Tony's Diner. At 1:10 p.m., John Doe was at Route <b>66</b> and Main Street, Bloomington, Ill. for 30 seconds. John may have stopped at that location for 30 seconds, such as due to a traffic light or the local business server <b>102</b> may periodically receive location data every 30 seconds indicating that John Doe was at this location for no more than 30 seconds. In any event, the local business server <b>102</b> may construct a route from 66 E Lafayette Street, Bloomington, Ill. to Tony's Diner with Route <b>66</b> and Main Street, Bloomington, Ill. being a waypoint on the route. In some embodiments, the local business server <b>102</b> may invoke the navigation API and provide the starting location, the destination location, and the waypoints as parameters. The local business server <b>102</b> may then receive a route from a navigation server via the navigation API that includes the starting location, the destination location, and the waypoints.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">An example of this route is illustrated in the map representation <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The local business server <b>102</b> may identify POIs the user passed over and did not visit on his way to Tony's Diner according to the POIs within a threshold distance of the route (e.g., within one mile, two miles, five miles, ten miles, etc.) and the amount of time in which the user was within the threshold distance of each POI. If the user was within the threshold distance of the POI for less than a threshold amount of time (e.g., five minutes), the local business server <b>102</b> may determine that the user did not visit the POI. In some embodiments, the local business server <b>102</b> may determine the type of business for the destination POI and may identify POIs the user passed over which are the same type of business as the destination POI. For example, Tony's Diner may be a restaurant, and the local business server <b>102</b> may identify other restaurants the user passed over on his way to Tony's Diner.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The local business server <b>102</b> may store indications of the POIs visited by the user and the POIs the user passed over and did not visit on the way to the visited POIs, for example in the database <b>124</b>.

If the business corresponding to the POI (e.g., Dairy Queen&#xae;) has less than a threshold number of retail locations (e.g., three, five, seven, etc.), or each of the locations for the business corresponding to the POI are within a threshold geographic range (e.g., the same city, the same state, within a 100 mile radius, etc.) the local business server <b>102</b> may determine that the POI is a local business. Otherwise, the local business server <b>102</b> may determine that the POI is a national/global business. In some embodiments, the local business server <b>102</b> determines whether a POI is a local business based on any suitable combination of the number of retail locations and/or the geographic range of the retail locations.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The local business server <b>102</b> may also determine the size of the POI based on any suitable combination of the number of employees for the business corresponding to the POI, an amount of revenue for the business corresponding to the POI, content included in reviews of the POI, etc. This information may act as a proxy for determining the number of retail locations and/or geographic range of the POI. For example, the local business server <b>102</b> may use the number of employees, amount of revenue, content included in reviews of the POI, etc., to verify that the POI corresponds to a local business and has less than a threshold number of locations or the locations are within a threshold geographic range. The local business server <b>102</b> may obtain an indication of the number of retail locations for the business corresponding to the POI and/or the geographic range of the retail locations from the map database or by invoking the mapping API to retrieve indications of each retail location for the business corresponding to the POI.

Additionally, the local business server <b>102</b> may determine the type of business for the POI from the map database, by invoking the mapping API, or from various online sources. In some embodiments, the local business server <b>102</b> may store indications of sizes of POIs and the type of businesses for the POIs in a separate business database, and may obtain the size of a POI and/or the type of business for a POI from the business database.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">For example, as shown in the data table <b>500</b>, John Doe visited Tony's Diner at 1:30 p.m. on Jun. 21, 2019, which is a local restaurant. On the way to Tony's Diner, John Doe passed over and did not visit Subway&#xae; and Dairy Queen&#xae; which are both national restaurants. John Doe also passed over and did not visit Main Street Convenience Store which is a local grocery store. The local business server <b>102</b> may analyze the indications of the POIs visited by or passed over by a user at various points in time to determine a frequency in which the user visits local businesses, a frequency in which the user visits national businesses, a frequency in which the user passes over local businesses in favor of national/global businesses, and a frequency in which the user passes over national/global businesses in favor of local businesses. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates another example data table <b>600</b> including local business metrics for users.

Also in some embodiments, the number of times a user passes over and does not visit a national business within a particular time interval may only include national businesses which were passed over and are the same type of business as the visited business.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In any event, the local business server <b>102</b> may generate a local business score for the user based on any suitable combination of the local business frequency, the national business frequency, the local business passing frequency, and/or the national business passing frequency. In some embodiments, the local business server <b>102</b> may increase the local business score according to the local business frequency and the national business passing frequency, and may decrease the score according to the national business frequency and the local business passing frequency. The local business score may also be a weighted combination of the local business frequency, the national business frequency, the local business passing frequency, and/or the national business passing frequency. The local business server <b>102</b> may also adjust the local business score based on the amount in which a user changes her habits from one time interval to the next. For example, a user who significantly increases her local business frequency and national business passing frequency from one week or month to the next may receive a higher increase in her local business score than a user who starts off with a high local business frequency and national business passing frequency but maintains similar frequencies in the subsequent time interval.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">Still further, the local business server <b>102</b> may adjust the local business score according to the geographic area for the user. For example, some users may be located in densely populated areas with more opportunities to visit national businesses, such as cities. Other users may be located in sparsely populated areas with less opportunities to visit national businesses and a higher concentration of local businesses, such as small towns. Accordingly, the local business server <b>102</b> may adjust the local business score to account for the number of local businesses and national businesses in the user's geographic area or the ratio of local business to national businesses in the user's geographic area. For example, the local business server <b>102</b> may generate the local business score based on the difference between the local business frequency for the user and local business frequencies for other users in the same geographic area. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, Mary Jones visits over twice as many local businesses per week as John Doe and passes over twice as many national businesses as John Doe. However, she also visits more than twice as many national businesses as John Doe and passes over twice as many local businesses as John Doe. Accordingly, her local business score is similar to John Doe's.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">Moreover, the local business server <b>102</b> may adjust the local business score according to other user characteristics included in the user's profile. For example, the local business server <b>102</b> may adjust the local business score according to demographic data such as the age group in which the user belongs. The local business server <b>102</b> may analyze the local business metrics including the local business frequency, the national business frequency, the local business passing frequency, and the national business passing frequency for users in different age groups (e.g., ages 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, etc.), and may adjust the local business score for the user according to the user's age group.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">The local business server <b>102</b> may then provide rewards to the user based on the local business score, based on the change in the local business score from one time interval to another, or based on any of the other local business metrics (e.g., the local business frequency, the national business frequency, the local business passing frequency, the national business passing frequency, etc.). The rewards may be positive or encouraging indicators which may be presented on the user's client device, such as badges, high fives, etc. The rewards may also be discounts at the local businesses, such as 50% off any purchase, a free drink, etc. In some embodiments, the user may earn positive or encouraging indicators for reaching threshold local business scores which may be exchanged for discounts at the local businesses. For example, a user may exchange 200 points from her local business score for a badge, and may exchange 1000 points from her local business score for a high five. The user may then exchanges badges and high fives for various discounts at the local businesses.

Although individual operations of one or more methods are illustrated and described as separate operations, one or more of the individual operations may be performed concurrently, and nothing requires that the operations be performed in the order illustrated. Structures and functionality presented as separate components in example configurations may be implemented as a combined structure or component. Similarly, structures and functionality presented as a single component may be implemented as separate components. These and other variations, modifications, additions, and improvements fall within the scope of the subject matter herein.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">Additionally, certain embodiments are described herein as including logic or a number of routines, subroutines, applications, or instructions. These may constitute either software (e.g., code embodied on a machine-readable medium or in a transmission signal) or hardware. In hardware, the routines, etc., are tangible units capable of performing certain operations and may be configured or arranged in a certain manner. In example embodiments, one or more computer systems (e.g., a standalone, client or server computer system) or one or more hardware modules of a computer system (e.g., a processor or a group of processors) may be configured by software (e.g., an application or application portion) as a hardware module that operates to perform certain operations as described herein.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In various embodiments, a hardware module may be implemented mechanically or electronically. For example, a hardware module may comprise dedicated circuitry or logic that is permanently configured (e.g., as a special-purpose processor, such as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)) to perform certain operations. A hardware module may also comprise programmable logic or circuitry (e.g., as encompassed within a general-purpose processor or other programmable processor) that is temporarily configured by software to perform certain operations. It will be appreciated that the decision to implement a hardware module mechanically, in dedicated and permanently configured circuitry, or in temporarily configured circuitry (e.g., configured by software) may be driven by cost and time considerations.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">Accordingly, the term &#x201c;hardware module&#x201d; should be understood to encompass a tangible entity, be that an entity that is physically constructed, permanently configured (e.g., hardwired), or temporarily configured (e.g., programmed) to operate in a certain manner or to perform certain operations described herein. Considering embodiments in which hardware modules are temporarily configured (e.g., programmed), each of the hardware modules need not be configured or instantiated at any one instance in time. For example, where the hardware modules comprise a general-purpose processor configured using software, the general-purpose processor may be configured as respective different hardware modules at different times. Software may accordingly configure a processor, for example, to constitute a particular hardware module at one instance of time and to constitute a different hardware module at a different instance of time.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093">Hardware modules can provide information to, and receive information from, other hardware modules. Accordingly, the described hardware modules may be regarded as being communicatively coupled. Where multiple of such hardware modules exist contemporaneously, communications may be achieved through signal transmission (e.g., over appropriate circuits and buses) that connect the hardware modules. In embodiments in which multiple hardware modules are configured or instantiated at different times, communications between such hardware modules may be achieved, for example, through the storage and retrieval of information in memory structures to which the multiple hardware modules have access. For example, one hardware module may perform an operation and store the output of that operation in a memory device to which it is communicatively coupled. A further hardware module may then, at a later time, access the memory device to retrieve and process the stored output. Hardware modules may also initiate communications with input or output devices, and can operate on a resource (e.g., a collection of information).</p><p id="p-0095" num="0094">The various operations of example methods described herein may be performed, at least partially, by one or more processors that are temporarily configured (e.g., by software) or permanently configured to perform the relevant operations. Whether temporarily or permanently configured, such processors may constitute processor-implemented modules that operate to perform one or more operations or functions. The modules referred to herein may, in some example embodiments, comprise processor-implemented modules.</p><p id="p-0096" num="0095">Similarly, the methods or routines described herein may be at least partially processor-implemented. For example, at least some of the operations of a method may be performed by one or more processors or processor-implemented hardware modules. The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the processor or processors may be located in a single location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment or as a server farm), while in other embodiments the processors may be distributed across a number of locations.</p><p id="p-0097" num="0096">The performance of certain of the operations may be distributed among the one or more processors, not only residing within a single machine, but deployed across a number of machines. In some example embodiments, the one or more processors or processor-implemented modules may be located in a single geographic location (e.g., within a home environment, an office environment, or a server farm). In other example embodiments, the one or more processors or processor-implemented modules may be distributed across a number of geographic locations.</p><p id="p-0098" num="0097">Unless specifically stated otherwise, discussions herein using words such as &#x201c;processing,&#x201d; &#x201c;computing,&#x201d; &#x201c;calculating,&#x201d; &#x201c;determining,&#x201d; &#x201c;presenting,&#x201d; &#x201c;displaying,&#x201d; or the like may refer to actions or processes of a machine (e.g., a computer) that manipulates or transforms data represented as physical (e.g., electronic, magnetic, or optical) quantities within one or more memories (e.g., volatile memory, non-volatile memory, or a combination thereof), registers, or other machine components that receive, store, transmit, or display information.</p><p id="p-0099" num="0098">As used herein any reference to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; means that a particular element, feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment.
