The invention further relates to a vertical cavity surface emitting laser having an optical aperture.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) are a type of semiconductor laser diodes with laser beam emission perpendicular to the top or bottom surface of the device. Typically, a VCSEL comprises two DBRs (DBR=distributed Bragg reflector) parallel to the wafer surface, and an active region comprising one or more quantum wells for the laser light generation arranged between the two DBRs. The DBRs comprise layers with alternating high and low refractive indices. In common VCSELs, the DBRs are doped as p-type and n-type materials, forming a diode junction. In order to enable low threshold currents, a VCSEL typically has one or more optical apertures configured to restrict the current in the VCSEL to a confined region. One technique to form the optical aperture uses oxidizing the semiconductor material in one or more layers of the VCSEL layer stack to a desired oxidation depth. The layer(s) to be oxidized typically is/are high-content aluminum layer(s) of the layer stack. The current path between the DBRs is restricted to the central non-oxidized region of the oxidized layer(s), as the oxidized outer region is non-conductive. Laser light formation is substantially restricted to the central region of the oxidized layer(s). The central region thus forms the optical aperture.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">During the VCSEL fabrication process, mechanical stress related damage of the VCSEL is a serious issue, as it decreases operational reliability and life-time of the VCSEL. The highest amount of mechanical stress (up to 100 MPa) is generated closely to the most sensitive area of the device, namely the optical active quantum well region. If the optical aperture is formed by oxidation of e.g. a specific AlGaAs layer, transformation of the crystallographic structure into Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>creates strong lattice mismatch and therefore mechanical stress between the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>and the surrounding AlGaAs layers.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO 2010/058805 A1 discloses a method for manufacturing a surface-emitting laser device. The method includes forming a laminated body in which a lower reflecting mirror, a resonator structure including an active layer, and an upper reflecting layer having a selective oxidized layer are laminated on a substrate. The laminated body is etched to form a mesa structure having the selective oxidized layer exposed at side surfaces thereof. The selective oxidized layer is selectively oxidized from the side surfaces of the mesa structure to form a constriction structure in which a current passing region is surrounded by an oxide. A separating groove is formed at a position away from the mesa structure. An outermost front surface of at least a part of the laminated body exposed is passivated when the separating groove is formed. The passivated part is coated with a dielectric body.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">JP 2004 158664 A discloses a semiconductor laser device provided with a current confinement structure. A further surface-emitting laser comprising an oxidized layer for current confinement is known from JP 2009 238832 A.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 5,359,618 A discloses a vertical cavity surface emitting laser with first and second mirror stacks and an active area sandwiched therebetween. The second mirror stack is formed into a mesa with exposed end surface and outer side walls and a centrally located light emission region. The portion of the mesa adjacent the exposed outer sidewalls has a reduced electrical conductance so as to spread operating current from the outer side walls into the centrally located light emission region. The electrical conductance of the portion is reduced by oxidizing or etching the outer sidewalls.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">US 2006/013276 A1 discloses a vertical cavity surface emitting laser including a gap in a mirror stack and a protective layer sealing an end of the gap. The gap defines a boundary of the aperture of the VCSEL without introducing the stresses that oxide regions and oxide VCSELs can cause, and a protective layer, which can be a thin dielectric layer, shields the mirror stack from environmental damage. The VCSEL can thus achieve high reliability. A fabrication process for the VCSEL forms an oxidation hole, oxidizes a portion of an aluminum-rich layer in a mirror stack of the VCSEL exposed in the hole, and then removes all or some of the resulting oxide to form the desired gap. The protective layer can then be deposited to seal an end of the gap.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, there is a need in an improved method of forming an optical aperture of a VCSEL.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment, the present disclosure provides a method of forming an optical aperture of a vertical cavity surface emitting laser that includes providing a layer stack of semiconductor layers, the semiconductor layers including an intermediate layer comprising a semiconductor material suitable to be oxidized and oxidizing the intermediate layer to an oxidation width so as to form an oxidized outer region and a non-oxidized central region in the intermediate layer.

The size of the optical aperture can be controlled by the oxidation width, which in turn may be controlled by the duration of the oxidation process and/or parameters of the oxidation atmosphere like pressure and temperature and constituents of the oxidation atmosphere. The oxidation rate further depends on the semiconductor material which is oxidized. Differently from the conventional methods of forming an optical aperture, the oxidized material is removed from at least a part of the oxidized outer region of the intermediate layer. It is also possible to remove the oxidized material completely from the oxidized outer region. By removing the oxidized material from at least a part of the oxidized outer region, a gap forms in the intermediate layer between layers of the layer stack which are adjacent to the intermediate layer. Mechanical stress implemented by the oxidization process due to strong lattice mismatch between the oxidized semiconductor material and the surrounding non-oxidized semiconductor material is thus relaxed. If the oxidized material is completely removed from the oxidized outer region of the intermediate layer, mechanical stress relaxation is achieved up to the tip of the oxidized outer region at the transition to the non-oxidized central region.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0039">The gap formed after removing the oxidized material is at least partially filled with an electrically non-conducting material which is of much higher quality than the removed oxidized semiconductor material and does not lead to mechanical stress in the layer stack. The electrically non-conducting material is deposited in the gap on the gap walls. While the oxidation product obtained by oxidizing the semiconductor material of the intermediate layer, for example Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>obtained from the oxidation of AlAs or AlGaAs has poor mechanical and electrical quality, the electrically non-conducting material deposited in the gap after removal of the oxidized semiconductor material may have a very good mechanical and electrical quality. In particular, the deposited electrically non-conducting material may passivate open or dangling bonds, which may be generated in the oxidation process, at the interfaces (gap walls) between the gap and the surrounding semiconductor layers without the implementation of stress. The electrically isolating behavior of the deposited material furthermore enables the current confinement.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0040">Refinements of the method according to invention will be described hereinafter</p><p id="p-0039" num="0041">In an embodiment, providing the layer stack may include:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0042">epitaxially growing the layer stack,</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0043">etching the layer stack to form a pre-form of a mesa of the VCSEL and a support structure at least partially surrounding the pre-form of the mesa, the support structure comprising an outer supporting region and at least one supporting web connecting the outer supporting region with the pre-form of the mesa, wherein the pre-form of the mesa includes the intermediate layer.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0040" num="0044">This processing serves, on the one hand, the formation of an oxidation area for the later oxidation process. The oxidation area is formed by the outer wall of the pre-form of the mesa.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0045">On the other hand, the mechanical support structure advantageously enables mechanical stability during and after the removal of the oxidized material from the intermediate layer, before the gap is re-filled. The size and thus strength of the mechanical support structure will depend on the desired final VCSEL mesa size and the oxidation width. For larger oxidation widths, stronger support structures with multiple connecting supporting webs are advantageous.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0046">In this embodiment, it may be advantageous if the deposition of the electrically non-conductive material also covers the side wall of the pre-form of the mesa as it further stabilizes the pre-form of the mesa, and may fill further gaps which may be present after removal of oxidized material from further layers of the layer stack. In other words, the deposited electrically non-conductive material is somewhat &#x201c;anchored&#x201d; into these layers.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0047">In an embodiment, etching the layer stack is performed such that the pre-form of the mesa has a tapering outer wall. The outer wall may taper from bottom to top (i.e. in direction of the epitaxial growth of the layer stack) of the pre-form of the mesa. The tapering shape of the pre-form of the mesa has the advantage that mechanical stability of the pre-form of the mesa is further increased. The side wall angle of the oxidation area (the outer wall of the pre-form of the mesa) with respect to the plane orientation of the layers of the layer stack may be chosen between 65&#xb0; and 70&#xb0;. In this angle range, a good mechanical stability is achieved, when the oxidized material is removed from the layer is achieved.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0048">In an embodiment, the method may further comprise, after depositing the electrically non-conducting material in the gap, trim etching the pre-form of the mesa to obtain a final mesa having a straight (non-tapering) outer wall.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0049">In combination with the embodiment described before, the mesa definition process may be splitted into two separate process steps, namely a first step of formation of the oxidation area by etching the layer stack to provide the mesa pre-form, and after oxidation, removal of the oxidized material and filling the non-conductive material in the gap, the pre-form of the mesa is further processed to obtain the final mesa which then may have an outer wall perpendicular to the plane orientation of the layers of the stack. The trim etch may also remove residual material which may have been deposited on the side wall of the pre-form of the mesa when re-filling the gap after removal of the oxidized material.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0050">In a further embodiment, the intermediate layer may have a thickness which is significantly larger than thicknesses of semiconductor layers adjacent to or in vicinity of the intermediate layer.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0051">The advantage here is that the thicker intermediate layer is oxidized more rapidly than the thinner surrounding semiconductor layers. A further advantage is that the oxidized material generated when oxidizing the intermediate layer has a higher porosity and is thus easier to remove. In a conventional VCSEL, a thicker oxidized layer would lead to an optical aperture with less current confinement ability due to a lower electrical breakdown field and reduced refractive index in the oxidized region of the layer. Since the oxidized material is removed in the method according to the present invention, such a disadvantage will not occur in the method according to the present invention, as the oxidized material is replaced by a high quality electrically non-conducting material after removal of the oxidized material.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0052">The thickness of the intermediate layer, which may be defined in the epitaxial process, may be in a range from about 80 nm to about 100 nm, while the surrounding semiconductor layers may have a thickness in a range from about 20 nm to about 30 nm.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0053">In an embodiment, the semiconductor material of the intermediate layer may be an Al-based semiconductor material, in particular AlAs or AlGaAs.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0054">In a further embodiment, removing the oxidized intermediate layer may be performed by etching using a hydrofluoric acid dip or a fluorine gas phase based etching process.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0055">A fluorine gas phase based etching process, also referred to as atomic layer etching, with exact control of the pressure is preferred. A high etching rate may be achieved in this way. A plasma or the like is less preferred as a plasma may damage susceptible layers. A further advantage of the fluorine gas phase etching process is the high selectivity for the oxidized material versus the semiconductor material.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0056">In a further embodiment, depositing the electrically non-conducting material comprises depositing the electrically non-conducting material using atomic layer deposition.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0057">Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a deposition technology which is suitable to fill thin gaps with an aspect ratio of up to 1000:1 in a reliable manner.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0058">The electrically non-conducting material is deposited on the gap walls with a thickness which is smaller than the thickness of the gap, wherein the electrically non-conducting material may be deposited on the gap walls with a thickness in a range from about 2 nm to about 5 nm.

The layer stack may comprise, on a substrate <b>12</b>, a first distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) <b>14</b>, an active region <b>16</b> for laser light emission, and a second DBR <b>18</b>. The active region <b>16</b> is arranged between the first and second DBRs <b>14</b>, <b>18</b>. The first DBR <b>14</b>, the active regions <b>16</b> and the second DBR <b>16</b> form an optical resonator. The first DBR <b>14</b> may comprise n-doped AlGaAs/GaAs layer pairs, for example. The active region <b>16</b> may comprise one or more quantum wells for laser emission. The second DBR <b>18</b> may comprise p-doped AlGaAs/GaAs layer pairs.

The optical aperture <b>24</b> is formed in an intermediate layer <b>26</b> of the layer stack of the VCSEL <b>10</b>. In conventional VCSELs, the optical aperture <b>24</b> is formed by oxidizing the intermediate layer <b>26</b> which may comprise an Al-based semiconductor material with a high Al content.

The lattice mismatch generates mechanical stress in the surrounding semiconductor layers, leading to reduced life-time and reduced operational reliability of the VCSEL.
