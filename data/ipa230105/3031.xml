More particularly, certain embodiments of the invention relate to a cladding system for efficiently mounting paneling to walls.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following background information may present examples of specific aspects of the prior art (e.g., without limitation, approaches, facts, or common wisdom) that, while expected to be helpful to further educate the reader as to additional aspects of the prior art, is not to be construed as limiting the present invention, or any embodiments thereof, to anything stated or implied therein or inferred thereupon.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Cladding may be used to protect the exterior surface of a structure as well as improve the structure's overall appearance. Especially in areas with more severe weather conditions, cladding may be used to waterproof structures, creating a protective layer that may repel water and guard against damage that may be caused by a variety of other environmental factors. Cladding may be used to finish the exterior of a new building or renew the exterior of existing buildings.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The following is an example of a specific aspect in the prior art that, while expected to be helpful to further educate the reader as to additional aspects of the prior art, is not to be construed as limiting the present invention, or any embodiments thereof, to anything stated or implied therein or inferred thereupon. By way of educational background, another aspect of the prior art generally useful to be aware of is that various conventional cladding techniques may be used in protecting the exterior walls of a building. For example, without limitation, timber shakes and shingles may be used to cover buildings, creating a non-structural layer of wood to safeguard the building against the elements. Such conventional cladding techniques, however, may be difficult to install and ensure proper alignment of cladding material. Additionally, while many conventional cladding techniques may provide a layer of protection against water, they may not be completely watertight.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In view of the foregoing, it is clear that these traditional techniques are not perfect and leave room for more optimal approaches.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is illustrated by way of example, and not by way of limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings and in which like reference numerals refer to similar elements and in which:</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref> illustrate an exemplary cladding system, wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows a panel guide, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows a panel guide integrated with weather strips, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> shows a panel guide integrated with a U cover, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref> illustrate installation of an exemplary cladding system, wherein <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows installation of a panel guide, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> shows placement of panels on a panel guide, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> shows installation of a U cover, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> shows installation of a screw cover, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention; and</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref> illustrate exemplary installed panels, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Unless otherwise indicated illustrations in the figures are not necessarily drawn to scale.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention is best understood by reference to the detailed figures and description set forth herein.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">Embodiments of the invention are discussed below with reference to the Figures. However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed description given herein with respect to these figures is for explanatory purposes as the invention extends beyond these limited embodiments. For example, it should be appreciated that those skilled in the art will, in light of the teachings of the present invention, recognize a multiplicity of alternate and suitable approaches, depending upon the needs of the particular application, to implement the functionality of any given detail described herein, beyond the particular implementation choices in the following embodiments described and shown. That is, there are modifications and variations of the invention that are too numerous to be listed but that all fit within the scope of the invention. Also, singular words should be read as plural and vice versa and masculine as feminine and vice versa, where appropriate, and alternative embodiments do not necessarily imply that the two are mutually exclusive.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is to be further understood that the present invention is not limited to the particular methodology, compounds, materials, manufacturing techniques, uses, and applications, described herein, as these may vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is used for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. It must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include the plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, a reference to &#x201c;an element&#x201d; is a reference to one or more elements and includes equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art. Similarly, for another example, a reference to &#x201c;a step&#x201d; or &#x201c;a means&#x201d; is a reference to one or more steps or means and may include sub-steps and subservient means. All conjunctions used are to be understood in the most inclusive sense possible. Thus, the word &#x201c;or&#x201d; should be understood as having the definition of a logical &#x201c;or&#x201d; rather than that of a logical &#x201c;exclusive or&#x201d; unless the context clearly necessitates otherwise. Structures described herein are to be understood also to refer to functional equivalents of such structures. Language that may be construed to express approximation should be so understood unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">All words of approximation as used in the present disclosure and claims should be construed to mean &#x201c;approximate,&#x201d; rather than &#x201c;perfect,&#x201d; and may accordingly be employed as a meaningful modifier to any other word, specified parameter, quantity, quality, or concept. Words of approximation, include, yet are not limited to terms such as &#x201c;substantial&#x201d;, &#x201c;nearly&#x201d;, &#x201c;almost&#x201d;, &#x201c;about&#x201d;, &#x201c;generally&#x201d;, &#x201c;largely&#x201d;, &#x201c;essentially&#x201d;, &#x201c;closely approximate&#x201d;, etc.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">As will be established in some detail below, it is well settled law, as early as 1939, that words of approximation are not indefinite in the claims even when such limits are not defined or specified in the specification.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, see <i>Ex parte Mallory, </i>52 USPQ 297, 297 (Pat. Off. Bd. App. 1941) where the court said &#x201c;The examiner has held that most of the claims are inaccurate because apparently the laminar film will not be entirely eliminated. The claims specify that the film is &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; eliminated and for the intended purpose, it is believed that the slight portion of the film which may remain is negligible. We are of the view, therefore, that the claims may be regarded as sufficiently accurate.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Note that claims need only &#x201c;reasonably apprise those skilled in the art&#x201d; as to their scope to satisfy the definiteness requirement. See <i>Energy Absorption Sys., Inc. </i>v. <i>Roadway Safety Servs., Inc., </i>Civ. App. 96-1264, slip op. at 10 (Fed. Cir. Jul. 3, 1997) (unpublished) <i>Hybridtech </i>v. <i>Monoclonal Antibodies, Inc., </i>802 F.2d 1367, 1385, 231 USPQ 81, 94 (Fed. Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 947 (1987). In addition, the use of modifiers in the claim, like &#x201c;generally&#x201d; and &#x201c;substantial,&#x201d; does not by itself render the claims indefinite. See <i>Seattle Box Co. </i>v. <i>Industrial Crating </i>&#x26; <i>Packing, Inc., </i>731 F.2d 818, 828-29, 221 USPQ 568, 575-76 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Moreover, the ordinary and customary meaning of terms like &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; includes &#x201c;reasonably close to: nearly, almost, about&#x201d;, connoting a term of approximation. See In re <i>Frye, </i>Appeal No. 2009-006013, 94 USPQ2d 1072, 1077, 2010 WL 889747 (B.P.A.I. 2010) Depending on its usage, the word &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; can denote either language of approximation or language of magnitude. <i>Deering Precision Instruments, L.L.C. </i>v. <i>Vector Distribution Sys., Inc., </i>347 F.3d 1314, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (recognizing the &#x201c;dual ordinary meaning of th[e] term [&#x201d;substantially&#x201c;] as connoting a term of approximation or a term of magnitude&#x201d;). Here, when referring to the &#x201c;substantially halfway&#x201d; limitation, the Specification uses the word &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; as a substitute for the word &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; (Fact 4). (Fact 4). The ordinary meaning of &#x201c;substantially halfway&#x201d; is thus reasonably close to or nearly at the midpoint between the forwardmost point of the upper or outsole and the rearwardmost point of the upper or outsole.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Similarly, the term &#x2018;substantially&#x2019; is well recognized in case law to have the dual ordinary meaning of connoting a term of approximation or a term of magnitude. See <i>Dana Corp. </i>v. <i>American Axle </i>&#x26; <i>Manufacturing, Inc., </i>Civ. App. 04-1116, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 18265, *13-14 (Fed. Cir. Aug. 27, 2004) (unpublished). The term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; is commonly used by claim drafters to indicate approximation. See <i>Cordis Corp. </i>v. <i>Medtronic AVE Inc., </i>339 F.3d 1352, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (&#x201c;The patents do not set out any numerical standard by which to determine whether the thickness of the wall surface is &#x2018;substantially uniform.&#x2019; The term &#x2018;substantially,&#x2019; as used in this context, denotes approximation. Thus, the walls must be of largely or approximately uniform thickness.&#x201d;); see also <i>Deering Precision Instruments, LLC </i>v. <i>Vector Distribution Sys., Inc., </i>347 F.3d 1314, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <i>Epcon Gas Sys., Inc. </i>v. <i>Bauer Compressors, Inc., </i>279 F.3d 1022, 1031 (Fed. Cir. 2002). We find that the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; was used in just such a manner in the claims of the patents-in-suit: &#x201c;substantially uniform wall thickness&#x201d; denotes a wall thickness with approximate uniformity.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should also be noted that such words of approximation as contemplated in the foregoing clearly limits the scope of claims such as saying &#x2018;generally parallel&#x2019; such that the adverb &#x2018;generally&#x2019; does not broaden the meaning of parallel. Accordingly, it is well settled that such words of approximation as contemplated in the foregoing (e.g., like the phrase &#x2018;generally parallel&#x2019;) envisions some amount of deviation from perfection (e.g., not exactly parallel), and that such words of approximation as contemplated in the foregoing are descriptive terms commonly used in patent claims to avoid a strict numerical boundary to the specified parameter. To the extent that the plain language of the claims relying on such words of approximation as contemplated in the foregoing are clear and uncontradicted by anything in the written description herein or the figures thereof, it is improper to rely upon the present written description, the figures, or the prosecution history to add limitations to any of the claim of the present invention with respect to such words of approximation as contemplated in the foregoing. That is, under such circumstances, relying on the written description and prosecution history to reject the ordinary and customary meanings of the words themselves is impermissible. See, for example, <i>Liquid Dynamics Corp. </i>v. <i>Vaughan Co., </i>355 F.3d 1361, 69 USPQ2d 1595, 1600-01 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The plain language of phrase 2 requires a &#x201c;substantial helical flow.&#x201d; The term &#x201c;substantial&#x201d; is a meaningful modifier implying &#x201c;approximate,&#x201d; rather than &#x201c;perfect.&#x201d; In <i>Cordis Corp. </i>v. <i>Medtronic AVE, Inc., </i>339 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2003), the district court imposed a precise numeric constraint on the term &#x201c;substantially uniform thickness.&#x201d; We noted that the proper interpretation of this term was &#x201c;of largely or approximately uniform thickness&#x201d; unless something in the prosecution history imposed the &#x201c;clear and unmistakable disclaimer&#x201d; needed for narrowing beyond this simple-language interpretation. Id. In <i>Anchor Wall Systems </i>v. <i>Rockwood Retaining Walls, Inc., </i>340 F.3d 1298, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2003)&#x201d; Id. at 1311. Similarly, the plain language of Claim 1 requires neither a perfectly helical flow nor a flow that returns precisely to the center after one rotation (a limitation that arises only as a logical consequence of requiring a perfectly helical flow).</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The reader should appreciate that case law generally recognizes a dual ordinary meaning of such words of approximation, as contemplated in the foregoing, as connoting a term of approximation or a term of magnitude; e.g., see <i>Deering Precision Instruments, L.L.C. </i>v. <i>Vector Distrib. Sys., Inc., </i>347 F.3d 1314, 68 USPQ2d 1716, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 1426 (2004) where the court was asked to construe the meaning of the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; in a patent claim. Also see <i>Epcon, </i>279 F.3d at 1031 (&#x201c;The phrase &#x2018;substantially constant&#x2019; denotes language of approximation, while the phrase &#x2018;substantially below&#x2019; signifies language of magnitude, i.e., not insubstantial.&#x201d;). Also, see, e.g., <i>Epcon Gas Sys., Inc. </i>v. <i>Bauer Compressors, Inc., </i>279 F.3d 1022 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (construing the terms &#x201c;substantially constant&#x201d; and &#x201c;substantially below&#x201d;); <i>Zodiac Pool Care, Inc. </i>v. <i>Hoffinger Indus., Inc., </i>206 F.3d 1408 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (construing the term &#x201c;substantially inward&#x201d;); <i>York Prods., Inc. </i>v. <i>Cent. Tractor Farm </i>&#x26; <i>Family Ctr., </i>99 F.3d 1568 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (construing the term &#x201c;substantially the entire height thereof&#x201d;); <i>Tex. Instruments Inc. </i>v. <i>Cypress Semiconductor Corp., </i>90 F.3d 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (construing the term &#x201c;substantially in the common plane&#x201d;). In conducting their analysis, the court instructed to begin with the ordinary meaning of the claim terms to one of ordinary skill in the art. <i>Prima Tek, </i>318 F.3d at 1148. Reference to dictionaries and our cases indicates that the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; has numerous ordinary meanings. As the district court stated, &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; can mean &#x201c;significantly&#x201d; or &#x201c;considerably.&#x201d; The term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; can also mean &#x201c;largely&#x201d; or &#x201c;essentially.&#x201d; Webster's New 20th Century Dictionary 1817 (1983).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Words of approximation, as contemplated in the foregoing, may also be used in phrases establishing approximate ranges or limits, where the end points are inclusive and approximate, not perfect; e.g., see <i>AK Steel Corp. </i>v. <i>Sollac, </i>344 F.3d 1234, 68 USPQ2d 1280, 1285 (Fed. Cir. 2003) where it where the court said [W]e conclude that the ordinary meaning of the phrase &#x201c;up to about 10%&#x201d; includes the &#x201c;about 10%&#x201d; endpoint. As pointed out by AK Steel, when an object of the preposition &#x201c;up to&#x201d; is nonnumeric, the most natural meaning is to exclude the object (e.g., painting the wall up to the door). On the other hand, as pointed out by Sollac, when the object is a numerical limit, the normal meaning is to include that upper numerical limit (e.g., counting up to ten, seating capacity for up to seven passengers). Because we have here a numerical limit&#x2014;&#x201c;about 10%&#x201d;&#x2014;the ordinary meaning is that that endpoint is included.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the present specification and claims, a goal of employment of such words of approximation, as contemplated in the foregoing, is to avoid a strict numerical boundary to the modified specified parameter, as sanctioned by <i>Pall Corp. </i>v. <i>Micron Separations, Inc., </i>66 F.3d 1211, 1217, 36 USPQ2d 1225, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 1995) where it states &#x201c;It is well established that when the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; serves reasonably to describe the subject matter so that its scope would be understood by persons in the field of the invention, and to distinguish the claimed subject matter from the prior art, it is not indefinite.&#x201d; Likewise see <i>Verve LLC </i>v. <i>Crane Cams Inc., </i>311 F.3d 1116, 65 USPQ2d 1051, 1054 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Expressions such as &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; are used in patent documents when warranted by the nature of the invention, in order to accommodate the minor variations that may be appropriate to secure the invention. Such usage may well satisfy the charge to &#x201c;particularly point out and distinctly claim&#x201d; the invention, 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 112, and indeed may be necessary in order to provide the inventor with the benefit of his invention. In <i>Andrew Corp. </i>v. <i>Gabriel Elecs. Inc., </i>847 F.2d 819, 821-22, 6 USPQ2d 2010, 2013 (Fed. Cir. 1988) the court explained that usages such as &#x201c;substantially equal&#x201d; and &#x201c;closely approximate&#x201d; may serve to describe the invention with precision appropriate to the technology and without intruding on the prior art. The court again explained in <i>Ecolab Inc. </i>v. <i>Envirochem, Inc., </i>264 F.3d 1358, 1367, 60 USPQ2d 1173, 1179 (Fed. Cir. 2001) that &#x201c;like the term &#x2018;about,&#x2019; the term &#x2018;substantially&#x2019; is a descriptive term commonly used in patent claims to &#x2018;avoid a strict numerical boundary to the specified parameter, see <i>Ecolab Inc. </i>v. <i>Envirochem Inc., </i>264 F.3d 1358, 60 USPQ2d 1173, 1179 (Fed. Cir. 2001) where the court found that the use of the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; to modify the term &#x201c;uniform&#x201d; does not render this phrase so unclear such that there is no means by which to ascertain the claim scope.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Similarly, other courts have noted that like the term &#x201c;about,&#x201d; the term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; is a descriptive term commonly used in patent claims to &#x201c;avoid a strict numerical boundary to the specified parameter.&#x201d;; e.g., see <i>Pall Corp. </i>v. <i>Micron Seps., </i>66 F.3d 1211, 1217, 36 USPQ2d 1225, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 1995); see, e.g., <i>Andrew Corp. </i>v. <i>Gabriel Elecs. Inc., </i>847 F.2d 819, 821-22, 6 USPQ2d 2010, 2013 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (noting that terms such as &#x201c;approach each other,&#x201d; &#x201c;close to,&#x201d; &#x201c;substantially equal,&#x201d; and &#x201c;closely approximate&#x201d; are ubiquitously used in patent claims and that such usages, when serving reasonably to describe the claimed subject matter to those of skill in the field of the invention, and to distinguish the claimed subject matter from the prior art, have been accepted in patent examination and upheld by the courts). In this case, &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; avoids the strict 100% nonuniformity boundary.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Indeed, the foregoing sanctioning of such words of approximation, as contemplated in the foregoing, has been established as early as 1939, see <i>Ex parte Mallory, </i>52 USPQ 297, 297 (Pat. Off. Bd. App. 1941) where, for example, the court said &#x201c;the claims specify that the film is &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; eliminated and for the intended purpose, it is believed that the slight portion of the film which may remain is negligible. We are of the view, therefore, that the claims may be regarded as sufficiently accurate.&#x201d; Similarly, In re <i>Hutchison, </i>104 F.2d 829, 42 USPQ 90, 93 (C.C.P.A. 1939) the court said, &#x201c;It is realized that &#x201c;substantial distance&#x201d; is a relative and somewhat indefinite term, or phrase, but terms and phrases of this character are not uncommon in patents in cases where, according to the art involved, the meaning can be determined with reasonable clearness.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Hence, for at least the forgoing reason, Applicants submit that it is improper for any examiner to hold as indefinite any claims of the present patent that employ any words of approximation.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meanings as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.

In such contexts, &#x201c;configured to&#x201d; or &#x201c;operable for&#x201d; is used to connote structure by indicating that the mechanisms/units/circuits/components include structure (e.g., circuitry and/or mechanisms) that performs the task or tasks during operation. As such, the mechanisms/unit/circuit/component can be said to be configured to (or be operable) for perform(ing) the task even when the specified mechanisms/unit/circuit/component is not currently operational (e.g., is not on).
