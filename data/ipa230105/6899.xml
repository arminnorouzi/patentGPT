FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to the field of transmission and reception systems in networks. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a technique that allows measuring quality of channels for transmitting and receiving data in a system which includes at least two devices which are connected thru a network.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">2. BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present section is intended to introduce the reader to various aspects of art, which may be related to various aspects of the present disclosure that are described and/or claimed below. This discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the present disclosure. Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the field of data transmission in networks, some data transmission/reception equipment may be severely impacted by some variation of the quality of received signal. This particularly true in systems which require real time transmission and/or reception of data. For example, in a local area network (LAN) or a home area network (HAN), a device may need to receive real-time data, from another device. Real time data may for example be TV program which is provided by an operator (i.e. Verizon&#x2122;, T-Mobile&#x2122;, Orange&#x2122;, Deutsche Telekom&#x2122;, etc.). Real time data may also be video and/or audio representing execution of software somewhere in another network and coming from one or several servers. Among the target services, one can consider that streamed data originating from the execution of a game (such as FPS games) in the cloud are real time data (for example Google&#x2122; Stadia&#x2122;).</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">More generally, one can consider real time data are data which are transmitted (and received) with time constraint and order constraint, both of these constraints determining the possibility of transmitting and/or receiving real-time data in acceptable conditions.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For achieving reception and/or transmission of real-time data in good conditions (guarantying efficient treatment of these data), it may be necessary to obtain information on whether the reception/transmission conditions are good or not. For example, in a home area network, it may be interesting to obtain information on the quality of the signal that is received by a device. For example, it may be interesting to obtain an indication of the quality of a wireless signal (e.g. Wi-Fi signal) so as to determine whether conditions are good or not.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Usually, monitoring quality of signal received in networks, and more specifically in wireless network, is based on a single measurement: the arrangement of wireless devices within a wireless network and the overall quality of the reception and transmission condition is often determined on the basis of received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values that each indicates the distance between two wireless devices and the strength of the received signal. The RSSI is thus used so as a kind of representation of the quality of the wireless link.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the sole strength of a received signal may not be enough to determine whether a given device may be able to properly receive real-time data in a network. Indeed, for Wi-Fi networks, the Wi-Fi quality is highly dependent of several criteria; the RSSI (signal indicator) level is not sufficient for knowing if a Wi-Fi connection is good enough for example for IPTV UDP/Multicast communication.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It would hence be desirable to provide a technique that would avoid at least some of these drawbacks of the prior art, and that would notably allow obtaining relevant information on whether wireless transmission conditions are suitable for real-time data transmission or not.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">3. SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present disclosure, a method for monitoring quality of transmission conditions in a communications network is proposed.

The technique thus allows obtaining an accurate indicator of the ability of devices to transmit and/or receive real-time data.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the disclosure, the signal is a received signal and the at least three specific characteristics of the received signal belong to the group which comprises the &#x201c;PHY rate&#x201d; of the last received data frame by the monitoring device, the remaining available time for transmission &#x201c;Tx opportunity&#x201d; and the percentage of retransmission &#x201c;Frame retries&#x201d;.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The present disclosure relates to a method that allows determining transceiving (transceiving stands for transmitting and/or receiving) conditions over a network. This objective is reached, according to the disclosure, by combining measures of at least three characteristics of signal. A calculation is made, based on these characteristics, for providing an instant composite QoS indicator. The composite QoS indicator is more likely to provide a good indication on whether real-time data will be efficiently processed by the networks or not. Additionally, the instant composite QoS indicator can itself be processed to provide a long-time composite indicator which is likely to be stored for further analysis.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">As it will be described with more details hereinafter with reference to the accompanying figures, it is proposed in one embodiment of the present disclosure to use a combination of three pieces of data, which are obtained in a continuous way, directly from the physical layer or by a driver of a device included in a network. Each of these three pieces of data represent a characteristic of the signal. These three characteristics, when combined, represent an efficient indication on the ability of the link used in the network for transmitting real-time data between a transmitter and a receiver.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a flow chart describing the general method and the characteristics extracted from the link for obtaining the instant composite QoS indicator (iCQi) at a given measuring time. According to this general disclosure, a device (D<b>0</b>) which is included in a network (for example a local network) comprising at least two devices (e.g., D<b>0</b>, D<b>1</b> etc.) is in charge of monitoring quality of transmission condition in a network in the form of instant composite QoS indicators (iCQis), based on at least three specific characteristics of a received signal, the signal varying in time. The device is called a monitoring device. The monitoring device implements, in a continuous or semi-continuous way, a first phase (P<b>1</b>) for determining instant composite QoS indicators (iCQis) which includes at least one iteration of the following steps:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0039">capturing (<b>10</b>) a piece of data representing the value of each characteristic of the at least three specific characteristics of the received signal, called a caught value (thus delivering at least three caught value v #1, v #2, v #3, one per characteristic);</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0040">normalizing (<b>20</b>) the caught values, according to a normalizing scheme associated to the three specific characteristics of the received signal, delivering at least three normalized values (vn #1, vn #2, vn #3 one per characteristic);</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0041">calculating (<b>30</b>) the instant composite QoS indicator (iCQi) as a function of the at least three normalized values;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0042">storing (<b>40</b>) the instant composite QoS indicator (iCQi);</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0043">freezing (<b>50</b>) the process during a given period of time.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0040" num="0044">According to a specific embodiment, the at least three specific characteristics belong to the group comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0045">PHY rate of the last received data frame;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0046">Tx opportunity that is the remaining available time for transmission;</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0047">Frame retries.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0041" num="0048">Thus, the instant composite QoS indicator (iCQi) is a mix of three values, each of them being representative of one among these above three characteristics. These specific characteristics are selected, among several available characteristics, since they are, when combined (mixed), suitable to represent the quality of the signal received by the monitoring device for representing the ability of the signal to transport real-time data efficiently.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0049">The way the three values are normalized is a function of the characteristics themselves and of defined ceilings and thresholds. In one embodiment, the normalized values are between 0 and 1. In other embodiments and variants, normalized values may be between 0 and 100% or between &#x2212;1 and 1, the 0-value representing for example a minimum requirement for a characteristic. Detailed explanations on the normalization are given herein above in connection with a specific embodiment.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0050">Once the values are normalized, according to their respective normalization scheme, the normalized values are combined, also according to a combination scheme, which is function of the form the target score has to be obtained. More specifically, in one embodiment, the normalized values are multiplied for delivering the instant composite QoS indicator (iCQi) which is then stored in the memory of the monitoring device.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0051">According to a specific feature, the monitoring device is, in the network, the device which should receive the real-time data. Thus, in this context, the monitoring device is able to indicate, to the transmitting device, whether it will able to receive and process the real-time data. In another embodiment, the monitoring device is the transmitting device, which is able to continuously monitor the quality of the links with receiving devices, and to decide whether it will adapt or not the content to transmit through the link(s) as a function of the indicator(s) (for example, one indicator per link). It is thus possible to apply the same technique at the level of the transmitter. In this case, the three specific characteristics (associated with a receiver device) are:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0052">Tx (transmission) data rate (instead of Rx (reception) data rate);</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0053">Tx (transmission) retries (instead of Rx (reception) retries);</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0054">Txop remains unchanged.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0045" num="0055">For example, this allows an access point (AP) (example. g., a gateway) to monitor the QoS for each connected client. The result is similar/equivalent to the analysis done when the code is executed in the receiving device (knowing that a given client is connected to only one AP at one time).</p><p id="p-0046" num="0056">Since obtaining and storing many values of the instant composite QoS indicator (iCQi) may lead to the accumulation of a huge quantity of data, a so-called compression phase (P<b>2</b>) is implemented. The objective of this compression phase is to reduce the size of the logs while keeping valuable data available for further analysis. Compression phase (P<b>2</b>) is independent of the monitoring phase (P<b>1</b>), and both phases can run in parallel in separate threads.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0057">As previously discussed, obtaining an instant indicator of the quality of the link (or channel) is valuable for an instant analysis. However, an objective of the disclosure is also to provide source data for long time analysis (for example, between one day and one year). A further objective is to allow determining, over a long period, the possible interfering causes of a bad quality for a link. While retaining instant indicator on a short period is feasible, doing so for a (very) long time is difficult. One approach to overcoming this difficulty is to summarize data, on a continuous basis, for allowing more detailed analysis posteriori. What has to be understood is that, according to the disclosure, for a posteriori analysis, the &#x201c;bad&#x201d; events are more important than the good ones. It is indeed supposed that the link or channel is more often in good conditions for transmitting than in bad condition. So the compression phase should have the ability to summarize instant composite QoS indicators (iCQis) so that bad values of this indicators are put forward. For a given set of instant composite QoS indicators (iCQis) the compression is to produce a weighted composite QoS indicator (wCQi). The weighted composite QoS indicator (wCQi) is the result of an integration made in a set of instant composite QoS indicators (iCQis) where the bad values of an instant composite QoS indicators are more important that the good ones. Several embodiments are possible for achieving this result, depending on the method used for creating an instant composite QoS indicator (iCQi). According to an embodiment proposed herein after, a weighted average is calculated on a given period of time (for example, one minute) for a set of instant composite QoS indicators (iCQis). The calculated weighted average may be an adaptative one (e.g., adaptative average). According to other embodiments, a weighted average is calculated for each value (PHY rate, Tx opportunities, retries) of the instant composite QoS indicator (iCQi) and then the resulting three weighted averages are combined to produce the weighted composite QoS indicator (wCQi), also for a given period of time. Other methods may be used to summarize a set of instant composite QoS indicators (iCQis).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0058">Thus, the second phase for determining weighted composite QoS indicators, as a function of at least one set of instant composite QoS indicators previously determined in the first phase, generally includes at least one iteration of selecting (<b>60</b>) a given set of instant composite QoS indicators (iCQix) among the available instant composite QoS indicators (iCQis) and calculating (<b>70</b>) a weighted composite QoS indicators (wCQi) comprising multiplying a predetermined weight to each instant composite QoS indicator of the selected set of instant composite QoS indicators (iCQix) and deleting (<b>80</b>) the set of instant composite QoS indicators (iCQix) from the available instant composite QoS indicators (iCQis). These steps are done in a continuous or semi continuous way, depending on parametrization. The weighted composite QoS indicators (wCQi) is logged, along with other physical values (notably timestamps, RSSI) in a database for future use, as explained herein after.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0059">Above, a specific embodiment of the disclosure is described.

In this embodiment, since the STB is supposed to receive data from the gateway, and more precisely video data, it is important to identify whether the Wi-Fi link quality is compatible or not for IPTV over Wi-Fi.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0063">Internet Protocol television (IPTV) stands for delivery of television content over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Unlike downloaded media, IPTV allows streaming the source media continuously, in real-time, synchronized with the source. As a result, a client media player can begin playing the content (such as a TV channel) almost immediately. IPTV uses the Internet protocol and requires important availability of the link which is used to transmit and receive content. Indeed, in IPTV, video frames are coming from the WAN interface of the gateway, and are transmitted to the STB client. In the context of this embodiment videoframes are transmitted through the Wi-Fi link, and it is important to determine the quality of the link. One can note that streaming video games may also use streaming for transmitting data frames to a client. The problem of monitoring the quality of the Wi-Fi link is also present for streaming video games.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0064">Thus, in this embodiment, The STB shall monitor and record the quality of the Wi-Fi link. This monitoring is done in a continuous way, (e.g., every two seconds). The Wi-Fi channel may vary quickly at the speed at which Wi-Fi equipment decides to access the Internet. Wi-Fi handles small queries pretty well and there's thus little need to go below 500 ms. However, beyond 5 seconds, one could begin to miss critical events, which is not a good thing considering the adaptative average which is done after: one can hardly accept to lose events while making the extensive measuring. As a consequence, for Wi-Fi, one can select a capturing value between 0.5 and 3 seconds. In this embodiment, 2 seconds have been chosen.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0065">The three characteristics that have been selected for monitoring the Wi-Fi quality are expressed in percentage and are, like previously exposed:<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0066">the &#x201c;PHY rate&#x201d; of the last received data frame;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0067">the &#x201c;Tx opportunity&#x201d; that is the remaining available time for transmission;</li>        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0068">the &#x201c;Frame retries&#x201d;.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0056" num="0069">In this embodiment, the instant Wi-Fi QoS composite indicator is a combination of the values of these three characteristics, delivering an instant Wi-Fi QoS composite indicator every two seconds.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0070">However, this instant Wi-Fi QoS composite indicator is not the only logged value.
