Background Information</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A modern aircraft propulsion system may include a gas turbine engine housed within a nacelle. The nacelle includes an inlet structure for directing incoming air to the gas turbine engine. This inlet structure includes an inlet lip, an inner barrel and an outer barrel. The inlet lip forms a leading edge of the inlet structure. The inner barrel is connected to a radial inner end of the inlet lip, and at least partially forms an outer peripheral boundary of an inlet duct into the aircraft propulsion system. The outer barrel is connected to a radial outer end of the inlet lip, and circumscribes the inner barrel.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Under certain environmental conditions, the inlet lip may be susceptible to ice accumulation. To melt ice that may accumulate on the inlet lip, the inlet structure may be configured with a thermal anti-icing system. A lip skin of the inlet lip, for example, may be configured with an electrical resistance heater. Such an electrical resistance heater may be attached to an interior surface of the lip skin to minimize a thermal conduction path length from the heater to an exterior surface of the lip skin/the inlet lip. While such electrical resistance heaters have various benefits, there is still room in the art for improvement. Damage to the lip skin and the electrical resistance heater arranged therewith following a foreign object impact, for example, may render a portion of or the entire electrical resistance heater inoperable where the damage severs one or more electrical resistance circuits within the electrical resistance heater.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, an assembly is provided for a structure.

This aircraft assembly <b>20</b> includes an aircraft structure <b>22</b> and a microwave thermal anti-icing system <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The aircraft structure <b>22</b> includes at least one exterior skin <b>26</b>; e.g., a multi-layered, composite skin. This exterior skin <b>26</b> is configured to form an exterior surface <b>28</b> of the aircraft structure <b>22</b> such as an aerodynamic flow surface. The exterior skin <b>26</b>, for example, may be configured with a nacelle of a propulsion system for the aircraft; e.g., the aircraft structure <b>22</b> may be a nacelle structure. The exterior skin <b>26</b>, more particularly, may be configured as or otherwise included as part of a noselip of the nacelle. Alternatively, the exterior skin <b>26</b> may be configured with another component/structure of the aircraft such as its fuselage or a wing.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The aircraft structure <b>22</b> and its exterior skin <b>26</b> extend laterally in a first direction (e.g., an x-axis direction) along an x-axis. The aircraft structure <b>22</b> and its exterior skin <b>26</b> extend laterally in a second direction (e.g., a y-axis direction) along a y-axis. The aircraft structure <b>22</b> and its exterior skin <b>26</b> extend vertically in a vertical direction (e.g., a z-axis direction) along a z-axis. Note, the term &#x201c;lateral&#x201d; may be used herein to generally describe the first lateral direction, the second lateral direction and/or any other direction within the x-y plane. Also note, the term &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; may be used herein to describe a depthwise panel direction and is not limited to a gravitational up/down direction. Furthermore, for ease of illustration, the x-y plane is shown as a generally flat plane. However, in other embodiments, the x-y plane and, thus, the aircraft structure <b>22</b> and/or its exterior skin <b>26</b> may be curved and/or follow an undulating geometry. For example, the x-y plane and, thus, the aircraft structure <b>22</b> and/or its exterior skin <b>26</b> may be arcuate, cylindrical, conical, frustoconical, or tapered with or without radial undulations. In such embodiments, a solely vertical direction (e.g., z-axis direction) may be defined relative to a position of interest on the x-y plane. For example, on a spherical x-y plane, the vertical direction (e.g., z-axis) direction is a radial direction.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The exterior skin <b>26</b> is configured as a relatively thin body that extends laterally within the x-y plane. The exterior skin <b>26</b> has a vertical thickness <b>30</b>. This skin vertical thickness <b>30</b> extends vertically between opposing side surfaces <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> of the exterior skin <b>26</b>, where the skin exterior surface <b>32</b> may form the structure exterior surface <b>28</b>. The exterior skin body may be solid, non-porous vertically between the skin exterior surface <b>32</b> and the skin interior surface <b>34</b>. Material(s) of the exterior skin <b>26</b> may thereby extend between the skin exterior surface <b>32</b> and the skin interior surface <b>34</b> without any interruptions; e.g., pores, voids, chambers, cavities and/or any other types of apertures. The present disclosure, however, is not limited to such an exemplary solid, non-porous exterior skin configuration.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The thermal anti-icing system <b>24</b> is configured to melt and/or prevent ice accumulation on the exterior surface <b>28</b>, <b>32</b>. The thermal anti-icing system <b>24</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes at least one susceptor <b>36</b> and a microwave system <b>38</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The susceptor <b>36</b> is configured to absorb electromagnetic energy (e.g., microwave radiation, also referred to as &#x201c;microwaves&#x201d;) and convert that absorbed electromagnetic energy into heat. The susceptor <b>36</b>, for example, may be configured as a thin layer (or strip, or wire) of material. Examples of the susceptor material may include, but are not limited to: indium tin oxide (ITO); aluminum (Al) or an alloy thereof; ferrous metal such as stainless steel; titanium (Ti) or an alloy thereof; Inconel alloys; chromium (Cr) or an alloy thereof; graphite; composites of metal(s) and ceramic(s) (e.g., cermets); doped silicon carbide; and/or metal oxide(s). Another example of the susceptor material includes (e.g., fiber) reinforcement material within a polymer matrix, where a thickness of the susceptor material may be sized to be about or exactly one-quarter (&#xbc;) of the wavelength of the microwaves generated by the microwave system <b>38</b>. An example of the reinforcement material is fiberglass. An example of the polymer matrix is thermoset epoxy resin. The present disclosure, however, is not limited to the foregoing exemplary susceptor materials.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The microwave system <b>38</b> includes a microwave source <b>40</b> and a microwave transmission system <b>42</b>.

Of course, in other embodiments, the microwave source <b>40</b> may generate the microwaves at a frequency at or above 2.6 gigahertz and/or at a frequency at or below 2.3 gigahertz. For example, the microwave source <b>40</b> may be configured to generate microwaves at a frequency between one and ten gigahertz; e.g., between one and three gigahertz, or more specifically between 2.2 and 2.7 gigahertz for example.

For example, a solid state device may require less (e.g., 10-100&#xd7; less) operational power than a vacuum electron device; e.g., 20-50 volts versus 4000 volts. A solid state device may have a longer useful lifetime than a vacuum electron device; e.g., 15-20 plus years versus 500-1000 hours. A solid state device may have a lower mass and, thus, weigh less than a vacuum electron device.

Furthermore, the exterior skin <b>26</b> and the thermal anti-icing system <b>24</b> of the present disclosure may alternatively be configured for non-aircraft applications. For example, the exterior skin <b>26</b> may form an exterior surface of an airfoil such as, but not limited to, a wind turbine blade. In another example, the exterior skin <b>26</b> may for an exterior surface of another type of vehicle that would benefit from anti-icing; e.g., an automobile, a boat, etc.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">While various embodiments of the present invention have been disclosed, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many more embodiments and implementations are possible within the scope of the invention.
