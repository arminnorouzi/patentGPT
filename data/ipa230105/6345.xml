Radar applications range from machine inspection (by measuring vibration), counting people and tracking, and the like. On the other hand, it is envisaged that future 5G deployments will utilize this frequency band for very high data rate. For both the application scenarios, a need exists for scanning an antenna beam over a large angular swath where the antenna beam itself displays high directivity, i.e. narrow beam width rather than using a single antenna with omnidirectional coverage. Omnidirectional antenna has the property of low gain thereby requiring more transmit power; this is critical at MMW frequency bands due to high propagation loss. Moreover, an omnidirectional antenna will pick up radio waves from both the desired object (or user) as well as interfering sources; thereby making detection more difficult.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A standard alternative is to implement electronic scanning of antenna beam using phased-array concept. However, the phased-array concept works well with a narrow band system. An array factor that defines the directivity and beam scanning angle is frequency sensitive. Both values change as the operating frequency changes and therefore the array needs to be reconfigured when the system is wideband. Typically, bandwidth &#x3e;10% of center frequency. On the other hand, the emerging areas of 5G or ultra-wideband radar expect a frequency bandwidth of greater than 20% or 500 MHz. To introduce frequency independence, conventional concepts like multiband array, a frequency tapered array and an array with varying element sizes and element distances may be employed. Cost and size of the antenna scanning system is a concern with these conventional concepts.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Embodiments of the present disclosure present technological improvements as solutions to one or more of the above-mentioned technical problems recognized by the inventors in conventional systems.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In an aspect, there is provided a Millimeter Wave (MMW) frequency antenna scanning system comprising: a microstrip antenna positioned horizontally in an XY plane of a Cartesian coordinate system and cooperating with a Radio Frequency (RF) chain to receive and transmit radio waves;

While examples and features of disclosed principles are described herein, modifications, adaptations, and other implementations are possible without departing from the scope of the disclosed embodiments.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The Millimeter Wave (MMW) frequency band of 24 GHz to 28 GHz is gaining importance in Radio Frequency (RF) applications and 5th Generation (5G) deployments in wireless communications. Detection by an omnidirectional antenna is less efficient considering it picks up radio waves from interfering sources. To meet the need for scanning the antenna beam over a large angular swath with high directivity, a phased array implementation may be considered. However, the phased array implementation works better with a narrow band system. Alternatives like multiband array, frequency tapered array and arrays with varying element sizes and element distances are cost intensive and size of the antenna scanning system is also a concern.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In a classical consideration for 5G deployment at MMW frequency bands, &#x201c;small cells&#x201d; i.e. cells that cover a region of 250 m to 300 m each are required, due to the high propagation losses associated with MMW. Moreover, there are issues involved with obstruction due to buildings, infrastructure where MMW radio waves cannot penetrate the structures. This consideration leads to a practical deployment scenario where thousands of 5G base stations are needed to be installed to cover an urban area. Thus, size and cost of an antenna scanning system is a very important consideration. The technical problem of providing an MMW frequency antenna scanning system using a single small size antenna capable of scanning as desired at a desired precision is addressed in the present disclosure. The antenna scanning system provided is an electromechanical system that makes the system cost effective. Computer control provides the precision control in beam steering from remote. Use of a metasurface and configuration of a microstrip antenna (described later in the description) addresses the concern on the size of the antenna scanning system.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the context of the subject disclosure, definitions of certain expressions and their usage are as explained herein below.<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0032">Metamaterial is an artificial material created by introducing periodic arrangements of small perturbations in a natural material.

Here, it is observed that the peak beam got steered w.r.t the reference beam with the same angle) (40&#xb0;) as that of the metasurface inclination angle.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0073">Therefore, concluding the above facts, the main beam is getting steered with the same angle as that of metasurface inclination angle.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0074">It may be noted that the beam steering is happening only in &#x3c6;=90&#xb0; plane because the metasurface <b>108</b> is allowed to incline towards the Y-axis. Similarly, if the metasurface <b>108</b> is allowed to incline towards the X-axis, then the beam steering behavior will be observed for &#x3c6;=0&#xb0; plane.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates the S<b>11</b> plots for the microstrip antenna <b>102</b> having various values of inclination angle of metasurface, when the metasurface is disposed at a distance of 4 millimeter (mm) from a radiating face of the microstrip antenna, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0076">When the metasurface <b>108</b> was placed on top of the microstrip antenna <b>102</b> at a distance of 4 mm then S<b>11</b> lies between &#x2014;10 dB and &#x2014;15 dB at frequency of interest 28 GHz for various inclination angles of the metasurface <b>108</b>, which does not match the requirement (S<b>11</b>&#x2264;&#x2212;15 dB as desired in MMW applications). Considering this requirement, the S<b>11</b> dip illustrates not a good matching except for inclination angle of 20&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a 2-Dimensional radiation pattern of the microstrip antenna <b>102</b> for various values of inclination angle of metasurface, when the metasurface <b>108</b> is disposed at a distance of 4 millimeter (mm) from the radiating face of the microstrip antenna <b>102</b>, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. The expressions &#x2018;ang&#x2019; and &#x2018;mag&#x2019; depicted in the figure represent angle and magnitude respectively, associated with the gain in the radiation pattern plot. The peak points of the radiation pattern have been marked by markers m<b>1</b>, m<b>2</b>, m<b>3</b> and m<b>4</b>. It has been observed that the two peak points, corresponding to the radiation pattern for inclination angle 10&#xb0; and 20&#xb0;, coincided at the same point marked by m<b>2</b>. Also, the rest of the beam are not getting steered in a good manner as expected.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0078">Hence, in accordance with the present disclosure, the separation between antenna and metasurface (the second predetermined distance) was optimized to get the S<b>11</b> dip (@28 GHz) below &#x2212;15 dB for every inclination angle of the metasurface <b>108</b>. Also, the beam needs to get steered with the same angle as that of angle rotate. The optimized second predetermined distance which fulfills both these criteria is 8 mm. Hence, only the intrinsic property of the metasurface <b>108</b> is not sufficient enough to achieve beam steering as desired for MMW applications. It also depends upon the design of the microstrip antenna <b>102</b> provided in the present disclosure along with the optimization of the distance between the microstrip antenna <b>102</b> and the metasurface <b>108</b> in the MMW frequency antenna scanning system <b>100</b>. The computer controlled electromechanical system <b>100</b> thus provides a cost effective and compact MMW frequency antenna scanning system with desired beam steering.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0079">The illustrated steps are set out to explain the exemplary embodiments shown, and it should be anticipated that ongoing technological development will change the manner in which particular functions are performed.
