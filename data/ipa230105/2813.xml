The disclosure also provides methods and systems useful in the diagnosis of genetic abnormalities in a mixed nucleic acid population taken from an organism. For example, disclosed herein are methods and systems useful in the diagnosis of fetal genetic abnormalities or tumor genetic abnormalities using samples obtained noninvasively from pregnant females or patients. Such samples can include mixed nucleic acid populations derived from blood, plasma, serum, urine, stool or saliva.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Analysis of mixed nucleic acid populations, for example DNA and RNA samples obtained from a single tissue source such as blood, urine or saliva but containing distinct nucleic acid subpopulations, has elicited significant interest in the research and health care communities. Using suitable methods, mixed nucleic acid populations derived from cell-free DNA (or RNA) taken from pregnant females can be analyzed to determine fetal characteristics, including disease inheritance. Similarly, mixed nucleic acid populations derived from cell-free DNA (or RNA) taken from cancer patients can be analyzed to determine various characteristics such as tumor malignancy, tumor origin or drug susceptibility. While analysis of such mixed nucleic acid populations can be technically complex due to the high degree of similarity between the various subpopulations, the difficulty of the analysis is outweighed by the ease of obtaining appropriate nucleic acid samples cheaply, quickly and non-invasively through procedures such as phlebotomy or urine/saliva collection. One mode of analyzing cell-free DNA, nucleic acid sequencing, is informative but costly on a per-sample and time-consuming. Microarray analysis is cheaper and quicker than sequencing, but current commercial embodiments of microarray products do not readily support discrimination between the different and highly similar subpopulations present in a mixed nucleic acid population. As a result of the low concentration of fetal DNA in maternal samples, and low concentration of tumor DNA in a blood sample containing circulating tumor cells, single or low multiplex assays are unlikely to differentiate between an aneuploid fetus (e.g., trisomy of chromosome 21) from a euploid fetus, or a tumor cell from a healthy cell in a cancer patient. For example, fetal DNA can be present at levels of between 4%-15% of total cell-free DNA in blood; DNA derived from a particular fetal chromosome would represent one-twenty-third of such fetal DNA. Detection of a trisomy would require reliable detection of signal changes as low as 1-2% above background. Moreover, the analysis is further complicated by the limited amount of nucleic acid available through non-invasive sampling methods. For example, a maternal sample of 10 mls of whole blood can yield between 5 and 15 ng of purified cell-free DNA in a typical assay.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Due to the current challenges posed by such non-invasive approaches, a majority of pregnant women are subject to prenatal testing, including maternal serum screening and/or an ultrasound test, to determine risks for common birth defects, such as those resulting from trisomy 13, 18, and 21. However, the sensitivity and specificity of such tests are very poor leading to high false positive rates. As a result of the high false positive rates of such conventional tests, individuals typically must conduct follow-up testing with an invasive diagnostic test, such as Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS) between 11 and 14 weeks gestation or amniocentesis after 15 weeks gestation. These invasive procedures carry a risk of a miscarriage of around one percent (see Mujezinovic and Alfirevic, Obstet. Gynecol., 110:687-694 (2011)). Current analysis of fetal cells typically involves karyotyping or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and does not provide information about single gene traits. As a result, additional tests are required for identification of single gene diseases and disorders. Because prenatal diagnosis can be critical for management of a pregnancy with chromosomal abnormalities and localized genetic abnormalities, an accurate and early diagnosis is important to allow for interventional care before or during delivery and to prevent devastating consequences for the neonate.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Similarly, on the cancer front, powerful tools such as OncoScan&#xae; have been developed for purposes of diagnosing cancers. However, such samples are typically biopsy samples taken in invasive procedures that are both expensive and potentially risky to the patient. Through the use of microarray-based technology, researchers are able to identify large numbers of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) on a single array, which allows for the rapid and accurate detection of genetic abnormalities in a subject. As an example of one such product is the SNP detection microarray product from Affymetrix called OncoScan&#xae;. The OncoScan&#xae; product provides genome-wide copy number and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) profiles from solid tumor samples. Such a technology is a powerful tool in cancer diagnostics because it helps to overcome significant challenge due to the difficulty of working with limited amounts of DNA from highly degraded FFPE samples. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,190,373. However, such technologies are finding application in numerous other fields, as well. Specifically, genetic abnormalities account for a wide number of pathologies, including pathologies caused by chromosomal aneuploidy (e.g., Down syndrome), germline mutations in specific genes (e.g., sickle cell anemia), and pathologies caused by somatic mutations (e.g., cancer), and in many cases, the detection of such genetic abnormalities is complicated by invasive diagnostic procedures.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">As such, the development of a microarray based test that is sensitive and specific enough to detect genetic abnormalities in samples of mixed nucleic acid populations obtained by non-invasive means with low false-positive and false-negative rates would be of benefit to the field of molecular diagnostics. Recently, Ariosa Diagnostics reported studies involving microarray based analysis of cell-free DNA from maternal blood to detect the presence of fetal aneuploidies. See, e.g., Stokowski et al., Prenatal Diagnosis 35:1243-1246 (2015). Such methods involved analysis of bulk signals from non-polymorphic loci (i.e., loci that are expected to be identical for both mother and fetus) to estimate chromosomal copy number by simply measuring fluctuations in total signal detected from both maternal and fetal DNA at a given genetic locus. This necessitates a design strategy whereby the array is configured to interrogate non-polymorphic loci to determine copy number of the underlying chromosomes. There is a need to develop improved methods (as all as associated compositions, systems, devices and instruments) that leverages the high-throughput genotyping capabilities of microarray-based analysis to generate data from a single set of interrogation sites (for example, a data from a single set of polymorphic loci in mixed DNA populations), which can then be used to both genotype and estimate copy number of a given locus or chromosome within the major and minor DNA populations within mixed nucleic acid populations.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Described herein are methods and systems for analyzing a mixed nucleic acid sample to detect differences in copy number of a target polynucleotide, such as a detection of copy number variants indicating chromosomal aneuploidy, as well as methods of genotyping such target polynucleotides even when present at low levels within a mixed nucleic acid population.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This Summary is provided to introduce various aspects of the disclosure that are further described below in the Detailed Description.

A genome may be multi-chromosomal such that the DNA is cellularly distributed among a plurality of individual chromosomes. For example, in humans there are 22 pairs of chromosomes plus a gender associated XX or XY pair.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0150">As used herein, &#x201c;genotyping&#x201d; refers to the determination of the nucleic acid sequence information from a nucleic acid sample at one or more nucleotide positions. The nucleic acid sample may contain or be derived from any suitable source, including the genome or the transcriptome. In some embodiments, genotyping may comprise the determination of which allele or alleles an individual carries at one or more polymorphic sites. For example, genotyping may include or the determination of which allele or alleles an individual carries for one or more SNPs within a set of polymorphic sites. For example, a particular nucleotide in a genome may be an A in some individuals and a C in other individuals. Those individuals who have an A at the position have the A allele and those who have a C have the B allele. In a diploid organism the individual will have two copies of the sequence containing the polymorphic position so the individual may have an A allele and a B allele or alternatively two copies of the A allele or two copies of the B allele. Those individuals who have two copies of the B allele are homozygous for the B allele, those individuals who have two copies of the A allele are homozygous for the B allele, and those individuals who have one copy of each allele are heterozygous. The array may be designed to distinguish between each of these three possible outcomes. A polymorphic location may have two or more possible alleles and the array may be designed to distinguish between all possible combinations. In some embodiments, one or more polynucleotides (or a portion or portions of the polynucleotide, its amplification products, or complements thereof) that contain a sequence of interest (e.g., one or more SNP or mutation) can be processed by other techniques such as sequencing. Therefore, in some embodiments, the polynucleotides can be sequenced for genotyping or determining the presence or absence of the polymorphism or mutation.

The conventional internationally recognized individual human genome chromosome numbering system is employed herein. The size of an individual chromosome can vary from one type to another with a given multi-chromosomal genome and from one genome to another. In the case of the human genome, the entire DNA mass of a given chromosome is usually greater than 100,000,000 bp. For example, the size of the entire human genome is about 3&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>bp. The largest chromosome, chromosome no. 1, contains about 2.4&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>bp while the smallest chromosome, chromosome no. 22, contains about 5.3&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>bp. In some embodiments, chromosomes of interest in connection with the methods and systems of the present disclosure include those chromosomes that are associated with a chromosomal abnormality, such as chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y.

The actual physical size or extent of any individual chromosomal region can vary greatly. The term &#x201c;region&#x201d; is not necessarily definitive of a particular one or more genes because a region need not take into specific account the particular coding segments (exons) of an individual gene. In some embodiments, a chromosomal region will contain at least one polymorphic site.</p><p id="p-0154" num="0153">As used herein, &#x201c;chromosomal abnormalities&#x201d; or &#x201c;chromosomal abnormality&#x201d; can include any genetic abnormality including but not limited to aneuploidy, such as trisomy 21 (a.k.a.

A &#x201c;polymorphic site&#x201d; can refer to the nucleic acid position(s) at which a difference in nucleic acid sequence occurs. A polymorphism may comprise one or more base changes, an insertion, a repeat, or a deletion. A polymorphic locus may be as small as one base pair. Polymorphic sites include restriction fragment length polymorphisms, variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR's), hypervariable regions, minisatellites, dinucleotide repeats, trinucleotide repeats, tetranucleotide repeats, simple sequence repeats, and insertion elements. The first identified variant or allelic form is arbitrarily designated as the reference form and other variant or allelic forms are designated as alternative or variant or mutant alleles. The variant or allelic form occurring most frequently in a selected nucleic acid population is sometimes referred to as the wildtype form. In some embodiments, the wildtype form can be referred to as a &#x201c;major subpopulation&#x201d; and the mutant can be referred to as ta &#x201c;minor subpopulation&#x201d;. In some embodiments, the more frequently occurring allele can be referred to as a &#x201c;major subpopulation&#x201d; and the rarer or less frequently occurring allele can be referred to as ta &#x201c;minor subpopulation&#x201d;. Diploid organisms may be homozygous or heterozygous for allelic forms. A diallelic polymorphism has two forms. A triallelic polymorphism has three forms. A polymorphism between two nucleic acids can occur naturally, or be caused by exposure to or contact with chemicals, enzymes, or other agents, or exposure to agents that cause damage to nucleic acids, for example, ultraviolet radiation, mutagens or carcinogens.

Suitable methods for genotyping include variations of single nucleotide extension, use of allele-specific probes, ligation-based allelic discrimination, and the like.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0160">In the context of array based assays, a variety of genotyping methods are available. In some embodiments, the array surface is divided into features, each feature containing multiple sites that include copies of substantially identical oligonucleotides configured to bind to a particular target nucleic acid sequence. Hybridization of nucleic acid molecules to different locations on the array can be detected and quantified. One suitable method is to use any array containing allele-specific probes that selectively bind only to certain alleles and not others. In other embodiments, the array contains probes that bind non-selectively to all of the different forms of an allele, but then is extended or otherwise modified in an allele-specific manner to generate an allele-specific product. For example, the probe of the array can be elongated via template-dependent nucleotide polymerization. Alternatively, the probe can be elongated via sequence-dependent ligation of a tag oligonucleotide, which may contain a signal-generating moiety. In still, allele-specific products (e.g., allele-specific nucleotide extension products or ligation products) can be generated off-array, and then hybridized to an array containing probes that discriminate between the various extension products. Signals emitted from the array indicating hybridization of nucleic acid molecules to specific array probes can be detected and quantified.

In general, &#x201c;universal&#x201d; refers to the use of a single primer or set of primers for a plurality of amplification reactions. For example, in the detection or genotyping of a 100 different target sequences, all the MIPs may share the identical universal priming sequences, allowing for the multiplex amplification of the 100 different probes using a single set of primers. This allows for ease of synthesis (e.g. only one set of primers is made), resulting in reduced costs, as well as advantages in the kinetics of hybridization. Most importantly, the use of such primers greatly simplifies multiplexing in that only two primers are needed to amplify a plurality of probes. In general, the universal priming sequences/primers each range from about 12 to about 40 base pairs in length. Suitable universal priming sequences are known to one of skill in the art, and specifically include those exemplified herein. In some embodiments, the MIP is also designed with a tag sequence, or a barcode sequence, that will allow for specific detection of two channel probes using a two-color system. In such an example, the universal primer sequence at one end of the linearized probes, either the 5&#x2032;- or 3&#x2032;-end, depending on the application and the detection platform, will contain a specific sequence to recognize a particular colored label. Thus it can be advantageous to design a MIP to have a restriction site between two universal 3&#x2032;- and 5&#x2032;-ends of universal primers.</p><p id="p-0177" num="0176">Once the circularized probes are cleaved to form linearized probes, the probes can be subjected to an amplifying step of the first linearized probe composition in the presence of a first tailed primer to form a first amplified product composition, and amplifying the second linearized probe composition in the presence of a second tailed primer to form a second amplified product composition, wherein the first tailed primer has a tail sequence that is different from the second tailed primer. The amplification step can be carried out by any method known in the art. The PCR reaction can be carried out in the presence of a polymerase useful in connection with the present disclosure, such as USD Taq. In some embodiments, the amplification step is carried out in the presence of a hot-start polymerase comprising the polymerase and a polymerase inhibitor. In some embodiments, the polymerase inhibitor is disassociated from the polymerase when the temperature is at least 40&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the amplification step is carried out in the presence of Titanium Taq polymerase. In some embodiments, the amplification step is carried out in the presence of Platinum SuperFi DNA Polymerase.</p><p id="p-0178" num="0177">The present disclosure also contemplates sample preparation methods in certain preferred embodiments.

The fixing can include contacting the oligonucleotide array with nucleic acid hybridized thereto with a suitable fixing agent. In some embodiments, the fixing step occurs after the hybridization step is completed. In some embodiments, the fixing step occurs well after the hybridization step, e.g., after the hybridized array is washed and stained with a strain mixture. Therefore, in some embodiments, the array may undergo the steps of hybridization, washing, staining and fixing in this order, along with other steps.</p><p id="p-0184" num="0183">The different primer pair amplified sequences can be differentiated based on spectrally distinguishable probes (e.g. 2 different dye-labeled probes such as Taqman or Locked Nucleic Acid Probes (Universal Probe Library, Roche)). In such approach, all probes are combined into a single reaction volume and distinguished based on the differences in the color emitted by each probe. For example, the probes targeting one polynucleotide (e.g., a test chromosome, such as chromosome 21) may be conjugated to a dye with a first color and the probes targeting a second polynucleotide (e.g., a reference chromosome, such as chromosome 1) in the reaction may be conjugated to a dye of a second color.

In some embodiments, a complementary oligonucleotide to an amplified product composition comprises either a fluorescent/luminescent/chromogenic label or can be subsequently be reacted with additional compounds (e.g., immunostaining, aptamers) to generate a signal. In some embodiments, instead of hapten-labeled probes for detection, the labeling probes can have fluorophores conjugated directly which would eliminate the antibody-mediated signal amplification.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">As described herein, an amplified product composition can be generated from PCR by primers flanking the markers. These amplicons can be produced singly or in multiplexed reactions. In some embodiments, amplified product compositions can be produced as ss-DNA by asymmetric PCR from one primer flanking the polymorphism or as RNA transcribed in vitro from promoters linked to the primers. As an example, a fluorescent label can be introduced into amplified product compositions directly as dye-bearing nucleotides or bound atter amplification using dye-streptavidin complexes to incorporated biotin containing nucleotides.
