Hemoglobinopathies encompass a number of anemias of genetic origin in which there is a decreased production and/or increased hemolysis of erythrocytes. In particular, sickle cell disease is a group of genetic disorders that manifest in the production of sickle-shaped erythrocytes and are characterized by hemolytic anemia and vaso-occlusion events in addition to intense periods of pain, organ failure, and early mortality. Sickle cell anemia is the most common and severe form of sickle cell disease (SCD), affecting approximately 100,000 people in the United States (approximately 85,000 adults and 15,000 children) and 4.4 million worldwide. For many patients, SCD is defined by chronic organ failure punctuated by acute complications and early mortality. The sickle-shaped red blood cells (RBCs) that are the hallmark of SCD reveal only a small fraction of the complex and multifactorial pathophysiology stemming from perturbations in the normal function of blood and the vascular system. Current therapies for SCD are limited to supportive treatment of complications, erythrocyte transfusions, hydroxyurea, and stem cell transplantation, which are limited both in scope and magnitude of effect, leaving an unmet need for agents that help to mitigate the multifaceted complications arising from blood and vascular dysfunction.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Given the lack of available therapies, there is still a need for agents, e.g., dietary compositions and therapeutics for treating hemoglobinopathies, such as SCD, in a subject. There is a need for compositions designed to target multiple pathways (blood production and integrity, vascular function, and plasma and RBC amino acid imbalances) intersecting key systems (vascular, RBCs) to maintain blood health and function.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Provided herein is a composition (e.g., an Active Moiety) including amino acid entities and excluding glutamine or including a reduced level of glutamine that is useful for improving erythrocyte and/or hemoglobin function, turnover, and synthesis; vascular function; inflammation; and/or oxidative stress in a subject, e.g., a subject with a hemoglobinopathy (e.g., sickle cell disease) or a thalassemia (e.g. &#x3b1;-thalassemia or &#x3b2;-thalassemia). The composition can be used in a method of treating (e.g., reversing, reducing, ameliorating, or preventing) one or more symptoms of a hemoglobinopathy or a thalassemia in a subject in need thereof (e.g., a human). The method can further include monitoring the subject for an improvement in one or more symptoms of a hemoglobinopathy or a thalassemia after administration of the composition. The invention is based, in part, on the observation that glutamine increased levels of cell adhesion markers and only slightly reduced cell migration markers in the presence of TNF-&#x3b1; in an in vitro assay for sickle cell disease. Cell adhesion can contribute to vaso-occlusion during a sickling crisis. This observation was surprising because L-glutamine is the sole active ingredient in an oral powder indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients 5 years of age and older.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, the invention features a method of improving one, two, three, four, five, six or more (e.g., all) of erythrocyte function, turnover, or synthesis; hemoglobin function, turnover, or synthesis; or vascular function, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a composition (e.g., an Active Moiety) comprising:</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">a) a leucine amino acid entity,</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">b) a arginine amino acid entity, and</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">c) a N-acetylcysteine (Nac)-entity;</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">wherein the composition does not comprise a peptide of more than 20 amino acid residues in length (e.g., whey protein), or if a peptide of more than 20 amino acid residues in length is present, the peptide is present at less than: 10 wt. % of the total wt. of the composition (e.g., in dry form); and</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">wherein the composition does not comprise glutamine, or if glutamine is present, the glutamine is present at less than: 10 wt. %, 1 wt. %, 0.5 wt. %, 0.15 wt. %, 0.1 wt. %, 0.05 wt. %, 0.01 wt. %, or 0.001 wt. % of the total wt. of the composition (e.g., in dry form);</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">thereby improving one, two, three, four, five, six or more (e.g., all) of erythrocyte function, turnover, or synthesis; hemoglobin function, turnover, or synthesis; or vascular function in the subject.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect, the invention features a method of improving erythrocyte function comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a composition described herein.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, the invention features a method of improving erythrocyte turnover comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a composition described herein.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect, the invention features a method of improving erythrocyte synthesis comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a composition described herein.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another aspect, the invention features a method of improving hemoglobin function comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a composition described herein.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect, the invention features a method of improving hemoglobin turnover comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a composition described herein.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another aspect, the invention features a method of improving hemoglobin synthesis comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a composition described herein.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another aspect, the invention features a method of improving vascular function comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a composition described herein.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another aspect, the invention features a method of increasing RBC deformability relative to a control, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a composition described herein.

Physical and metabolic dysfunction of red blood cells (RBC) drives acute and chronic complications in nearly every organ system, such as in a hemoglobinopathy (e.g., sickle cell disease) or a thalassemia (e.g., &#x3b1;-thalassemia or (3-thalassemia). RBC dysfunction and lysis drive myriad clinical sequelae such as vaso-occlusion, organ failure, and infections. RBC dysfunction can be characterized by cell sickling, oxidative stress, dehydration, and adhesion to endothelium, which may complicate the passage of RBC through microvessels. Chronic complications can stem from a lifetime of anemia and accrual of organ damage into adulthood, and can be punctuated by acute events such as vaso-occlusion and sudden organ failure. The invention is based, in part, on the observation that glutamine increased levels of cell adhesion markers and only slightly reduced cell migration markers in the presence of TNF-&#x3b1; in an in vitro assay for sickle cell disease. Cell adhesion can contribute to vaso-occlusion during a sickling crisis. This observation was surprising because L-glutamine is the sole active ingredient in an oral powder indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients 5 years of age and older.</p><p id="p-0161" num="0316">The amino acid entities and relative amounts of the amino acid entities in the compositions disclosed herein have been optimized, e.g., to reduce vascular adhesion, mitigate the presentation of vascular inflammation, defend against insults to red blood cell (RBC) deformability and function, and reduce complications associated with SCD (e.g., hemolysis, vascular adhesion, vascular inflammation, reduced vascular function, acute and chronic organ failure) in a subject that requires the coordination of many biological, cellular and molecular processes. Without being bound by any theory, it is understood that a composition of the invention can reprogram the disordered multifactorial biology of RBC rigidity and fragility, hemolysis, vascular adhesion, vascular inflammation, and vascular dysfunction.</p><p id="p-0162" num="0317">The composition described herein provides a multimodal and combinatorial approach to improve red blood cell dysfunction, hemolysis (e.g., including anemia, chronic hypoxia, oxidative stress, depletion of nitric oxide, and/or vascular dysfunction), vaso-occlusion (e.g., including ischemic injury, inflammation, clotting, and/or acute organ damage), altered hematopoiesis, and/or sickle cell disease pathophysiology. In some embodiments, administration of the composition results in improved vascular tone, vascular dilation, and/or vaso-occlusion (e.g. improved NO availability, NO-dependent endothelial function, and/or blood pressure). In some embodiments, administration of the composition results in improved RBC deformability, reduced hemolysis, and/or reduced vascular inflammation (e.g., as determined by levels of glutathione (e.g., plasma or RBC glutathione), oxidative stress markers, hemolytic markers, cytokines, and/or adhesion markers). In some embodiments, administration of the composition results in increased protein synthesis and/or increased proteogenic substrates for hemoglobin to support heme synthesis. In some embodiments, administration of the composition results in improved hematopoiesis and/or an improved red blood cell population (e.g., improved reticulocytes, hemoglobin, fetal hemoglobin, and/or dense or irreversibly sickled cells). The composition described herein is optimized to target one, two, or three of: (i) restoration of plasma arginine and nitric oxide to improve vascular injury; (ii) improved antioxidant defense in red blood cells, plasma, and systems-wide; or (iii) anabolic and energetic support for increased hematopoietic demand, in a subject, e.g., a subject having a hemoglobinopathy (e.g., sickle cell disease) or a thalassemia (e.g., &#x3b1;-thalassemia or &#x3b2;-thalassemia).</p><p id="p-0163" num="0318">In some embodiments, the composition (e.g., the Active Moiety) is capable of improving one, two, three, four, or more (e.g., all) of NO-mediated vascular function, protein synthesis, cellular energy, inflammation, or heme synthesis. In some embodiments, the composition is capable of restoring NO-dependent endothelial function, reducing risk of vaso-occlusion events, improving vascular health, decreasing hemolysis, and/or decreasing oxidative stress. In some embodiments, the composition is capable of providing increased arginine bioavailability for NO synthesis. In some embodiments, the composition is capable of increasing RBC turnover, protein synthesis (e.g., hemoglobin synthesis, e.g., in hematopoietic progenitors and/or reticulocytes), and/or heme synthesis. In some embodiments, the composition is capable of providing energetic support for highly proliferative cells (e.g., hematopoietic precursors and/or immune cells).</p><p id="p-0164" num="0319">Described herein, in part, is a composition (an Active Moiety) comprising amino acid entities and methods of improving one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight or more (e.g., all) of erythrocyte function, turnover, or synthesis; hemoglobin function, turnover, or synthesis; vascular function; oxidative stress (e.g., one or both of blood and systemic oxidative stress); or inflammation by administering an effective amount of the composition. The composition may be administered to treat a hemoglobinopathy (e.g., sickle cell disease) or a thalassemia (e.g., &#x3b1;-thalassemia or &#x3b2;-thalassemia) in a subject in need thereof. The amino acid entities and relative amounts of the amino acid entities in the composition have been carefully selected, e.g., to improve erythrocyte and/or hemoglobin function, turnover, or synthesis in a subject (e.g., a subject having a hemoglobinopathy (e.g., SCD) or a thalassemia) that requires the coordination of many biological, cellular, and molecular processes. The composition allows for multi-pathway beneficial effects on the systems-level pathology of a hemoglobinopathy or a thalassemia. In particular, the composition has been specifically tailored to treat oxidative stress, vascular disease, inflammation, and the increased turnover, synthesis, and dysfunction of erythrocytes and hemoglobin.</p><p id="p-0165" num="0320">Complex diseases, such as hemoglobinopathy (e.g., sickle cell disease) or thalassemia (e.g., &#x3b1;-thalassemia or &#x3b2;-thalassemia), impact multiple biological pathways. Loss of health can be the direct result of metabolic pathways and functions that are not being maintained or supported. Consequently, restoring homeostasis and maintaining health requires multifactorial approaches. The compositions described herein are interventional candidates to address the systems-wide impact of dysregulated metabolism to support and maintain homeostasis, which helps support normal structures and functions of the body.</p><p id="p-0166" num="0321">The composition described herein have been optimized to directly and simultaneously target multiple metabolic pathways implicated both in complex diseases (e.g., a subject having a hemoglobinopathy (e.g., SCD) or a thalassemia) and overall health. The distinct ratios of each of the amino acid entities in the composition are designed to target and maximize the fundamental role of the composition in regulating multiple metabolic functions (e.g., one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight or more (e.g., all) of erythrocyte function, turnover, or synthesis; hemoglobin function, turnover, or synthesis; vascular function; oxidative stress (e.g., one or both of blood and systemic oxidative stress). In particular, the composition described herein can support and maintain blood health, which is critical to a multitude of metabolic functions throughout the body. The composition described herein has been designed to target multiple biological pathways with the goal of supporting normal structures and functions of the blood. In particular, administration of the composition described herein can improve and/or treat one, two, three, or more of reduced blood production, reduced blood integrity, plasma and/or RBC amino acid imbalance, decreased vascular health, or inflammation, e.g., in a subject with a hemoglobinopathy (e.g., sickle cell disease) or a thalassemia (e.g., &#x3b1;-thalassemia or &#x3b2;-thalassemia). In some embodiments, administration of the composition to a subject improves or maintains one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, or more of the following: (a) proliferation and/or maturation of blood cells during hematopoietic demand; (b) RBC form and/or function against dehydration; (c) rigidity; (d) oxygen transport; (e) amino acid balance to support RBC metabolism (e.g., substrates for glutathione and nitric oxide synthesis); (f) generation of ROS; (g) delivery of amino acids to peripheral tissue; (h) defenses against vascular adhesion; (i) inflammation; or (j) stasis.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Definitions</heading><p id="p-0167" num="0322">Terms used in the claims and specification are defined as set forth below unless otherwise specified.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0323">It must be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0324">As used herein, the term &#x201c;amino acid entity&#x201d; refers to a levo (L)-amino acid in free form or salt form (or both), the L-amino acid residue in a peptide smaller than 20 amino acid residues (e.g., oligopeptide, e.g., a dipeptide or a tripeptide), a derivative of the amino acid, a precursor of the amino acid, or a metabolite of the amino acid (see, e.g., Table 1). An amino acid entity includes a derivative of the amino acid, a precursor of the amino acid, a metabolite of the amino acid, or a salt form of the amino acid that is capable of effecting biological functionality of the free L-amino acid.

In some embodiments, LC-MS is used to determine the identity and/or amounts of pharmaceutical grade amino acid entities present at a sampling point or in a portion. In some embodiments, LC-MS is used to determine whether a dry blended preparation meets a standard for composition uniformity, e.g., portion or blend uniformity.

Exemplary government regulatory agencies include: Federal Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), SwissMedic, China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA), or Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), Health Canada, and Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). A product quality parameter can also be a parameter specified by a national or regional pharmacopeia or formulary, including the U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), British Pharmacopeia (BP), National Formulary (NF), European Pharmacopeia (EP), Japanese Pharmacopeia (JP), or the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH).</p><p id="p-0411" num="0593">The one or more reference standards may be a standard used or promulgated by the pharmaceutical industry or by agencies or entities, e.g., government or trade agencies or entities, regulating the pharmaceutical industry to ensure one or more product quality parameters are within acceptable ranges for a medicine, pharmaceutical composition, treatment, or other therapeutic. The one or more reference standards may be a standard used or set by a manufacturer of a combination (e.g., dry blended preparation, e.g., PGDBP), e.g., a manufacturer having approval from a governmental agency to market the PGDBP, to ensure one or more product quality parameters are within acceptable ranges for a supplement, nutraceutical, medicine, pharmaceutical composition, treatment, or other therapeutic. A product quality parameter can be any parameter regulated by the manufacturer, or by the pharmaceutical industry or by agencies or entities, e.g., government or trade agencies or entities, including but not limited to composition; composition uniformity; dosage; dosage uniformity; presence, absence, and/or level of contaminants or impurities; level of sterility (e.g., the presence, absence and/or level of microbes), color, or particle morphology (e.g., size or shape).</p><p id="p-0412" num="0594">Composition Uniformity</p><p id="p-0413" num="0595">In some embodiments, the reference standard is composition uniformity. Composition uniformity, in general, is a standard of homogeneity. Composition uniformity can be classified into two different but related types of uniformity: blend uniformity and portion uniformity (portion uniformity is used interchangeably with content uniformity and dosage uniformity herein). Composition uniformity may comprise one or both types depending on the usage and context. Composition uniformity may comprise a standard of the homogeneity of a combination (e.g., dry blended preparation, e.g., PGDBP) with regards to one or a plurality of components. In some embodiments, a combination that meets a standard for composition uniformity does so with regards to one, two, three, four, or more (e.g., all) components (e.g., pharmaceutical grade amino acid entities).</p><p id="p-0414" num="0596">Blend Uniformity</p><p id="p-0415" num="0597">Blend uniformity refers to the level of homogeneity of the distribution of components in a combination, e.g., dry blended preparation, e.g., PGDBP. In some embodiments, a standard for composition uniformity, e.g., blend uniformity, is met when the amount of a component (e.g., a pharmaceutical grade amino acid entity) at a first sampling point in the combination (e.g., dry blended preparation, e.g., PGDBP) differs by no more than a predetermined amount from a reference value. Amounts may be absolute, e.g., grams, or relative, e.g., weight/weight (e.g., X g of the component in Y g of sampling point). Amounts may be arbitrary values, as in the case of comparing absorbance values to absorbance values or in statistical comparisons of curves, e.g., of spectra. In some embodiments, acquiring a value for blend uniformity comprises assessing a standard for composition uniformity, e.g., blend uniformity, by acquiring a value for the amount of a component at a first sampling point in the combination and comparing it to reference value.</p><p id="p-0416" num="0598">In some embodiments, NIR is used to determine whether the amount of a component (e.g., a pharmaceutical grade amino acid entity) at a first sampling point in the combination (e.g., dry blended preparation, e.g., PGDBP) differs by no more than a predetermined amount from a second or further sampling. Using NIR, the near infrared spectrum for a sampling point can be acquired and compared to the near infrared spectrum for a second or further sampling point (e.g., a third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and/or tenth sampling point) or to the near infrared spectrum for a sample known to meet a reference standard, e.g., a standard for composition uniformity, e.g., blend uniformity. If the comparison shows that the spectra are similar enough to one another, a standard for blend uniformity is met. Similarity of NIR spectra can be evaluated by comparing the conformity index of sampling points. The conformity index is a value generated by the NIR spectra obtained, and the examples of conformity indices described are not an exhaustive list of all possible conformity indices. The conformity index may be the absorbance at a particular wavelength or wavelengths in the near infrared range. The conformity index may be the standard deviation of the average absorbance at a particular wavelength or wavelengths in the near infrared range at a plurality of sampling points. The key characteristic of the conformity index, whichever value is selected, is that the conformity indices of the sampling points accessed converge (in the case of absorbance at particular wavelength) or reduce (in the case of standard deviation) as blending/mixing time increases. For example, the conformity index may be selected to be a wavelength of X nm in the near infrared range. The absorbance at X nm will be measured at a plurality of sampling points at time points during blending. As blending continues, the absorbance at X nm at each sampling point will grow more similar to one another.</p><p id="p-0417" num="0599">In some embodiments, the reference value is the amount of the component at a second or further sampling point (e.g., a third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and/or tenth sampling point) sampling point in the combination (e.g., dry blended preparation, e.g., PGDBP). The second sampling or further sampling point (e.g., a third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and/or tenth sampling point) point may be a different spatial location in the combination, for example, samples can be collected from a set of predetermined, spread out spatial locations, e.g., a stratified sampling plan with predetermined sites to be sampled, e.g., to obtain samples that represent a variety of locations in the blender or mixer.</p><p id="p-0418" num="0600">In some embodiments, the second sampling point is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more minutes after the first sampling point. In some embodiments, multiple sampling points separated in time are taken throughout the process of manufacturing the dry blended preparation (e.g., PGDBP). In some embodiments, the sampling points separated in time are at intervals throughout the process of manufacturing the dry blended preparation (e.g., PGDBP), e.g., every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 minutes. In some embodiments, the multiple sampling points are compared to one another (e.g., the most recent sampling points are compared to each other).</p><p id="p-0419" num="0601">In some embodiments, a standard for composition uniformity, e.g., blend uniformity, is met when the amount of the component at a first sampling point differs from the reference value, e.g., the amount of the component at a second or further sampling point (e.g., a third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and/or tenth sampling point) by less than or equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10%, e.g., 10%. In some embodiments, a standard for composition uniformity is met when the amount of a component at a first sampling differs by no more than 10% from the amount of the component at a second or further sampling point (e.g., a third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, and/or tenth sampling point). In some embodiments, a standard for composition uniformity is met when the amount of a component at a first sampling differs by no more than 10% from the amount of the component present in the combination (e.g., dry blended preparation, e.g., PGDBP). In some embodiments, a standard for composition uniformity is met when the amount of a component at the most recent sampling point differs by no more than 10% from the amount of the component present at the next most recent sampling point. Values for the amount of a component present at a sampling point can comprise NIR spectra. Comparisons of values for the amount of a component present at a first, second, or further sampling point can comprise comparison of NIR spectra, e.g., overlaying NIR spectra or comparing conformity indices of the first, second, or further sampling points. Blend uniformity can be met when NIR spectra, e.g., conformity indices, reach a threshold of similarity or overlap.</p><p id="p-0420" num="0602">Portion Uniformity</p><p id="p-0421" num="0603">Portion uniformity refers to the homogeneity of portions of the dry blended preparation, e.g., PGDBP, with respect to amounts of components (e.g., pharmaceutical grade amino acid entities).

Cells were washed once with 150 &#x3bc;l DPBS and viability was assessed using the WST-8 Cell Proliferation Cytotoxicity Assay (Dojindo). Following the assay, cells were washed twice with 150 &#x3bc;l PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min followed by two additional washes with 150 &#x3bc;l PBS. Protein levels in supernatant samples were analyzed by ELISA for IL-6 and TNF&#x3b1; using commercially available kits (R&#x26;D Systems) according to manufacturer-supplied protocols.

Amino Acid Profiling of Erythrocytes</heading><p id="p-0472" num="0650">Concentration differences in plasma and erythrocyte amino acids in sickle cell disease have been described and are thought to contribute to endothelial dysfunction. For example, release of erythrocyte arginase through hemolysis has been described to contribute to lower plasma arginine, contribute to limited bioavailability of this amino acid and a pathological state of nitric oxide (NO) resistance (Morris et al. 2005). Metabolomics studies have also identified amino acid level and pathway dysregulation, hypothesized to contribute to disease pathology (Darghouth et al. 2011).</p><p id="p-0473" num="0651">Plasma and erythrocyte amino acids, as well as oxidized and reduced glutathione, will be analyzed in sickle cell disease patient whole blood samples (IRB approval, Boston Children's Hospital) as well as in whole blood from race-matched healthy controls.

Adhesion Biomarkers</heading><p id="p-0474" num="0652">The hallmark of sickle cell disease is the &#x201c;sickle cell crisis,&#x201d; caused by vaso-occlusion of small blood vessels that lead to ischemic injuries and severe pain. A number of factors conspire toward vaso-occlusion: increased rigidity and adhesion of sickle RBCs make them more likely to stick to circulating WBCs and the vascular endothelium; increased arginase from hemolysis depletes free plasma arginine necessary to generate nitric oxide (NO), impairing vasodilation. Sickle cell crises are the primary reason that patients seek medical care, and can be life threatening as they can occur in any organ and last for several days. Crises in the pulmonary vasculature manifest as &#x201c;acute chest syndrome;&#x201d; those in the brain can cause stroke or &#x201c;silent&#x201d; cerebral infarcts; those in bone can lead to osteonecrosis; and crises elsewhere can lead to damage and failure in nearly any organ. Sickling leads to physical disruption and increased turnover of the erythrocyte membrane, increased cell rigidity, cell dehydration through loss of potassium, and increased RBC adhesion via externalization of phosphatidylserine. Red blood cell adhesion to leukocytes and to vascular endothelial cells, mediated by increased phosphatidylserine exposure, is among the mechanisms of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease, and measurement of phosphatidylserine exposure correlates well with other assays of adhesion such as erythrocyte adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells.</p><p id="p-0475" num="0653">Phosphatidyl serine exposure will be measured by binding of Annexin V conjugated to the fluorescent probe Alexa 488 (Life Technologies), either in untreated sickle cell disease patient blood (IRB approval, Boston Children's Hospital), healthy control donor blood (Research Blood Components) under untreated conditions or when treated with a disease-pathology-relevant stimulus known to provoke phosphatidylserine exposure such as hypoxia or the calcium ionophore 4-br A23187 (Millipore Sigma).

induced ICAM-1 expression levels in HLMVEC cells. Gly, CitNac and Nac also reduced levels of ICAM-1 expression to a lesser extent. HLMVEC cells treated with RCitNacQCarLHKVS and RCitNacQCar moderately reduced TNF&#x3b1; induced ICAM-1 expression levels. RCitNac, Nac, Gly, and CitNac greatly reduced VCAM-1 expression in HLMVEC cells. RCitNacQCarLHKVS, had a moderate effect on VCAM-1 expression in these cells, as did Cit, and Car. Q alone increased ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.</p><p id="p-0509" num="0684">Summary of results: As described, an ideal treatment is one that addresses the multifactorial pathology of SCD as represented by HLMVEC by reducing disease phenotypes (VCAM1, ICAM1, IL6). The ability of single amino acids and combinations to simultaneously impact these phenotypes was measured by a META-rank score (Tables 17 and 18). META-rank score is a composite measure that considers the optimal impact on all 3 phenotypes (e.g. decrease VCAM1, ICAM1, and IL6) in the HLMVEC model. An optimal amino acid or combination treatment (i.e. treatment that has the desired effect on all measures) has a lower score than a sub-optimal treatment (i.e. treatment has an undesirable effect on all measures). Based on META-rank the RCitNac was the optimal treatment, and the combinations RCitNacQCar and RCitNacQCarLHKVS were among the optimal treatment conditions. In addition, results with Q alone suggest that a RNacCitCarLHKVS-containing composition that excludes or comprises a limited amount of Q would be effective in reducing HLMVEC phenotypes (e.g., VCAM1, ICAM1, and/or IL-6).</p><heading id="h-0018" level="1">Example 10.

Amino acid treatments reducing soluble adhesion marker levels are highly desirable for improving adhesion biology in endothelial disorders. sICAM-1 level was reduced by 25% in HLMVECs when RCitNacQCarLKHVS amino acids were co-treated with 0.5 ng/mL TNF-&#x3b1; relative to the control. Upon removing L-glutamine (or Q) from this above combination a further 12% reduction was noted, suggesting potential benefit of either eliminating or limiting amount of Q toward improving adhesion response. In other words, presence of Q in amino acid treatments may not reduce adhesion biomarkers. Additional confirmation of the inability of Q to reduce adhesion is shown by its single agent co-treatment with TNF-&#x3b1; that failed to reduce sICAM-1 levels. The directional response or trend for these amino acid co-treatments was similar at higher TNF-&#x3b1; concentration 25 ng/mL as well with an exception of Q single agent that surprisingly increased sICAM-1 level by 142% instead of lowering the biomarker, suggesting a potential untoward or detrimental effect of Q to human physiology in diseases particularly with elevated cytokine levels where sICAM-1 levels spike during immune flare or cytokine storm (Sousa A, et al, Dis Markers 2015:747036). Another treatment, namely RCitNacCar, significantly reduced sICAM-1 (53%) at low TNF-&#x3b1; concentration however in the presence of Q this amino acid combination (RCitNacQCar) failed to reduce sICAM-1 which was again consistent with the above Q-containing combination RCitNacQCarLKHVS.</p><p id="p-0546" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00022" num="00022"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 21</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Adhesion marker sICAM-1 in HLMVEC/TNF-&#x3b1; model</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="105pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="154pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>sICAM-1 expression relative to TNF Control</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Amino Acid</entry><entry>TNF Conc</entry><entry>Mean %</entry><entry>Std.</entry><entry>Number of</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Supplement</entry><entry>(ng/mL)</entry><entry>Change</entry><entry>Deviation</entry><entry>values</entry><entry>P-value**</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>RCitNacQCar</entry><entry>0.5</entry><entry>4.491665</entry><entry>17.52376</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>0.752427263</entry></row><row><entry>RCitNacCarLKHVS</entry><entry>0.5</entry><entry>&#x2212;37.3698</entry><entry>1.869053</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>0.001927051</entry></row><row><entry>Q</entry><entry>0.5</entry><entry>5.573351</entry><entry>4.655257</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>0.246005225</entry></row><row><entry>RCitNacCar</entry><entry>0.5</entry><entry>&#x2212;53.4306</entry><entry>5.452768</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>0.005495371</entry></row><row><entry>RCitNacCarLKHVSQ</entry><entry>0.5</entry><entry>&#x2212;25.2971</entry><entry>5.286129</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>0.022535187</entry></row><row><entry>RCitNacQCar</entry><entry>25</entry><entry>63.391</entry><entry>39.99675</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>0.154359614</entry></row><row><entry>RCitNacCarLKHVS</entry><entry>25</entry><entry>&#x2212;35.2642</entry><entry>14.91163</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>0.079324062</entry></row><row><entry>Q</entry><entry>25</entry><entry>142.4986</entry><entry>25.38256</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>0.015523748</entry></row><row><entry>RCitNacCar</entry><entry>25</entry><entry>&#x2212;17.599</entry><entry>6.971693</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>0.071794294</entry></row><row><entry>RCitNacCarLKHVSQ</entry><entry>25</entry><entry>&#x2212;3.1149</entry><entry>15.59689</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>0.804602309</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0547" num="0719">Table 22 shows mean percent change in sVCAM-1, another marker of endothelial cell activation.

Statistical analysis was done using one-way ANOVA two sample t-test.</p><p id="p-0558" num="0727">Results</p><p id="p-0559" num="0728">Table 25 shows mean percent change in oxygen consumption rate (OCR) or maximal respiration for described amino acid treatments relative to the corresponding TNF-&#x3b1; control including standard deviations and p values for the comparisons. Amino acid treatments that increase and/or sustain increase in mitochondrial oxygen consumption especially in the presence of cytokine co-treatments indicate a boost or support to mitochondrial respiration/metabolism under inflammatory duress and are therefore considered favorable for metabolic health of microvascular endothelial cells. These results suggest that RCitNacQCarLKHVS best supports maximal respiration by increasing OCR by &#x2dc;110% when compared to the TNF-&#x3b1; control. And removal of Q from this combination reduced mitochondrial performance by &#x2dc;2.5-fold, while Q single agent did not support oxygen consumption at either TNF-&#x3b1; concentration and in fact appeared to get worse at the higher TNF-&#x3b1; concentration of 25 ng/mL. This data shows a surprising and unexpected role of Q as a single agent and RCitNacCarLKHVS amino acids when combined (RCitNacQCarLKHVS) to improve mitochondrial metabolism in endothelial cells since neither individually showed benefit compared to the control.</p><p id="p-0560" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00026" num="00026"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 25</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate in HLMVEC/TNF-&#x3b1; model</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="2"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="105pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="154pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Maximal respiration (OCR) relative to TNF Control</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Amino Acid</entry><entry>TNF Conc</entry><entry>Mean %</entry><entry>Std.</entry><entry>Number of</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Supplement</entry><entry>(ng/mL)</entry><entry>Change</entry><entry>Deviation</entry><entry>values</entry><entry>P-value**</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="70pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>RCitNacCarLKHVSQ</entry><entry>0.5</entry><entry>109.352</entry><entry>98.44061</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>0.109643</entry></row><row><entry>RCitNacCarLKHVS</entry><entry>0.5</entry><entry>&#x2212;20.6273</entry><entry>38.21671</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>0.409442</entry></row><row><entry>Q</entry><entry>0.5</entry><entry>&#x2212;47.7527</entry><entry>15.02554</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>0.11924</entry></row><row><entry>RCitNacCarLKHVSQ</entry><entry>25</entry><entry>79.89473</entry><entry>48.56108</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>0.012394</entry></row><row><entry>RCitNacCarLKHVS</entry><entry>25</entry><entry>&#x2212;8.43519</entry><entry>59.72999</entry><entry>4</entry><entry>0.978266</entry></row><row><entry>Q</entry><entry>25</entry><entry>&#x2212;27.9927</entry><entry>70.71826</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>0.402579</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0026" level="1">SUMMARY OF EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0561" num="0729">Sickle cell disease is complex and driven by a multitude of unique mechanisms. Maintaining blood health and function requires coordination of many biological, cellular and molecular processes. As shown in the Examples herein, the amino acid compositions disclosed in this application (including LRQNacHKVSCitCar, RCitNacQCar, and RCitNac) were able to [1] mitigate inflammatory cytokines in human vascular endothelial cells, [2] reduce cellular adhesion molecule expression in human vascular endothelial cells, and [3] protect against insults to human RBC deformability, whereas compositions such as Q, RCit, and Nac were only able to influence some, but not all of those important processes required for maintaining blood health. In fact, glutamine (Q)&#x2014;which is FDA approved for the treatment of sickle cell disease&#x2014;displayed negative or undesirable effects in particular assays herein that are mitigated in combinations.</p><p id="p-0562" num="0730">Results with Q alone suggest that compositions comprising RCitNac but excluding Q, or those such as LRQNacHKVSCitCar, RCitNacQCar that comprise lower amounts of Q would also be useful in [1] mitigating inflammatory cytokines in human vascular endothelial cells, [2] reducing cellular adhesion molecule expression in human vascular endothelial cells, and [3] protecting against insults to human RBC deformability. In compositions comprising LRQNacHKVSCitCar or RCitNacQCar, the exclusion or reduction of Q would yield important benefits in material costs for production; and/or reduction of overall amino acid/nitrogen load which would be beneficial for pediatric and at-risk populations such as those dealing with liver and kidney disease.</p><p id="p-0563" num="0731">Combined results from Tables 21-25 demonstrate the benefit of specific amino acid compositions disclosed herein towards adhesion, inflammation, and mitochondrial metabolism in endothelial biology. Removal from or absence of Q in amino acid combinations helps lower sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 biomarkers to improve adhesion response when triggered by cytokines such as TNF-&#x3b1; that simulate disease state in the model. However, the presence or inclusion of Q in the large amino acid combination RCitNacQCarLKHVS significantly lowers inflammatory markers MCP-1 and IL-6 and boosts mitochondrial respiration (OCR), suggesting specific and non-redundant roles of amino acids especially in combinations to affect different biology nodes in vascular endothelial health and disease.</p><p id="p-0564" num="0732">While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment and various alternate embodiments, it will be understood by persons skilled in the relevant art that various changes in form and details can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p><p id="p-0565" num="0733">All references, issued patents, and patent applications cited within the body of the instant specification are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety, for all purposes.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
