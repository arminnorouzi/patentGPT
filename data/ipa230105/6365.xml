However, interference between the orthogonally-polarized-channels is inevitable, and can lead to crosstalk among the channels and symbols comprising data streams, thereby causing an increase in bit error rate (BER) on the receiving end of the wireless communications system. Furthermore, in conventional wireless transceivers that can establish two-way communications to and from satellites, transmit antennas and receive antennas can be arranged on separate antenna panels. In this conventional approach, the transmit panel and the receive panel can be oriented and adjusted separately so that both panels can align precisely with, for example, a target satellite. However, in this conventional approach, wireless transceivers would have a large size due to two separate antenna panels, and would also require a large number of processing elements and complex routing networks to coordinate the transmission and reception operations, which can lead to undesirable signal delays, and high implementation cost and complexity.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a compact wireless transceiver that can effectively increase signal isolation and reduce bit error rate.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure is directed to a wireless transceiver having receive antennas and transmit antennas with orthogonal polarizations in a phased array antenna panel, substantially as shown in and/or described in connection with at least one of the figures, and as set forth in the claims.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a functional block diagram of a portion of an exemplary wireless transceiver according to one implementation of the present application.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates a functional block diagram of a portion of an exemplary wireless transceiver according to one implementation of the present application.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates a top plan view of a portion of a phased array antenna panel of an exemplary wireless transceiver according to one implementation of the present application.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates a top plan view of a portion of a phased array antenna panel of an exemplary wireless transceiver according to one implementation of the present application.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates a top plan view of a portion of a phased array antenna panel of an exemplary wireless transceiver according to one implementation of the present application.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> illustrates a top plan view of a portion of a phased array antenna panel of an exemplary wireless transceiver according to one implementation of the present application.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> illustrates a functional block diagram of a portion of an exemplary wireless transceiver according to one implementation of the present application.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrates a functional block diagram of a portion of an exemplary wireless transceiver according to one implementation of the present application.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> illustrates a top plan view of a portion of a phased array antenna panel of an exemplary wireless transceiver according to one implementation of the present application.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exemplary wireless communications system utilizing exemplary wireless transceivers according to one implementation of the present application.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following description contains specific information pertaining to implementations in the present disclosure.

In addition, in contrast to conventional communications systems where orthogonally-polarized-channels occupying the same RF frequency band are utilized for transmission/reception, because implementations of the present application utilize only one polarization for transmission and only an orthogonal polarization for reception, interference among transmit and/or receive signals can also be effectively eliminated, thereby substantially reducing the bit error rate of the wireless transceiver.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the present implementation, each of receive antennas <b>112</b><i>a </i>through <b>112</b><i>z </i>is a linear-polarization receive antenna of a first polarization, while each of transmit antennas <b>114</b><i>a </i>through <b>114</b><i>z </i>is a linear-polarization transmit antenna of a second polarization that is orthogonal to the first polarization.

These dimensions can also be used to receive signals at 10 GHz. In another implementation, each of reconfigurable receive/transmit antennas <b>316</b><i>a </i>through <b>316</b><i>z </i>in phased array antenna panel <b>302</b> may be configured to transmit or receive signals in the 60 GHz frequency range using much smaller antenna sizes.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the present implementation, phased array antenna panel <b>302</b> is a flat panel array employing reconfigurable receive/transmit antennas <b>316</b><i>a </i>through <b>316</b><i>z</i>, where phased array antenna panel <b>202</b> is coupled to associated active circuits to form beams for reception and transmission. In one implementation, the reception beam is formed fully electronically by means of phase and amplitude control circuits, for example, in RF front end circuits (such as RF front end chips <b>307</b><i>a </i>and <b>307</b><i>x </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) associated with reconfigurable receive/transmit antennas <b>316</b><i>a </i>through <b>316</b><i>z</i>.

It should be understood that car <b>403</b><i>a</i>, recreational vehicle <b>403</b><i>b </i>and airplane <b>403</b><i>c </i>may each be moving, thereby causing a change in position of corresponding wireless transceivers <b>401</b><i>a </i>through <b>401</b><i>c</i>.
