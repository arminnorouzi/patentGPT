The electromagnetic valve may be applied for switching the flow path of the working fluid. In this case, it is required to prevent leakage of the working fluid.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, a pressure of the working fluid may fluctuate at a downstream of the electromagnetic valve. In this case, it is desirable to prevent leakage of the working fluid. Further improvements are required for electromagnetic valves and fluid systems including electromagnetic valves in the above-mentioned aspects or in other aspects not mentioned.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A first disclosure comprises: a coil which is magnetized if energized; a core which is arranged in a magnetic circuit of the coil; a plunger which is arranged in the magnetic circuit of the coil opposed to the core via a magnetic gap; a valve member which is movable with the plunger; and a normally close compression spring which urges the valve member toward a side to a normally close valve seat. Since the electromagnetic valve moves the valve member by using a coil magnetization force generated by energizing the coil, the normally close valve seat is closed by the valve member during it is not energized.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, it comprises a valve body which includes: an inflow passage of the working fluid; an outflow passage of the working fluid; a normally close valve seat which is formed between the inflow passage and the outflow passage and is come into contact with the valve member; and a pressure relief passage communicating the inflow passage and the outflow passage by bypassing the normally close valve seat. According to the first disclosure, even if the normally close valve seat is closed, it is possible to communicate the inflow passage and the outflow passage by the pressure relief passage.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the first disclosure, a pressure relief valve is arranged in a portion of the pressure relief passage in the valve body. The pressure relief valve closes the pressure relief passage, if a pressure of the working fluid in the outflow passage is lower than, is equal to, and is higher by a pressure difference less than a predetermined relief pressure than a pressure of the working fluid in the inflow passage. The pressure relief valve opens the pressure relief passage, if the pressure of the working fluid in the outflow passage is higher by a pressure difference equal to or higher than the relief pressure than a pressure of the working fluid in the inflow passage.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to the first disclosure, by opening the pressure relief valve, it is possible to prevent the pressure of the working fluid in the outflow passage from becoming higher than the predetermined relief pressure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A second disclosure includes two outflow passages, a normally close outflow passage and a normally open outflow passage. A normally close valve seat and a normally open valve seat are formed on the valve body.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the second disclosure, the working fluid from the inflow passage flows to the normally close outflow passage when the coil is energized, and the working fluid flows to the normally open outflow passage when the coil is not energized. This makes it possible to switch the flow of the working fluid depending on whether the coil is energized or de-energized.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a third disclosure, a passage cross-sectional area of the pressure relief passage is smaller than passage cross-sectional areas of the inflow passage and the outflow passage. The pressure relief passage may be sufficient as long as it can release the pressure, and it is not necessary to enable a large flow amount of the working fluid. By reducing the cross-sectional area of the passage, the valve body can be miniaturized.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">A fourth disclosure relates to a structure of the pressure relief valve. The pressure release valve includes: a pressure relief valve seat formed in the pressure relief passage; the pressure relief valve member arranged in a side to the inflow passage of the pressure relief valve seat; and a pressure relief spring urges the pressure relief valve member toward a side to the pressure release valve seat. An pressure relief operation is available by a simple structure by urging the pressure relief valve member against the pressure relief valve seat.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A fifth disclosure also relates to a structure of the pressure relief valve. The pressure relief passage is in a circular and tubular shape, the pressure relief valve member is a columnar shape which slides in the pressure relief passage in the circular and tubular shape, and the pressure relief valve member has a pressure relief groove formed on a peripheral surface of the columnar shape.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Since the pressure relief valve member is guided by the pressure relief passage, the pressure relief valve member can be smoothly moved. In the state that the pressure relief valve member is separated from the pressure relief valve seat, the pressure of the working fluid can be released by the pressure relief groove.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">A sixth disclosure also relates to a structure of the pressure relief valve. A duck bill valve having a slit at a tip end is used as the pressure relief valve. A pressure relief valve can be configured with a simpler structure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Seventh disclosure is a fluid system that includes the electromagnetic valve. The fluid system comprises: a tank for the working fluid; a pump which sucks the working fluid from the tank and discharges the working fluid in a high pressure; a pipe through which the working fluid from the pump flows; a stop valve which is arranged in the pipe, opens the pipe if the pressure of the working fluid in the pipe is equal to or higher than an open pressure and closes the pipe if the pressure of the working fluid in the pipe is less than the open pressure; and the electromagnetic valve described above. The electromagnetic valve is located between the pump and the stop valve.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A relief pressure of the pressure relief valve of the electromagnetic valve is set to be smaller than an open pressure of the stop valve. In this fluid system, a pressure of the working fluid in the pipe is always kept less than the open pressure. As a result, it is possible to prevent an unintended leakage of the working fluid.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating a piping configuration of an electromagnetic valve.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the electromagnetic valve of a first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of the electromagnetic valve illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a line IV-IV in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a perspective view of a valve member illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a top view of the valve member illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a perspective view of a pressure relief valve member illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a top view of the pressure relief valve member illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an electromagnetic valve of a second embodiment.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the electromagnetic valve of a third embodiment.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a perspective view of a duck-bill valve illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an electromagnetic valve of a fourth embodiment.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along a line XIII-XIII of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an electromagnetic valve of a fifth embodiment.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an electromagnetic valve of a sixth embodiment.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an electromagnetic valve of a seventh embodiment.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an electromagnetic valve of an eighth embodiment.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating another piping configuration of an electromagnetic valve.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of an electromagnetic valve of a ninth embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">JP2014-66309A discloses a comparative example.

The fluid system controls a behavior of the working fluid in the pipe <b>102</b>. The fluid system provides a control device which controls the behavior of the working fluid, including the pressure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a fluid system in a vehicle washer system. The fluid system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> uses a three-way valve which switches flow paths as the electromagnetic valve <b>200</b> (EMV). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the washer fluid in the tank <b>110</b> is pressurized by the pump <b>120</b> and supplied to the electromagnetic valve <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">A stop valve <b>101</b>, which opens at a constant pressure, is arranged in front of a nozzle <b>100</b> (NZL), which injects the washer fluid. The stop valve <b>101</b> is arranged in a pipe <b>102</b> between the electromagnetic valve <b>200</b> and a nozzle <b>100</b>. The stop valve <b>101</b> opens the pipe when the pressure of the working fluid in the pipe <b>102</b> is equal to or higher than the open pressure. The stop valve <b>101</b> closes the pipe when the pressure of the working fluid in the pipe <b>102</b> is less than the open pressure. The stop valve <b>101</b> has a setting member such as a spring for setting the open pressure. The washer fluid is trapped in the pipe <b>102</b> by the stop valve <b>101</b>, and it is possible to improve a responsiveness at a next operation.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The electromagnetic valve disclosed in JP2014-66309A may be used as the electromagnetic valve <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.

Pumped washer fluid flows into the inflow passage <b>222</b>, and then flows out from the normally open outflow passage <b>223</b> via the communication hole <b>226</b>, the valve chamber <b>225</b>, and the normally open valve seat <b>227</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">The washer fluid of the electromagnetic valve <b>200</b> is injected from the nozzle <b>100</b> via the normally open pipe <b>102</b><i>b</i>. Since the pressure of the washer fluid rises to about 400 Kilopascals, the open pressure of the stop valve <b>101</b> (about 10 kilopascals) is hardly a problem.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">If the cleaning of the camera <b>131</b> is completed, the operation of the pump <b>120</b> is stopped. Since the pressure in the pipe <b>102</b> becomes atmospheric pressure when the pump is stopped, the pipe <b>102</b> is closed by the stop valve <b>101</b>. By closing the stop valve <b>101</b>, it is possible to improve a sharp liquid shut off property in response to an end of injection. In addition, the stop valve <b>101</b> can block a backflow of air and store the washer fluid in the pipe <b>102</b>. As a result, the washer fluid is rapidly injected at the next operation. In other words, it is possible to improve a responsiveness of an injection device for the washer fluid.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the case that the washer fluid is injected onto the rear window glass <b>130</b>, the electromagnetic valve <b>200</b> is energized. The coil <b>205</b> is excited by energization to form a magnetic circuit that passes through the yoke <b>201</b>, the core <b>206</b>, the plunger <b>209</b>, and the stator <b>211</b>. The plunger <b>209</b> moves to a side to the core <b>206</b> against the compressive force of the normally close compression spring <b>207</b>, the magnetic gap between the tapered portion of the core <b>206</b> and the tapered portion of the plunger <b>209</b> is narrowed by the magnetic force.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">As the plunger <b>209</b> moves, the valve member <b>214</b> is urged up by the normally open compression spring <b>231</b> to close the normally open valve seat <b>227</b>. The operation of the electromagnetic valve <b>200</b> described above is performed before the start of operation of the pump <b>120</b>. Therefore, a pressure of the high-pressure washer fluid from the pump <b>120</b> is not applied to the valve member <b>214</b>, and the movement of the valve member <b>214</b> is not hindered.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">The valve member <b>214</b> is a spherical shape, and the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> also has a concave tapered shape corresponding to the valve member <b>214</b>. In other words, the surfaces of the valve member <b>214</b> and the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> are surfaces of a rotating body which may demonstrate self-alignment functions with each other. Therefore, even if the central axis of the valve member <b>214</b> is slightly displaced due to the extension of the normally open compression spring <b>231</b>, the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> can be reliably sealed. In particular, since the valve member <b>214</b> is made of rubber, it can be brought into close contact with the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> by its own elasticity, and the sealing property can be further improved.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">After energizing the electromagnetic valve <b>200</b> to switch the flow paths, the operation of the pump <b>120</b> is started. The high-pressure washer fluid from the pump <b>120</b> flows into the inflow passage <b>222</b>, and then flows out from the normally close outflow passage <b>228</b> via the communication hole <b>226</b>, the valve chamber <b>225</b>, and the normally close valve seat <b>229</b>. An outflowing washer fluid flows through the normally close pipe <b>102</b><i>a </i>and the stop valve <b>101</b>, and is injected from the nozzle <b>100</b> to the rear window glass <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">If the cleaning of the rear window glass <b>130</b> is completed, the operation of the pump <b>120</b> is stopped. If the pressure in the normally close pipe <b>102</b><i>a </i>drops below the open pressure of the stop valve <b>101</b>, the stop valve <b>101</b> also closes. Subsequently, the energization of the electromagnetic valve <b>200</b> is also terminated. Since the washer <b>208</b> made of a non-magnetic material is interposed between the core <b>206</b> and the plunger <b>209</b>, the plunger <b>209</b> is urged down by the normally close compression spring <b>207</b> in response to a finish of energization.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">Since an urging force of the normally close compression spring <b>207</b> is larger than an urging force of the normally open compression spring <b>231</b>, the valve member <b>214</b> is urged against the normally close valve seat <b>229</b>. Since the normally close valve seat <b>229</b> also has a tapered shape corresponding to the spherical shape of the valve member <b>214</b>, it can be reliably sealed like the above-mentioned normally open valve seat <b>227</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">According to this embodiment, the valve member <b>214</b> has a three-dimensional shape which is convex on both sides. Further, the valve member <b>214</b> is arranged so as to fit within the tapered shape of the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> and the normally close valve seat <b>229</b>. Therefore, it is not necessary to provide a guide for the valve member <b>214</b>, and an assembly work of the valve member <b>214</b> becomes easy. That is, even if an axis of the valve member <b>214</b> is slightly displaced due to an influence of the normally open compression spring <b>231</b> and a flow of the washer fluid, the displacement of the valve member <b>214</b> is within a range of the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> and the normally close valve seat <b>229</b>. Therefore, the valve member <b>214</b> is urged against the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> or the normally close valve seat <b>229</b> by the normally close compression spring <b>207</b> and a pressure of the washer fluid. Since both the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> and the normally closed valve seat <b>229</b> have a tapered shape, the valve member <b>214</b> is guided by the tapered shape. As a result, the valve member <b>214</b> comes into contact with the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> or the normally close valve seat <b>229</b> on the entire circumference thereof.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">When the ambient temperature rises while the operation of the pump <b>120</b> is completed, the washer fluid and air in the pipe <b>102</b> expand. The normally open pipe <b>102</b><i>b </i>is closed by the stop valve <b>101</b>, but since the normally open valve seat <b>227</b> is open, the pressure due to expansion is released to a side to the pump <b>120</b> and does not become excessively high. However, in the normally close pipe <b>102</b><i>a</i>, both the normally close valve seat <b>229</b> and the stop valve <b>101</b> are closed. Therefore, the washer fluid is trapped in the normally close pipe <b>102</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, the pressure in the normally close pipe <b>102</b><i>a </i>may rise excessively due to an expansion of the washer fluid and the air.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">If the pressure rises equal to or higher than the open pressure of the stop valve <b>101</b>, the washer fluid in the normally close pipe <b>102</b><i>a </i>may leak from the nozzle <b>100</b> to the rear window glass <b>130</b>. However, according to this embodiment, the pressure relief valve <b>233</b> is opened to release the pressure, so that the leakage of the washer fluid can be reliably prevented.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">If the pressure in the normally close pipe <b>102</b><i>a </i>becomes higher than the relief pressure, it lifts the pressure relief valve member <b>217</b> by overcoming an urging force of the pressure relief spring <b>216</b>. As a result, the pressure relief valve seat <b>218</b> is opened and the pressure relief passage <b>232</b> is opened. The normally close outflow passage <b>228</b> communicates with the inflow passage <b>222</b> via the pressure relief groove <b>217</b><i>a </i>of the pressure relief valve member <b>217</b> and the pressure relief guide <b>234</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">The relief pressure of the pressure relief valve <b>233</b> is about half of the open pressure of the stop valve <b>101</b>. Therefore, by opening the pressure relief valve <b>233</b> before the stop valve <b>101</b> opens, it is possible to suppress an increase in pressure in the normally close pipe <b>102</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Here, since the pressure relief passage <b>232</b> releases the pressure of a trapped part of the washer fluid, a large amount of the washer fluid does not flow in the pressure relief passage <b>232</b>. A passage cross-sectional area of the pressure relief passage <b>232</b> is smaller than passage cross-sectional areas of the inflow passage <b>222</b> and the outflow passage <b>223</b> and <b>228</b>. Therefore, even if there is a portion having a small flow path cross-sectional area (passage cross-sectional area) such as the pressure relief groove <b>217</b><i>a</i>, no malfunction occurs in an operation.
