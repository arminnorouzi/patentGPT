Overview</heading><p id="p-0026" num="0025">A feedback divider block of a fractional-N phase locked loop (PLL) provided according to an aspect of the present disclosure contains a division circuitry and a division factor generator. The division circuitry is designed to divide an output clock of the PLL by a sequence of divisor values to generate a feedback clock, wherein each divisor value is an integer. The division factor generator is designed to generate the sequence of divisor values, wherein the division factor generator contains a splitter and a modulator core.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The splitter is designed to generate a corresponding integer portion and a corresponding residue portion, the sum of which equals a sum of a compensation factor (used to compensate for the effects of unequal successive time periods of a reference clock) and the desired division factor (which determines the frequency of the output clock). The modulator core is designed to generate a respective logic stream of integers corresponding to each residue portion, wherein the logic stream of integers represent a magnitude of the residue portion in a density domain, wherein each integer of the logic stream is added to the corresponding integer portion to generate a corresponding divisor value of the sequence of divisor values.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an embodiment, the integer portion contains all of the integer value of the sum noted above. The modulator core may be realized by a delta-sigma modulator (DSM) having a signal transfer function (STF), wherein the STF always generates only an integer value as an output in response to an integer value received as input.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In another embodiment, MASH-111 DSM is used, whose STF is a delay value (e.g., Z<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>). The division factor generator may accordingly include a delay unit to implement the delay value thereby causing the corresponding integer portion to be delayed by the delay value instead of being processed by the modulator core.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Several aspects of the present disclosure are described below with reference to examples for illustration. However, one skilled in the relevant art will recognize that the disclosure can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other methods, components, materials and so forth. In other instances, well known structures, materials, or operations are not shown in detail to avoid obscuring the features of the disclosure. Furthermore, the features/aspects described can be practiced in various combinations, though only some of the combinations are described herein for conciseness.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="1">2. Example Device</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of a phase locked loop (PLL). PLL <b>100</b> is shown containing crystal oscillator (XO) <b>105</b>, buffer <b>110</b>, delay element (Td) <b>115</b>, XNOR gate <b>120</b>, phase detector (PD) <b>125</b>, charge pump (XP) <b>130</b>, low-pass filter (LPF) <b>135</b>, voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) <b>140</b>, frequency dividers <b>150</b> (DIVO<b>1</b>) and <b>155</b> (DIVO<b>2</b>), and fractional-N frequency divider block <b>170</b>. Block <b>170</b> is in turn shown containing division circuitry <b>160</b> and delta sigma modulator DSM (<b>165</b>). The components and blocks of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are shown merely by way of illustration. In alternative embodiments, PLL <b>100</b> may contain more, fewer or differently implemented blocks. For example, PLL <b>100</b> can be implemented as an all-digital PLL with PD <b>125</b> implemented as a time-to-digital converter (TDC), CP <b>130</b> omitted, digital filter in place of LPF <b>135</b> and VCO <b>140</b> implemented as a digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO). PLL <b>100</b> may also be implemented with a combination of analog and digital blocks, as would be apparent to one skilled in the relevant arts.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">XO <b>150</b> is a crystal oscillator (source clock source) that generates a periodic signal (source clock) having a desired frequency. The signal is buffered and forwarded on path <b>112</b> as a source clock clk-xo-main <b>112</b> by buffer <b>110</b>. The source clock <b>112</b> is delayed by delay element <b>115</b> to generate a delayed clock on path <b>113</b>. XNOR gate <b>120</b> performs an exclusive-NOR logic operation of the clocks <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> to generate a reference clock <b>122</b> (clk-ref-n). The delay element <b>115</b> and XNOR operation on clocks <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> result in reference clock <b>122</b> having a frequency that is double that of the source clock. Alternative approaches can be used to generate reference clocks of similar characteristics.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">PD <b>125</b> generates an error signal representing the phase difference between reference clock <b>122</b> and feedback clock <b>162</b>. In an embodiment, the phase difference is obtained based on the times of occurrences of the falling edges of clocks <b>122</b> and <b>162</b>. The error signal drives a current source and current sink in CP <b>130</b>, which generates a current proportional to the strength (magnitude and sign included) of the error signal. LPF <b>135</b> converts the current to a voltage, and performs low-pass filtering of the voltage to generate a filtered error signal as an output. VCO <b>140</b> receives the filtered error signal and generates an output clock <b>141</b> with a frequency determined by the strength of the filtered error signal.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Fractional-N frequency divider block <b>170</b> divides the frequency of output clock <b>141</b> by a desired division factor (fraction or an integer) to generate feedback clock <b>162</b>. The value of the desired division factor employed by fractional-N frequency divider block <b>170</b> determines the steady-state frequency of output clock <b>141</b>. If the desired division factor is represented by a fraction M.N, then frequency of output clock <b>141</b> equals the product of M.N and the frequency (reference frequency) of reference clock <b>122</b>. N is the integer portion, M is the decimal fraction portion and &#x201c;.&#x201d; represents a decimal point, and M.N represents a desired division factor to achieve output clock <b>141</b> at the desired frequency. Fractional-N frequency divider block <b>170</b> includes a division circuitry (DIVN) <b>160</b> and a Delta-Sigma Modulator (DSM) <b>165</b>. DSM <b>165</b> receives the division factor M.N on path <b>161</b> (e.g., from a user input not shown or from an external device). Based on the value M.N, DSM <b>165</b> generates a sequence of divisor values (all integers) on path <b>166</b>. One divisor value of the sequence is used per cycle of reference clock <b>122</b> as the number by which DIVN <b>160</b> should divide frequency of output clock <b>141</b>. The time instant at which DSM <b>165</b> is to forward the next divisor value of the sequence is indicated by the active edge of feedback clock <b>162</b>, which is applied also to the clock input terminal of DSM <b>165</b>. DSM <b>165</b> can be implemented in a known way.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">It is generally desirable to have a high-frequency reference clock in order to minimize quantization noise contribution by DSM <b>165</b> and noise contribution by VCO <b>140</b> to jitter in the output clock CLKOUT <b>141</b>, and therefore in CLK<b>1</b> (<b>151</b>) and CLK<b>2</b> (<b>156</b>) which are derived from output clock <b>141</b> by frequency division in frequency dividers DIVO<b>1</b> <b>150</b> and DIVO<b>2</b> <b>155</b> respectively. Hence a clock doubler (here implemented by the combination of delay element <b>115</b> and XNOR gate <b>120</b>) is typically used in high performance (i.e., low jitter) Fractional-N frequency synthesis applications to generate reference clock at double the frequency of source clock <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the manner in which the clock doubling can be done. A pair of edges of clocks <b>112</b> and <b>113</b> are shown to occur at time instances T<b>21</b> and T<b>22</b>. The XNOR operation of XNOR <b>120</b> results in generation of reference clock <b>122</b> with double the frequency of signal <b>112</b>. Signal <b>210</b> represents the result of XOR operation on signals <b>112</b> and <b>113</b>. Such a technique is well-known.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A non-50% duty cycle (i.e., asymmetry) of the source clock (here <b>112</b>, generated by XO <b>105</b>) before the doubler will result in large phase error perturbations of opposite signs alternating between successive reference clock (reference clock <b>122</b>) edges. This is because, reference clock <b>122</b> would have successive periods that alternate between having a shorter period and a longer period, as illustrated below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. Even at steady state (i.e., when PLL <b>100</b> is locked to reference clock <b>122</b>, and is generating output clock <b>141</b> with the desired frequency), the phase error perturbations cause the subsequent blocks (PD, CP, LPF, VCO) to cause non-linear fold-back of DSM <b>165</b>'s quantization noise in-band (i.e., within the pass-band/band-width of PLL <b>100</b>), thereby elevating the overall jitter in output clock <b>141</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Alternatively, even when a source clock and frequency-doubling are not used to generate the reference clock, reference clock generator may use other techniques for generating reference clocks having unequal successive time periods. Again, this could result in the phase error perturbations, noise fold-back and the increase of overall jitter in output clock <b>141</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref> illustrate such foldback. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>B-<b>3</b>D</figref> are plots depicting the respective histograms of the phase error at the phase detector input for three different values of asymmetry of the reference clock (namely reference clock duty cycle of 50%, 49%, 45% respectively).</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, source clock <b>112</b> is shown as having a non-50% duty-cycle (i.e., asymmetric). The doubling operation results in reference clock <b>122</b> having unequal successive periods (T<b>32</b>-T<b>33</b> and T<b>33</b>-T<b>35</b>). However, since output clock <b>141</b> always has 50% duty cycle, feedback clock <b>162</b> also will always have successive time periods nominally the same excluding the Frac-N DSM related phase movement. At steady-state, the negative edges of reference clock <b>122</b> and feedback clock <b>162</b> are not aligned. For example, in interval T<b>31</b>-T<b>32</b> the reference clock negative edge is earlier than that of feedback clock <b>162</b>, while in interval T<b>33</b>-T<b>34</b> the reference clock negative edge is later than that of feedback clock <b>162</b>.

Therefore, compensation for the duty cycle error in the source clock is usually required.

For example, one approach corrects the source clock itself by using delay cells with corresponding delays to cancel the asymmetry in the source clock. However, such an approach may be very difficult in practice and may incur additional noise penalty. A better approach is to sense the non-50% duty cycle (duty cycle error) in the source clock by extracting the phase detector's (<b>125</b>) sign sequence and use that information to modulate DSM <b>165</b> to compensate for the source clock duty cycle error.

Example System</heading><p id="p-0076" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example system containing a PLL incorporating a TDC with counters and count logic implemented according to various aspects of the present disclosure, as described in detail above. System <b>1200</b> is shown containing SyncE (Synchronous Ethernet) timing cards (<b>1210</b> and <b>1220</b>) and line cards <b>1</b> through N, of which only two line cards <b>1230</b> and <b>1250</b> are shown for simplicity. Line card <b>1230</b> is shown containing jitter attenuator PLL <b>1240</b> and SyncE PHY Transmitter <b>1245</b>. Line card <b>1250</b> is shown containing jitter attenuator PLL <b>1260</b> and SyncE PHY Transmitter <b>1265</b>. The components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> may operate consistent with the Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE) network standard. As is well known in the relevant arts, SyncE is a physical layer (PHY)-based technology for achieving synchronization in packet-based Ethernet networks. The SyncE clock signal transmitted over the physical layer should be traceable to an external master clock (for example, from a timing card such as card <b>1210</b> or <b>1220</b>). Accordingly, Ethernet packets are re-timed with respect to the master clock, and then transmitted in the physical layer. Thus, data packets (e.g., on path <b>1231</b> and <b>1251</b>) are re-timed and transmitted without any time stamp information being recorded in the data packet. The packets may be generated by corresponding applications such as IPTV (Internet Protocol Television), VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), etc.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0080">Thus, line card <b>1230</b> receives a packet on path <b>1231</b>, and forwards the packet on output <b>1246</b> after the packet has been re-timed (synchronized) with a master clock. Similarly, line card <b>1250</b> receives a packet on path <b>1251</b>, and forwards the packet on output <b>1266</b> after the packet has been re-timed (synchronized) with a master clock.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0081">The master clock (<b>1211</b>/clock <b>1</b>) is generated by timing card <b>1210</b>. Timing card <b>1220</b> generates a redundant clock (<b>1221</b>/clock-<b>2</b>) that is to be used by line cards <b>1230</b> and <b>1250</b> upon failure of master clock <b>1211</b>. Master clock <b>1211</b> and redundant clock <b>1221</b> are provided via a backplane (represented by numeral <b>1270</b>) to each of lines cards <b>1230</b> and <b>1250</b>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0082">In line card <b>1230</b>, jitter attenuator PLL <b>1240</b> is implemented as PLL <b>400</b> described above in detail.
