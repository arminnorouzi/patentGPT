WO 2017/015144 discloses a method of cementing an oil or gas well for abandonment. An agitator assembly comprising an agitator, a packer, and a burst sub, with a running tool fitted to the top, is run down a production tubing on wireline. Cement flows through the agitator assembly and causes the production tubing to vibrate. The vibration of the production tubing assists the formation of a good quality cement plug extending all around the production tubing over a substantial length of the well. More than one agitator may be deployed at intervals along the production tubing.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When the flow of cement through the agitator assembly stops, the production tubing may cease to vibrate. When the production tubing ceases to vibrate, and the cement has not set (i.e., the cement is not cured), the production tubing may move against the casing, possibly compromising the quality of the cement plug. The production tubing is particularly prone to move against the casing under the effect of gravity in horizontal or highly deviated wells.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there is a continuing need in the art for systems and methods for cementing a tubing.

These systems and methods involve pumping a fluid, usually other than cement, from the wellhead, through a vibration device that can generate at least one of pressure pulses, lateral oscillations, and axial oscillations, and back into an annulus toward the wellhead. The annulus may be located around a circulation means provided inside the tubing being cemented, in which case, the annulus may be confined inside the tubing. Alternatively, the annulus can be located around the tubing being cemented, in which case, the annulus is confined inside a casing surrounding the tubing. Flow in the annulus can optionally be controlled, for example, via a packer located near or at the wellhead, an unloader valve, or a punching sub capable of making a hole in the tubing.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrate the operation of a system for cementing a tubing, such as a production tubing <b>24</b>, which is located inside a casing <b>26</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the casing <b>26</b> and/or the production tubing <b>24</b> may be located in a horizontal or highly deviated well; however, the system may alternatively be used in wells having a different configuration.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The system may include a distal downhole tool <b>10</b> and a proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> that each includes a flow-through passage along the tool and a vibration device. The vibration device can generate at least one of pressure pulses, lateral oscillations, and axial oscillations during the pumping of the cement or other fluid in the flow-through passage.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the distal downhole tool <b>10</b> may be provided in the production tubing <b>24</b>. For example, the distal downhole tool <b>10</b> may be connected to a setting tool and placed in the production tubing <b>24</b> using conveyance means, such as wireline, coiled tubing, or other known conveyance means.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The distal downhole tool <b>10</b> is attached to the production tubing <b>24</b>. For example, the setting tool may be used to move an anchor included in the distal downhole tool <b>10</b> from a collapsed position to an extended position for gripping against the production tubing <b>24</b>. Alternatively, the distal downhole tool <b>10</b> may latch to a device forming a part of the production tubing <b>24</b>, such as a nipple profile or another completion component. Other known attachment means may be used for attaching the distal downhole tool <b>10</b> to the production tubing <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Preferably, a packer is included in the distal downhole tool <b>10</b>. The packer, which may be used to prevent flow between the distal downhole tool <b>10</b> and the production tubing <b>24</b>, is moved from a retracted position to an expanded position for sealing against the production tubing <b>24</b>. For example, the setting tool may include an actuator configured to move the packer. Alternatively to a packer, the distal downhole tool <b>10</b> may be permanently shaped or selectively configurable such that the flow between the distal downhole tool <b>10</b> and the production tubing <b>24</b> is substantially more restricted than flow in the flow-through passage along the distal downhole tool <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Then, the setting tool may be disconnected from the distal downhole tool <b>10</b> and retrieved from the well so that the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> can be provided in the production tubing <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In contrast with the distal downhole tool <b>10</b>, which preferably includes a packer, the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> preferably does not include a packer, or if a packer is provided, the packer is not expanded. As such, flow between the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> and the production tubing <b>24</b> is preferably allowed. However, the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> may include a packer that is expanded as well as an unloader valve positioned between the vibration device and the packer. The unloader valve is configured to be normally closed and selectively open a backflow path between the flow-through passage along the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> and an annulus between the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> and the production tubing <b>24</b> on a side of the packer that is the closest to the wellhead. When the backflow path is open, cement or other fluid can flow in the flow-through passage, generate at least one of pressure pulses, lateral oscillations, and axial oscillations, and then flow in the backflow path toward the wellhead. There are various ways to open the unloader valve.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Similarly to the distal downhole tool <b>10</b>, the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> is also attached to the production tubing <b>24</b>. For example, a setting tool may be used to move an anchor included in the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> from a collapsed position to an extended position for gripping against the production tubing <b>24</b>. Alternatively, the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> may latch to a device forming a part of the production tubing <b>24</b>, such as a nipple profile or another completion component. Other known attachment means may be used for attaching the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> to the production tubing <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> is connected via a coupling tool <b>40</b> to circulation means, such as a coiled tubing <b>32</b>, other umbilical, or other tubular, conduit, or pipe. The coupling tool <b>40</b> and the coiled tubing <b>32</b> provide a flow path from the wellhead through the coiled tubing <b>32</b> and a backflow path to the wellhead in an annulus <b>34</b> between the production tubing <b>24</b> and the coiled tubing <b>32</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The coupling tool <b>40</b> includes a latch sub and a flow-through passage extending from inside the coiled tubing <b>32</b> through the latch sub to an end of the coupling tool <b>40</b> opposite the coiled tubing <b>32</b>. The proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> includes a connector, and the flow-through passage along the first proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> extends through the connector to an end of the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> opposite the connector. In use, the connector of the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> is engaged with the latch sub of the coupling tool <b>40</b>. The connector of the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> is configured to seal against the latch sub of the coupling tool <b>40</b> when the connector is engaged with the latch sub. Accordingly, a flow communication is established between the flow-through passage of the coupling tool <b>40</b> and the flow-through passage of the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> when the connector is engaged with the latch sub. Thus, cement may be pumped into the coiled tubing <b>32</b> through the coupling tool <b>40</b> and the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b>. Further, the cement may flow in the flow-through passage of the distal downhole tool <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">During a cementing operation, annular seal <b>36</b>, which is located near or at the wellhead, is at least partially opened, and cement <b>42</b> is pumped into the production tubing <b>24</b>, for example, first into the coiled tubing <b>32</b>, through the coupling tool <b>40</b> and the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b>, and out of the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b>. The cement <b>42</b> may continue to flow inside a portion of the production tubing <b>24</b> located between the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b>, through the distal downhole tool <b>10</b>, and out of the distal downhole tool <b>10</b>. The cement <b>42</b> flows back into an annulus <b>28</b> between the production tubing <b>24</b> and the casing <b>26</b>, toward the annular seal <b>36</b>. The annular seal <b>36</b> may be partially choked to provide a squeeze pressure on the cement <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Preferably, a packer <b>38</b>, which is located near or at the wellhead, may be used to prevent or at least to hinder the cement <b>42</b> from flowing back into the annulus <b>34</b> toward the wellhead after exiting the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b>. However, in cases where the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> includes a packer as well as an unloader valve, the packer of the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> may be used instead of, or in addition to, the packer <b>38</b> for preventing or at least hindering the flow back on cement into the annulus <b>34</b> toward the wellhead. The unloader valve may remain closed during the pumping of the cement <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each of the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> and the distal downhole tool <b>10</b> can generate at least one of pressure pulses, lateral oscillations, and axial oscillations during the pumping of the cement <b>42</b>. The pressure pulses, lateral oscillations, or axial oscillations are caused by the flow of cement through a vibration device included in the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> and the distal downhole tool <b>10</b>. The lateral oscillations and axial oscillations may be transmitted from the vibration tool to the production tubing <b>24</b> through the attachment of the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> and the distal downhole tool <b>10</b> to the production tubing. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, these pressure pulses, lateral oscillations, or axial oscillations may cause a portion of the production tubing <b>24</b> to centralize inside the casing <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Further, the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> can generate at least one of pressure pulses, lateral oscillations, and axial oscillations after the pumping of the cement <b>42</b> has ceased, and during the curing of the cement <b>42</b>. To do so, the annular seal <b>36</b>, if provided in the system, is closed. In cases where the packer <b>38</b>, which is located near or at the wellhead, is provided in the system, the packer <b>38</b> is open. Alternatively, in cases where the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> includes a packer as well as an unloader valve, the unloader valve is opened, such as by pulling (or pushing) on the coiled tubing <b>32</b>. Then, fluid, usually other than cement, is pumped into the production tubing <b>24</b>, for example, first into the coiled tubing <b>32</b>, through the coupling tool <b>40</b> and the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b>, and out of the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b>. The fluid flows back into the annulus <b>34</b> toward the wellhead packer <b>38</b>. The flow of the fluid through the vibration device included in the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b> causes these pressure pulses, lateral oscillations, or axial oscillations, which in turn may cause the production tubing <b>24</b> to remain centralized while the cement <b>42</b> is curing. The circulation of fluid may last for several hours, possibly a few days while the cement <b>42</b> is curing. Further, the circulation of fluid, the pressure pulses, lateral oscillations, and/or axial oscillations may apply a squeeze pressure to the cement <b>42</b> while the cement <b>42</b> is curing, thus improving the bond of the cement <b>42</b> to the casing <b>26</b> and/or to the production tubing <b>24</b>. The fluid may include Lost Circulation Material (&#x201c;LCM&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The system may comprise a release mechanism disposed along the proximal downhole tool <b>30</b>, the coupling tool <b>40</b>, or the coiled tubing <b>32</b>.
