Thus, for example, a reference to &#x201c;an agent&#x201d; includes a single agent and a plurality of agents.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The term &#x201c;associated with&#x201d; as used herein in the context of two or more moieties (e.g., proteins or protein domains) refers to the fact that the moieties are physically associated with or connected to one another, either directly or via one or more additional moieties that serve as a linking agent, to form a structure that is sufficiently stable so that the moieties remain physically associated under the conditions in which the structure is used, e.g., under physiological conditions. A supernegatively charged protein may be associated with an effector protein through non-covalent interactions (e.g., electrostatic interactions). In some embodiments, a supernegatively charged protein may be associated with an effector protein through electrostatic interactions to form a complex. In some embodiments, a sufficient number of weaker interactions can provide sufficient stability for moieties to remain physically associated under a variety of different conditions. In some embodiments, a supernegatively charged protein is associated with an effector protein via a covalent bond (e.g., an amide bond). In some embodiments, a effector protein is associated with a supernegatively charged protein directly by a peptide bond, or indirectly via a linker.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The term &#x201c;fusion protein&#x201d; refers to a protein comprising a plurality of heterologous proteins, protein domains, or peptides, e.g., a supernegatively charged protein and an effector protein, associated with each other via a peptide linkage, thus forming a single amino acid sequence. In some embodiments, a fusion protein is encoded by a gene.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The term &#x201c;supernegatively charged protein&#x201d; refers to a protein that has a net negative charge of at least &#x2212;1, at least &#x2212;2, at least &#x2212;3, at least &#x2212;4, at least &#x2212;5, at least &#x2212;6, at least 7, at least 8, at least &#x2212;9, at least &#x2212;10, at least &#x2212;15, at least &#x2212;20, at least &#x2212;25, at least &#x2212;30, at least &#x2212;35, at least &#x2212;40, at least &#x2212;45, at least &#x2212;50, or more. Supernegatively charged proteins provided in the present disclosure include: prothymosin alpha (ProT&#x3b1;), DPH3 homolog, ADP ribosylation factor-like protein 2-binding protein, protein S100-B, Sirtuin-1, and variants thereof.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The term &#x201c;effector protein&#x201d; refers to a protein that modulates a biological function of a cell when introduced into the cell, e.g., a modification of a nucleic acid molecule in the cell (such as a cleavage, deamination, recombination, etc.), or a modulation (e.g., increases or decreases) the expression or the expression level of a gene in the cell.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The term &#x201c;nuclease,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to an agent, for example, a protein, nucleic acid, or a small molecule, capable of cleaving a phosphodiester bond connecting nucleotide residues in a nucleic acid molecule. In some embodiments, a nuclease is a protein, e.g., an enzyme that can bind a nucleic acid molecule and cleave a phosphodiester bond connecting nucleotide residues within the nucleic acid molecule. A nuclease may be an endonuclease, cleaving a phosphodiester bond within a polynucleotide chain, or an exonuclease, cleaving a phosphodiester bond at the end of the polynucleotide chain. In some embodiments, a nuclease is a site-specific nuclease, binding and/or cleaving a specific phosphodiester bond within a specific nucleotide sequence, which is also referred to herein as the &#x201c;recognition sequence,&#x201d; the &#x201c;nuclease target site,&#x201d; or the &#x201c;target site.&#x201d; In some embodiments, a nuclease recognizes a single stranded target site, while in other embodiments, a nuclease recognizes a double-stranded target site, for example, a double-stranded DNA target site. The target sites of many naturally occurring nucleases, for example, many naturally occurring DNA restriction nucleases, are well known to those of skill in the art. In many cases, a DNA nuclease, such as EcoRI, HindIII, or BamHI, recognize a palindromic, double-stranded DNA target site of 4 to 10 base pairs in length, and cut each of the two DNA strands at a specific position within the target site. Some endonucleases cut a double-stranded nucleic acid target site symmetrically, i.e., cutting both strands at the same position so that the ends comprise base-paired nucleotides, also referred to herein as blunt ends. Other endonucleases cut a double-stranded nucleic acid target site asymmetrically, i.e., cutting each strand at a different position so that the ends comprise unpaired nucleotides. Unpaired nucleotides at the end of a double-stranded DNA molecule are also referred to as &#x201c;overhangs,&#x201d; e.g., as &#x201c;5&#x2032;-overhang&#x201d; or as &#x201c;3&#x2032;-overhang,&#x201d; depending on whether the unpaired nucleotide(s) form(s) the 5&#x2032; or the 3&#x2032; end of the respective DNA strand. Double-stranded DNA molecule ends ending with unpaired nucleotide(s) are also referred to as sticky ends, as they can &#x201c;stick to&#x201d; other double-stranded DNA molecule ends comprising complementary unpaired nucleotide(s). A nuclease protein typically comprises a &#x201c;binding domain&#x201d; that mediates the interaction of the protein with the nucleic acid substrate, and a &#x201c;cleavage domain&#x201d; that catalyzes the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond within the nucleic acid backbone. In some embodiments, a nuclease protein can bind and cleave a nucleic acid molecule in a monomeric form, while, in other embodiments, a nuclease protein has to dimerize or multimerize in order to cleave a target nucleic acid molecule. Binding domains and cleavage domains of naturally occurring nucleases, as well as modular binding domains and cleavage domains that can be combined to create nucleases that bind specific target sites, are well known to those of skill in the art. For example, transcriptional activator like elements can be used as binding domains to specifically bind a desired target site, and fused or conjugated to a cleavage domain, for example, the cleavage domain of FokI, to create an engineered nuclease cleaving the desired target site.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The term &#x201c;cationic lipid&#x201d; refers to a lipid which has a cationic, or positive, charge at physiologic pH. Cationic lipids can take a variety of forms including, but not limited to, liposomes or micelles. Cationic lipids useful for certain aspects of the present disclosure are known in the art, and, generally comprise both polar and non-polar domains, bind to polyanions, such as nucleic acid molecules or supernegatively charged proteins, and are typically known to facilitate the delivery of nucleic acids into cells. Examples of useful cationic lipids include polyethylenimine, polyamidoamine (PAMAM) starburst dendrimers, Lipofectin (a combination of DOTMA and DOPE), Lipofectase, LIPOFECTAMINE&#xae; (e.g., LIPOFECTAMINE&#xae; 2000, LIPOFECTAMINE&#xae; 3000, LIPOFECTAMINE&#xae; RNAiMAX, LIPOFECTAMINE&#xae; LTX Lipofectamine&#xae; MessengerMax), SAINT-RED (Synvolux Therapeutics, Groningen Netherlands), FuGENE HD DOPE (Promega), Cytofectin (Gilead Sciences, Foster City, Calif.), and Eufectins (JBL, San Luis Obispo, Calif.). Exemplary cationic liposomes can be made from N-[1-(2,3-dioleoloxy)-propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA), N-[1-(2,3-dioleoloxy)-propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP), 3&#x3b2;-[N-(N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-dimethylaminoethane)carbamoyl]cholesterol (DC-Chol), 2,3,-dioleyloxy-N-[2(sperminecarboxamido)ethyl]-N,N-dimethyl-1-propanaminium trifluoroacetate (DOSPA), 1,2-dimyristyloxypropyl-3-dimethyl-hydroxyethyl ammonium bromide; and dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDAB). Cationic lipids have been used in the art to deliver nucleic acid molecules to cells (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,855,910; 5,851,548; 5,830,430; 5,780,053; 5,767,099; 8,569,256; 8,691,750; 8,748,667; 8,758,810; 8,759,104; 8,771,728; Lewis et al. 1996. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:3176; Hope et al. 1998.

For example, if the target nucleic acid sequence is located within a regulatory region of a gene, a transcriptional activator causes an increase of the level of expression of a gene product encoded by the gene (conversely, a transcriptional repressor causes a decrease of the level of expression of a gene product encoded by the gene). The gene product can be an RNA transcribed from the gene (e.g., an mRNA) or a polypeptide translated from an mRNA transcribed from the gene. Typically an increase or decrease in the level of an mRNA results in an increase or decrease in the level of a polypeptide translated therefrom. The level of expression may be determined using standard techniques for measuring mRNA or protein.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The term &#x201c;Transcriptional Activator-Like Effector,&#x201d; (TALE) as used herein, refers to effector proteins comprising a DNA binding domain, which contains a highly conserved 33-34 amino acid sequence comprising a highly variable two-amino acid motif (Repeat Variable Diresidue, RVD).

In some embodiments, the cleavage domain is the cleavage domain of the type II restriction endonuclease FokI. Zinc finger nucleases can be designed to target virtually any desired sequence in a given nucleic acid molecule for cleavage, and the possibility to design zinc finger binding domains to bind unique sites in the context of complex genomes allows for targeted cleavage of a single genomic site in living cells, for example, to achieve a targeted genomic alteration of therapeutic value. Targeting a double-strand break to a desired genomic locus can be used to introduce frame-shift mutations into the coding sequence of a gene due to the error-prone nature of the non-homologous DNA repair pathway. Zinc finger nucleases can be generated to target a site of interest by methods well known to those of skill in the art. For example, zinc finger binding domains with a desired specificity can be designed by combining individual zinc finger motifs of known specificity. The structure of the zinc finger protein Zif268 bound to DNA has informed much of the work in this field and the concept of obtaining zinc fingers for each of the 64 possible base pair triplets and then mixing and matching these modular zinc fingers to design proteins with any desired sequence specificity has been described (Pavletich N P, Pabo C O (May 1991). &#x201c;Zinc finger-DNA recognition: crystal structure of a Zif268-DNA complex at 2.1 A&#x201d;. <i>Science </i>252 (5007): 809-17, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein). In some embodiments, separate zinc fingers that each recognizes a 3 base pair DNA sequence are combined to generate 3-, 4-, 5-, or 6-finger arrays that recognize target sites ranging from 9 base pairs to 18 base pairs in length. In some embodiments, longer arrays are contemplated. In other embodiments, 2-finger modules recognizing 6-8 nucleotides are combined to generate 4-, 6-, or 8-zinc finger arrays. In some embodiments, bacterial or phage display is employed to develop a zinc finger domain that recognizes a desired nucleic acid sequence, for example, a desired nuclease target site of 3-30 bp in length. Zinc finger nucleases, in some embodiments, comprise a zinc finger binding domain and a cleavage domain fused or otherwise conjugated to each other via a linker, for example, a polypeptide linker. The length of the linker determines the distance of the cut from the nucleic acid sequence bound by the zinc finger domain. If a shorter linker is used, the cleavage domain will cut the nucleic acid closer to the bound nucleic acid sequence, while a longer linker will result in a greater distance between the cut and the bound nucleic acid sequence. In some embodiments, the cleavage domain of a zinc finger nuclease has to dimerize in order to cut a bound nucleic acid. In some such embodiments, the dimer is a heterodimer of two monomers, each of which comprise a different zinc finger binding domain. For example, in some embodiments, the dimer may comprise one monomer comprising zinc finger domain A conjugated to a FokI cleavage domain, and one monomer comprising zinc finger domain B conjugated to a FokI cleavage domain. In this non-limiting example, zinc finger domain A binds a nucleic acid sequence on one side of the target site, zinc finger domain B binds a nucleic acid sequence on the other side of the target site, and the dimerize FokI domain cuts the nucleic acid in between the zinc finger domain binding sites.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The term &#x201c;zinc finger,&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a small nucleic acid-binding protein structural motif characterized by a fold and the coordination of one or more zinc ions that stabilize the fold. Zinc fingers encompass a wide variety of differing protein structures (see, e.g., Klug A, Rhodes D (1987). &#x201c;Zinc fingers: a novel protein fold for nucleic acid recognition&#x201d;. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 52: 473-82, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference). Zinc fingers can be designed to bind a specific sequence of nucleotides, and zinc finger arrays comprising fusions of a series of zinc fingers, can be designed to bind virtually any desired target sequence. Such zinc finger arrays can form a binding domain of a protein, for example, of a nuclease, e.g., if conjugated to a nucleic acid cleavage domain. Different types of zinc finger motifs are known to those of skill in the art, including, but not limited to, Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2</sub>, Gag knuckle, Treble clef, Zinc ribbon, Zn<sub>2</sub>/Cys<sub>6</sub>, and TAZ2 domain-like motifs (see, e.g., Krishna S S, Majumdar I, Grishin N V (January 2003). &#x201c;Structural classification of zinc fingers: survey and summary&#x201d;. <i>Nucleic Acids Res. </i>31 (2): 532-50). Typically, a single zinc finger motif binds 3 or 4 nucleotides of a nucleic acid molecule. Accordingly, a zinc finger domain comprising 2 zinc finger motifs may bind 6-8 nucleotides, a zinc finger domain comprising 3 zinc finger motifs may bind 9-12 nucleotides, a zinc finger domain comprising 4 zinc finger motifs may bind 12-16 nucleotides, and so forth. Any suitable protein engineering technique can be employed to alter the DNA-binding specificity of zinc fingers and/or design novel zinc finger fusions to bind virtually any desired target sequence from 3-30 nucleotides in length (see, e.g., Pabo C O, Peisach E, Grant R A (2001). &#x201c;Design and selection of novel cys2His2 Zinc finger proteins&#x201d;. <i>Annual Review of Biochemistry </i>70: 313-340; Jamieson A C, Miller J C, Pabo C O (2003). &#x201c;Drug discovery with engineered zinc-finger proteins&#x201d;. <i>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery </i>2 (5): 361-368; and Liu Q, Segal D J, Ghiara J B, Barbas C F (May 1997). &#x201c;Design of polydactyl zinc-finger proteins for unique addressing within complex genomes&#x201d;. <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. </i>94 (11); the entire contents of each of which are incorporated herein by reference). Fusions between engineered zinc finger arrays and protein domains that cleave a nucleic acid can be used to generate a &#x201c;zinc finger nuclease.&#x201d; A zinc finger nuclease typically comprises a zinc finger domain that binds a specific target site within a nucleic acid molecule, and a nucleic acid cleavage domain that cuts the nucleic acid molecule within or in proximity to the target site bound by the binding domain. Typical engineered zinc finger nucleases comprise a binding domain having between 3 and 6 individual zinc finger motifs and binding target sites ranging from 9 base pairs to 18 base pairs in length. Longer target sites are particularly attractive in situations where it is desired to bind and cleave a target site that is unique in a given genome.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The terms &#x201c;RNA-programmable nuclease&#x201d; and &#x201c;RNA-guided nuclease&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein and refer to a nuclease that forms a complex with (e.g., binds or associates with) one or more RNA molecule that is not a target for cleavage. In some embodiments, an RNA-programmable nuclease, when in a complex with an RNA, may be referred to as a nuclease:RNA complex. RNA-programmable nucleases include Cas9. Typically, the bound RNA(s) is referred to as a guide RNA (gRNA). gRNAs can exist as a complex of two or more RNAs, or as a single RNA molecule. gRNAs that exist as a single RNA molecule may be referred to as single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), though &#x201c;gRNA&#x201d; is used interchangeably to refer to guide RNAs that exist as either single molecules or as a complex of two or more molecules. Typically, gRNAs that exist as single RNA species comprise two domains: (1) a domain that shares homology to a target nucleic acid (e.g., and directs binding of a Cas9 complex to the target); and (2) a domain that binds a Cas9 protein. The gRNA comprises a nucleotide sequence that complements a target site, which mediates binding of the nuclease/RNA complex to said target site and providing the sequence specificity of the nuclease:RNA complex.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The term &#x201c;Cas9&#x201d; or &#x201c;Cas9 nuclease&#x201d; refers to an RNA-guided nuclease comprising a Cas9 protein, or a fragment thereof (e.g., a protein comprising an active or inactive DNA cleavage domain of Cas9 or a partially inactive DNA cleavage domain (e.g., a Cas9 &#x201c;nickase&#x201d;), and/or the gRNA binding domain of Cas9).

Recombinases can be classified into two distinct families: serine recombinases (e.g., resolvases and invertases) and tyrosine recombinases (e.g., integrases). Examples of serine recombinases include, without limitation, Hin, Gin, Tn3, &#x3b2;-six, CinH, ParA, &#x3b3;&#x3b4;, Bxb1, &#x3d5;C31, TP901, TG1, &#x3d5;BT1, R4, &#x3d5;RV1, &#x3d5;FC1, MR11, A118, U153, and gp29. Examples of tyrosine recombinases include, without limitation, Cre, FLP, R, Lambda, HK101, HK022, and pSAM2. The serine and tyrosine recombinase names stem from the conserved nucleophilic amino acid residue that the recombinase uses to attack the DNA and which becomes covalently linked to the DNA during strand exchange. Recombinases have numerous applications, including the creation of gene knockouts/knock-ins and gene therapy applications.

proteins to cells in vivo, ex vivo, or in vitro. Such systems and methods typically involve association of the effector protein with a supernegatively charged protein to form a complex or a fusion protein, and delivery of the complex or fusion protein to a cell. In some embodiments, the effector protein to be delivered by the supernegatively charged protein has therapeutic activity. In some embodiments, delivery of the complex or fusion protein to a cell involves administering the complex or fusion protein comprising a supernegatively charged protein associated with a effector protein to a subject in need thereof.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0067">Effector proteins suitable for delivery to a target cell in vivo, ex vivo, or in vitro, by a system or method provided herein will be apparent to those of skill in the art and include, for example, enzymes (e.g., without limitation, nucleases, recombinases, epigenetic modifiers), transcriptional regulators (e.g., without limitation, transcriptional activators and transcriptional repressors), therapeutic proteins (e.g., without limitation, antibodies, antigens, hormones, cytokines), and diagnostic proteins (e.g., without limitation, fluorescent proteins).</p><p id="p-0070" num="0068">In some embodiments, the effector protein is an enzyme. An enzyme is a substance produced by a living organism that acts as a catalyst to bring about a specific biochemical reaction. Non-limiting examples of enzymes that may be used in accordance with the present disclosure include nucleases, recombinases, and epigenetic modifiers. The delivery of other types of enzymes using the compositions and methods described herein are also contemplated.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0069">In some embodiments, the effector protein is a nuclease. In some embodiments, the effector protein is a transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN). TALE nucleases, or TALENs, are artificial nucleases comprising a transcriptional activator-like effector DNA binding domain associated with a DNA cleavage domain, for example, a FokI domain. A number of modular assembly schemes for generating engineered TALE constructs have been reported (Zhang, Feng; et. al.

Those of skill in the art will understand that TALE nucleases can be engineered to target virtually any genomic sequence with high specificity, and that such engineered nucleases can be used in embodiments of the present technology to manipulate the genome of a cell, e.g., by delivering the respective TALEN via a method or strategy disclosed herein under circumstances suitable for the TALEN to bind and cleave its target sequence within the genome of the cell. In some embodiments, the delivered TALEN targets a gene or allele associated with a disease or disorder. In some embodiments, delivery of the TALEN to a subject confers a therapeutic benefit to the subject.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0070">In some embodiments, the effector protein is a zinc finger nuclease (ZFN). Zinc finger nucleases are a class of artificial nucleases that comprise a DNA cleavage domain and a zinc finger DNA binding domain. In some embodiments, the DNA cleavage domain is a non-specific DNA cleavage domain of a restriction endonuclease, for example, of FokI. In some embodiments, the DNA cleavage domain is a domain that only cleaves double-stranded DNA when dimerized with a second DNA cleavage domain of the same type. In some embodiments, the DNA cleavage domain is fused to the C-terminus of the zinc finger domain via a linker, for example, a peptide linker. In some embodiments, the zinc finger domain comprises between about 3 and about 6 zinc fingers and specifically recognizes and binds a target sequence of about 9-20 nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, a plurality of zinc finger nuclease molecules is delivered to a target cell by a system or method provided by this invention, with the zinc finger domain of one zinc finger nuclease molecule binding a target sequence in close proximity of the target sequence of a second zinc finger nuclease molecule. In some embodiments, the zinc finger domains of the zinc finger nuclease molecules binding target sequences in close proximity to each other are different. In some embodiments, a zinc finger nuclease molecule delivered to a cell by a system or method provided herein binds a target nucleic acid sequence in close proximity to the target sequence of another zinc finger nuclease molecule, so that the DNA cleavage domains of the molecules dimerize and cleave a DNA molecule at a site between the two target sequences.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0071">Methods for engineering, generation, and isolation of nucleases targeting specific sequences, e.g., TALE, or zinc finger nucleases, and editing cellular genomes at specific target sequences, are well known in the art (see, e.g., Mani et al., Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 335:447-457, 2005; Perez et al., Nature Biotechnology 26:808-16, 2008; Kim et al., Genome Research, 19:1279-88, 2009; Urnov et al., Nature 435:646-51, 2005; Carroll et al., Gene Therapy 15:1463-68, 2005; Lombardo et al., Nature Biotechnology 25:1298-306, 2007; Kandavelou et al., Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 388:56-61, 2009; and Hockemeyer et al., Nature Biotechnology 27(9):851-59, 2009, as well as the reference recited in the respective section for each nuclease).

In some embodiments, the RNA guided protein is associated with a guide RNA (gRNA) in the composition described herein. In some embodiments, the RNA-programmable protein is a Cas9 nuclease, a Cas9 variant, or a fusion of a Cas9 protein, which is delivered to a target cell by a system or method provided herein. In some embodiments, the RNA-programmable nuclease is a (CRISPR-associated system) Cas9 endonuclease, for example, Cas9 (Csn1) from <i>Streptococcus pyogenes </i>(see, e.g., &#x201c;Complete genome sequence of an M1 strain of <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>.&#x201d; Ferretti J.

Because RNA-programmable nucleases (e.g., Cas9) use RNA:DNA hybridization to determine target DNA cleavage sites, these proteins are able to cleave, in principle, any sequence specified by the guide RNA. Methods of using RNA-programmable nucleases, such as Cas9, for site-specific cleavage (e.g., to modify a genome) are known in the art (see e.g., Cong, L. et al. Multiplex genome engineering using CRISPR/Cas systems. Science 339, 819-823 (2013); Mali, P. et al. RNA-guided human genome engineering via Cas9. Science 339, 823-826 (2013); Hwang, W. Y. et al.

CRISPR is an adaptive immune system that provides protection against mobile genetic elements (viruses, transposable elements and conjugative plasmids). CRISPR clusters contain spacers, sequences complementary to antecedent mobile elements, and target invading nucleic acids. CRISPR clusters are transcribed and processed into CRISPR RNA (crRNA). In type II CRISPR systems correct processing of pre-crRNA requires a trans-encoded small RNA (tracrRNA), endogenous ribonuclease 3 (rnc) and a Cas9 protein. The tracrRNA serves as a guide for ribonuclease 3-aided processing of pre-crRNA. Subsequently, Cas9/crRNA/tracrRNA endonucleolytically cleaves linear or circular dsDNA target complementary to the spacer. The target strand that is not complementary to the crRNA is first cut endonucleolytically, then trimmed 3&#x2032;-5&#x2032; exonucleolytically. In nature, DNA-binding and cleavage typically requires protein and both RNA. However, single guide RNAs (&#x201c;sgRNA&#x201d;, or simply &#x201c;gNRA&#x201d;) can be engineered so as to incorporate aspects of both the crRNA and tracrRNA into a single RNA species.

Cas9 recognizes a short motif in the CRISPR repeat sequences (the PAM or protospacer adjacent motif) to help distinguish self versus non-self.

In some embodiments, proteins comprising Cas9 proteins or fragments thereof are referred to as &#x201c;Cas9 variants.&#x201d; A Cas9 variant shares homology to Cas9, or a fragment thereof. For example, a Cas9 variant is at least about 70% identical, at least about 80% identical, at least about 90% identical, at least about 95% identical, at least about 98% identical, at least about 99% identical, at least about 99.5% identical, or at least about 99.9% to wild type Cas9. In some embodiments, the Cas9 variant comprises a fragment of Cas9 (e.g., a gRNA binding domain or a DNA-cleavage domain, an N-terminal domain or a C-terminal domain, etc.), such that the fragment is at least about 70% identical, at least about 80% identical, at least about 90% identical, at least about 95% identical, at least about 98% identical, at least about 99% identical, at least about 99.5% identical, or at least about 99.9% to the corresponding fragment of wild type Cas9. In some embodiments, wild type Cas9 corresponds to Cas9 from <i>Streptococcus pyogenes </i>(NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_017053.1). In some embodiments, a Cas9 protein has an inactive (e.g., an inactivated) DNA cleavage domain. A nuclease-inactivated Cas9 protein may interchangeably be referred to as a &#x201c;dCas9&#x201d; protein (for nuclease &#x201c;dead&#x201d; Cas9). In some embodiments, dCas9 corresponds to, or comprises in part or in whole. In some embodiments, variants of dCas9 are provided. For example, in some embodiments, variants having mutations other than D10A and H840A are provided, which result in nuclease inactivated Cas9 (dCas9). Such mutations, by way of example, include other amino acid substitutions at D10 and H840, or other substitutions within the nuclease domain of Cas9 (e.g., substitutions in the HNH nuclease subdomain and/or the RuvC1 subdomain). In some embodiments, variants or homologues of dCas9 are provided which are at least about 70% identical, at least about 80% identical, at least about 90% identical, at least about 95% identical, at least about 98% identical, at least about 99% identical, at least about 99.5% identical, or at least about 99.9% identical to SEQ ID NO: 22.

comprising a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) or Cas9 nickase (nCas9) fused to an effector domain (e.g., an enzymatic domain such as a base modifying enzyme, a transcription regulator, an epigenetic modifier, or a nuclease). Any of the nucleases, transcriptional regulators, and epigenetic modifiers described herein may be fused to a dCas9 or a nCas9 to form a Cas9 fusion protein.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0076">In some embodiments, the Cas9 fusion protein comprises a dCas9 or nCas9 fused to a deaminase (e.g., a cytosine deaminase or adenosine deaminase). A &#x201c;cytosine deaminase&#x201d; refers to an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction &#x201c;cytosine+H<sub>2</sub>O&#x2192;uracil+NH<sub>3</sub>&#x201d; or &#x201c;5-methyl-cytosine+H<sub>2</sub>O&#x2192;thymine+NH3.&#x201d; As it may be apparent from the reaction formula, such chemical reactions result in a C to U/T nucleobase change. In the context of a gene, such a nucleotide change, or mutation, may in turn lead to an amino acid change in the protein, which may affect the protein's function, e.g., loss-of-function or gain-of-function. Cas9 fusion proteins comprising a dCas9 or nCas9 fused to a cytosine deaminase have been described in the art, e.g., in U.S. Pat.

It is needed for the breakdown of adenosine from food and for the turnover of nucleic acids in tissues. Its primary function in humans is the development and maintenance of the immune system. An adenosine deaminase catalyzes hydrolytic deamination of adenosine (forming inosine, which base pairs as G) in the context of DNA. There are no known adenosine deaminases that act on DNA. Instead, known adenosine deaminase enzymes only act on RNA (tRNA or mRNA). Evolved deoxyadenosine deaminase enzymes that accept DNA substrates and deaminate dA to deoxyinosine, which were used in Cas9 fusion proteins comprising dCas9 or nCas9 fused to an adenosine deaminase have been described, e.g., in PCT Application, PCT/US2017/045381, filed Aug. 3, 2017; incorporated herein by reference.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0078">When the functional effector protein is a RNA guided nuclease (e.g., Cas9, a Cas9 homolog, a Cas9 variant, or a Cas9 fusion protein), the effector protein may be associated with a guide RNA (gRNA). A &#x201c;gRNA&#x201d; (guide ribonucleic acid) herein refers to a fusion of a CRISPR-targeting RNA (crRNA) and a trans-activation crRNA (tracrRNA), providing both targeting specificity and scaffolding/binding ability for Cas9 nuclease. A &#x201c;crRNA&#x201d; is a bacterial RNA that confers target specificity and requires tracrRNA to bind to Cas9. A &#x201c;tracrRNA&#x201d; is a bacterial RNA that links the crRNA to the Cas9 nuclease and typically can bind any crRNA. The sequence specificity of a Cas DNA-binding protein is determined by gRNAs, which have nucleotide base-pairing complementarity to target DNA sequences. The native gRNA comprises a 20 nucleotide (nt) Specificity Determining Sequence (SDS), which specifies the DNA sequence to be targeted, and is immediately followed by a 80 nt scaffold sequence, which associates the gRNA with Cas9. In some embodiments, an SDS of the present disclosure has a length of 15 to 100 nucleotides, or more. For example, an SDS may have a length of 15 to 90, 15 to 85, 15 to 80, 15 to 75, 15 to 70, 15 to 65, 15 to 60, 15 to 55, 15 to 50, 15 to 45, 15 to 40, 15 to 35, 15 to 30, or 15 to 20 nucleotides. In some embodiments, the SDS is 20 nucleotides long. For example, the SDS may be 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25 nucleotides long. At least a portion of the target DNA sequence is complementary to the SDS of the gRNA. For Cas9 to successfully bind to the DNA target sequence, a region of the target sequence is complementary to the SDS of the gRNA sequence and is immediately followed by the correct protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence (e.g., NGG for Cas9 and TTN, TTTN, or YTN for Cpf1). In some embodiments, an SDS is 100% complementary to its target sequence. In some embodiments, the SDS sequence is less than 100% complementary to its target sequence and is, thus, considered to be partially complementary to its target sequence. For example, a targeting sequence may be 99%, 98%, 97%, 96%, 95%, 94%, 93%, 92%, 91%, or 90% complementary to its target sequence. In some embodiments, the SDS of template DNA or target DNA may differ from a complementary region of a gRNA by 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 nucleotides.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0079">In addition to the SDS, the gRNA comprises a scaffold sequence (corresponding to the tracrRNA in the native CRISPR/Cas system) that is required for its association with Cas9 (referred to herein as the &#x201c;gRNA handle&#x201d;). In some embodiments, the gRNA comprises a structure 5&#x2032;-[SDS]-[gRNA handle]-3&#x2032;. In some embodiments, the scaffold sequence comprises the nucleotide sequence of 5&#x2032;-guuuuagagcuagaaauagcaaguuaaaauaaaggcuaguc cguuaucaacuugaaaaaguggcaccgagucggugcuuuuu-3&#x2032; (SEQ ID NO: 1). Other non-limiting, suitable gRNA handle sequences that may be used in accordance with the present disclosure are listed in Table 2.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0080">In some embodiments, the guide RNA is about 15-120 nucleotides long and comprises a sequence of at least 10 contiguous nucleotides that is complementary to a target sequence. In some embodiments, the guide RNA is 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, or 120 nucleotides long. In some embodiments, the guide RNA comprises a sequence of 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 or more contiguous nucleotides that is complementary to a target sequence. Sequence complementarity refers to distinct interactions between adenine and thymine (DNA) or uracil (RNA), and between guanine and cytosine.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0081">A &#x201c;protospacer adjacent motif&#x201d; (PAM) is typically a sequence of nucleotides located adjacent to (e.g., within 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 3, or 1 nucleotide(s) of a target sequence). A PAM sequence is &#x201c;immediately adjacent to&#x201d; a target sequence if the PAM sequence is contiguous with the target sequence (that is, if there are no nucleotides located between the PAM sequence and the target sequence). In some embodiments, a PAM sequence is a wild-type PAM sequence. Examples of PAM sequences include, without limitation, NGG, NGR, NNGRR(T/N), NNNNGATT, NNAGAAW, NGGAG, and NAAAAC, AWG , CC. In some embodiments, a PAM sequence is obtained from <i>Streptococcus pyogenes </i>(e.g., NGG or NGR). In some embodiments, a PAM sequence is obtained from <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(e.g., NNGRR(T/N)). In some embodiments, a PAM sequence is obtained from <i>Neisseria meningitidis </i>(e.g., NNNNGATT). In some embodiments, a PAM sequence is obtained from <i>Streptococcus thermophilus </i>(e.g., NNAGAAW or NGGAG). In some embodiments, a PAM sequence is obtained from <i>Treponema denticola </i>NGGAG (e.g., NAAAAC). In some embodiments, a PAM sequence is obtained from <i>Escherichia coli </i>(e.g., AWG). In some embodiments, a PAM sequence is obtained from <i>Pseudomonas auruginosa </i>(e.g., CC). Other PAM sequences are contemplated. A PAM sequence is typically located downstream (i.e., 3&#x2032;) from the target sequence, although in some embodiments a PAM sequence may be located upstream (i.e., 5&#x2032;) from the target sequence.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0082">In some embodiments, the effector protein is a recombinase. A &#x201c;recombinase&#x201d; is an enzyme that catalyzes directionally sensitive DNA exchange reactions between short (30-40 nucleotides) target site sequences that are specific to each recombinase. These reactions enable four basic functional modules: excision/insertion, inversion, translocation and cassette exchange, which have been used individually or combined in a wide range of configurations to control gene expression. Recombinases are known to those of skill in the art, and include, for example, those described herein. In some embodiments, the recombinase is selected from a Cre recombinase, a Tn3 resolvase, a Hin recombinase, or a Gin recombinase.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0083">Non-limiting, exemplary nucleotide and amino acid sequences for recombinases are provided below.

An &#x201c;epigenetic modifier&#x201d; refers to an enzyme that modifies a DNA base without changing the DNA sequence. For example, an epigenetic modifier catalyzes DNA methylation (and demethylation), acetylation (and deacetylation), or histone modifications (e.g., histone methylation/demethylation, acetylation/deacetylation, ubiquitylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, etc.). The presence of one more epigenetic modifications can affect the transcriptional activity of one or more genes, for example turning genes from an &#x201c;on&#x201d; state to an &#x201c;off&#x201d; state, and vice versa. Epigenetic modifiers include, but are not limited to, histone demethylase, histone methyltransferase, hydroxylase, histone deacetylase, and histone acetyltransferase. Exemplary epigenetic modifiers can be found in Konermann et al., Nature. 2013; 500, 472-476; Mendenhall et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31, 1133-1136; and Maeder et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31, 1137-1142; the entire contents of each are incorporated herein by reference.

regulator. A transcriptional regulator refers to an protein that regulates gene expression by activating or repressing the transcription of a gene. A transcriptional regulator may be a transcriptional activator or a transcriptional repressor. A transcriptional activator is a protein that increases gene transcription of a gene or set of genes. Most activators function by binding sequence-specifically to a DNA site located in or near a promoter and making protein-protein interactions with the general transcription machinery (RNA polymerase and general transcription factors), thereby facilitating the binding of the general transcription machinery to the promoter. A transcriptional repressor is a DNA- or RNA-binding protein that inhibits the expression of one or more genes by binding to the operator or associated silencers. A DNA-binding repressor blocks the attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter, thus preventing transcription of the genes into messenger RNA. An RNA-binding repressor binds to the mRNA and prevents translation of the mRNA into protein. Non-limiting, exemplary amino acid sequences of transcriptional regulators are provided below.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00005" num="00005"><table frame="none" colsep="0"

USA, 89:5547-5551 (1992)) combined the tetracycline repressor (tetR) with the transcription activator (VP 16) to create a tetR-mammalian cell transcription activator fusion protein, tTa (tetR-VP 16), with the tetO-bearing minimal promoter derived from the human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) major immediate-early promoter to create a tetR-tet operator system to control gene expression in mammalian cells. In one embodiment, a tetracycline inducible switch is used (Yao et al., Human Gene Therapy; Gossen et al., Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:5547-5551 (1992); Shockett et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 92:6522-6526 (1995)).</p><p id="p-0119" num="0112">Additionally, the vector can contain, for example, some or all of the following: a selectable marker gene, such as the neomycin gene for selection of stable or transient transfectants in mammalian cells; enhancer/promoter sequences from the immediate early gene of human CMV for high levels of transcription; transcription termination and RNA processing signals from SV40 for mRNA stability; SV40 polyoma origins of replication and ColE1 for proper episomal replication; internal ribosome binding sites (IRESes), versatile multiple cloning sites; and T7 and SP6 RNA promoters for in vitro transcription of sense and antisense RNA. Suitable vectors and methods for producing vectors containing transgenes are well known and available in the art.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0113">An expression vector comprising the nucleic acid can be transferred to a host cell by conventional techniques (e.g., electroporation, liposomal transfection, and calcium phosphate precipitation) and the transfected cells are then cultured by conventional techniques to produce the fusion proteins described herein. In some embodiments, the expression of the fusion proteins described herein is regulated by a constitutive, an inducible, or a tissue-specific promoter.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0114">The host cells used to express the fusion proteins described herein may be either bacterial cells such as <i>Escherichia coli, </i>or, preferably, eukaryotic cells. In particular, mammalian cells, such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), in conjunction with a vector such as the major intermediate early gene promoter element from human cytomegalovirus is an effective expression system for immunoglobulins (Foecking et al. (1986) &#x201c;Powerful And Versatile Enhancer-Promoter Unit For Mammalian Expression Vectors,&#x201d; Gene 45:101-106; Cockett et al.

Such host-expression systems represent vehicles by which the coding sequences of the isolated fusion proteins described herein may be produced and subsequently purified, but also represent cells which may, when transformed or transfected with the appropriate nucleotide coding sequences, express the fusion proteins described herein in situ. These include, but are not limited to, microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g., <i>E. coli </i>and <i>B. subtilis</i>) transformed with recombinant bacteriophage DNA, plasmid DNA or cosmid DNA expression vectors containing coding sequences for the fusion proteins described herein; yeast (e.g., <i>Saccharomyces pichia</i>) transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing sequences encoding the fusion proteins described herein; insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., baclovirus) containing the sequences encoding the fusion proteins described herein; plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g., cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) and tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g., Ti plasmid) containing sequences encoding the fusion proteins described herein; or mammalian cell systems (e.g., COS, CHO, BHK, 293, 293T, 3T3 cells, lymphotic cells (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,715), Per C.6 cells (human retinal cells developed by Crucell) harboring recombinant expression constructs containing promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g., the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter).</p><p id="p-0123" num="0116">In bacterial systems, a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the fusion proteins being expressed. For example, when a large quantity of such a protein is to be produced, for the generation of pharmaceutical compositions of fusion proteins described herein, vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable. Such vectors include, but are not limited, to the <i>E. coli </i>expression vector pUR278 (R&#xfc;ther et al. (1983) &#x201c;Easy Identification Of cDNA Clones,&#x201d; EMBO J. 2:1791-1794), in which the coding sequence may be ligated individually into the vector in frame with the lac Z coding region so that a fusion protein is produced; pIN vectors (Inouye et al. (1985) &#x201c;Up-Promoter Mutations In The 1pp Gene Of <i>Escherichia coli,</i>&#x201d; Nucleic Acids Res. 13:3101-3110; Van Heeke et al. (1989) &#x201c;Expression Of Human Asparagine Synthetase In <i>Escherichia coli,</i>&#x201d; J. Biol. Chem. 24:5503-5509); and the like. pGEX vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In general, such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption and binding to a matrix glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione. The pGEX vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor Xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned target gene product can be released from the GST moiety.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0117">In an insect system, <i>Autographa californica </i>nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) is used as a vector to express foreign genes. The virus grows in <i>Spodoptera frugiperda </i>cells. The coding sequence may be cloned individually into non-essential regions (e.g., the polyhedrin gene) of the virus and placed under control of an AcNPV promoter (e.g., the polyhedrin promoter).</p><p id="p-0125" num="0118">In mammalian host cells, a number of viral-based expression systems may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, the coding sequence of interest may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription/translation control complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination. Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g., region E1 or E3) will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing the immunoglobulin molecule in infected hosts (e.g., see Logan et al. (1984) &#x201c;Adenovirus Tripartite Leader Sequence Enhances Translation Of mRNAs Late After Infection,&#x201d; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3655-3659). Specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted antibody coding sequences. These signals include the ATG initiation codon and adjacent sequences. Furthermore, the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the desired coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert. These exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins, both natural and synthetic. The efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements, transcription terminators, etc. (see Bitter et al. (1987) &#x201c;Expression And Secretion Vectors For Yeast,&#x201d; Methods in Enzymol. 153:516-544).</p><p id="p-0126" num="0119">In addition, a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences, or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired. Such modifications (e.g., glycosylation) and processing (e.g., cleavage) of protein products may be important for the function of the protein. Purification and modification of recombinant proteins is well known in the art such that the design of the polyprotein precursor could include a number of embodiments readily appreciated by a skilled worker. Any known proteases or peptidases known in the art can be used for the described modification of the precursor molecule, e.g., thrombin or factor Xa (Nagai et al.

Appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed. To this end, eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript, glycosylation, and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used. Such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to CHO, VERY, BHK, HeLa, COS, MDCK, 293, 293T, 3T3, WI38, BT483, Hs578T, HTB2, BT20 and T47D, CRL7030 and Hs578Bst.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0121">A number of selection systems may be used, including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (Wigler et al.

The cationic lipid-mediated delivery of cargo proteins fused to a surface-modified supernegatively charged (&#x2212;30)GFP was recently reported, which results in the encapsulation and delivery of the cargo protein into mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo<sup>1</sup>. To discover polyanionic proteins with optimal properties for lipid-mediated protein delivery, highly negatively charged proteins from the human proteome were evaluated for their ability to delivery cargo proteins into cultured mammalian cells. It was discovered that a small, widely expressed, intrinsically disordered human protein, ProT&#x3b1;, enables &#x2dc;10-fold more efficient cationic lipid-mediated protein delivery compared to (&#x2212;30)GFP. ProT&#x3b1; enables efficient delivery of two unrelated genome editing proteins, Cre recombinase and zinc-finger nucleases, under conditions in which (&#x2212;30)GFP, lipid alone, or the cargo proteins alone do not result in substantial delivered genome editing activity. High negative charge is necessary, but not sufficient, for ProT&#x3b1;'s protein delivery activity, which is blocked by small molecules that impede liposome fusion, but not by drugs that inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. ProT&#x3b1; can enable protein delivery applications, including genome editing, when delivery potency is limiting.</p><p id="p-0186" num="0179">Proteins including genome editing agents represent an increasing proportion of biomedical research tools and new human therapeutics<sup>2</sup>. Due to their inability to spontaneously cross the lipid bilayer, however, current uses of protein tools and therapeutic agents are largely limited to targeting extracellular components<sup>3</sup>. Technologies to facilitate cytosolic access by proteins are critical to expanding the potential targets that can be accessed by exogenous proteins.</p><p id="p-0187" num="0180">Researchers have developed several approaches to facilitate protein translocation across the cytosol. Positively charged cell-penetrating peptides, such as the HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat) peptide<sup>4,5</sup>, poly-arginine<sup>6</sup>, or superpositively charged proteins<sup>3,7,8</sup>, allow a fused cargo protein to reach the cytosol via interaction with the highly anionic proteoglycans on the cell surface, followed by endocytosis<sup>9</sup>. However, escape from endosomes is generally very inefficient, and moreover any unencapsulated escaped proteins are susceptible to proteolytic degradation and neutralization by serum proteins and the extracellular matrix<sup>10</sup>.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0181">Lipid nanoparticles can encapsulate proteins to prevent degradation and neutralization by antibodies<sup>11</sup>. While cationic lipids are routinely used to transfect polyanionic nucleic acids into mammalian cells, they have not been widely used for protein delivery, as proteins vary in charge, and hence, vary in their ability to be encapsulated by cationic lipids<sup>12</sup>. To impart nucleic-acid-like properties onto proteins, it was previously demonstrated that fusing an anionic protein, such as an engineered (&#x2212;30)GFP with many surface-exposed negative charges, to a protein of interest enables its efficient encapsulation and delivery into mammalian cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>)<sup>1</sup>.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0182">While (&#x2212;30)GFP enables cationic lipids to deliver a variety of fused cargo proteins<sup>1</sup>, its discovery from protein engineering efforts unrelated to delivery<sup>13 </sup>suggests that more potent anionic proteins that mediate lipid-based protein delivery may exist. Moreover, the bacterial origin of (&#x2212;30)GFP likely will result in immunogenicity, potentially compromising the safety and efficacy of using this protein in vivo<sup>14</sup>.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0183">To address both limitations, it was sought to discover an improved protein tag for lipid-mediated protein delivery from the human proteome. A possible outcome was that the human proteome, which contains many proteins with high theoretical net charge, likely includes some highly anionic proteins that would mediate efficient lipid-based delivery of fused cargo proteins into mammalian cells.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0184">A candidate list of human proteins with &#x3e;0.75 net theoretical negative charges per kD was generated from the UniProt protein database (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>)<sup>15</sup>. To focus on proteins that are more likely to be easily expressed and purified as fusion partners with a wide range of potential cargo proteins, the list was narrowed down to proteins with published structures, known bacterial expression, and no extensive disulfide bonds or post-translational modifications.

Each purified fusion protein was encapsulated with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX, a commercially available lipid formulation previously used to mediate robust protein delivery of anionic proteins and protein complexes<sup>1</sup>. HeLa cells containing a genomically integrated dsRed gene preceded by a floxed transcriptional terminator<sup>7 </sup>were used to screen the fusion proteins for Cre delivery activity. Functional Cre delivery catalyzes recombination to remove the terminator, resulting in dsRed expression and red fluorescence. Delivery potency was defined as the protein concentration at which 50% of analyzed cells contain red fluorescence (EC<sub>50</sub>). While unfused Cre with RNAiMAX lipid induced red fluorescence in the assay at an EC<sub>50 </sub>of 73&#xb1;12 nM, fusion of (&#x2212;30)GFP to Cre lowered the EC<sub>50 </sub>with RNAiMAX to 10.1&#xb1;2.6 nM (Table 3)<sup>1</sup>.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0186">Seven of the 12 anionic human proteins tested from the set of 12 candidates did not substantially improve the efficacy of protein delivery when fused to the N-terminus of Cre recombinase compared to that of Cre alone (73 nM EC<sub>50</sub>) (Table 3). Their inability to do so may be due to an inability to support lipid encapsulation, or to interference with recombinase activity when fused to Cre. Four human proteins showed compatibility with lipid complexation and enhanced Cre delivery compared to that of unfused Cre, but their delivery potency did not exceed that of (&#x2212;30)GFP (10 nM EC<sub>50</sub>) (Table 3). One protein, human prothymosin alpha (ProT&#x3b1;), a small, intrinsically disordered protein<sup>16 </sup>with a net theoretical charge of &#x2dc;44, greatly improved the potency of Cre protein delivery 10-fold compared to that of (&#x2212;30)GFP, to an EC<sub>50 </sub>of 1.0&#xb1;0.2 nM (Table 3 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0195" num="0187">To verify the highly potent lipid encapsulation and delivery of ProT&#x3b1;, ProT&#x3b1;-Cre was delivered using lipid nanoparticles to two additional human cell lines containing genomically integrated RFP reporters based on HEK293 and BSR<sup>3 </sup>cells. Consistent with the delivery improvement observed in HeLa cells, ProT&#x3b1;-Cre also resulted in a large (approximately 10-fold) improvement in delivery potency compared to (&#x2212;30)GFP-Cre in both cell lines (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>F</figref>). Cre-mediated fluorescent activation was visually confirmed via microscopy to be consistent with these quantified changes in delivery potency (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). There was not any significant cellular toxicity observed during ProT&#x3b1;-mediated delivery (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0196" num="0188">ProT&#x3b1; contains a stretch of aspartate and glutamate residues that provide a concentrated region of anionic charge<sup>16</sup>. To investigate if a simple stretch of acidic residues of similar negative charge magnitude is sufficient to confer compatibility with cationic liposome delivery, two constructs were generated that have the same theoretical net charge with those of (&#x2212;30)GFP and ProT&#x3b1;, (&#x2212;30 and &#x2212;44, respectively) but with sequences containing scrambled Glu and Asp residues: (&#x2212;30)polyD/E and (&#x2212;44)polyD/E (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). Importantly, Cre fusions to (&#x2212;30)polyD/E or (&#x2212;44)polyD/E resulted in much poorer protein delivery potencies (EC<sub>50</sub>=62&#xb1;7.6 nM and 21&#xb1;3.2 nM, respectively) than fusions with (&#x2212;30)GFP or ProT&#x3b1; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). These results show that additional features beyond net theoretical charge within ProT&#x3b1; strongly contribute to its ability to enable highly potent lipid-mediated protein delivery.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0189">ProT&#x3b1; is universally expressed in human tissues and contains multiple domains that are hypothesized to be modular in function<sup>16</sup>. Researchers have associated multiple biological functions with ProT&#x3b1;, including histone chaperone activity implicated in nucleosome exchange<sup>17</sup>, extracellular immune modulation<sup>16</sup>, and cell proliferation<sup>18</sup>. To identify the domains within ProT&#x3b1; responsible for cationic lipid-mediated protein delivery, a series of truncated ProT&#x3b1; variants were generated and the Cre fusion protein delivery titrations were repeated in the presence of RNAiMAX lipid (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>).</p><p id="p-0198" num="0190">Deletion of the central anionic region almost completely abolished delivery by ProT&#x3b1; (EC<sub>50</sub>=36&#xb1;4.7 nM), consistent with the hypothesis that negative charges are critical for complexation with cationic lipids (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). Deletion of the N-terminal region, hypothesized to have receptor-binding properties<sup>16</sup>, also slightly increased the EC<sub>50 </sub>to 2.9&#xb1;0.4 nM, suggesting that ProT&#x3b1; might mediate liposome-cell membrane interaction via surface-exposed receptors, in addition to simple electrostatic charge attraction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). The deletion of its C-terminal region resulted in a 7.7-fold impairment of delivery potency (EC<sub>50</sub>=7.7&#xb1;0.8 nM, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). The C-terminus of ProT&#x3b1; contains a putative NLS<sup>16</sup>. To test the possibility that the NLS is responsible for delivery enhancements during ProT&#x3b1;-mediated delivery, Cre containing an additional N-terminal SV40 NLS was cloned, expressed, and delivered. Cre delivery did not benefit from an additional NLS, consistent with the known ability of Cre to localize to the nucleus spontaneously, and suggesting that the C-terminus domain assists ProT&#x3b1; protein delivery potency through mechanisms beyond facilitating nuclear localization (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). Taken together, these results indicate that multiple domains within ProT&#x3b1; contribute to its unusual cationic lipid-mediated protein delivery potency.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0191">Next, potential mechanisms of ProT&#x3b1;-mediated protein delivery were probed compared to those of canonical cationic liposomes, which are thought to enter cells through clathrin-dependent endocytosis<sup>19,20</sup>. Several inhibitors of various pathways involved in endocytosis and micropinocytosis were applied to observe possible effects on delivery, including sodium azide, which depletes cellular ATP<sup>21</sup>; ethylisopropyl amiloride (EIPA), a micropinocytosis inhibitor<sup>22</sup>; Dynasore (Dyna), a dynamin inhibitor<sup>23</sup>; methyl-B-cyclodextrin (MBCD), a cholesterol-depleting molecule that prevents lipid raft formation<sup>24</sup>; chloropramazine (CPZ), a clathrin-dependent endocytosis inhibitor<sup>25</sup>, and wortmannin (WTM), a PI3-kinase inhibitor that prevents clathrin-dependent endocytosis<sup>26</sup>. After pre-incubating various inhibitors with HEK293 cells containing the RFP Cre reporter, either (&#x2212;30)GFP-Cre or ProT&#x3b1;-Cre was combined with RNAiMAX lipid and cells with the resulting complex were treated for 4 hours. Excess liposomes and inhibitors were washed off through several washes with buffer containing heparin, and the cells were further incubated for 2 days.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0192">Flow cytometry analysis showed that MBCD almost completely negated cytosolic access, while CPZ and WTM caused mild inhibition of delivery (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). These data are consistent with a previous study<sup>27 </sup>that examined the mechanism of siRNA transfection using cationic lipids and implicated direct liposome fusion, which is acutely inhibited by MBCD, rather than clathrin-mediated endocytosis followed by endosomal escape, as the major source of functional cargo in the cytoplasm. Moreover, (&#x2212;30)GFP-Cre and ProT&#x3b1;-Cre were inhibited by the same molecules to nearly identical degrees, suggesting that the large delivery potency increase enabled by ProT&#x3b1; is predominantly due to its apparent ability to engage cationic lipids at &#x2dc;10-fold lower concentrations than (&#x2212;30)GFP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). Minimal cell toxicity was observed at the doses chosen for study (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0201" num="0193">Next, ProT&#x3b1; was applied as an unusually potent mediator of protein delivery to deliver zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), chimeric genome editing proteins composed of a modular DNA-binding zinc-finger domains and a heterodimeric FokI nuclease<sup>28</sup>. Two ZFNs (left and right) when targeted to adjacent half-sites of a genomic locus will bind together, enabling their fused FokI nuclease domains to dimerize and induce a double stranded DNA cut, initiating end-joining processes that result in indels at the target locus<sup>28</sup>. ZFNs are promising research tools and therapeutics, and are in multiple clinical trials for the treatment of diseases including HIV<sup>29</sup>.</p><p id="p-0202" num="0194">ZFNs have been shown to enter cells spontaneously at high concentrations under some conditions<sup>30</sup>. However, self-delivery of ZFNs requires serum-free media and &#x3bc;M protein concentrations, which are not relevant for some cell culture and for most in vivo applications. It was sought to test the ability of ProT&#x3b1; to mediate potent delivery of ZFNs with cationic lipids. Both left and right ZFNs were expressed targeting the AAVS1 safe harbor site in the human genome fused with ProT&#x3b1; at the N-terminus (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>). Before conducting protein delivery, it was confirmed that ProT&#x3b1; did not affect the activity of ZFNs in DNA cleavage assays in vitro conducted using purified substrates (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>) and in plasmid transfections of ZFN variants (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>). The concentration of protein and lipid was also optimized for ZFN delivery into HEK293T cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0203" num="0195">Finally, ProT&#x3b1;-ZFN fusions or unmodified ZFNs complexed with RNAiMAX lipid were delivered into HEK293T cells in the presence of 10% serum. After 2 days, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) showed robust ZFN-mediated indel formation only in cells treated with both pairs of ProT&#x3b1;-ZFN fusions and the lipid in the mid-nM concentration regime (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>). In contrast, cells treated with unmodified ZFNs complexed with RNAiMAX resulted in background level indels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>). Neither ZFNs only nor the ProT&#x3b1;-ZFN fusions resulted in substantial cytotoxicity at the concentrations tested when complexed with RNAiMAX (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>). Taken together, the findings show that ProT&#x3b1; enables potent delivery of both Cre recombinase and ZFNs at nM concentrations into human cells when combined with a simple commercially available cationic lipid.</p><p id="p-0204" num="0196">It is believed that ProT&#x3b1; represents the most potent reported protein that enables potent delivery of fused proteins via cationic liposomes. As ProT&#x3b1; expression is known in all human tissues tested<sup>16</sup>, it may serve as a less immunogenic domain for protein delivery than other non-human alternatives, such as (&#x2212;30)GFP. Based on previous studies on the use of anionic proteins to mediate cationic lipid-based protein delivery<sup>1,31</sup>, it is anticipated that ProT&#x3b1; will be compatible with a variety of commercial and non-commercial cationic lipid reagents. It is also envisioned that the ProT&#x3b1; may be particularly enabling when delivering proteins with adverse properties that preclude naked protein delivery via conventional cell-penetrating peptides, or that are not tolerated by the cell at higher concentrations.</p><heading id="h-0010" level="2">Methods</heading><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Cloning</heading><p id="p-0205" num="0197">PCR was performed using Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England BioLabs).
