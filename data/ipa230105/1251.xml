Most of the aerial performances are performed on silks, Lyra, trapeze, hammocks, or a custom apparatus of the performer's choice.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many of the pre-existing three-legged and four-legged aerial rigging structures are known to have height adjustment capability. Mostly, head portions and legs connecting arms formed on the head portion of such structures are fixed. After connecting the legs to the legs and connecting arms at the bottom of the head portions of such structures, the users are required to manually lift the positions of the legs or feet by sighting up each leg to straighten the legs as needed. This requires a lot of effort from users, the involvement of many people, and also requires the users to move around the rigging structures several times to get the rigging structures assembled correctly in the desired position. Due to having the fixed head portion and legs connecting arms, such known structures cannot be raised, assembled, and suspended above the ground surface using available mechanical advantages such as winching systems or similar mechanical systems.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, what is required is a self-supporting, mechanized, and portable rigging structure using the mechanical advantage to allow the rigging structure to be raised, assembled, and suspended above the ground surface using one or more pulley block and tackle systems and/or winches.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an objective of the present invention to provide a rigging system or a novel rigging structure that's portable and easy to set up and disassemble.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is another objective of the present invention to provide a self-supporting and portable rigging structure that can be raised, assembled, and suspended above the ground surface with lesser manpower and effort.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is another object of the present invention to provide a rigging structure with provisions on all the feet for interconnecting the legs of the rigging system together using a metal or non-metal wire so as to reduce or prevent buckling effect on the legs when the system has a load suspended from it.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is another objective of the present invention to provide a rigging structure that's safe and versatile and can be installed or configured in a variety of venues where performances need to be performed with ease.

Each of the holders <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b </i>comprises a pair of opposing plates <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>111</b><i>b</i>, a pair of legs connecting arms <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, each rotatably connected over a rod <b>110</b><i>c </i>configured in between the pair of opposing plates <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>111</b><i>b</i>, a pair of connecting side plates <b>113</b><i>a</i>, <b>113</b><i>b</i>, each rotatably connected over the rod <b>110</b><i>c </i>and adapted for holding the leg connecting arm <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>in specific angular position.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As particularly seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, the central shaft <b>108</b> includes a first end <b>108</b><i>a </i>and a second end <b>108</b><i>b</i>. The central shaft <b>108</b> may be made of any suitable metal able to sustain the load mounted thereon. The load <b>300</b> herein refers to different equipment or props and the performers, dancers, etc. using the equipment/props. The load <b>300</b> is connected to a central eyebolt <b>108</b><i>c </i>directly or using one or more carabiners <b>302</b> or similar connectors. In example, the central shaft <b>108</b> comprises a centrally located rotating/swivelling eyebolt <b>108</b><i>c</i>. The rotatable eyebolt <b>108</b><i>c </i>helps in mounting of the load or any props/equipments directly on it as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> without requiring any kind of additional swivelling equipments. In another embodiment, instead of rotating eyebolt <b>108</b><i>c</i>, the shaft <b>108</b> may have a fixed eyebolt. In addition to the central eyebolt <b>108</b><i>c</i>, the shaft <b>108</b> may comprise connectors <b>108</b><i>d </i>on either side of the eyebolt <b>108</b><i>c </i>to allow connectivity for other props or equipments as needed. In an example, the user can use pulley systems and mount the pulleys on these connectors <b>108</b><i>d </i>to perform some specific aerial acts.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">As further seen, the first end <b>108</b><i>a </i>of the shaft <b>108</b> is passed through the opposing plate <b>111</b><i>a </i>of the holder <b>110</b><i>a</i>, and is received by the opposing plate <b>111</b><i>b</i>. Likewise, the second end <b>108</b><i>b </i>of the shaft <b>108</b> is passed through the opposing plate <b>111</b><i>a </i>of the holder <b>110</b><i>b</i>, and is received by the opposing plate <b>111</b><i>b</i>. Further, each of the holders <b>110</b><i>a</i>,<b>110</b><i>b </i>includes the legs connecting arms <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, with each of the legs connecting arms <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>being rotatably mounted over the rod <b>110</b><i>c </i>to provide support to the shaft <b>108</b>. These legs connecting arms <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>located on each of the holders <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b </i>are angularly held in position using the side plates <b>113</b><i>a</i>, <b>113</b><i>b</i>. Further, each of the side plates <b>113</b><i>a</i>, <b>113</b><i>b </i>is rotatably mounted over the rod <b>110</b><i>c</i>. The side plates <b>113</b><i>a</i>, <b>113</b><i>b </i>include provisions to retain the legs connecting arms <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>in position or in angle and don't let the arms <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>to get displaced or slide in different positions. In order to facilitate this further, the legs connecting arms <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>are also connected to the side plates <b>113</b><i>a</i>, <b>113</b><i>b </i>using one or more fasteners such as screws, nut and bolts. Each of the side plates <b>113</b><i>a</i>, <b>113</b><i>b </i>are also connected to the opposing plates <b>111</b><i>b </i>using suitable fasteners. Further, each of the side plates <b>113</b><i>a</i>, <b>113</b><i>b</i>, the opposing plates <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>111</b><i>b</i>, the leg connecting arms <b>112</b><i>a</i>, and <b>112</b><i>b </i>comprises holes that allow these components to functionally interconnect with each other using the rods <b>110</b><i>c</i>. Each of the rods <b>110</b><i>c </i>is retained in place between the pair of opposing plates <b>111</b><i>a</i>, <b>111</b><i>b </i>using suitable fasteners. As can be understood from the mechanical construction of the head portion <b>102</b>, the head portion <b>102</b> acts as pivoting point for the rigging structure and the legs connecting arms <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>along with the side plates <b>113</b><i>a</i>, <b>113</b><i>b </i>are rotatable sidewise as indicated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. This helps in sliding pair <b>1</b> legs and pair <b>2</b> legs towards and away from each other possible using pulley block and tackle systems and/or winching systems.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Each of the plurality of legs <b>104</b> consists of multiple leg sections interconnecting each other. Depending upon the desired height for the rigging structure <b>100</b> above the ground surface, the user may require interconnecting two, three, four, or five leg sections for setting up each of the legs <b>104</b>. However, it should be understood that each of the plurality of legs <b>104</b> should consist of same number and/or like configuration of the leg sections. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the rig system <b>100</b> is shown with a maximum height say 15 or 16 feet. Each of the legs <b>104</b> includes a first leg section <b>104</b><i>a </i>that connects to the foot <b>106</b>, and one or more second leg sections <b>104</b><i>b </i>that connects to the first leg section <b>104</b><i>a</i>. The first leg section <b>104</b><i>a </i>may include a cleat <b>104</b><i>e </i>for tying off ropes. The first leg section <b>104</b><i>a </i>may be angled at one end so that it can properly connect to the foot <b>106</b>. The mechanism for interconnecting two leg pieces together is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. To elaborate, each of the leg sections preferably have two parts, a first part <b>105</b><i>a </i>and a second part <b>105</b><i>b</i>. The first part <b>105</b><i>a </i>incorporates holes <b>105</b><i>c </i>and the second part <b>105</b><i>b </i>incorporates push buttons <b>105</b><i>d</i>. As in example, the part <b>105</b><i>b </i>of the leg section <b>1</b> is inserted under the part <b>105</b><i>a </i>of the leg section <b>2</b>. The insertion is done by pressing the push buttons <b>105</b><i>d </i>of the leg section <b>1</b>. When the buttons <b>105</b><i>d </i>on the part <b>105</b><i>b </i>of the leg section <b>1</b> is slidably inserted inside the part <b>105</b><i>a </i>of the leg section <b>2</b>, the buttons <b>105</b><i>d </i>get into the holes <b>105</b><i>c </i>locking the two leg sections together. The same buttons and holes configuration is used in all the leg sections to interconnect with each other. Although in the shown example, the rigging structure <b>100</b> includes five leg sections <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>104</b><i>b</i>. One of the leg sections <b>104</b><i>a</i>, <b>104</b><i>b </i>may require just presence of holes or the buttons instead of both according to some embodiments. It should be understood that one can use lesser or more number of leg sections for constructing each leg <b>104</b> depending upon desired height of the rigging structure <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>8</b></figref> together with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> demonstrates about the process of assembling or setting up of the rigging structure <b>100</b> by interconnecting various components and/or parts and a mechanical advantage of the structure <b>100</b> being able to be raised, assembled and suspended above the ground surface using one or more pulley block and tackle systems and/or winches.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The process of setting up or installation of the system <b>100</b> (as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) starts with the use of the head portion <b>102</b>. For the ease of installation, the head portion <b>102</b> is lifted and temporarily mounted over a pair of support stands <b>202</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Although, a pair of stands <b>202</b> is shown in use, it should be understood that one can use even a single support stand <b>202</b> that's appropriately designed to support the head portion <b>102</b>. Further, it is also possible to use more than two support stands according to some other embodiments. It should be understood that the design and structure of the support stands do not form part of the invention. Once the head portion <b>102</b> is mounted on the stands <b>202</b>, the user can then connect one or more second leg sections <b>104</b><i>b </i>to each of the legs connecting arms <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b </i>of the head portion <b>102</b> by rotating the head portion or the holders <b>110</b><i>a</i>, <b>110</b><i>b </i>over the stands <b>202</b>. Upon connecting the second leg sections <b>104</b><i>b </i>to the legs connecting arms <b>112</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>b</i>, the first leg section <b>104</b><i>a </i>is connected to the second leg sections <b>104</b><i>b</i>. The first leg section <b>104</b><i>a </i>of each of legs <b>104</b> is then finally connected to the feet <b>106</b> in order to form the complete legs <b>104</b>. The rigging structure <b>100</b> of the present invention includes four such legs, each pair (pair <b>1</b> and pair <b>2</b>) on one side.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Once the legs <b>104</b> are connected to the head portion <b>102</b>, the rigging structure <b>100</b> is then taken off the stands <b>202</b> and made to stand on a substantially flat surface on ground or stage or like location in its initial position according to one embodiment. In another embodiment, the rigging structure <b>100</b> may be taken off the stands <b>202</b> automatically during the pulling of the legs <b>104</b>. When taken off the stands <b>202</b> and made to stand on the ground, each pair of legs <b>104</b> (denoted as pair <b>1</b> and pair <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) of the rigging structure <b>100</b> are oriented at a distant location from each other resulting in lower height of the rigging structure as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>. This height may not always be desirable for performing aerial acts or dance or aerial activities. Also, an essence of this invention is interconnecting the legs <b>104</b> of the rigging structure <b>100</b> together using a metal or a non-metal wire <b>109</b> so as to reduce or prevent buckling effect occurring on the legs <b>104</b> while the load <b>300</b> is attached to it. To attain to the interconnectivity between the legs <b>104</b> and to increase the height of the rigging structure <b>100</b> to a desired level above ground, it becomes essential for each pair of legs (pair <b>1</b> and pair <b>2</b>) to be pulled towards each other in order to bring the rigging structure <b>100</b> to an intermediate or final position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>B and <b>8</b>C</figref> respectively so as to connect the legs <b>104</b> together using the metal or a non-metal wires <b>109</b><i>a</i>-<b>109</b><i>d </i>for stability. As an essence of this invention, the structure <b>100</b> acts as a pivoting system. To elaborate, while the pair <b>1</b> legs are pulled towards pair <b>2</b> legs then pair <b>2</b> legs remains pivoted. Likewise, when the pair <b>2</b> legs are pulled towards pair <b>1</b> legs, pair <b>1</b> legs remain pivoted, and this raises the structure <b>100</b> in height.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, in particular shows, the metal wire <b>109</b><i>a </i>with two ends laid on the ground, and two pulley block and tackle systems, namely 4:1 pulley block and tackle system and 2:1 pulley block and tackle system. The 4:1 pulley block and tackle system is preferably deployed for connecting to one end of the metal wire <b>109</b><i>a </i>and the foot of the leg <b>104</b> (one of the pair <b>1</b> legs). Another 4:1 pulley block and tackle system (present on opposing side and not visible) can be deployed connecting to one end of another metal wire <b>109</b><i>b </i>(not seen) and the foot of the leg <b>104</b> (one of the pair <b>1</b> legs not visible). The users are able to pull one end of the rope from the 4:1 pulley block and tackle systems to pull the legs <b>104</b> (pair <b>1</b> legs) together towards pair <b>2</b> legs. The pair <b>2</b> legs at this point acts as pivot and do not move. This raises the structure <b>100</b>. Likewise, 2:1 pulley block and tackle system is preferably deployed connecting to another end of the metal wire <b>109</b><i>a </i>and the foot of the leg <b>104</b> (one of pair <b>2</b> legs). Another 2:1 pulley block and tackle system (present on opposing side and not visible) can be deployed connecting to another end of the metal wire <b>109</b><i>b </i>(not seen) and the foot of the leg <b>104</b> (one of pair <b>2</b> legs). The users are able to pull one end of the rope from the 2:1 pulley block and tackle systems to pull the legs <b>104</b> (pair <b>2</b> legs) towards pair <b>1</b> legs. The pair <b>1</b> legs at this point acts as pivot to raise the structure <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> shows the setup configuration once the users have pulled the pair <b>1</b> legs simultaneously towards the pair <b>2</b> legs using the 4:1 pulley block and tackle systems, which facilitates connecting the one end of the metal wires <b>109</b><i>a</i>, <b>109</b><i>b </i>to the feet of the pair <b>1</b> legs. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> also shows the 4:1 pulley and tackle system removed from the rigging structure <b>100</b> once the operation of pulling of the pair <b>1</b> legs is completed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> also shows increases height of the rigging structure <b>100</b> affected by the pull of the pair <b>1</b> legs. Likewise, the un-operated 2:1 pulley block and tackle system is then operated to further increase the rigging structure's height to a maximum level as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>, which then allows connectivity between the pair <b>2</b> legs to the remaining end of the metal wires <b>109</b><i>a</i>, <b>109</b><i>b</i>. Once the metal wires <b>109</b><i>a</i>,<b>109</b><i>b </i>connect the pair <b>1</b> legs to pair <b>2</b> legs, additional metal wires <b>109</b><i>c</i>, and <b>109</b><i>d </i>can be used to connect each of the pair <b>1</b> legs together, and each of the pair <b>2</b> legs together respectively. The movement of pair <b>1</b> legs and pair <b>2</b> legs towards each other is facilitated by wheels present on the feet <b>206</b> of the legs <b>104</b>. The wheels may be configured to be removed once the rig system is set up fully. Further, although for the purpose of this example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>C</figref>, 4:1 and 2:1 pulley block and tackle systems are shown in use. It should be understood that based on desired force and heaviness of the rigging structure <b>100</b> one can use various other pulley block and tackle configurations. In some embodiment, one may implement the system without use of any pulley block and tackle system. In the context of the present invention, a pulley block and tackle system refers to combination of one or more single or double pulleys and a rope. Suitable pulleys available in the market can be used to form desired pulley block and tackle system that can provide desirable pulling force.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is mainly similar to intermediate position of the rigging structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> with the 2:1 pulley block and tackle system in use. As seen, the rigging structure <b>100</b> is set up on the ground, the metal wire <b>109</b><i>a </i>and metal wire <b>109</b><i>b </i>(not seen) are connected to the feet <b>106</b> of the legs <b>104</b> (pair <b>2</b> legs) at their one end, and the other end of the metal wires <b>109</b><i>a</i>, <b>109</b><i>b </i>are connected to one end of the 2:1 pulley block and tackle system (using a carabiner or like connector). The use of 2:1 pulley block and tackle system is shown here as an example and one skilled in the art should understand that any other pulley block and tackle configuration can be used depending upon the pull force required for pulling the legs <b>104</b>. The 2:1 pulley block and tackle systems (there are two such systems, one for each of the pair <b>1</b> legs) is further connected to the feet of the legs <b>104</b> (pair <b>1</b> legs). During operation, the users (preferably two users) hold one end of the 2:1 pulley block and tackle systems and then pull the rope, which then applies a force on the other end of the rope connected to the metal wires <b>109</b><i>a</i>, <b>109</b><i>b </i>and pulls the pair <b>2</b> legs towards pair <b>1</b> legs. Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows a similar set up of the rigging structure <b>100</b>, however instead of using the 2:1 pulley block and tackle system or any pulley block and tackle systems, the system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> deploys a winch system <b>400</b> mounted on the legs <b>104</b> for raising the rig's height. In contrast to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the one end of the wires <b>109</b><i>a</i>, <b>109</b><i>b </i>is connected to a retractable strap of the winch systems <b>400</b>. Although only one winch system is visible, it should be understood that there are two winch systems in order to pull pair <b>2</b> legs together towards pair <b>1</b> legs. Once the one end of the wires <b>109</b><i>a</i>, <b>109</b><i>b </i>is connected to the retractable strap of the two winch systems <b>400</b>, the users can rotate handles of the respective winch system to wind in or retract the strap within the winch system <b>400</b> which then forces the connected pair <b>2</b> legs to move towards the pair <b>1</b> legs. The winching systems are devices used to wind a cable or a rope or a strap in or out and are well known conventional devices and thus the details pertaining to the winch system <b>400</b> is omitted from the description.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Description and details for some of mechanical components such as carabiners, locking pins, fasteners, and others is intentionally omitted as their uses and functionalities should be obvious to the person skilled in the art and to keep the draft concise. Different parts, components forming the rigging structure of the present invention can be made using known mechanical techniques and can be made in various different sizes and using variety of materials. Thus, although particular embodiments of the invention have been described in detail for purposes of illustration, various modifications and enhancements may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
