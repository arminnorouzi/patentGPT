method and apparatus for coupling a soft tissue implant into a locking cavity formed within a bone is disclosed. The apparatus includes a member to pull the soft tissue implant into a femoral tunnel. The member includes a suture having first and second ends which are passed through first and second openings associated with the longitudinal passage to form a pair of loops. Portions of the suture lay parallel to each other within the suture. Application of tension onto the suture construction causes retraction of the soft tissue implant into the femoral tunnel.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000"

Despite their widespread use, several improvements in the use of sutures and suture anchors may be made. For example, the procedure of tying knots may be very time consuming, thereby increasing the cost of the procedure and limiting the capacity of the surgeon. Furthermore, the strength of the repair may be limited by the strength of the knot. This latter drawback may be of particular significance if the knot is tied improperly as the strength of the knot in such situations may be significantly lower than the tensile strength of the suture material.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">To improve on these uses, sutures having a single preformed loop have been provided. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> represents a prior art suture construction. As shown, one end of the suture is passed through a passage defined in the suture itself. The application of tension to the ends of the suture pulls a portion of the suture through the passage, causing a loop formed in the suture to close. Relaxation of the system, however may allow a portion of the suture to translate back through the passage, thus relieving the desired tension.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is an object of the present teachings to provide an alternative device for anchoring sutures to bone and soft tissue. The device, which is relatively simple in design and structure, is highly effective for its intended purpose.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">To overcome the aforementioned deficiencies, a method for configuring a braided tubular suture and a suture configuration are disclosed. The method includes passing a first end of the suture through a first aperture into a passage defined by the suture and out a second aperture defined by the suture so as to place the first end outside of the passage. A second end of the suture is passed through the second aperture into the passage and out the first aperture so as to place the second end outside of the passage.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method of surgically implanting a suture construction in a femoral tunnel is disclosed. A suture construction is formed by passing the suture through a bore defined by a locking member. A first end of the suture is passed through a first aperture within the suture into a passage defined by the suture and out a second aperture defined by the suture so as to place the first end outside of the passage and define a first loop. A second end of the suture is then passed through the second aperture into the passage and out the first aperture so as to place the second end outside of the passage, and define a second loop. The first and second ends and the first and second loops are then passed through the femoral tunnel. Soft tissue is then passed through the first and second loops. Tension is applied onto the first and second ends to constrict the first and second loops about the soft tissue.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, a method of surgically implanting a suture is disclosed. The suture is passed through a bore defined by a first fastener. A suture construction is formed by passing the suture through a bore defined by a locking member. A first end of the suture is passed through a first aperture within the suture into a passage defined by the suture and out a second aperture defined by the suture so as to place the first end outside of the passage and define a first loop. A second end of the suture is then passed through the second aperture into the passage and out the first aperture so as to place the second end outside of the passage, and define a second loop. A second fastener is coupled to at least one of the first and second loops. After the fastener is coupled to the patient, tension is applied onto the first and second ends to constrict at least one of the first and second loops.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment a method of surgically implanting a soft tissue replacement for attaching two bone members is disclosed. A first and second tunnels are formed in first and second bones. A locking member having a first profile which allows insertion of the locking member through the tunnel and a second profile which allows engagement with the positive locking surface upon rotation of the locking member is provided. The suture construction described above is coupled to the locking member. The first and second ends and the first and second loops of the construction and the locking member are threaded through the first and second tunnels. Soft tissue is threaded through the first and second loops so as to engage bearing surfaces on the first and second loops. The locking member is then engaged.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided herein.

It should be understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals indicate like or corresponding parts and features.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> represents a suture construction <b>20</b> according to the present teachings. Shown is a suture <b>22</b> having a first end <b>24</b> and a second end <b>26</b>. The suture <b>22</b> is formed of a braided body <b>28</b> that defines a longitudinally formed hollow passage <b>30</b> therein. First and second apertures <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are defined in the braided body <b>28</b> at first and second locations of the longitudinally formed passage <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Briefly referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a first end <b>24</b> of the suture <b>22</b> is passed through the first aperture <b>32</b> and through longitudinal passage <b>30</b> formed by a passage portion and out the second aperture <b>34</b>. The second end <b>26</b> is passed through the second aperture <b>34</b>, through the passage <b>30</b> and out the first aperture <b>32</b>. This forms two loops <b>46</b> and <b>46</b>&#x2032;. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the relationship of the first and second apertures <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> with respect to the first and second ends <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> can be modified so as to allow a bow-tie suture construction <b>36</b>. As described below, the longitudinal and parallel placement of first and second suture portions <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> of the suture <b>22</b> within the longitudinal passage <b>30</b> resists the reverse relative movement of the first and second portions <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> of the suture once it is tightened.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first and second apertures are formed during the braiding process as loose portions between pairs of fibers defining the suture. As further described below, the first and second ends <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> can be passed through the longitudinal passage <b>30</b> multiple times. It is envisioned that either a single or multiple apertures can be formed at the ends of the longitudinally formed passage.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>, a portion of the braided body <b>28</b> of the suture defining the longitudinal passage <b>30</b> can be braided so as to have a diameter larger than the diameter of the first and second ends <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. Additionally shown are first through fourth apertures <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>42</b>, and <b>44</b>. These apertures can be formed in the braiding process or can be formed during the construction process. In this regard, the apertures <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>42</b>, and <b>44</b> are defined between adjacent fibers in the braided body <b>28</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, and described below, it is envisioned the sutures can be passed through other biomedically compatible structures.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref> represent alternate constructions wherein a plurality of loops <b>46</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are formed by passing the first and second ends <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> through the longitudinal passage <b>30</b> multiple times. The first and second ends <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> can be passed through multiple or single apertures defined at the ends of the longitudinal passage <b>30</b>. The tensioning of the ends <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> cause relative translation of the sides of the suture with respect to each other.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Upon applying tension to the first and second ends <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> of the suture <b>22</b>, the size of the loops <b>46</b><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>is reduced to a desired size or load. At this point, additional tension causes the body of the suture defining the longitudinal passage <b>30</b> to constrict about the parallel portions of the suture within the longitudinal passage <b>30</b>. This constriction reduces the diameter of the longitudinal passage <b>30</b>, thus forming a mechanical interface between the exterior surfaces of the first and second parallel portions as well as the interior surface of the longitudinal passage <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>11</b></figref>, the suture construction can be coupled to various biocompatible hardware. In this regard, the suture construction <b>20</b> can be coupled to an aperture <b>52</b> of the bone engaging fastener <b>54</b>. Additionally, it is envisioned that soft tissue or bone engaging members <b>56</b> can be fastened to one or two loops <b>46</b>. After fixing the bone engaging fastener <b>54</b>, the members <b>56</b> can be used to repair, for instance, a meniscal tear. The first and second ends <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> are then pulled, setting the tension on the loops <b>46</b>, thus pulling the meniscus into place. Additionally, upon application of tension, the longitudinal passage <b>30</b> is constricted, thus preventing the relaxation of the tension caused by relative movement of the first and second parallel portions <b>38</b>, <b>40</b>, within the longitudinal passage <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>11</b>B</figref>, the loops <b>46</b> can be used to fasten the suture construction <b>20</b> to multiple types of prosthetic devices. As described further below, the suture <b>22</b> can further be used to repair and couple soft tissues in an anatomically desired position. Further, retraction of the first and second ends allows a physician to adjust the tension on the loops between the prosthetic devices.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b><i>b </i></figref>represents the coupling of the suture construction according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> with a bone fastening member.

The application of tension to either the first or second end <b>24</b> or <b>26</b> will tighten the loops <b>46</b> or <b>46</b>&#x2032; separately.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>E</figref> represent potential uses of the suture constructions <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>7</b></figref> in an ACL repair. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, the longitudinal passage portion <b>30</b> of suture construction <b>20</b> can be first coupled to a fixation member or fastener <b>60</b>. The fixation member <b>60</b> can have a first profile which allows insertion of the fixation member <b>60</b> through the tunnel and a second profile which allows engagement with a positive locking surface upon rotation. The longitudinal passage portion <b>30</b> of the suture construction <b>20</b>, fixation member <b>60</b>, loops <b>46</b> and ends <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> can then be passed through a femoral and tibial tunnel <b>62</b>. The fixation member <b>60</b> is positioned or coupled to the femur. At this point, a natural or artificial ACL <b>64</b> can be passed through a loop or loops <b>46</b> formed in the suture construction <b>20</b>. Tensioning of the first and second ends <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> applies tension to the loops <b>46</b>, thus pulling the ACL <b>64</b> into the tunnel. In this regard, the first and second ends are pulled through the femoral and tibial tunnel, thus constricting the loops <b>46</b> about the ACL <b>64</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown, the suture construction <b>20</b> allows for the application of force along an axis <b>61</b> defining the femoral tunnel. Specifically, the orientation of the suture construction <b>20</b> and, more specifically, the orientation of the longitudinal passage portion <b>30</b>, the loops <b>46</b>, and ends <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> allow for tension to be applied to the construction <b>20</b> without applying non-seating forces to the fixation member <b>60</b>. As an example, should the loops <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> be positioned at the fixation member <b>60</b>, application of forces to the ends <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> may reduce the seating force applied by the fixation member <b>60</b> onto the bone.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>C</figref>, the body portion <b>28</b> and parallel portions <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> of the suture construction <b>20</b> remain disposed within to the fixation member <b>60</b>. Further tension of the first ends draws the ACL <b>64</b> up through the tibial component into the femoral component. In this way, suture ends can be used to apply appropriate tension onto the ACL <b>64</b> component. The ACL <b>64</b> would be fixed to the tibial component using a plug or screw as is known.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">After feeding the ACL <b>64</b> through the loops <b>46</b>, tensioning of the ends allows engagement of the ACL with bearing surfaces defined on the loops. The tensioning pulls the ACL <b>64</b> through a femoral and tibial tunnel. The ACL <b>64</b> could be further coupled to the femur using a transverse pin or plug. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>E</figref>, once the ACL is fastened to the tibia, further tensioning can be applied to the first and second ends <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> placing a desired predetermined load on the ACL. This tension can be measured using a force gauge. This load is maintained by the suture configuration. It is equally envisioned that the fixation member <b>60</b> can be placed on the tibial component <b>66</b> and the ACL pulled into the tunnel through the femur. Further, it is envisioned that bone cement or biological materials may be inserted into the tunnel <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>D</figref> represent a close-up of a portion of the suture <b>20</b>. As can be seen, the portion of the suture defining the longitudinal passage <b>30</b> has a diameter d<sub>1 </sub>which is larger than the diameter d<sub>2 </sub>of the ends <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>. The first aperture <b>32</b> is formed between a pair of fiber members. As can be seen, the apertures <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> can be formed between two adjacent fiber pairs <b>68</b>, <b>70</b>. Further, various shapes can be braided onto a surface of the longitudinal passage <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The sutures are typically braided of from 8 to 16 fibers. These fibers are made of nylon or other biocompatible material. It is envisioned that the suture <b>22</b> can be formed of multiple type of biocompatible fibers having multiple coefficients of friction or size. Further, the braiding can be accomplished so that different portions of the exterior surface of the suture can have different coefficients of friction or mechanical properties. The placement of a carrier fiber having a particular surface property can be modified along the length of the suture so as to place it at varying locations within the braided constructions.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A and <b>14</b>B</figref> represent the coupling of suture construction <b>22</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> to a bone. The longitudinal passage <b>30</b> is coupled to a fixation member <b>60</b> which can be disposed within an aperture formed in the bone. The fixation member <b>60</b> can be, for example, a staple or a bone engaging screw. After coupling the suture construction <b>22</b> to the bone, loops <b>46</b> and <b>47</b> and ends <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> are readily accessible by the physician. The application of tension to the ends <b>24</b> and/or <b>26</b> causes the loops <b>46</b> and <b>47</b> to constrict. The loops <b>46</b> and <b>47</b> can be used to couple two or more portions of the anatomy.
