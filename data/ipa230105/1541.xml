The bonded abrasive articles can be used in various applications, including, for example, surface grinding, precision grinding operations (e.g., gear grinding operations), and the like. In one particular aspect, the abrasive article may include a bonded abrasive of a certain dimension and structure that has improved performance in foundry applications.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Reference herein to bonded abrasive articles includes reference to a three-dimensional volume of an abrasive material having abrasive particles contained within a volume of a bond material. Bonded abrasive articles can be distinct from coated abrasive articles that may utilize a single layer of abrasive particles contained in a layer of bond or adhesive material. Moreover, the bonded abrasive articles of embodiments herein may include some porosity within the three-dimensional volume of a bond material.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a flowchart for forming an abrasive article in accordance with an embodiment. As illustrated, the process for forming the abrasive article can begin at step <b>101</b> by forming a mixture that includes abrasive particles with a multimodal particle size distribution. The mixture can be a slurry, including a plurality of components homogeneously mixed in therein. In accordance with an embodiment, the process of forming the mixture can include providing a carrier material. A carrier material may be a liquid suitable for containing solid components therein. For example, in one particular embodiment, the carrier can include water; more particularly, it may consist essentially of water such as deionized water.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The process of forming the mixture may further include adding a bond precursor material to the carrier. A bond precursor material may be a material that becomes the bond material of the final-formed abrasive article. In accordance with an embodiment, the bond precursor material can include a powder material configured to form the bond material of the final-formed abrasive article. In one embodiment, the bond precursor material can include an inorganic material, such as, but not limited to, metals, metal alloys, ceramics, vitreous materials or frit materials, or any combination thereof. The bond precursor material may include inorganic material in an amorphous phase, polycrystalline phase, monocrystalline phase, or any combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with one embodiment, the bond precursor material may be added in a particular content. For example, mixture may include at least 1 wt % of the bond precursor material for a total weight of the mixture, such as at least 2 wt % or at least 3 wt % or at least 4 wt % or at least 5 wt % or at least 6 wt % or at least 7 wt % or at least 8 wt % or at least 9 wt % or at least 10 wt % or at least 12 wt % or at least 14 wt % or at least 16 wt % or at least 18 wt % or at least 20 wt % or at least 22 wt % or at least 24 wt % or at least 26 wt % or at least 28 wt % or at least 30 wt %. Still, in one non-limiting embodiment, the mixture may include not greater than 30 wt % of the bond precursor material for a total weight of the mixture, such as not greater than 28 wt % or not greater than 25 wt % or not greater than 22 wt % or not greater than 20 wt % or not greater than 18 wt % or not greater than 15 wt % or not greater than 12 wt % or not greater than 10 wt % or not greater than 8 wt % or not greater than 5 wt % or not greater than 3 wt %. The mixture may include a content of the bond precursor material in an amount within a range, including any of the minimum and maximum percentages noted above.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In accordance with another embodiment, the process of forming a mixture can include adding a gelling agent to the mixture. The addition of the gelling agent to the mixture may be completed at various times, including, for example, prior to the addition of any dry components. The gelling agent may be a material that facilitates changing the mixture into a gel. A gelling agent may be used in combination with gelling processes, including, for example, the addition of heat, to facilitate the gelation process.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with an embodiment, the gelling agent may be an organic material, such as a gum. For example, the gelling agent may be selected from the group consisting of agar, agarose, xanthan gum, carboxy methyl cellulose, gellan gum, carrageenan gum, guar gum, tara gum, cellulose gum, locust bean gum, pectin, or any combination thereof. For example, the gelling agent may be a combination of agar and pectin; or a combination of gellan gum; or a combination of guar gum, and agarose; or a combination of gellan gum and xanthan gum; or a combination of cellulose gum, locust bean gum, or pectic.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">For certain embodiments, the mixture may include a certain content of the gelling agent to facilitate the formation of an improved abrasive article. For example, the mixture may include at least 0.1 wt % of the gelling agent for a total weight of the mixture, such as at least 0.2 wt % or at least 0.5 wt % or at least 0.8 wt % or at least 1 wt % or at least 1.5 wt % or at least 2 wt % or at least 2.5 wt % or at least 3 wt % or at least 3.5 wt % or at least 4 wt % or at least 4.5 wt % or at least 5 wt % or at least 5.5 wt % or at least 6 wt % or at least 6.5 wt % or at least 7 wt % or at least 7.5 wt %. In one non-limiting example, the mixture may include not greater than 10 wt % of the gelling agent for a total weight of the mixture, such as not greater than 9 wt % or not greater than 8 wt % or not greater than 7 wt % or not greater than 6 wt % or not greater than 5 wt % or not greater than 4 wt % or not greater than 3 wt % or not greater than 2 wt % or not greater than 1 wt %. The mixture may include a content of the gelling agent in an amount within a range, including any of the minimum and maximum percentages noted above.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The mixture may further include abrasive particles configured to form the abrasive component of the final-formed abrasive article. The abrasive particles may be added to the mixture at various times, including, for example, after the addition of the bond precursor material to the mixture. Still, it will be appreciated, in other embodiments, the abrasive particles may be added in combination with one or more of the other components in the mixture, including, for example, but not limited to the gelling agent, the bond precursor material, or one or more additives. The abrasive particles may include a material such as from the group consisting of oxides, borides, nitrides, carbides, oxynitrides, oxycarbides, amorphous, monocrystalline, polycrystalline, superabrasive, or any combination thereof. In one particular embodiment, the abrasive particles can include alumina, and may consist essentially of alumina.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The mixture may include a certain content of abrasive particles to facilitate improved manufacturing and/or improved performance of the abrasive article. For example, in one embodiment, the mixture may include at least 20 wt % of the abrasive particles for a total weight of the mixture, such as at least 22 wt % or at least 24 wt % or at least 26 wt % or at least 28 wt % or at least 30 wt % or at least 35 wt % or at least 40 wt % or at least 45 wt % or at least 50 wt % or at least 55 wt % or at least 60 wt % or at least 65 wt % or at least 70 wt %. In another non-limiting embodiment, the mixture may include not greater than 80 wt % of the abrasive particles for a total weight of the mixture, such as not greater than 75 wt % or not greater than 70 wt % or not greater than 65 wt % or not greater than 60 wt % or not greater than 55 wt % or not greater than 50 wt % or not greater than 45 wt % or not greater than 40 wt % or not greater than 35 wt % or not greater than 30 wt %, such as not greater than 25 wt %. The mixture may include a content of the abrasive particles in an amount within a range, including any of the minimum and maximum percentages noted above.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an embodiment, the abrasive particles in the mixture can have a multimodal particle size distribution. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> includes a non-limiting example of a multimodal distribution. The particle size distribution can have a first mode, Sab<b>1</b>, corresponding to a first particle size and a second mode, Sab<b>2</b>, corresponding to a second particle size, where Sab<b>1</b> is smaller than Sab<b>2</b>. The first mode can have a first height SabH<b>1</b>, and the second mode can have a second height SabH<b>2</b>. The distribution also includes a particle size SabAVG, equal to the average of Sab<b>1</b> and Sab<b>2</b> ((Sab<b>1</b>+Sab<b>2</b>)/2).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an embodiment, the first mode Sab<b>1</b> can be a particular particle size that may facilitate improved manufacturing and/or improved performance of the abrasive article. In an embodiment, Sab<b>1</b> can be at least at least 5 microns or at least 10 microns or at least 15 microns or at least 20 microns or at least 25 microns or at least 30 microns or at least 35 microns or at least 40 microns or at least 45 microns or at least 50 microns or at least 55 microns or at least 60 microns. In another embodiment, Sab<b>1</b> can be no greater than 150 microns or no greater than 140 microns or no greater than 130 microns or no greater than 120 microns or no greater than 110 microns or no greater than 100 microns or no greater than 95 microns or no greater than 90 microns or no greater than 85 microns or no greater than 80 microns or no greater than 75 microns or no greater than 70 microns or no greater than 65 microns or no greater than 60 microns or no greater than 55 microns. It will be appreciated that Sab<b>1</b> can be between any of the minimum and maximum values noted above, including for example, but not limited to, at least 5 microns and no greater than 100 microns, at least 30 microns and no greater than 100 microns, or at least 25 microns and no greater than 120 microns.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an embodiment, Sab<b>2</b> can be a particular particle size that may facilitate improved manufacturing and/or improved performance of the abrasive article.

A single, pulse-echo ultrasound sensor (Model #KS75-1) with a 1 mHz immersion sensor and an active diameter of 19.0 mm is placed 1 inch from the wheel. The sensor is attached to a DC step motor that moves the sensor over the entire surface of the wheel while maintaining the 1-inch distance. UTWin V3.62 software is used to control the movement of the step motor. The gain is set at 10cB, 400V pulser, LP filter of 2.0 mHz, a HP filter of 0.5 mHz, and a 100 mHz sampling rate. The data is acquired and processed by JET color map array format to create an RGB image via the UTWin software.

The abrasive bodies were aligned with and contacted the outlet of a sandblasting device. Fine quartz was fired at abrasive bodies with a pressure of about 15 psi for 10 seconds, forming a small crater in the abrasive body. The quartz used was AGSCO testing sand provided by AGSCO that conforms to the ASTM C-778 Standard for Graded and 20/30 Sand. The depth of the craters in mm is measured using a depth gauge. 24 total measurements were taken at different locations of the abrasive bodies.
