More particularly, the present invention relates to LED grow-light systems constructed with T-slot bars, light bars, electronics and accessories that secured through T-slot interconnects.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">A grow-light or plant light, is an artificial light source, generally an electric light, designed to stimulate plant growth by emitting a light appropriate for photosynthesis. Grow-lights either attempt to provide a light spectrum similar to that of the sun, or to provide a spectrum that is more tailored to the needs of the plants being cultivated. Depending on the type of plant being cultivated, the stage of cultivation (e.g. the germination/vegetative phase or the flowering/fruiting phase), and the photo-period required by the plants, specific ranges of spectrum, luminous efficacy and color temperature are desirable for use with specific plants and time periods.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Grow-lights are used for horticulture, indoor gardening, plant propagation, and food production, including indoor hydroponics and aquatic plants. Although most grow-lights are used on an industrial level, they can also be used in households.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the inverse-square law, the intensity of light radiating from a point source (in this case a bulb) that reaches a surface is inversely proportional to the square of the surface's distance from the source (if an object is twice as far away, it receives only a quarter the light) which is a serious hurdle for indoor growers, and many techniques are employed to use light as efficiently as possible. Reflectors are thus often used in the lights to maximize light efficiency. Plants or lights are moved as close together as possible so that they receive equal lighting and that all light coming from the lights falls on the plants rather than on the surrounding area. Therefore High Intensity Discharge (HID) lights are often used.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Common types of HID grow-lights include fluorescent grow-lights, Metal Halide (MH) grow-lights, Ceramic Metal Halide (CMH) grow-lights, High Pressure Sodium (HPS) grow-light, and Combination MH and HPS (&#x201c;Dual Arc&#x201d;) grow-lights. Because of the improved effectiveness, energy costs, and longevity, many grow-light systems now utilize LED technology.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">LED grow-lights are composed of light-emitting diodes, usually in a casing with a heat sink and built-in fans. White LED grow-lights provide a full spectrum of light designed to mimic natural light, providing plants a balanced spectrum of red, blue and green. However, the spectrum used varies. White LED grow-light are designed to emit similar amounts of red and blue light with an added green light to appear white.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">T-slot bars are generally extruded bars formed from metal. However, T-slot bars can also be formed from plastics, fiberglass and other suitable materials. T-slot bars have been used to from skeletal structures on walls to provide bracing for electrical and plumbing installations and can be interconnected together to form structures using nut/bolt-type of interlocking mechanisms. Aluminum T-slot bars are particularly useful from building larger structure on walls, ceilings and/or build suspended structures for supporting LED-grow lighting.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">One shortcoming of currently available LED grow-light systems is a rapid die-off in light density, and/or light intensity, from the central portion of an LED light canopy towards the outer edges of the LED light canopy. One solution would be to make a LED grow-light canopy that is substantially larger that the grow bed being illuminated by the LED grow-light canopy. This solution however is not satisfactory because of the increased footprint and inefficient energy consumption of the grow-light system. Currently available LED grow-light systems, are also not well suited for providing vertical light canopies for vertical grow beds. Furthermore, the LED grow-light canopy generally needs to be manually raised or lowered to accommodate the growth of plants or change lighting intensity above the grow bed within a central illumination area.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention to a dual-layer LED grow-light system includes grow-light canopies that maintain a small footprint and provide uniform lighting above a grow bed to the central illumination area. The grow-light canopies include a number of LED light bars, that are preferably elongated linear LED light bars, arranged in parallel on the canopy support structure. Each of the LED light bars include LEDs, or arrays of LEDs, arranged along a light emitting surface. The light emitting surfaces of the linear LED light bars collectively illuminate a grow bed positioned relative to the grow-light canopies.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The LEDs utilized in the LED light bars of the present invention can include LEDs emitting light having any number of wavelengths/colors, or combinations of wavelengths/colors, suitable for the application at hand. The LEDs utilized in the linear LED light bars can be tunable to change light emitting profiles and can also be dimmed to change the intensity of light emitted from individual LED light bars or collectively from all of the LED light bars.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with the embodiments of the invention, the operation of the grow-light system and/or position of the grow-light canopy is controlled by a control module. The control module includes a computer with a micro-processor and memory. The computer is configured to run software stored on the memory and implement grow-light protocols or programs. The grow-light protocols or programs can be dynamically modified in response to environmental feed-back from a number of sensors located on or near LED grow-light system. The control module can, for example, control the intensity or density of light emitted, the distribution light emitted, and/or the wavelength of light emitted from light emitting surfaces of the LED light bars, to comply with a grow-light protocol or program suitable for the vegetation being cultivated and also preferably control vertical positioning of the grow-light canopy, such as described below.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, the grow-light canopy provides substantially uniform light density and/or light intensity over the a central illumination area of a grow bed by reducing the light density and/or light intensity die-off at outer edges of the light canopy. Light density refers to a summation of photons emitted of all wavelengths over an area, and light intensity refers to a number of photons emitted for a selected wavelength over the area; light density and light intensity can, in some cases, be used interchangeably. Luminous flux (in lumens) is a measure of the total amount of light output in all directions, while luminous intensity (in candelas) is a measure of beam brightness in a particular direction. This application is generally concerned with luminous intensity of light that reaches a grow bed positioned below a grow-light canopy. However, it is understood that for unfocused light, luminous flux and luminous intensity are generally proportional to each other.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">To reduce die-off of light density and/or light intensity at outer edges of a grow-light canopy, the present invention utilizes LED light bars with spatially modulated LED configurations. For example, LEDs, or arrays of LEDs, are spaced or positioned along the light emitting surfaces such that distances between adjacent LEDs, or arrays of LEDs, are sequentially reduced, when moving from the center portion of the light emitting surface of a LED light bar to the two end portions of the light emitting surfaces of the LED light bar.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In further embodiments of the present invention, LED light bars with physically modulated LED configurations are utilized, wherein larger arrays of LEDs are positioned near end portions of the light emitting surfaces of LED light bars, and smaller arrays of LEDs are positioned near center portions of the light emitting surfaces of the LED light bars.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In yet further embodiments of the present invention, LED light bars are spatially modulated within the canopy, such that separations between adjacent LED light bars is greater near outer edges of the grow-light canopy than separations of the LED light bar near the center portions of the grow-light canopy.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, linear LED light bars, or a portion thereof, are configured to move up and down relative to the grow bed. The linear LED light bars, and the portion that is configured to move up or down manually and/or automatically, respond to control commands from a controller module and/or feedback from the grow-light, sensors. The positions of the linear LED light bars relative to the grow bed can be controlled from a wireless control or a remote computer to execute grow-light protocols or programs. The positions of the linear LED light bars relative to the grow bed are preferably controlled through stepper motors attached to the LED grow-light canopy, which move up and down along vertical canopy support pole structures of the LED grow-light system.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Whether the LED grow-light system included one or more light canopies, the system is preferably constructed using a quick interconnect system for connecting T-slot bars and T-slot light bars together and/or installing T-slot bar structures to walls or ceilings and/or attaching electronic accessories to the T-slot bar structures.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The quick interconnect system of the present invention utilizes T-slot interconnects. A T-slot interconnect includes body portion with two substantially orthogonally and elongated interlock tabs positioned on opposed sides of the body portion. In operation, one of the elongated interconnect tabs is fitted into a T-slot channel of a T-slot bar and is rotated through the body portion, such that the elongated interconnect tab is locked within the T-channel of the T-slot bar.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the remaining elongated interconnect tab is placed into a T-channel of a second T-slot bar and the second T-slot bar is rotated such the remaining elongated interconnect tab is locked within the T-channel of the second T-slot bar to build a T-slot bar structure.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Alternatively, the two substantially orthogonally and elongated interlock tabs of a T-slot interconnect are placed within T-channels of two orthogonally positioned T-slot bars. The T-slot interconnect is then rotated through a body portion of the T-slot interconnect to secure the two substantially orthogonally and elongated interlock tabs within the T-channels of the two orthogonally positioned T-slot bars and, thereby, secure the T-slot bars in their respective orthogonal position. The T-slot interconnect is rotated through a body portion using a extended clip, hook, cable harnesses or other structure and/or a tool or a wrench, such as described below.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In further embodiments of the invention the T-slot interconnect has an extended clip, hook, harnesses or other structure attached to, for example, the body portion of the T-slot interconnect. The extended clip, hook, harnesses or other structure can be used for supporting or securing wiring or cables. Also, the extended clip, hook, harnesses or other structure can be used as a lever to rotate the T-slot interconnect to secure elongated interlock tabs within the T-channels of T-slot bars, such as described above.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In still further embodiments of the invention the body portion of a T-slot interconnect is formed from two hexagonally shaped parts or portions that are capable of being independently rotated with respect to each other using, for example with a wrench of other suitable tool. The two hexagonally shaped parts or portions are coupled to the opposed and elongated interconnect tabs and for independently rotating the opposed and elongated interconnect tabs and securing the opposed and elongated interconnect tabs within T-channels of T-slot bars, as described above.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">There are also a number of applications where T-slot interconnects are attached to one T-slot bar through one of the elongated interconnect tabs. For example, a T-bar interconnect can have mounting features or structures for attaching the T-bar interconnect to a wall, a ceiling or other structure for supporting an attached T-slot bar or T-slot bar structure. A T-bar interconnect can also be installed in one T-slot bar for holding cables/wires and/or supporting electronics while being attached to the T-slot bar.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The T-slot interconnects described above and below are used to secure elongated light bars with T-slots, referred to herein as T-slot light bars, to T-slot bars and build LED grow-light structures or grow-light canopies.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the invention, a conventional skylights and/or short cylinders coated in highly reflective material, also known as a light tube, is installed into the roof surface or side structure of a growing container. The light tube, in a straight or bent configuration, redirects sunlight from a collecting dome on the exterior of a container to a light emitting diffuser inside the container to supplement artificial lighting within any configuration of containers with very little loss in efficiency and minimal added heat transfer. Sensors monitor existing light availability, providing feedback for a central controller to control the function of the LED grow-light system to optimize PAR.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Skylights and optical tube of the present invention can also be used in warehouses, buildings do other enclosures alone or in combination with the grow-light canopy systems described herein</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings"
