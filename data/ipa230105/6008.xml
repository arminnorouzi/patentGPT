Therefore, in the embodiments of the present disclosure, in order to distinguish the structure of the light-emitting functional layer at different periods, the first light-emitting functional layer <b>14</b> and the second light-emitting functional layer <b>24</b> are used to distinguish, and those skilled in the art can understand that, the first light-emitting functional layer <b>14</b> is manufactured through the second light-emitting functional layer, or it can also be understood that the first light-emitting functional layer <b>14</b> is at least part of the second light-emitting functional layer <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">The spacer <b>17</b> exists in the manufacturing process of the display panel <b>1</b>, and it plays the role of supporting the FMM, so that the second light-emitting functional layer <b>24</b> may be smoothly manufactured; and after the second light-emitting functional layer <b>24</b> is manufactured, the sacrifice pattern <b>18</b> is removed, so that the spacer <b>17</b> is detached from the display panel <b>1</b>, and foreign particles, generated by the spacer <b>17</b> during the process of removing the FMM, may be removed, thereby providing a good support surface for the subsequent manufacturing of an encapsulation layer.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">The sacrifice pattern <b>18</b> is removed by, for example, wet etching or dry etching. The wet etching, for example, uses a stripping solution to dissolve the sacrifice pattern <b>18</b>; and dry etching, for example, uses a gas to react with the sacrifice pattern <b>18</b>, thereby etching the sacrifice pattern <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">After the sacrifice pattern <b>18</b> is removed, the spacer <b>17</b> loses its support, so that the spacer <b>17</b> is detached (also referred to as falling off) from the display panel <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the related art, since a material of the spacer <b>17</b> is an organic material, when the FMM is used, the FMM may scratch the spacer <b>17</b> during the installation or removal of the FMM, thereby generating foreign particles. The density of the spacers <b>17</b> and the foreign particles generated by the spacers <b>17</b> will affect the quality of a film layer manufactured after the first light-emitting functional layer <b>14</b>. The film layer manufactured after the first light-emitting functional layer <b>14</b> includes, for example, the encapsulation layer. The encapsulation layer includes at least an organic encapsulation sub-layer, and the organic encapsulation sub-layer may be formed by, for example, ink jet printing (IJP). A material of the organic encapsulation sub-layer has certain fluidity, so that the density of the spacers <b>17</b> may affect the fluidity of the organic encapsulation sub-layer. For example, in some regions where the density of the spacers <b>17</b> is great, the fluidity of the material of the organic encapsulation sub-layer is reduced, thereby forming a portion of the organic encapsulation sub-layers with a large thickness; while in some regions where the density of the spacers <b>17</b> is low, the fluidity of the material of the organic encapsulation sub-layer is increased, thereby forming a portion of the organic encapsulation sub-layer with a small thickness. As a result, the thicknesses of different portions of the organic encapsulation sub-layer are different, and the thickness uniformity is poor; moreover, the foreign particles may cause defects in the organic encapsulation sub-layer, which affects the encapsulation effect of the organic encapsulation sub-layer. In addition, due to a height difference of the spacers <b>17</b> (for example, in a length direction of the display panel <b>1</b>, the heights of the spacers <b>17</b> on the left and right sides are different), the brightness of the edge of the display panel <b>1</b> may be different from that of other areas of the display panel <b>1</b>, so that the display panel <b>1</b> has a color shift phenomenon, and the display effect is affected. Therefore, in the related art, the existence of the spacers <b>17</b> may affect the quality of the film layer manufactured after the first light-emitting functional layer <b>14</b>, and further affect the display effect of the display panel <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">In the embodiments of the present disclosure, during the manufacturing of the display panel <b>1</b>, the sacrifice patterns <b>18</b> and the spacers <b>17</b> are formed on the pixel defining layer <b>13</b> to support the FMM, and after the second light-emitting functional layer <b>24</b> is manufactured, the spacers <b>17</b> is removed by removing the sacrifice pattern <b>18</b>, so that the first light-emitting functional layer <b>14</b> having the second hollowed-out portions <b>140</b> is manufactured through the second light-emitting functional layer <b>24</b>. Therefore, when manufacturing the organic encapsulation sub-layer in the embodiments of the present disclosure, since there is no barrier of the spacers <b>17</b>, the film thicknesses of the different areas of the manufactured organic encapsulation sub-layer are closer to each other, and the film thickness uniformity is good, and thus the encapsulation effect of the panel <b>1</b> may be improved; furthermore, the foreign particles generated by the spacer <b>17</b> due to being scratched by the FMM may also be removed, so that the manufactured organic encapsulation sub-layer may not have defects due to the foreign particles, and the quality of the film layer may be good, and thus the encapsulation effect of the display panel <b>1</b> may be further improved. Moreover, since there is no spacers <b>17</b>, the display panel <b>1</b> may not have the color shift phenomenon due to the height difference of the spacers <b>17</b>, so that the display effect of the display panel <b>1</b> may be increased; in addition, since there is no spacers <b>17</b>, a thickness of the display panel <b>1</b> may be reduced, so that the display panel <b>1</b> with a small thickness may be manufactured, which is more in line with the trend of the display panel <b>1</b> developing towards lightness and thinness, and improves the market competitiveness of the display panel <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">In some embodiments, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>1</b>C, <b>1</b>E and <b>1</b>F</figref>, the orthogonal projection of the second hollowed-out portion <b>140</b> on the base <b>11</b> and the orthogonal projection of the second opening <b>1302</b> on the base <b>11</b> have a gap therebetween.
