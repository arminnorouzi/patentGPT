Enabling the high energy density and safety of Li-ion batteries requires the development of high-capacity, and high-voltage cathodes, high-capacity anodes and accordingly functional electrolytes with high voltage stability, interfacial compatibility with electrodes and safety.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">A lithium-ion battery typically includes a separator and/or electrolyte between an anode and a cathode. In one class of batteries, the separator, cathode and anode materials are individually formed into sheets or films. Sheets of the cathode, separator and anode are subsequently stacked or rolled with the separator separating the cathode and anode (e.g., electrodes) to form the battery. Typical electrodes include electro-chemically active material layers on electrically conductive metals (e.g., aluminum and copper). Films can be rolled or cut into pieces which are then layered into stacks. The stacks are of alternating electro-chemically active materials with the separator between them.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Si is one of the most promising anode materials for Li-ion batteries due to its high specific gravimetric and volumetric capacity (3579 mAh/g and 2194 mAh/cm<sup>3 </sup>vs. 372 mAh/g and 719 mAh/cm<sup>3 </sup>for graphite), and low lithiation potential (&#x3c;0.4 V vs. Li/Li<sup>+</sup>). Among the various cathodes presently available, layered lithium transition-metal oxides such as Ni-rich Li[Ni<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>y</sub>Mn(Al)<sub>1-x-y</sub>]O<sub>2 </sub>(NCM or NCA) are the most promising ones due to their high theoretical capacity (&#x2dc;280 mAh/g) and relatively high average operating potential (3.6 V vs Li/Li<sup>+</sup>). In addition to Ni-rich NCM or NCA cathode, LiCoO<sub>2 </sub>(LCO) is also a very attractive cathode material because of its relatively high theoretical specific capacity of 274 mAh g<sup>-1</sup>, high theoretical volumetric capacity of 1363 mAh cm<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, low self-discharge, high discharge voltage, and good cycling performance. Coupling Si anodes with high-voltage Ni-rich NCM (or NCA) or LCO cathodes can deliver more energy than conventional Li-ion batteries with graphite-based anodes, due to the high capacity of these new electrodes. However, both Si-based anodes and high-voltage Ni rich NCM (or NCA) or LCO cathodes face formidable technological challenges, and long-term cycling stability with high-Si anodes paired with NCM or NCA cathodes has yet to be achieved.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">For anodes, silicon-based materials can provide significant improvement in energy density. However, the large volumetric expansion (&#x3e;300%) during the Li alloying/dealloying processes can lead to disintegration of the active material and the loss of electrical conduction paths, thereby reducing the cycling life of the battery. In addition, an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer can develop on the surface of the cycled anodes, and leads to an endless exposure of Si particle surfaces to the liquid electrolyte. This results in an irreversible capacity loss at each cycle due to the reduction at the low potential where the liquid electrolyte reacts with the exposed surface of the Si anode. In addition, oxidative instability of the conventional non-aqueous electrolyte takes place at voltages beyond 4.5 V, which can lead to accelerated decay of cycling performance. Because of the generally inferior cycle life of Si compared to graphite, only a small amount of Si or Si alloy is used in conventional anode materials.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The NCM (or NCA) or LCO cathode usually suffers from an inferior stability and a low capacity retention at a high cut-off potential. The reasons can be ascribed to the unstable surface layer's gradual exfoliation, the continuous electrolyte decomposition, and the transition metal ion dissolution into electrolyte solution. The major limitations for LCO cathode are high cost, low thermal stability, and fast capacity fade at high current rates or during deep cycling. LCO cathodes are expensive because of the high cost of Co. Low thermal stability refers to exothermic release of oxygen when a lithium metal oxide cathode is heated. In order to make good use of Si anode//NCM or NCA cathode-, and Si anode//LCO cathode-based Li-ion battery systems, the aforementioned barriers need to be overcome.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">One strategy for overcoming these barriers includes exploring new electrolyte additives in order to make good use of Si anode//NCM or NCA cathode-, and Si anode//LCO cathode-based full cells. The next generation of electrolyte additives to be developed should be able to form a uniform, stable SEI layer on the surface of Si anodes. This layer should have low impedance and be electronically insulating, but ionically conductive to Li-ion. Additionally, the SEI layer formed by the additive should have excellent elasticity and mechanical strength to overcome the problem of expansion and shrinkage of the Si anode volume. On the cathode side, the ideal additives should be oxidized preferentially to the solvent molecule in the bare electrolyte, resulting in a protective cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) film formed on the surface of the Ni-rich NCM (or NCA) and LCO cathodes. At the same time, it should help alleviate the dissolution phenomenon of transition metal ions and decrease surface resistance on cathode side. In addition, they could help improve the physical properties of the electrolyte such as ionic conductivity, viscosity, and wettability.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The term &#x201c;alkyl&#x201d; refers to a straight or branched, saturated, aliphatic radical having the number of carbon atoms indicated. The alkyl moiety may be branched or straight chain. For example, C1-C6 alkyl includes, but is not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, hexyl, etc. Other alkyl groups include, but are not limited to heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, etc. Alkyl can include any number of carbons, such as 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 1-5, 1-6, 1-7, 1-8, 1-9, 1-10, 1-11, 1-12 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6, 4-5, 4-6 and 5-6. The alkyl group is typically monovalent, but can be divalent, such as when the alkyl group links two moieties together.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The term &#x201c;fluoro-alkyl&#x201d; refers to an alkyl group where one, some, or all hydrogen atoms have been replaced by fluorine.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The term &#x201c;alkylene&#x201d; refers to an alkyl group, as defined above, linking at least two other groups, i.e., a divalent hydrocarbon radical. The two moieties linked to the alkylene can be linked to the same atom or different atoms of the alkylene.

The electrolyte or electrolyte additives can form a stable, electronically insulating but ionically conducting SEI layer on the surface of Si anodes. Additionally, these electrolytes or additives may also help modify cathode surfaces, forming stable CEI layers. These could enable the electrochemical stability of Li-ion batteries when cycled at higher voltages and help with calendar life of the batteries. In addition, to alleviate battery safety concerns, these additives may impart an increased thermal stability to the organic components of the electrolyte, drive a rise in the flash point of the electrolyte formulations, increase the flame-retardant effectiveness and enhance thermal stability of SEI or CEI layers on the surface of electrodes.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0038">In the present disclosure, the use of chemical compounds comprising sulfonate esters as electrolyte additives for energy storage devices with Si-dominant anodes are described. Due to their unique chemical structures and functional groups, sulfonate ester compound containing electrolyte additives may bring the following benefits: (i) stabilize solid/electrolyte interface film to reduce electrolyte reactions (oxidation on the NCM, NCA, or LCO cathode and reduction on the Si anode), prevent Si anode volume expansion, and protect transition metal ion dissolution from NCM or NCA cathode and stabilize the subsequent structure changes; and avoid the exothermic reaction between the released oxygen for LCO and organic electrolyte and enhance the thermal stability of LCO cathode; and (ii) reduce the flammability and enhance the thermal stability of organic electrolytes and increase the safety of electrolyte solutions. Due to their versatility in reaction chemistry and overall stability in electrochemical environments, as well as having excellent flame resistance or fire retardant properties, involving sulfonate ester compound containing electrolyte additives into electrolyte solutions may help improve both overall electrochemical performance and safety of Si anode-based Li-ion batteries.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0039">Typical carbon anode electrodes include a current collector such as a copper sheet. Carbon is deposited onto the collector along with an inactive binder material. Carbon is often used because it has excellent electrochemical properties and is also electrically conductive. If the current collector layer (e.g., copper layer) was removed, the carbon would likely be unable to mechanically support itself. Therefore, conventional electrodes require a support structure such as the collector to be able to function as an electrode. The electrode (e.g., anode or cathode) compositions described in this application can produce electrodes that are self-supported. The need for a metal foil current collector is eliminated or minimized because conductive carbonized polymer is used for current collection in the anode structure as well as for mechanical support. In typical applications for the mobile industry, a metal current collector is typically added to ensure sufficient rate performance. The carbonized polymer can form a substantially continuous conductive carbon phase in the entire electrode as opposed to particulate carbon suspended in a non-conductive binder in one class of conventional lithium-ion battery electrodes. Advantages of a carbon composite blend that utilizes a carbonized polymer can include, for example, 1) higher capacity, 2) enhanced overcharge/discharge protection, 3) lower irreversible capacity due to the elimination (or minimization) of metal foil current collectors, and 4) potential cost savings due to simpler manufacturing.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0040">Anode electrodes currently used in the rechargeable lithium-ion cells typically have a specific capacity of approximately 200 milliamp hours per gram (including the metal foil current collector, conductive additives, and binder material). Graphite, the active material used in most lithium ion battery anodes, has a theoretical energy density of 372 milliamp hours per gram (mAh/g). In comparison, silicon has a high theoretical capacity of 4200 mAh/g. In order to increase volumetric and gravimetric energy density of lithium-ion batteries, silicon may be used as the active material for the cathode or anode. Several types of silicon materials, e.g., silicon nanopowders, silicon nanofibers, porous silicon, and ball-milled silicon, have also been reported as viable candidates as active materials for the negative or positive electrodes. Small particle sizes (for example, sizes in the nanometer range) generally can increase cycle life performance. They also can display very high initial irreversible capacity. However, small particle sizes also can result in very low volumetric energy density (for example, for the overall cell stack) due to the difficulty of packing the active material. Larger particle sizes, (for example, sizes in the micron range) generally can result in higher density anode material. However, the expansion of the silicon active material can result in poor cycle life due to particle cracking. For example, silicon can swell in excess of 300% upon lithium insertion. Because of this expansion, anodes including silicon should be allowed to expand while maintaining electrical contact between the silicon particles.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0041">Cathode electrodes described herein may include metal oxide cathode materials, such as Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LiCoO<sub>2</sub>) (LCO), Ni-rich oxides, high voltage cathode materials, lithium-rich oxides, nickel-rich layered oxides, lithium rich layered oxides, high-voltage spinel oxides, and high-voltage polyanionic compounds.

Hard carbon can be a carbon that does not convert into graphite even with heating in excess of 2800 degrees Celsius. Precursors that melt or flow during pyrolysis convert into soft carbons and/or graphite with sufficient temperature and/or pressure.
