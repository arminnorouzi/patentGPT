System <b>100</b> as shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> includes a network controller device <b>10</b> that can communicate with one or more other devices such as network equipment <b>20</b>, one or more control devices <b>30</b> (e.g., network routers, firewalls, etc.), and/or other devices. In an aspect, the network controller device <b>10</b> can be utilized to facilitate dynamic filtering of malicious, harmful, or otherwise unwanted network traffic within one or more networks associated with the network controller device <b>10</b>. The network controller device <b>10</b> can be implemented as a standalone device that is communicatively coupled to the network equipment <b>20</b> and control devices <b>30</b> via respective networks or internetworks, or alternatively the network controller device <b>10</b> can be implemented via one or more elements of a core network environment associated with a network operator and communicate with the network equipment <b>20</b> and control devices <b>30</b> via an IP network or the like. Other implementations are also possible.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The network equipment <b>20</b> shown in system <b>100</b> can include, and/or implement the functionality of, a network controller, a base station, an access point, an Evolved Node B (eNB), a next generation Node B (gNB), user equipment devices (UE) or other mobile devices, and/or any other devices that can communicate with the network controller device <b>10</b> over one or more communication networks. In an aspect, the network equipment <b>20</b> can be configured to report and/or indicate the presence of malicious network traffic, such as that associated with malware, system intrusions, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks or the like, and/or other harmful or unwanted events to the network controller device <b>10</b>. Also or alternatively, the network controller device <b>10</b> can be configured to monitor traffic associated with the network equipment <b>10</b> and detect malicious or undesirable network traffic present in the monitored traffic. Other implementations could also be used.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The control devices <b>30</b> shown in system <b>100</b> can include standalone devices, network routers, firewall devices, and/or other network devices that regulate the flow of network traffic between communication networks associated with the network controller device <b>10</b>. For example, the control devices <b>30</b> can be provider edge (PE) router devices associated with an IP network implemented by a network service provider, e.g., as described in further detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, and/or any other device that can be operable to restrict and/or otherwise control the flow of network traffic between respective communication networks.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an aspect, the network controller device <b>10</b> can include one or more transceivers <b>12</b> that can communicate with (e.g., transmit messages to and/or receive messages from) the network equipment <b>20</b>, the control devices <b>30</b>, and/or other devices in system <b>100</b>. The transceiver <b>12</b> can include respective antennas and/or any other hardware or software components (e.g., an encoder/decoder, modulator/demodulator, etc.) that can be utilized to process signals for transmission and/or reception by the network controller device <b>10</b> and/or associated network devices such as a base station. Also or alternatively, the transceiver <b>12</b> can include an interface that facilitates communication with one or more elements of system <b>100</b>, such as the control devices <b>30</b> or the like, via backhaul connections.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an aspect, the network controller device <b>10</b> can further include a processor <b>14</b> and a memory <b>16</b>, which can be utilized to facilitate various functions of the network controller device <b>10</b>. For instance, the memory <b>16</b> can include a non-transitory computer readable medium that contains computer executable instructions, and the processor <b>14</b> can execute instructions stored by the memory <b>16</b>. For simplicity of explanation, various actions that can be performed via the processor <b>14</b> and the memory <b>16</b> of the network controller device <b>10</b> are shown and described below with respect to various logical components. It is noted that the logical components described herein can be implemented in hardware, software, and/or a combination of hardware and software. For instance, a logical component as described herein can be implemented via instructions stored on the memory <b>16</b> and executed by the processor <b>14</b>. Other implementations of various logical components could also be used, as will be described in further detail where applicable. In addition, an example computer architecture that can be utilized wholly or in part to implement various logical components described herein is described in further detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an aspect, the processor <b>14</b> and the memory <b>16</b> of the network controller device <b>10</b> can facilitate a dynamic and automated implementation of security controls across multiple networks, including networks of a same communication technology or different technologies. Additionally, the network controller device <b>10</b>, via the processor <b>14</b> and memory <b>16</b>, can use data from multiple types of on-network and/or off-network sources, including network endpoints, to define network access controls. By way of example, if an endpoint or network device, an antivirus/antimalware service, or other source detects or identifies anomalous traffic, this information can be provided to the network controller device <b>10</b>, which in turn can initiate a request to the network to filter the identified traffic. Respective examples of sources that can be utilized by the network controller device are described in further detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>10</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Filtering and/or blocking as initiated by the network controller device <b>10</b> can occur in several places across multiple associated networks. For instance, controls can be implemented locally near a source of offending traffic and/or at a point farther away in the network that is closer to the destination for the traffic. As another example, the network controller device <b>10</b> can reach out to another network, which can operate according to the same network technology or different network technologies from a network associated with the network controller device <b>10</b>, to facilitate blocking traffic as it enters or leaves the network ecosystem.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Additionally, the network controller device <b>10</b> can implement controls in a coordinated fashion across respective in-scope control devices <b>30</b> to achieve a comprehensive security solution. The implemented controls can be dynamic, e.g., such that they have a time to live, and/or static in order to reduce the proliferation of blocking rules over time. In a further aspect, dynamic and automated security controls facilitated by the network controller device <b>10</b> can extend near real-time intelligent monitoring, filtering, and/or blocking capability to untrusted premises, e.g., for private network implementations such as private 5G, 6G, or other networks.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">By implementing various embodiments as described herein, various advantages can be realized that can improve the performance of a wireless communication network and/or respective devices in the network. These advantages can include, but are not limited to, the following. The ability of a communication network to identify and act upon malicious network traffic, and in particular encrypted malicious traffic, can be improved. Usage of communication network resources can be improved. Response times for malicious network traffic in a communication network can be increased, and the range of response opportunities for such traffic can be increased. Other advantages are also enabled by such network access.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a block diagram of a system <b>200</b> that facilitates dynamic multi-network security controls is illustrated. Repetitive description of like elements employed in other embodiments described herein is omitted for brevity.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the network controller device <b>10</b> of system <b>200</b> can include a report processing component that can receive, e.g., over an IP network, a provider network, a core network, etc., a report of malicious and/or harmful network traffic observed by network equipment, e.g., network equipment <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, that operates in a first communication network that is communicatively coupled to the IP network.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an aspect, the communication network in which the network equipment observing the malicious network traffic operates can utilize a same radio access technology, or different radio access technologies, than the network controller device <b>10</b> and/or a network in which the network controller device <b>10</b> operates. Respective examples of an internetwork environment in which the network controller device <b>10</b> and respective network equipment can operate are described in further detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>6</b></figref>. Also or alternatively, while reports provided to the report processing component <b>210</b> can relate to network traffic observed by a network equipment, the report itself can be provided to the network controller device <b>10</b> via the network equipment that observed the traffic and/or other equipment or network entities acting on the network equipment's behalf.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an aspect, the report provided to the report processing component <b>210</b> as described above can indicate a second communication network, which is also communicatively coupled to the IP network and is distinct from the first communication network, as an originating network or origination point of the malicious network traffic. Depending on information available to the entity that provides the report to the report processing component <b>210</b>, the report can indicate one or more specific devices in the second communication network as source devices of the malicious traffic, or alternatively the report can indicate one or more networks associated with the malicious traffic, e.g., based on radio access technologies associated with the networks and/or the malicious traffic.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The network controller device <b>10</b> shown in system <b>200</b> further includes a traffic analysis component <b>220</b> that, in response to a report being received at the report processing component <b>210</b>, can identify second network equipment operating in the second communication network as a source of the malicious network traffic. In an implementation in which reports provided to the report processing component <b>210</b> do not indicate specific devices as a source of the malicious traffic, the traffic analysis component <b>220</b> can communicate with control devices <b>30</b> and/or other devices associated with the communication network indicated in the report, and/or other communication networks, to pinpoint the source(s) of the malicious traffic.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Subsequent to this identification, and/or in an implementation in which specific devices are indicated in the report provided to the report processing component <b>210</b>, the traffic analysis component <b>220</b> can further verify the malicious network traffic, e.g., by determining whether the traffic meets one or more network traffic criteria to be classified as malicious or harmful. This can be done, for instance, to prevent the network controller device <b>10</b> from issuing access controls in response to false or abusive reports.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The network controller device <b>10</b> shown in system <b>200</b> additionally includes an access control component <b>230</b> that can cause a control device <b>30</b> associated with the source network for the malicious or harmful network traffic to prevent network equipment identified and/or verified via the traffic analysis component <b>220</b> from transmitting network traffic, including the malicious or harmful network traffic, outside of the communication network in which it operates, e.g., via the IP network, for a defined time interval. Preventative measures that can be taken by the access control component <b>230</b> are described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">By enabling preventative actions to be performed on the basis of malicious activity observed close to the target resource or network endpoint, the network controller device <b>10</b> can provide improved network security functionality in network environments that utilize encrypted transport (e.g., Transport Layer Security or TLS) between end devices and application resources as well as improved protection against malicious attacks that utilize the application layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) stack.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Similarly, the network controller device <b>10</b> can automatically and dynamically control and/or block malicious activity at a point close to the source of the malicious activity, e.g., at a control device <b>30</b> and/or similar devices, to prevent malicious traffic from entering the IP network and/or reaching the endpoint device or resources. Since the network controller device <b>10</b> is not constrained to a specific network or network technology, the network controller device <b>10</b> can provide the ability to block the source of malicious traffic even if the malicious traffic traverses multiple networks.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a block diagram of a system <b>300</b> that facilitates dynamic multi-network security controls via a dynamic access control list (dynamic ACL) <b>310</b> is illustrated. Repetitive description of like elements employed in other embodiments described herein is omitted for brevity. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, when the access control component <b>230</b> of the network controller device <b>10</b> identifies a source of malicious network activity, e.g., as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the access control component <b>230</b> can signal a control device <b>30</b> for a communication network associated with the source of the malicious activity to add the source device(s) to a dynamic ACL <b>310</b> maintained by the control device <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an aspect, the dynamic ACL <b>310</b> can be maintained by the control device <b>30</b> in software, e.g., via a processor and memory in a similar manner to the processor <b>14</b> and memory <b>16</b> of the network controller device <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Alternatively, the dynamic ACL <b>310</b> can be maintained by the control device <b>30</b> using a combination of hardware and software elements. By way of example, in the event that a control device <b>30</b> does not have sufficient processing and/or storage capabilities for maintaining a dynamic ACL <b>310</b> at a desired scale, additional storage devices, processors, and/or other hardware can be implemented at the control device <b>30</b> to facilitate maintenance of the dynamic ACL <b>310</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;shim&#x201d; can refer to the software and/or hardware elements of a control device <b>30</b> that are responsible for maintaining a dynamic ACL <b>310</b>. An example implementation of shims in a multi-network environment is described in further detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>8</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In another aspect, a dynamic ACL <b>310</b> maintained by a control device <b>30</b> can consist of identifiers, such as IP address or the like, of respective devices in a network associated with the control device <b>30</b>, such that the network controller device <b>10</b> can cause the control device <b>30</b> to add the IP address or other identifier of identified network equipment to the dynamic ACL <b>310</b> for a defined time interval. An example implementation of a dynamic ACL <b>310</b> is shown by diagram <b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. As shown in diagram <b>400</b>, the dynamic ACL <b>310</b> can contain respective entries that each correspond to access controls being enforced by the control device <b>30</b>. The respective entries can include an identifier for a given network device, here an IP address, and an expiration time associated with the corresponding access control. It is noted that the structure and contents of the dynamic ACL <b>310</b> shown in diagram <b>400</b> comprise merely one example of a structure that could be utilized for a dynamic ACL <b>310</b>, and that other structures or contents could also be used. For instance, while the expiration time field is shown in diagram <b>400</b> as a time of day listing, the expiration field could instead track an amount of time a given access control is to remain active. Additionally, entries of the dynamic ACL <b>310</b> can specify a destination IP address in addition to a source IP address, as well as additional fields such as protocol or port number. Other modifications could also be performed without departing from the scope of this description or the claimed subject matter.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">By implementing dynamic access controls with time-to-live properties, e.g., instead of a conventional blacklist, access restrictions can be better tailored to ongoing behavior of respective network devices while reducing disruptions to devices that have ceased malicious activity. For instance, at the expiration time associated with an access control on the dynamic ACL <b>310</b>, the network controller device <b>10</b>, e.g., via the traffic analysis component <b>220</b> described above, can determine whether the device associated with the listed IP address has discontinued transmitting malicious network traffic and/or otherwise ceased its harmful or malicious network activity. If, at that time, it is determined that the listed device has ceased performing malicious network activity, the device can be removed from the dynamic ACL <b>310</b>, thereby permitting the device to again transmit network traffic outside of its associated network. In another example, devices listed on the dynamic ACL <b>310</b> can be monitored continuously or semi-continuously, such that a determination that a given device has ceased conducting malicious network activity can be made prior to the corresponding listed expiration time. In this example, the device can be removed from the dynamic ACL <b>310</b> immediately upon said determination, or alternatively the access controls can continue until their listed expiration time.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">Conversely, if the network controller device <b>10</b> determines at the expiration time for a given access control on the dynamic ACL <b>310</b> that a device has not discontinued conducting malicious network activity, the entry corresponding to the device can be extended for an additional defined time period. In an aspect, extensions of an access control applied in this manner can increase with each successive extension, e.g., such that an extension of an access control is enforced for a second defined time interval that is longer than the original time interval. By way of example, a first block via the dynamic ACL <b>310</b> last for five minutes, a second block can last for one hour, a third block can last for one day, etc. Other time intervals could also be used. Additionally, the time intervals used in the dynamic ACL <b>310</b> could be non-uniform intervals, e.g., as determined via a machine learning algorithm and/or by other suitable means.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, respective entries of the dynamic ACL <b>310</b> can specify individual IP addresses or other device identifiers to facilitate finely granular access control. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in the event that the network controller device <b>10</b> determines that devices from a given subnet, e.g., devices having IP addresses x.y.z.1 and x.y.z.3, are engaging in harmful network activity, these devices can be placed individually in the dynamic ACL <b>310</b>. This can, in turn, reduce the impact to other, non-malicious devices that would occur for a generalized block, e.g., a block of all addresses satisfying x.y.z.*, a block of all devices associated with a given network or network operator, etc. As noted above, a control device <b>30</b> can be provided with additional processing and/or storage functionality to accommodate access control lists tailored to individual devices, e.g., instead of subnets or larger blocks of devices.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a block diagram of a system <b>500</b> that facilitates dynamic security controls between respective networks <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> communicatively coupled to a provider IP network <b>50</b> is illustrated. Repetitive description of like elements employed in other embodiments described herein is omitted for brevity. In the example illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, a target device <b>60</b> associated with a first network <b>40</b> has encountered malicious network traffic sent by a source device <b>62</b> associated with a second, different network <b>42</b>. As further shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the networks <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> are communicatively coupled to the provider IP network <b>50</b> via respective control devices <b>30</b> that route network traffic through their respectively associated networks <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and the provider IP network <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">While the network controller device <b>10</b> is illustrated as operating in the provider IP network <b>50</b>, it is noted that the network controller device <b>10</b> could also operate in one or more communication networks, which can be the same as or different from networks <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>. In such an implementation, the network controller device <b>10</b> could also communicate via the provider IP network <b>50</b> from a communication network associated with the network controller device <b>10</b> in a similar manner as that shown for the target device <b>60</b> and the source device <b>62</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the target device <b>60</b> can submit a report or other indication of the malicious network traffic transmitted by the source device <b>62</b> to the network controller device <b>10</b>, which is associated with the provider IP network <b>50</b>. While, for simplicity of illustration, the reporting is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> as proceeding directly from the target device <b>60</b> to the network controller device <b>10</b>, it is noted that this reporting could be provided to the network controller device <b>10</b> in any suitable manner. For example, a report sent by the target device <b>60</b> could initially be provided to the control device <b>30</b> for network <b>40</b>, which in turn can forward the report to the network controller device <b>10</b>. Alternatively, a report of malicious network activity observed by the target device <b>60</b> could be provided to the network controller device <b>10</b> by a different device, not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, that communicates with the target device <b>60</b> either within the network <b>40</b> or the provider IP network <b>50</b>. As still another alternative, the network controller device <b>10</b> could independently monitor traffic associated with networks <b>40</b>, <b>42</b> and impose access controls upon identifying malicious network activity, even in the absence of a report provided to the network controller device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">In response to the network controller device <b>10</b> being made aware of malicious network activity originating from the source device <b>62</b>, the network controller device can cause the control device <b>30</b> for the network <b>42</b> associated with the source device <b>62</b> to block or otherwise deny access by the source device <b>62</b> to the provider IP network <b>50</b>, e.g., by adding the device to a dynamic ACL <b>310</b> as described above. In addition, the network controller device <b>10</b> can cause the control device for the network <b>40</b> associated with the target device <b>60</b> to also add the source device <b>62</b> to its dynamic ACL <b>310</b>, thereby preventing network traffic originating from the source device <b>62</b> from reaching the network <b>40</b> associated with the target device <b>60</b> from the provider IP network <b>50</b>. In an aspect, the control device(s) that are configured by the network controller device <b>10</b> to block the source device <b>62</b> can be determined based on the severity of the malicious network activity, the likelihood that offending network traffic can be contained via a single point in the network, and/or other considerations.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, diagram <b>600</b> depicts an example network environment in which a network controller device as described herein (e.g., a network controller device <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) can function. Repetitive description of like elements employed in other embodiments described herein is omitted for brevity. As shown in diagram <b>600</b>, the example network environment includes a core IP network that provides control and management functionality for respective networks that are communicatively coupled to the core IP network. Additionally, the core IP network, via respective provider (P) router devices, can facilitate the transferal of data between respective networks associated with the core IP network.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">The core IP network, in turn, interfaces with respective communicatively coupled networks via respective provider edge (PE) router devices at the edge of the core IP network. In an aspect, the PE router devices can each be associated with one or more radio access technologies and can include network router equipment that manages traffic flows between their respective associated networks and the core IP network. To facilitate communication between an origin network and a destination network that are communicatively coupled to the core IP network, the PE router associated with the origin network can obtain network traffic to be transmitted and provide that network traffic to a P router in the core IP network, which can in turn convey the network traffic to the PE router for the destination network, either directly or indirectly, e.g., by transferring the network traffic to a second, different P router in the core IP network for conveyance of the network traffic from the second P router to the PE router for the destination network.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in diagram <b>600</b>, the respective PE routers can provide connectivity between respective communication networks, which can operate via a same network technology or different network technologies, via the core IP network. Diagram <b>600</b> includes an example set of networks that can be utilized in this manner, including those associated with internet peering, 3G/4G mobility, 5G mobility, internet service provider (ISP) services, broadband, hosting and/or domain name system (DNS), and a generalized network for other types of connectivity not covered via the other networks. It is noted that other network types and/or technologies could also be used.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">As further shown in diagram <b>600</b>, one or more of the respective communication networks can include respective associated network elements. For instance, the 5G mobility network shown in diagram <b>600</b> can be associated with a 5G edge network and radio access network (RAN), which in turn can be associated with a multi-access edge compute (MEC) node. While not illustrated in diagram <b>600</b>, other ones of the depicted networks could similarly be associated with respective network elements.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an aspect, the respective networks shown in diagram <b>600</b> can enable communication between network equipment operating in the respective networks, such as end user equipment (e.g., phones or other mobile devices, computers, etc.), network access points, firewall devices, or the like. However, as noted above, individual network equipment, such as firewall devices, can in some cases lack sufficient information to determine if network traffic is malicious, e.g., due to the traffic being encrypted and/or other causes. Additionally, devices such as firewalls are limited to the network in which unwanted traffic is detected, limiting their utility for traffic that spans multiple networks. Further, firewalls generally provide small scale protection, e.g., on the order of an individual user or a small group of users, and can be impractical to scale out to an entire network due to costs, logistics, and other factors.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In view of at least the above, the network controller device <b>10</b> as described herein can utilize detection sources around the network ecosystem to determine if malicious or harmful network activity is occurring, e.g., as shown by diagram <b>700</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. The triangular elements in diagram <b>700</b> represent shim elements as described above, which can include hardware and/or software that provide monitoring and/or filtering capability for the network controller device <b>10</b>. As further shown in diagram <b>700</b>, shim elements can be employed at respective PE routers of the provider edge network as well as at routers or other devices associated with the respective networks that are connected via the core IP network. By enabling inputs from other networks, endpoint devices, and/or users, the network controller device <b>10</b> can collect sufficient information to block traffic, even in cases in which the network said traffic resides does not have the ability to determine that the traffic is malicious. In this manner, the network controller device <b>10</b>, via the shim elements shown in diagram <b>700</b>, can distribute the monitoring and filtering functionality conventionally associated with a firewall device across the entire IP network.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">In an aspect, the network controller device <b>10</b> can detect unwanted traffic by monitoring devices around the ecosystem. When suspicious traffic is encountered, the network controller device <b>10</b> can analyze inputs from around the ecosystem to determine whether the suspicious traffic meets defined criteria to be considered malicious. In response to traffic meeting the criteria to be considered malicious, the network controller device can implement dynamic controls, e.g., as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref>. Further, the network controller device <b>10</b> can define optimum locations for the controls, as well as the parameters for the controls, based on the types of traffic expected over the interface.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In another aspect, the network controller device <b>10</b> can have the intelligence to assemble and analyze information and determine how to distribute controls across the ecosystem to filter traffic when warranted. For instance, the network controller device <b>10</b> can send a command to a shim element located in the control device(s) where filter(s) are to be applied. Since a control device can utilize shim software, existing interfacing devices, or other devices with filtering capabilities, can be used. These devices can additionally be located around the ecosystem, thus simplifying deployment. Additionally, due to the volume of data handled by a control device such as a PE router in comparison to a conventional firewall, access controls can be deployed by the network controller device <b>10</b> as described herein on a significantly larger scale, e.g., on the order of hundreds of megabits per second per PE router.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Turning next to diagram <b>800</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a specific, non-limiting example of an event that can be handled by the network controller device <b>10</b> and other devices in a network ecosystem is illustrated. More particularly, diagram <b>800</b> illustrates a series of five steps that can be performed at respective areas of the ecosystem via circular indicators on diagram <b>800</b>. It is noted, however, that other processing steps, as well as other processes entirely, could be used in addition to, or in place of, the indicated processing steps.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Initially, a monitoring device connected to a MEC within a private 5G network located on untrusted premises can detect a distributed attack, such as a DDoS attack, aimed at the MEC. Next, as shown at step <b>2</b>, the monitoring device can communicate information relating to the unwanted traffic to the network controller device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In response to the reporting from the MEC monitoring device, the network controller device <b>10</b>, based on the inputs from the MEC monitoring device and other sources around the IP network, can determine that filters to block the unwanted traffic are to be implemented, as shown at step <b>3</b>. In an aspect, a determination as to where to deploy filters can be based on the amount of unwanted traffic from each source of the traffic. For instance, depending on the type of attack, an attack could in some cases be effectively thwarted without blocking all of the traffic. Additionally, locations for filter deployment can be selected based on the availability or ability of devices in the ecosystem to deploy the desired filter(s).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">As a result of analyzing the above criteria, the network controller device <b>10</b> shown in diagram <b>800</b> can determine that blocking is to be implemented at the PE device connected to internet peering, at the control device between the core IP network and the 5G mobility network, and the interface between the 5G mobility network and the MEC, as shown at step <b>4</b>. These locations can be selected by the network controller device <b>10</b> based on, e.g., the amount of unwanted traffic originating from respective sources in the ecosystem, individualized considerations regarding network security (e.g., blocking can be deployed between the 5G mobility network and the MEC to avoid overloading the MEC, etc.), and/or other factors.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In order to reduce the proliferation of controls deployed around the ecosystem, the network controller device <b>10</b> as shown at step <b>5</b> can implement the controls described with respect to at step <b>4</b> for a set period of time based on, e.g., knowledge of previous network traffic patterns, machine learning, and/or other factors. Alternatively, the network controller device <b>10</b> can configure the controls to be removed once the attack traffic has subsided, and/or upon the fulfillment of any other suitable conditions.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">By implementing controls as described above, the network controller device <b>10</b> can enable controls to be implemented near the source of offending traffic, resulting in reduced impact to the capacity of the core IP network and/or the networks connected to it. Additionally, implementing controls as described above can enable filters or other controls to be implemented in a fine-grained manner with reduced impact to desired network traffic. Further, when deemed appropriate, the filters or blocks as applied above can be removed, which can in turn reduce the proliferation of what could be transient filters.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Turning next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a block diagram of a system <b>900</b> that facilitates implementation of dynamic multi-network security controls based on reporting from security software is illustrated. Repetitive description of like elements employed in other embodiments described herein is omitted for brevity. As noted with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> above, the network controller device <b>10</b> can detect malicious network activity by monitoring devices around the network ecosystem. As shown in system <b>900</b>, example sources of information that can be monitored by the network controller device <b>10</b> can include security software <b>70</b> operating on a target device <b>60</b>, such as malware detection software (e.g., antivirus software, etc.), software associated with an intrusion detection system and/or other software for detecting unwanted traffic at the target device <b>60</b> and/or in a network associated with the target device <b>60</b>. Also or alternatively, the network controller device <b>10</b> can obtain reports or other input in the form of a report from a router detecting an overload condition, input from a security operations center, and/or other sources. In an aspect, the security software <b>70</b>, and/or other sources that can report to the network controller device <b>10</b>, can utilize a defined application programming interface (API) and/or other interface(s) to send messages to the network controller device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">The security software <b>70</b> shown in system <b>900</b> can be specialized software designed for communication with the network controller device <b>10</b>, or alternatively the security software <b>70</b> can be implemented via an extension of existing software. For instance, antivirus software operating at the target device <b>60</b> could be modified to forward information regarding a source of malware encountered by the target device <b>60</b> to the network controller device <b>10</b>, e.g., in addition to blocking the malware locally at the target device <b>60</b>, to facilitate network-wide controls via the network controller device <b>10</b> in addition to local controls implemented via the antivirus software.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a block diagram of a system <b>1000</b> that facilitates implementation of dynamic multi-network security controls based on reporting from a private communication network is illustrated.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, system <b>1000</b> can include a private network <b>80</b>, which as used herein refers to a communication network associated with a communication technology (e.g., 5G) and installed on premises that are untrusted relative to the IP network associated with the network controller device <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">In an aspect, the private network <b>80</b> can include its own network equipment, such as cell sites, a network core, and other elements, which can be either owned by the operator of the private network <b>80</b> or provided to the operator of the private network <b>80</b> as a service. The private network <b>80</b> can also facilitate communication to and from a provider IP network, e.g., an IP network associated with the network controller device <b>10</b>. In an implementation in which the private network <b>80</b> is a 5G network, the RAN section of the private 5G network (e.g., via a gNodeB or the like) can connect back to a provider 5G network via a MEC and/or cellular backhaul.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">As further shown in system <b>1000</b>, the private network <b>80</b> can utilize a private network controller device <b>90</b>, which can provide security functionality for the private network <b>80</b> in a similar manner to that provided to the provider network via the network controller device <b>10</b>. Similar to other network equipment associated with the private network <b>80</b>, a private network controller device <b>90</b> could be owned and controlled by the operator of the private network <b>80</b> and/or provided to the operator as a service, e.g., by a network service provider.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In an aspect, the private network controller device <b>90</b> can implement its own blocks or filters within the private network <b>80</b>, e.g., based on reports of malicious network traffic provided to the private network controller device <b>90</b> by other network equipment of the private network <b>80</b> and/or other sources. The private network controller device <b>90</b> can then provide information relating to the malicious network traffic and/or corresponding actions taken within the private network <b>80</b> back to the network controller device <b>10</b>.
