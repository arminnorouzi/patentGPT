The storage chamber may be referred to as a refrigerating compartment or a freezing compartment according to the temperature range of the storage chamber.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The user opens the door in order to put objects into the storage chamber or take objects out of the storage chamber. In some examples, the door is rotatably provided on the cabinet and a gasket is provided between the door and the cabinet.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some cases, in a state of closing the door, the gasket is closely adhered between the door and the cabinet to prevent leakage of cool air from the storage chamber. As adhesion force of the gasket increases, the effect of preventing leakage of cool air may increase.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to increase adhesion force of the gasket, the gasket may be formed of, for example, a rubber magnet or a magnet may be provided in the gasket. However, if adhesion force of the gasket increases, a large force may be required to open the door.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Recently, refrigerators having an auto closing function have been provided.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A method for opening a door of a refrigerator is disclosed in Korean Patent Registration No. 10-1658668 that is a prior art document.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">According the prior art document, in order to open the door of the refrigerator, a driving motor rotates to allow the push rod that is gear-coupled to a rotation shaft of the driving motor to advance so as to open the door. Also, when it is confirmed that the push rod reaches a set position, at which the door is opened, by a position detection member configured to detect a position of the push rod, the driving motor reversely rotates so that the push rod returns to its initial position.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Also, the push rod receives driving force generated from the driving motor by a plurality of gears to move.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the prior art document, since two push rods operate by using one driving motor, each of the push rods is disposed at a position far from a hinge of the door to smoothly receive power of the driving motor. That is, each of the push rods are disposed adjacent to a boundary of two doors that are adjacent to each other.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thus, when the door is opened by using the push rod, there is a disadvantage that an opening angle of the door per unit length of the push rod is low. Thus, in order to increase in opening angle of the door, the push rod has to increase in length. In this case, a portion of the push rod, which is exposed to the outside, is lengthened, which cause deterioration of aesthetics.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Also, there is a limitation when a user closes the door after increasing in opening angle of the door before or after the push rod advances to move to the set position. In detail, an impact caused by emergency return of the door is transmitted to the plurality of gears through the push rod, and thus, the push rods and/or the gears are damaged.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Problem</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0015">An object of the prevent invention is to provide a refrigerator in which an opening angle of a door per unit length of a push member increases while the push member increases in length so as to increase in opening angle of the door.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Also, an object of the present invention is to provide a refrigerator in which a push member is capable of urgently returning to detect whether door is opened by external force and prevent the push member from being damaged.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading><p id="p-0018" num="0017">A refrigerator according on one aspect includes a cabinet having a storage chamber;

The push member <b>22</b> is installed to be withdrawn from and inserted into the housing <b>21</b> by driving force of the motor.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0101">Also, the door opening device <b>20</b> may further include a power transmission device <b>28</b> that transmits the driving force of the motor to the push member <b>22</b>. That is, the driving force of the motor is transmitted to the push member <b>22</b> through the power transmission device <b>28</b>. Thus, the push member <b>22</b> is withdrawn from the housing <b>21</b> by the driving of the motor in one direction and is inserted into the housing <b>21</b> the housing <b>21</b> by the driving of the motor in the other direction.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0102">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the push member <b>22</b> is inserted into the housing <b>21</b>, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a push rack <b>22</b> is withdrawn from the housing <b>21</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a portion of the push member <b>22</b> may protrude to the outside of the housing <b>21</b> in a state in which the push member <b>22</b> is inserted into the housing <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0103">The power transmission device <b>28</b> may include at least one gear. In the present invention, the number of gears is not limited as long as the power transmission device <b>28</b> is capable of transmitting the power of the motor to the push member <b>22</b>. For example, the power transmission device <b>28</b> may include a plurality of reduction gears.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0104">The push member <b>22</b> includes a rack gear <b>26</b> engaged with at least one power transmission device <b>28</b>. The driving force of the motor is transmitted to the push member <b>22</b> through the engagement between the power transmission device <b>28</b> and the rack gear <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0106" num="0105">The push member <b>22</b> may be provided in a curved shape so that an opening angle of the door <b>14</b> per unit length increases and also be provided in an arc shape around the hinge shaft <b>32</b> of the door hinge <b>30</b>.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0106">Also, the push member <b>22</b> may be disposed adjacent to the hinge shaft <b>32</b> so that the opening angle of the door <b>14</b> per unit length increases.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0107">That is, in the door <b>14</b>, the push member <b>22</b> is disposed close to the a first side surface between the first side surface adjacent to the hinge shaft <b>32</b> and a second side surface adjacent to the other door as an opposite surface of the first surface.</p><p id="p-0109" num="0108">Also, the push member <b>22</b> may include a rack cover <b>24</b> coupled to a distal end thereof. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the rack cover <b>24</b> is disposed to contact the front surface of the cabinet <b>11</b>. This is merely an example. For example, the rack cover <b>24</b> may be disposed to be spaced a predetermined distance from the cabinet <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">That is, as a length by which the push member <b>22</b> is withdrawn to the outside of the housing <b>21</b> increases, the rack cover <b>24</b> contacts the front surface of the cabinet <b>11</b> to apply force to the cabinet <b>11</b>. Accordingly, the cabinet <b>11</b> and the door <b>14</b> may be separated from each other, and the storage chamber may be opened.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">The rack cover <b>24</b> may be made of an elastic material because the rack cover <b>24</b> contacts the cabinet <b>11</b>. For example, the cabinet <b>11</b> may be made of a material that is elastically deformable, such as a rubber material or a silicon material, to prevent the breakage when external force is applied to the cabinet <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">A process of automatically opening the storage chamber by the rotation of the door <b>14</b> due to the driving of the door opening device <b>20</b> will be described.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">First, an opening signal that is required for opening the storage chamber is generated. For example, a signal may be generated through a voice or a human body sensor. That is, the user may generate the opening signal by recognizing the voice or a relatively free foot to the sensor while holding an object in both hands thereof.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">When the opening signal is generated, the motor is driven to transmit the driving force to the push member <b>22</b> through the power transmission device <b>28</b>. The push member <b>22</b> is withdrawn to the outside of the housing <b>21</b> by the driving force.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Accordingly, the rack cover <b>24</b> applies external force to the cabinet <b>11</b>, and thus, the door <b>14</b> rotates. That is, while the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is changed into the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the door <b>14</b> opens the storage chamber provided in the cabinet <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">Therefore, the user may approach the storage chamber without applying the external force to take out food or inject food into the storage chamber.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">Here, the door opening device <b>20</b> is provided to allow the door <b>14</b> to rotate at a predetermined angle and up to a predetermined position (hereinafter, opening position). For example, the door opening device <b>20</b> may allow the door <b>14</b> to rotate so that the door <b>14</b> is in the opening position having an opening angle of approximately 40 degrees.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">Also, in the door opening device <b>20</b>, after a predetermined time is elapsed, the motor of the door opening device <b>20</b> may be driven in the other direction, and thus, the push member <b>22</b> may be inserted into the housing <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">That is, the motor is driven so that the push member <b>22</b> returns to the housing <b>21</b>.
