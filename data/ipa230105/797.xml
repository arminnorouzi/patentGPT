This insulating material, composed in its majority by lipids (70% lipids, 30% protein), protects axons and makes possible the saltatory conduction, which speeds axonal electric impulse. Demyelination of axons in chronic MS may result in axon degeneration and neuronal cell death, but more specifically, MS destroys oligodendrocytes, the highly specialized CNS cells that generate and maintain myelin.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Oligodendrocyte precursors (PDGFR&#x3b1;+, NG2-proteoglycan+), the immature oligodendrocytes, are generated in ventral areas of the developing brain from a common glial progenitor, actively migrate and proliferate populating the CNS to finally differentiate to premyelinating oligodendrocytes (O4+). At this maturation point, oligodendrocytes both target and extend myelin sheaths along axons or they die. Less explored has been however, the hypothesis of enhanced myelination and/or remyelination by either endogenous oligodendrocyte precursors or transplanted cells.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Inducing differentiation and/or promoting survival during the maturation of endogenous oligodendrocyte progenitors can stimulate and enhance the generation of new oligodendrocytes and intrinsic myelination and/or remyelination. Therefore, there is a need for compounds and therapeutic methods capable of enhancing the generation of new oligodendrocytes.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Embodiments described herein generally relate to agents, compounds, and methods for enhancing oligodendrocyte generation by inducing, promoting, and/or modulating oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation, proliferation and/or maturation as well as to methods for the treatment of disease or disorders in subjects where myelination or remyelination is beneficial to the subject.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It was found that the enhancement and/or inducement of the accumulation of &#x394;8,9-unsaturated sterol intermediates of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) can induce Oligodendrocyte generation. Enhancement and/or inducement of the accumulation of &#x394;8,9-unsaturated sterol intermediates can be provided by modulating and/or inhibiting enzymes within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in OPCs that inhibit &#x394;8,9-unsaturated sterol intermediate accumulation and/or for which the &#x394;8,9-unsaturated sterol intermediates are substrates as well as directly and/or indirectly administering &#x394;8,9-unsaturated sterol intermediates to the OPCs. Enhancement and/or inducement of the accumulation of &#x394;8,9-unsaturated sterol intermediates can promote OPC differentiation, survival, proliferation and/or maturation and treat diseases and/or disorders in subjects where myelination or remyelination is beneficial to the subject.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, an agent that enhances and/or induces accumulation of &#x394;8,9-unsaturated sterol intermediates of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in the OPCs can be administered to a subject and/or the OPCs at an amount effective to promote and/or induce OPC differentiation, proliferation and/or maturation as well as oligodendrocyte generation. In one example, the agent can include at least one compound that inhibits enzyme mediated synthesis of one or more sterol intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway of the OPCs and/or promotes accumulation of &#x394;8,9-unsaturated sterol intermediates.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the compound can modulate and/or inhibit one or more enzyme mediated conversion steps of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway from lanosterol to cholesterol, for example, between lanosterol and/or lathosterol, of OPCs to promote and/or induce oligodendrocyte generation. For example, the compound can inhibit CYP51, sterol 14-reductase, and/or EBP enzyme mediated synthesis of sterol intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. In yet another example, the compound can modulate and/or inhibit enzyme mediated conversion of lanosterol to 4,4-dimethylcholesta-8(9),14,24-trien-3&#x3b2;-ol, 4,4-dimethylcholesta-8(9),14,24-trien-3&#x3b2;-ol to zymostenol, and/or zymostenol to lathosterol to enhance oligodendrocyte generation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the compound can modulate and/or inhibit one or more enzyme mediated conversion steps of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway from lanosterol to dehydrolathosterol or lathosterol.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, a compound used in the methods described herein can inhibit enzyme mediated conversion of zymostenol to lathosterol through the inhibition of emopamil binding protein (EBP) isomerase enzyme activity. Alternatively, a compound used in the methods described herein can inhibit sterol C14 reductase enzyme activity or CYP51 enzyme activity in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the compound is selected from the group consisting of bifonazole, clotrimazole, miconazole, butoconazole, ketoconazole, Fulvestrant, amorolfine, ifenprodil, ziprasidone, Tasin-1, tamoxifen, benztropine, clemastine, trans-U50488, EPZ005687, raloxifene, hydroxyzine, vesamicol, L-745,870, TMB-8, Cis-N-cyclohexyl-N-ethyl-3-(3-chloro-4-cyclohexylphenyl)prop-2-enylamine, pFluorohexahydro-Siladifenidol, pramoxine, toremifene, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In other embodiments, the compound can include interfering RNA, such as siRNA, or CRISPR/Cas nuclease that inhibits expression of an enzyme that synthesizes one or more sterol intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway of the OPCs. For example, the interfering RNA CRISPR/Cas nuclease can inhibit CYP51, sterol 14-reductase, and/or EBP enzyme expression.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">In other embodiments, the agent can include at least one &#x394;8,9-unsaturated sterol intermediate of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in OPCs or a derivative thereof that enhances generation of oligodendrocytes from the OPCs. The &#x394;8,9-unsaturated sterol intermediate can include at least one of lanosterol, 14-dehydrozymostenol, FF-MAS, MAS-412, zymosterol, zymostenol and derivatives thereof.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the compounds described herein can be used to treat neurodegenerative diseases and disorders in a subject in need thereof.

Tautomers exist as mixtures of a tautomeric set in solution. In solid form, usually one tautomer predominates. Even though one tautomer may be described, the present application includes all tautomers of the present compounds. A tautomer is one of two or more structural isomers that exist in equilibrium and are readily converted from one isomeric form to another. This reaction results in the formal migration of a hydrogen atom accompanied by a switch of adjacent conjugated double bonds. In solutions where tautomerization is possible, a chemical equilibrium of the tautomers will be reached. The exact ratio of the tautomers depends on several factors, including temperature, solvent, and pH. The concept of tautomers that are interconvertable by tautomerizations is called tautomerism.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Of the various types of tautomerism that are possible, two are commonly observed.

The CRISPR locus comprises a distinct class of interspersed short sequence repeats (SSRs) that were recognized in <i>E. coli </i>(Ishino et al. (1987) <i>J. Bacteriol., </i>169:5429-5433; and Nakata et al., <i>J. Bacteriol. </i>(1989) 171:3553-3556), and associated genes. Similar interspersed SSRs have been identified in <i>Haloferax mediterranei, Streptococcus pyogenes, Anabaena</i>, and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </i>(See, Groenen et al. (1993) <i>Mol. Microbiol., </i>10:1057-1065; Hoe et al. (1999) <i>Emerg. Infect. Dis., </i>5:254-263; Masepohl et al. (1996) <i>Biochim. Biophys. Acta </i>1307:26-30; and Mojica et al. (1995) <i>Mol. Microbiol., </i>17:85-93). The CRISPR loci typically differ from other SSRs by the structure of the repeats, which have been termed short regularly spaced repeats (SRSRs) (Janssen et al. (2002) <i>OMICS J. Integ. Biol., </i>6:23-33; and Mojica et al. (2000) <i>Mol. Microbiol., </i>36:244-246). In general, the repeats are short elements that occur in clusters that are regularly spaced by unique intervening sequences with a substantially constant length (Mojica et al. (2000), supra). Although the repeat sequences are highly conserved between strains, the number of interspersed repeats and the sequences of the spacer regions typically differ from strain to strain (van Embden et al., <i>J. Bacteriol. </i>(2002) 182:2393-2401).

RNAi constructs comprise double stranded RNA that can specifically block expression of a target gene. &#x201c;RNA interference&#x201d; or &#x201c;RNAi&#x201d; is a term initially applied to a phenomenon observed in plants and worms where double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) blocks gene expression in a specific and post-transcriptional manner.</p><p id="p-0227" num="0186">As used herein, the term &#x201c;dsRNA&#x201d; refers to siRNA molecules or other RNA molecules including a double stranded feature and able to be processed to siRNA in cells, such as hairpin RNA moieties.</p><p id="p-0228" num="0187">The term &#x201c;loss-of-function,&#x201d; as it refers to genes inhibited by the subject RNAi method, refers to a diminishment in the level of expression of a gene when compared to the level in the absence of RNAi constructs.</p><p id="p-0229" num="0188">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;mediates RNAi&#x201d; refers to (indicates) the ability to distinguish which RNAs are to be degraded by the RNAi process, e.g., degradation occurs in a sequence-specific manner rather than by a sequence-independent dsRNA response, e.g., a PKR response.</p><p id="p-0230" num="0189">As used herein, the term &#x201c;RNAi construct&#x201d; is a generic term used throughout the specification to include small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), hairpin RNAs, and other RNA species, which can be cleaved in vivo to form siRNAs. RNAi constructs herein also include expression vectors (also referred to as RNAi expression vectors) capable of giving rise to transcripts which form dsRNAs or hairpin RNAs in cells, and/or transcripts which can produce siRNAs in vivo.</p><p id="p-0231" num="0190">&#x201c;RNAi expression vector&#x201d; (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;dsRNA-encoding plasmid&#x201d;) refers to replicable nucleic acid constructs used to express (transcribe) RNA which produces siRNA moieties in the cell in which the construct is expressed. Such vectors include a transcriptional unit comprising an assembly of (1) genetic element(s) having a regulatory role in gene expression, for example, promoters, operators, or enhancers, operatively linked to (2) a &#x201c;coding&#x201d; sequence which is transcribed to produce a double-stranded RNA (two RNA moieties that anneal in the cell to form an siRNA, or a single hairpin RNA which can be processed to an siRNA), and (3) appropriate transcription initiation and termination sequences.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0191">The choice of promoter and other regulatory elements generally varies according to the intended host cell, such as an OPC. In general, expression vectors of utility in recombinant DNA techniques are often in the form of &#x201c;plasmids&#x201d; which refer to circular double stranded DNA loops, which, in their vector form are not bound to the chromosome. In the present specification, &#x201c;plasmid&#x201d; and &#x201c;vector&#x201d; are used interchangeably as the plasmid is the most commonly used form of vector. However, the application describes other forms of expression vectors that serve equivalent functions and which become known in the art subsequently hereto.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0192">The RNAi constructs contain a nucleotide sequence that hybridizes under physiologic conditions of the cell to the nucleotide sequence of at least a portion of the mRNA transcript for the gene to be inhibited (i.e., the &#x201c;target&#x201d; gene). The double-stranded RNA need only be sufficiently similar to natural RNA that it has the ability to mediate RNAi. Thus, embodiments tolerate sequence variations that might be expected due to genetic mutation, strain polymorphism or evolutionary divergence. The number of tolerated nucleotide mismatches between the target sequence and the RNAi construct sequence is no more than 1 in 5 basepairs, or 1 in 10 basepairs, or 1 in 20 basepairs, or 1 in 50 basepairs. Mismatches in the center of the siRNA duplex are most critical and may essentially abolish cleavage of the target RNA. In contrast, nucleotides at the 3&#x2032; end of the siRNA strand that is complementary to the target RNA do not significantly contribute to specificity of the target recognition.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0193">Sequence identity may be optimized by sequence comparison and alignment algorithms known in the art and calculating the percent difference between the nucleotide sequences by, for example, the Smith-Waterman algorithm as implemented in the BESTFIT software program using default parameters (e.g., University of Wisconsin Genetic Computing Group). Greater than 90% sequence identity, or even 100% sequence identity, between the inhibitory RNA and the portion of the target gene is preferred. Alternatively, the duplex region of the RNA may be defined functionally as a nucleotide sequence that is capable of hybridizing with a portion of the target gene transcript.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0194">Production of RNAi constructs can be carried out by chemical synthetic methods or by recombinant nucleic acid techniques. Endogenous RNA polymerase of the treated cell may mediate transcription in vivo, or cloned RNA polymerase can be used for transcription in vitro. The RNAi constructs may include modifications to either the phosphate-sugar backbone or the nucleoside, e.g., to reduce susceptibility to cellular nucleases, improve bioavailability, improve formulation characteristics, and/or change other pharmacokinetic properties. For example, the phosphodiester linkages of natural RNA may be modified to include at least one of a nitrogen or sulfur heteroatom. Modifications in RNA structure may be tailored to allow specific genetic inhibition while avoiding a general response to dsRNA. Likewise, bases may be modified to block the activity of adenosine deaminase. The RNAi construct may be produced enzymatically or by partial/total organic synthesis, a modified ribonucleotide can be introduced by in vitro enzymatic or organic synthesis.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0195">Methods of chemically modifying RNA molecules can be adapted for modifying RNAi constructs (see for example, <i>Nucleic Acids Res, </i>25:776-780<i>; J Mol Recog </i>7:89-98<i>; Nucleic Acids Res </i>23:2661-2668<i>; Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev </i>7:55-61). Merely to illustrate, the backbone of an RNAi construct can be modified with phosphorothioates, phosphoramidate, phosphodithioates, chimeric methylphosphonate-phosphodiesters, peptide nucleic acids, 5-propynyl-pyrimidine containing oligomers or sugar modifications (e.g., 2&#x2032;-substituted ribonucleosides, a-configuration).</p><p id="p-0237" num="0196">The double-stranded structure may be formed by a single self-complementary RNA strand or two complementary RNA strands. RNA duplex formation may be initiated either inside or outside the cell. The RNA may be introduced in an amount, which allows delivery of at least one copy per cell. Higher doses (e.g., at least 5, 10, 100, 500 or 1000 copies per cell) of double-stranded material may yield more effective inhibition, while lower doses may also be useful for specific applications. Inhibition is sequence-specific in that nucleotide sequences corresponding to the duplex region of the RNA are targeted for genetic inhibition.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0197">In certain embodiments, the subject RNAi constructs are &#x201c;small interfering RNAs&#x201d; or &#x201c;siRNAs.&#x201d; These nucleic acids are around 19-30 nucleotides in length, and even more preferably 21-23 nucleotides in length, e.g., corresponding in length to the fragments generated by nuclease &#x201c;dicing&#x201d; of longer double-stranded RNAs. The siRNAs are understood to recruit nuclease complexes and guide the complexes to the target mRNA by pairing to the specific sequences. As a result, the target mRNA is degraded by the nucleases in the protein complex. In a particular embodiment, the 21-23 nucleotides siRNA molecules comprise a 3&#x2032; hydroxyl group.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0198">The siRNA molecules described herein can be obtained using a number of techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, the siRNA can be chemically synthesized or recombinantly produced using methods known in the art. For example, short sense and antisense RNA oligomers can be synthesized and annealed to form double-stranded RNA structures with 2-nucleotide overhangs at each end (<i>Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, </i>98:9742-9747<i>; EMBO J, </i>20:6877-88). These double-stranded siRNA structures can then be directly introduced to cells, either by passive uptake or a delivery system of choice, such as described below.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0199">In certain embodiments, the siRNA constructs can be generated by processing of longer double-stranded RNAs, for example, in the presence of the enzyme dicer. In one embodiment, the <i>Drosophila </i>in vitro system is used. In this embodiment, dsRNA is combined with a soluble extract derived from <i>Drosophila </i>embryo, thereby producing a combination. The combination is maintained under conditions in which the dsRNA is processed to RNA molecules of about 21 to about 23 nucleotides.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0200">The siRNA molecules can be purified using a number of techniques known to those of skill in the art. For example, gel electrophoresis can be used to purify siRNAs. Alternatively, non-denaturing methods, such as non-denaturing column chromatography, can be used to purify the siRNA. In addition, chromatography (e.g., size exclusion chromatography), glycerol gradient centrifugation, affinity purification with antibody can be used to purify siRNAs.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0201">In certain embodiments, the RNAi construct is in the form of a hairpin structure (named as hairpin RNA). The hairpin RNAs can be synthesized exogenously or can be formed by transcribing from RNA polymerase III promoters in vivo. Examples of making and using such hairpin RNAs for gene silencing in mammalian cells are described in, for example, <i>Genes Dev, </i>2002, 16:948-58<i>; Nature, </i>2002, 418:38-9<i>; RNA, </i>2002, 8:842-50; and <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci, </i>2002, 99:6047-52. Preferably, such hairpin RNAs are engineered in cells or in an animal to ensure continuous and stable suppression of a desired gene. It is known in the art that siRNAs can be produced by processing a hairpin RNA in the cell.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0202">In yet other embodiments, a plasmid is used to deliver the double-stranded RNA, e.g., as a transcriptional product. In such embodiments, the plasmid is designed to include a &#x201c;coding sequence&#x201d; for each of the sense and antisense strands of the RNAi construct. The coding sequences can be the same sequence, e.g., flanked by inverted promoters, or can be two separate sequences each under transcriptional control of separate promoters. After the coding sequence is transcribed, the complementary RNA transcripts base-pair to form the double-stranded RNA.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0203">PCT application WO01/77350 describes an example of a vector for bi-directional transcription of a transgene to yield both sense and antisense RNA transcripts of the same transgene in a eukaryotic cell. Accordingly, certain embodiments provide a recombinant vector having the following unique characteristics: it comprises a viral replicon having two overlapping transcription units arranged in an opposing orientation and flanking a transgene for an RNAi construct of interest, wherein the two overlapping transcription units yield both sense and antisense RNA transcripts from the same transgene fragment in a host cell.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0204">In some embodiments, a lentiviral vector can be used for the long-term expression of a siRNA, such as a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA), to knockdown expression of the RPTP in a cancer cell. Although there have been some safety concerns about the use of lentiviral vectors for gene therapy, self-inactivating lentiviral vectors are considered good candidates for gene therapy as they readily transfect mammalian cells.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0205">By way of example, short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) down regulation of the AKR1A1 expression can be created using OligoEngene software (OligoEngine, Seattle, Wash.) to identify sequences as targets of siRNA. The oligo sequences can be annealed and ligated into linearized pSUPER RNAi vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, Wash.) and transformed in <i>E. coli </i>strain DH5a cells. After positive clones are selected, plasmid can be transfected into 293T cells by calcium precipitation. The viral supernatant collected containing shRNA can then be used to infect mammalian cells in order to down regulate the EBP, C14 reductase, or CYP51 enzyme.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0206">In another embodiment, the EBP, C14 reductase, or CYP51 inhibitor can include antisense oligonucleotides. Antisense oligonucleotides are relatively short nucleic acids that are complementary (or antisense) to the coding strand (sense strand) of the mRNA encoding a particular protein. Although antisense oligonucleotides are typically RNA based, they can also be DNA based. Additionally, antisense oligonucleotides are often modified to increase their stability.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0207">The binding of these relatively short oligonucleotides to the mRNA is believed to induce stretches of double stranded RNA that trigger degradation of the messages by endogenous RNAses. Additionally, sometimes the oligonucleotides are specifically designed to bind near the promoter of the message, and under these circumstances, the antisense oligonucleotides may additionally interfere with translation of the message. Regardless of the specific mechanism by which antisense oligonucleotides function, their administration to a cell or tissue allows the degradation of the mRNA encoding a specific protein. Accordingly, antisense oligonucleotides decrease the expression and/or activity of a particular protein (e.g., EBP, C14 reductase, or CYP51).</p><p id="p-0249" num="0208">The oligonucleotides can be DNA or RNA or chimeric mixtures or derivatives or modified versions thereof, single-stranded or double-stranded. The oligonucleotide can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety, or phosphate backbone, for example, to improve stability of the molecule, hybridization, etc. The oligonucleotide may include other appended groups, such as peptides (e.g., for targeting host cell receptors), or agents facilitating transport across the cell membrane (see, e.g., <i>Proc Natl Acad Sci </i>86:6553-6556<i>; Proc Natl Acad Sci </i>84:648-652; PCT Publication No. WO88/09810, published Dec. 15, 1988) or the blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., PCT Publication No. WO89/10134, published Apr. 25, 1988), hybridization-triggered cleavage agents (See, e.g., <i>BioTechniques </i>6:958-976) or intercalating agents. (See, e.g., <i>Pharm Res </i>5:539-549). To this end, the oligonucleotide may be conjugated or coupled to another molecule.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0209">Oligonucleotides described herein may be synthesized by standard methods known in the art, e.g., by use of an automated DNA synthesizer (such as are commercially available from Biosearch, Applied Biosystems, etc.). As examples, phosphorothioate oligonucleotides may be synthesized by the method of Stein et al. (<i>Nucl. Acids Res. </i>16:3209), methylphosphonate oligonucleotides can be prepared by use of controlled pore glass polymer supports (<i>Proc Natl Acad Sci </i>85:7448-7451).</p><p id="p-0251" num="0210">The selection of an appropriate oligonucleotide can be performed by one of skill in the art. Given the nucleic acid sequence encoding a particular protein, one of skill in the art can design antisense oligonucleotides that bind to that protein, and test these oligonucleotides in an in vitro or in vivo system to confirm that they bind to and mediate the degradation of the mRNA encoding the particular protein. To design an antisense oligonucleotide that specifically binds to and mediates the degradation of a particular protein, it is important that the sequence recognized by the oligonucleotide is unique or substantially unique to that particular protein. For example, sequences that are frequently repeated across protein may not be an ideal choice for the design of an oligonucleotide that specifically recognizes and degrades a particular message. One of skill in the art can design an oligonucleotide, and compare the sequence of that oligonucleotide to nucleic acid sequences that are deposited in publicly available databases to confirm that the sequence is specific or substantially specific for a particular protein.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0211">A number of methods have been developed for delivering antisense DNA or RNA to cells; e.g., antisense molecules can be injected directly into the tissue site, or modified antisense molecules, designed to target the desired cells (e.g., antisense linked to peptides or antibodies that specifically bind receptors or antigens expressed on the target cell surface) can be administered systematically.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0212">However, it may be difficult to achieve intracellular concentrations of the antisense oligonucleotide sufficient to suppress translation on endogenous mRNAs in certain instances. Therefore, another approach utilizes a recombinant DNA construct in which the antisense oligonucleotide is placed under the control of a strong pol III or pol II promoter. For example, a vector can be introduced in vivo such that it is taken up by a cell and directs the transcription of an antisense RNA. Such a vector can remain episomal or become chromosomally integrated, as long as it can be transcribed to produce the desired antisense RNA. Such vectors can be constructed by recombinant DNA technology methods standard in the art. Vectors can be plasmid, viral, or others known in the art, used for replication and expression in mammalian cells.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0213">Expression of the sequence encoding the antisense RNA can be by a promoter known in the art to act in mammalian, preferably human cells. Such promoters can be inducible or constitutive. Such promoters include but are not limited to: the SV40 early promoter region (<i>Nature </i>290:304-310), the promoter contained in the 3&#x2032; long terminal repeat of Rous sarcoma virus (<i>Cell </i>22:787-797), the herpes thymidine kinase promoter (<i>Proc Natl Acad Sci </i>78:1441-1445), the regulatory sequences of the metallothionein gene (<i>Nature </i>296:39-42), etc. A type of plasmid, cosmid, YAC or viral vector can be used to prepare the recombinant DNA construct that can be introduced directly into the tissue site. Alternatively, viral vectors can be used which selectively infect the desired tissue, in which case administration may be accomplished by another route (e.g., systematically).</p><p id="p-0255" num="0214">In some embodiments, endogenous expression of an enzyme that synthesizes one or more sterol intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway of OPC cells can be reduced in OPCs through the use of a nuclease to edit (e.g., mutate) genes encoding the enzyme or a genetic regulatory elements thereof. Nucleases and related systems for use in method described herein can include, but are not limited to a zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), a TALE-effector (TALEN), a CRISPR/Cas system or an NgAgo system.

A myelin related disorder as used herein can arise from a myelination related disorder or demyelination resulting from a variety of neurotoxic insults. &#x201c;Demyelination&#x201d; as used herein, refers to the act of demyelinating, or the loss of the myelin sheath insulating the nerves, and is the hallmark of some neurodegenerative autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and Guillain-Barre Syndrome. Leukodystrophies are caused by inherited enzyme deficiencies, which cause abnormal formation, destruction, and/or abnormal turnover of myelin sheaths within the CNS white matter. Both acquired and inherited myelin disorders share a poor prognosis leading to major disability. Thus, some embodiments of the present invention can include methods for the treatment of neurodegenerative autoimmune diseases in a subject. Remyelination of neurons requires oligodendrocytes.

A., Schanz, S., and Windrem, M. S. (2008). Stem cell-based strategies for treating pediatric disorders of myelin. Hum Mol Genet. 17, R76-83. At the other end of the age spectrum, myelin loss and ineffective repair may contribute to the decline in cognitive function associated with senescence (Kohama et al., 2011) Kohama, S. G., Rosene, D.

Loss of myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) underlies a number of neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis and diverse genetic diseases. Using high throughput chemical screening approaches, we have identified small molecules that promote myelination by stimulating oligodendrocyte formation from OPCs, and functionally enhance remyelination in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that a broad range of these pro-myelinating molecules function not through their canonical targets but by directly inhibiting CYP51, sterol 14-reductase, and EBP, a narrow range of enzymes within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. We found that chemical or genetic inhibition of these enzymes resulted in accumulation of &#x394;8,9-unsaturated sterol intermediates, which when independently supplied to OPCs enhanced formation of new oligodendrocytes. Functional studies showed that small molecule inhibitors of CYP51, sterol 14-reductase, and EBP induce accumulation of &#x394;8,9-unsaturated sterols in human brain tissue in vitro and mouse brain tissue in vivo. At the same doses, these molecules also enhance the rate of myelination in vivo in a lysolecithin-induced mouse model of focal demyelination. Collectively, our results provide a unifying mechanism-of-action for most known small-molecule enhancers of oligodendrocyte formation and highlight specific targets for the development of optimal remyelinating therapeutics.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Methods</heading><p id="p-0287" num="0246">No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.</p><heading id="h-0009" level="2">Small Molecules</heading><p id="p-0288" num="0247">The identity and purity of small molecules were authenticated by LC/MS before use.

Multiple groups have identified screening hits that show functional benefit in animal models of demyelination. However, translation of these findings to humans has been impeded by lack of knowledge of the functional targets of these molecules in enhancing oligodendrocyte formation. Previously we used mouse pluripotent stem cell-derived OPCs to identify structurally-diverse imidazole antifungal drugs as a robust class of hits that stimulate the generation of new mouse and human oligodendrocytes and enhance remyelination in mouse disease models. Imidazole antifungals are known to mediate their effects in yeast by inhibiting sterol 14-&#x3b1;-demethylase (CYP51), an essential enzyme for sterol biosynthesis in both fungal and mammalian cells. However, the mechanism of action of imidazole antifungal drugs in OPCs has remained undefined.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0265">To test whether CYP51 inhibition is responsible for the effect of imidazole antifungal drugs in promoting the generation of oligodendrocytes from OPCs, we assembled a collection of nine azole-containing molecules with wide-ranging potency for mammalian CYP51 inhibition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). We used a mass spectrometry-based biochemical assay to confirm that FDA-approved imidazole antifungals (miconazole, clotrimazole, and ketoconazole) showed clear inhibition of rodent CYP51 in vitro with similar IC<sub>50 </sub>values ranging from 300-700 nM (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). Three close analogs of ketoconazole known to lack antifungal activity were strikingly less effective at inhibiting mammalian CYP51: namely, the R-trans and S-trans diastereomers of ketoconazole and a truncated analog, Imidazole 124 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>,B). Additionally, we confirmed that the triazole antifungal fluconazole, which selectively targets yeast CYP51, did not inhibit mammalian CYP51 in vitro (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). For each molecule in our panel, potency for inhibition of mammalian CYP51 in vitro paralleled the enhanced formation of mature myelin basic protein-positive (MBP+) oligodendrocytes from mouse epiblast stem cell-derived OPCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>,D). These findings suggest that imidazole antifungals act by their canonical target, CYP51, to enhance oligodendrocyte formation.</p><p id="p-0309" num="0266">Since CYP51 is known to function in cholesterol biosynthesis in mammalian cells, we assessed functional inhibition of CYP51 in OPCs using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to measure cellular sterol levels. Mouse OPCs were treated with each azole-containing molecule for 24 hours, at which point they were lysed for analysis by GC/MS and levels of lanosterol, the substrate of CYP51, as well as downstream cholesterol levels were quantified. Lanosterol accumulated in OPCs only after treatment with each of five active imidazole antifungals, mirroring the effects of these molecules on CYP51 function in our biochemical assay (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B</figref>,E, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>). Notably, to eliminate potential cell source or assay artifacts, we confirmed all effects of small molecules on oligodendrocyte formation and sterol levels using a second, independently isolated batch of mouse epiblast stem cell-derived OPCs (Extended Data <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b><i>b</i>-<i>d</i></figref>; see Methods for details of OPC derivations). Additionally, the effects of azole molecules on oligodendrocyte formation and lanosterol levels were confirmed using primary mouse OPCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>E</figref>,F), using an orthogonal image quantitation approach measuring total process length (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref>), and using PLP1 as a second marker of oligodendrocyte formation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>H</figref>). For ketoconazole, the dose-response for accumulation of lanosterol closely resembled the dose-response for enhanced oligodendrocyte formation (compare <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F, <b>1</b>C</figref>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>51</b>, <b>5</b>B</figref>). The tight correlation between CYP51 inhibition and enhanced formation of oligodendrocytes among these highly structurally diverse azole-containing small molecules suggests that CYP51 is the relevant target in OPCs.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0267">We next used genetic manipulation and metabolite supplementation to independently confirm the role of CYP51 in oligodendrocyte formation. We used cell-permeable siRNA reagents to deplete CYP51 transcript levels in OPCs by 80% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref>). Suppression of CYP51 led to significant accumulation of lanosterol and enhanced formation of MBP+ oligodendrocytes, although this effect was smaller than seen for ketoconazole treatment, likely due to the siRNA treatment's slower kinetics and incomplete target suppression (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>H</figref>,I, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>J</figref>; confirmed in an independent OPC batch in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>K</figref>,L).

This finding suggests that accumulation of sterol intermediates may play a direct role in enhancing oligodendrocyte formation from OPCs.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0268">Since CYP51 inhibition was sufficient to induce the formation of oligodendrocytes, we used a chemical genetics approach to test whether modulation of other steps in cholesterol biosynthesis has a similar effect. Cholesterol biosynthesis is a long, intricately regulated pathway for which many high-quality small-molecule probes and approved drugs are available (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). We collected selective small-molecule inhibitors of eight enzymes throughout the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and assessed their impact on oligodendrocyte generation and sterol levels in OPCs. We confirmed that inhibitors targeting sterol-metabolizing enzymes selectively caused the accumulation of the expected upstream sterol intermediates in OPCs, and for all probes we confirmed reduced levels of one or both of the pathway's terminal products, desmosterol and cholesterol (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A-D</figref>). We evaluated the effects of each of these eight pathway inhibitors on OPC differentiation to oligodendrocytes. Only molecules targeting CYP51 (ketoconazole), sterol 14-reductase (amorolfine), and EBP (TASIN-1) enhanced formation of MBP+ oligodendrocytes, whereas inhibitors of the five other pathway enzymes were ineffective (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>E</figref>, confirmed in Extended Data <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>f</i></figref>, validated in primary OPCs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>G</figref>,H). Treatments had minimal effect on total cell number during the 3 d assay (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>E</figref>). Amorolfine and TASIN-1 were effective at doses below 100 nM, with potency for accumulation of 14-dehydrozymostenol and zymostenol mirroring potency for enhancement of oligodendrocyte formation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>71</b></figref>). Direct treatment of OPCs with 14-dehydrozymostenol and zymostenol enhanced the formation of MBP+ oligodendrocytes, whereas other sterols associated with steps downstream of EBP, including cholesterol itself, were ineffective (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>J</figref>,K,). In total, this chemical genetic analysis suggests that inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway within a limited window spanning CYP51 to EBP is sufficient for enhancing the formation of oligodendrocytes. The mechanism of this effect is not mediated by simple reduction of sterol levels as statin drugs and various other pathway inhibitors that we confirmed as depleting cholesterol and desmosterol levels did not modulate OPC differentiation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>,B). Notably, the sterol intermediates that accumulate following inhibition of steps between CYP51 and EBP are unified by the presence of an &#x394;8,9 unsaturation, suggesting a chemical basis for their functional effect to enhance oligodendrocyte formation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>).</p><p id="p-0312" num="0269">In parallel, we executed a screen of over 3,000 bioactive small molecules and approved drugs at a uniform dose of 2 &#x3bc;M (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>). This library contains many approved drugs screened previously, as well as a wide range of non-approved drug candidates and well-annotated chemical probes. Among our hits, we obtained nine imidazole antifungals as well as other molecules previously annotated as enhancing OPC differentiation, including clemastine (Extended Data Table 1). We also identified many confirmed hits with known targets that did not cluster into easily discernible categories (Extended Data Table 1). Among molecules not previously reported to modulate OPC differentiation, our top hit was EPZ005687, an inhibitor of the histone methyltransferase EZH2. EPZ005687 enhanced oligodendrocyte formation in both our mouse epiblast stem cell-derived OPCs and mouse primary OPCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B-F</figref>). Surprisingly, we verified that three structurally analogous EZH2 inhibitors had no effect on OPC differentiation, suggesting that EPZ005687 had an idiosyncratic off-target effect beyond EZH2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>C</figref>,D,F). We examined the effects of these four EZH2 inhibitors in our GC/MS-based sterol profiling assay and found that EPZ005687 uniquely caused accumulation of zymosterol and zymostenol in OPCs, indicative of EBP inhibition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>G-I</figref>). Among these four closely-related EZH2 inhibitors, structural differences relating to the presence of the morpholine and indazole rings appear to enable EPZ005687 alone to inhibit EBP in OPCs and

identified in previously published screens) and found that all 10 induced altered sterol profiles at the screening dose (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-B</figref>). Seven molecules inhibited EBP, two molecules inhibited sterol 14-reductase activity, and one molecule (fulvestrant) targeted CYP51 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>C-D</figref>). Four of these molecules have previously been shown to modulate sterol 14-reductase or EBP activity in CNS-derived cells: ziprasidone, ifenprodil, hydroxyzine, and raloxifene. Among 10 library molecules that we independently confirmed do not affect OPC differentiation to oligodendrocytes at the screening dose, none enhanced levels of 8,9-unsaturated sterol intermediates (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-B</figref>). These data show that modulation of sterol synthesis appears to be a dominant mechanism-of-action for enhancing the formation of oligodendrocytes among small molecules identified by high-throughput screening.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0271">Given the frequency of cholesterol pathway modulators within our top screening hits, we assessed whether any previously-reported enhancers of remyelination might also induce sterol intermediate accumulation. We assembled a collection of molecules reported to induce OPC differentiation through a variety of canonical targets: benztropine (muscarinic receptor), clemastine (H1 receptor and muscarinic receptor), tamoxifen (estrogen receptor), U50488 (&#x3ba;-opioid receptor), bexarotene (RXR), and liothyronine (thyroid hormone receptor). We identified the dose at which each molecule shows near-maximal upregulation of oligodendrocyte formation and then evaluated each molecule in our GC/MS sterol profiling assay (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>E-G</figref>). Benztropine, clemastine, tamoxifen, and U50488 induced accumulation of zymostenol and zymosterol and decreased basal sterol levels, indicative of inhibition of EBP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>C-D</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>H</figref>). Tamoxifen has been shown previously to inhibit EBP in a biochemical assay, in cell culture models, and in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. By contrast, liothyronine and bexarotene showed minimal effects on sterol levels, consistent with their known functions as regulators of transcription factor function and confirming that many, but not all, treatments that enhance oligodendrocyte formation cause sterol intermediate accumulation.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0272">Inhibition of EBP in OPCs following treatment with clemastine, tamoxifen, or other small molecules could result from direct targeting of EBP or could reflect a downstream consequence of each molecule inhibiting its canonical protein target. We assessed direct inhibition of EBP in vitro using a GC/MS-based biochemical assay of EBP enzymatic activity. We observed clear inhibition by the selective EBP inhibitor TASIN-1 as well as by benztropine, clemastine, tamoxifen, and U50488, with more potent cellular EBP inhibitors showing a greater magnitude of inhibition (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref>). We also annotated two molecules identified in our bioactives screen, EPZ005687 and hydroxyzine, as directly inhibiting EBP enzymatic activity in this biochemical assay, suggesting that many enhancers of oligodendrocyte formation directly target EBP in OPCs.</p><p id="p-0317" num="0273">We sought additional evidence that muscarinic receptor antagonists and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) mediate enhanced oligodendrocyte formation in OPCs by acting on EBP as their functional target. Although clemastine and benztropine have been validated as inducers of OPC differentiation to oligodendrocytes, previous work suggested that many other muscarinic receptor antagonists do not share this functional property. Using our bioactives screening data, we selected four muscarinic receptor antagonists with varying isoform selectivity and independently confirmed that all four do not enhance MBP+ oligodendrocyte generation at 2 &#x3bc;M (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-C</figref>). However, in independent cellular activity assays also performed at 2 &#x3bc;M, these four molecules and clemastine showed comparable, near-complete inhibition of the of the muscarinic receptor M1, M3, and M5 isoforms, suggesting that muscarinic receptors may not be the functional target in OPCs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>D</figref>). In contrast to clemastine and benztropine, which enhance 8,9-unsaturated sterol accumulation and directly inhibit EBP enzymatic activity, profiling of cellular sterol levels for the muscarinic receptor antagonists that do not enhance oligodendrocyte formation revealed no effect on zymostenol or other sterol intermediates in OPCs, and no inhibition of EBP was observed in an enzymatic activity assay (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>E-F</figref>). These findings suggest that only muscarinic receptor antagonists that inhibit EBP can enhance formation of oligodendrocytes.</p><p id="p-0318" num="0274">The ability to inhibit EBP in OPCs also predicts enhanced formation of oligodendrocytes among selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Multiple SERMs have been shown to potently target EBP in other cell types, with the tertiary amine functionality of SERMs like tamoxifen and toremifene believed to mimic EBP's sterol C8 cation-like transition state when protonated at physiological pH. We confirmed that toremifene inhibited EBP and enhanced MBP+ oligodendrocyte generation over a wide dose range (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>G-L</figref>). Ospemifene is also an FDA-approved SERM that is structurally identical to toremifene except for the substitution of a primary alcohol for toremifene's tertiary amine functionality. This change prevents ospemifene from bearing a positive charge at physiological pH and should eliminate EBP inhibitory activity. Indeed, ospemifene did not inhibit EBP in OPCs and did not enhance differentiation to MBP+ oligodendrocytes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>G-L</figref>). Notably, toremifene and ospemifene demonstrated comparable antiestrogen effects in an independent estrogen-dependent cell proliferation assay, suggesting that among structurally near-identical SERMs the ability to inhibit EBP, and not modulation of the estrogen receptor, predicts enhanced oligodendrocyte formation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>L</figref>).</p><p id="p-0319" num="0275">Because our results suggest that sterol modulation is a shared function of many (but not all) compounds that enhance oligodendrocyte formation, we tested the potential for combinations of small molecules to show additive or non-additive effects. Combining the thyroid hormone agonist liothyronine with a range of sterol-modulating OPC differentiation-inducing treatments produced additive effects on oligodendrocyte formation, indicating that these molecules likely function by mechanisms other than thyroid hormone receptor signaling to enhance oligodendrocyte generation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A</figref>,B). In contrast, combinations of ketoconazole at a maximally effective dose with any of four previously-reported enhancers of OPC differentiation (benztropine, clemastine, tamoxifen, and U50488) did not enhance differentiation above levels seen for ketoconazole alone (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>). This non-additive effect is consistent with these molecules sharing 8,9-unsaturated sterol accumulation as a common mechanism for induction of oligodendrocyte formation. By inhibiting pathway flux at CYP51 with ketoconazole, inhibitors of EBP can no longer cause further sterol accumulation or enhance oligodendrocyte formation.</p><p id="p-0320" num="0276">Since our in vitro OPC assays only model the initial differentiation event into oligodendrocytes, we next tested whether sterol pathway modulation also enhanced subsequent oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination in vitro and in vivo. We cultured OPCs for 14 days on electrospun microfibers to assess the effects of sterol pathway modulators on oligodendrocytes' ability to track and wrap along axon-like substrates. Ketoconazole (CYP51), amorolfine (sterol 14-reductase), and TASIN-1 (EBP), each of which function to accumulate sterol intermediates in OPCs, significantly enhanced MBP+ oligodendrocyte tracking along and wrapping of the microfibers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-C</figref>). Inhibition of other enzymes, up- or downstream in the pathway, had no effect on oligodendrocyte maturation and ensheathment of microfibers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0321" num="0277">Previously we established that the imidazole antifungal miconazole, which targets CYP51, penetrates the mouse blood brain barrier and enhances remyelination in mouse models of demyelination. To assess whether inhibition of other sterol pathway enzymes may also enhance remyelination in vivo, we selected one inhibitor of sterol 14-reductase (ifenprodil) and one inhibitor of EBP (tamoxifen) for further evaluation. Both ifenprodil and tamoxifen are known to cross the mouse blood brain barrier. We first used GC/MS-based sterol profiling to test target engagement in vivo in the CNS. Miconazole (10 mg per kg (body weight)), ifenprodil (10 mg per kg), and tamoxifen (2 mg per kg) each induced significant accumulation of 8,9-unsaturated sterols in the brain of adult wild type mice following 3 days of intraperitoneal dosing (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>). These data demonstrate that the sterol modulators miconazole, ifenprodil, and tamoxifen can functionally engage CYP51, sterol 14-reductase, and EBP respectively in the mouse CNS.</p><p id="p-0322" num="0278">Previously we demonstrated the positive effects of miconazole on remyelination using a well-established mouse model where injection of lysolecithin is used to create focal lesions of demyelination in the dorsal column white matter of the adult spinal cord. To test whether accumulation of other 8,9-unsaturated sterols enhances remyelination in vivo, we treated lesioned mice with ifenprodil (10 mg per kg) or tamoxifen (2 mg per kg) by daily intraperitoneal injection. Treatment began 4 days after lesion, and the effects on remyelination were quantified histologically 8 days later (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>). In vehicle treated animals, profiles of sparsely distributed remyelinating axons characterized by thin myelin sheaths were detected mainly at the periphery of the lesion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>), while ultrastructural analyses revealed unmyelinated axons or axons with a single wrap of myelin (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>). By contrast, following 8 days of treatment with ifenprodil or tamoxifen, remyelination was widespread throughout the lesion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>). In both central and peripheral regions of the lesion the majority of axons were surrounded by thin myelin sheaths (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>D</figref>). No obvious differences in axonal diameter were apparent between unmyelinated and myelinated axons, and both small diameter and larger diameter axons appeared equally myelinated in both treatments. Collectively, these data show that small molecule inhibitors of CYP51, sterol 14-reductase, and EBP can significantly enhance remyelination in mice.</p><p id="p-0323" num="0279">Finally, we also established that the sterol-modulating activities of miconazole, ifenprodil, and tamoxifen are not limited to murine cells but extend to human cells and tissue. We performed sterol profiling in a human glioma cell line and established that these molecules caused accumulation of the expected sterol intermediates (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>). Likewise, miconazole and ifenprodil led to 8,9-unsaturated sterol accumulation within human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical spheroids, further confirming that these molecules similarly engage the sterol synthesis pathway in mouse and human cells and CNS tissue (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0324" num="0280">Although multiple groups have identified small-molecule enhancers of oligodendrocyte formation, a key hurdle to clinical translation of these findings to patients with diseases of white matter is the incomplete understanding of these molecules' functional targets in OPCs. Here we define a dominant mechanism shared by many small molecule enhancers of remyelination: elevation of sterol intermediate levels by inhibition of a narrow window of cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes spanning CYP51 to EBP. In all we have characterized twenty-four small molecules with wide-ranging canonical targets as both enhancing myelination and elevating sterol intermediate levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>). No molecules have yet been identified that inhibit steps between CYP51 and EBP but are ineffective at enhancing oligodendrocyte formation. Several of these molecules have previously been shown to elevate 8,9-unsaturated sterol levels in mouse CNS cells and in human patients. Supplying OPCs with 8,9-unsaturated sterols was sufficient to enhance the formation of oligodendrocytes, whereas depleting cholesterol levels was ineffective, suggesting that sterol intermediate accumulation plays a positive role in facilitating oligodendrocyte formation from OPCs. Notably, accumulation of 8,9-unsaturated sterol intermediates has been observed in other cell state transitions, and altering the sterol composition of membranes can perturb membrane structure and signaling. Moreover, other labs have independently shown that multiple molecules annotated here as enhancing sterol intermediate levels have reversed paralysis in mice with MS-like disease, suggesting that altering sterol levels in vivo can regenerate functional myelin. Ultimately, our work demonstrates that modulating the sterol landscape in OPCs can enhance the formation of oligodendrocytes and points to new therapeutic targets, potent inhibitors for these targets, and metabolite-based biomarkers to accelerate the development of optimal remyelinating therapeutics.</p><p id="p-0325" num="0281">It should be understood that the methods described herein may be carried out in a number of ways and with various modifications and permutations thereof that are well known in the art.
