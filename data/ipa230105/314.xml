Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a medical device; specifically, the present disclosure relates to a medical device which can perform suction, irrigation and debridement without replacing equipment.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Prior Art</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">In traditional surgeries, the use of suction/irrigation devices to reduce liquid waste that result in low visibility of tissues, endoscopes to view the inside of tissues, and debridement devices to remove devitalized tissues all require the use of both hands and the need to replace devices frequently. As a result, a surgeon's job becomes very complex.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, in order to perform cautery, the cautery device needs to be inserted after removing the debridement devices or suction/irrigation devices; hence, the operational procedures for surgeons are very complex.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, an ideal set up would include a single medical device that has multiple functions so as to decrease the frequency of the surgeon replacing the surgical instruments and to ensure the safety of the patient receiving surgical treatment.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure intends to provide a medical device which is convenient for surgeons to use and has safety activation mechanisms.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present disclosure provides a medical device including an outer tube, an operation portion, and a control portion. The control portion has a channel communicated with the outer tube along the first direction. The control portion includes a control module, and the control module includes a suction control portion, a suction port actuator, and a switching unit. The suction control portion has a stopping unit toward the channel, and is configured to move along a second direction which is different from the channel. The suction port actuator is located at the side opposite to the suction control portion with the channel therebetween and driven by the suction control portion. The switching unit is configured to be released and driven by the suction control portion to switch the work status of the operation unit.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">When the suction control portion is located at the first position, the control module is configured to stop the suction port actuator from creating suction in the channel and the switching unit is configured to stop the activation of the operation unit.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the suction control portion is located at the second position, the control module is configured to enable the suction port actuator to create suction in the channel.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">When the suction control portion is located at the third position, the control module is configured to enable the suction port actuator to create suction in the channel and drive the switching unit to activate the operation portion. In addition, the stopping unit at least partially extends into the channel.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Through the mentioned configuration, a single medical device can perform multiple tasks; specifically, it can perform debridement at the same time as drawing blood so as to ensure good visibility during the process of surgery. In addition, the suction control portion is further prevented from moving from the second position to the third position by using the combination of the stopping unit and the external device.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is an exploded view drawing of an embodiment of the medical device of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a plane diagram of the internal structure of an embodiment of the medical device of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a diagram of a partial cross-section of the control portion of an embodiment of the medical device of the present disclosure when the suction control portion is located at the first position.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> is a diagram of a partial cross-section of the control portion of an embodiment of the medical device of the present disclosure when the suction control portion is located at the second position.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> is a diagram of a partial cross-section of the control portion of an embodiment of the medical device of the present disclosure when the suction control portion is located at the third position.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref> is a diagram of a stopping unit of an embodiment of the medical device of the present disclosure preventing the suction control portion from moving from the second position to the third position.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> is a plane diagram of the internal structure of an embodiment of the medical device of the present disclosure when inserting an external instrument.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a plane diagram of preventing the suction control portion from moving from the second position to the third position when inserting the external instrument.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref> is a back view of an embodiment of the medical device before inserting the external instrument.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref> is a back view of an embodiment of the medical device after inserting the external instrument.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> is an exploded view of a variant embodiment of the medical device.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> is a three-dimensional diagram of a variant embodiment of the medical device.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram illustrating the suction control portion of the medical device in another embodiment of the present invention switching between the first state and the second state.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is a plane diagram illustrating the medical device in another embodiment of the present invention when the suction control portion is located at the first location and in the first state.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> is a plane diagram illustrating the medical device in another embodiment of the present invention when the suction control portion is located at the third position.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is a diagram of a partial cross-section of the control portion when the suction control portion of in another embodiment of the medical device of the present invention is located at the first location and in the second state.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> is a plane diagram illustrating the medical device in another embodiment of the present invention when the suction control portion is located at the second position.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The various embodiments will be described in detail below, people skilled in the art may easily understand the advantages and effects of the present disclosure through the contents disclosed in the present specification with reference to the accompanying drawing conception principles.

Therefore, the switching unit <b>330</b> can be released and driven by the suction control portion <b>310</b> so as to switch the work status of the operation portion <b>20</b>. However, the switching unit <b>330</b> can be activated if at least a portion of the protruding portion <b>312</b> is in contact with or presses on the switching unit <b>330</b> when the suction control portion <b>310</b> moves to the third position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) along the second direction D<b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Specifically, in the present embodiment, when the suction control portion <b>310</b> is located at the first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), the control module <b>300</b> is configured to stop the suction port actuator <b>320</b> from creating suction in the channel and to make the switching unit <b>330</b> stop the operation of the operation portion <b>20</b>. For example, in the present embodiment, the suction control portion <b>310</b> is configured to be at least partially located inside a first channel P<b>1</b> extending along the second direction D<b>2</b>, and includes an upper O-ring <b>313</b>, lower O-ring <b>314</b> and an extending portion <b>315</b> located between the upper O-ring <b>313</b> and the lower O-ring <b>314</b> and moving along and within the first channel P<b>1</b>. The upper and lower ends of the extending portion <b>315</b> are connected to the portions on which the upper O-ring <b>313</b> and the lower O-ring <b>314</b> are disposed respectively, so as to link up the movements of the upper O-ring <b>313</b> and the lower O-ring <b>314</b>. In addition, the portion of the extending portion <b>315</b> configured to pass through the channel <b>31</b> is inwardly concaved toward one side or configured to avoid the channel <b>31</b> so as to keep the channel <b>31</b> unblocked.

On the other hand, the width of the portion of the first channel P<b>1</b> located over the channel <b>31</b> is quite uniform; therefore, when the suction control portion <b>310</b> moves from the first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) to the second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>), the upper O-ring <b>313</b> and the wall of the first channel P<b>1</b> can be kept in contact.

The second channel P<b>2</b> may have the same or similar structure as the first channel P<b>1</b>; therefore, at the same time when the upper O-ring <b>341</b> and the wall of the second channel P<b>2</b> are kept in close contact, the relative position between the lower O-ring <b>342</b> and the wall of the second channel P<b>2</b> is changed along with the movement of the extending portion <b>343</b>. The irrigation port actuator <b>350</b> is configured to stop irrigation in the channel <b>31</b> when the lower O-ring <b>342</b> and the wall of the second channel P<b>2</b> are in close contact, and to enable the irrigation port actuator <b>350</b> to irrigate in the channel <b>31</b> when the close contact between the lower O-ring <b>342</b> and the wall of the second channel P<b>2</b> is broken; however, the designs of the irrigation control portion <b>340</b> and the irrigation port actuator <b>350</b> of the present disclosure are not limited thereto.

In addition, the stopping unit <b>311</b> at least partially extends into the channel <b>31</b>. In other words, when another instrument is extended into the channel <b>31</b>, the stopping portion <b>311</b> will be stopped immediately and cannot move down. As a result, the suction control portion <b>310</b> cannot move to the third position. Furthermore, in the present embodiment, when the suction control portion <b>310</b> is located at the third position (please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>), the stopping portion <b>311</b> may be extended to a second depth d<b>2</b> of the channel <b>31</b>, and the second depth d<b>2</b> is greater than the first depth d<b>1</b>. Specifically, when the suction control portion <b>310</b> moves from the second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) to the third position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>), the upper O-ring <b>313</b> and the wall of the first channel P<b>1</b> can be kept in close contact, and the lower O-ring <b>314</b> and the wall of the first channel P<b>1</b> not in close contact. As such, the control module <b>300</b> can keep the suction valve <b>321</b> open. After the protruding portion <b>312</b> is at least partially in contact with the switching unit <b>330</b>, the switching unit <b>330</b> is driven to activate the operation portion <b>20</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, the control module <b>300</b> may further include a motor <b>360</b> providing power to the operation portion <b>20</b> and a cable <b>361</b> electrically connecting the motor <b>360</b> and the switching unit <b>330</b>. As such, when the suction control portion <b>310</b> is located at the third position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>), the switching unit <b>330</b> drives the motor <b>360</b> to switch the operation portion <b>20</b> to the working status. However, the structure of the suction port actuator <b>320</b> and principles of driving the suction port actuator <b>320</b> or the switching unit <b>330</b> are not limited thereto. For example, the motor <b>360</b> and the switching unit <b>330</b> may be connected wirelessly or the switching unit <b>330</b> may be connected to a driver in the operation portion <b>20</b> directly and wirelessly. As long as the driving of the suction port actuator <b>320</b> or the switching unit <b>330</b> is dependent on the suction port actuator <b>320</b>, the present disclosure is not limited thereto.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Therefore, a single suction port actuator <b>320</b> (For example, it can be a button protruding over the medical device <b>1</b>) may perform tasks such as suction and debridement, and it is very convenient for surgeons to operate. In addition, when the operation portion <b>20</b> performs tasks such as debridement, suctioning is still ongoing. Therefore, even if tissues such as brain tissues are bleeding under surgical treatment, good visibility can be ensured by absorbing blood as soon as possible. In addition, since the suction control portion <b>310</b> has the stopping unit <b>311</b>, it is possible to prevent or decrease the chance of the suction control portion <b>310</b> moving to the third position unexpectedly (for example, moving to the third position only if the suction control portion <b>310</b> is pressed hard), activating the operation portion <b>20</b> and damaging the part under surgery or the extended instrument.

In addition, in the second state, the protruding portion <b>312</b> is not collinear with the switching unit <b>330</b> along the second direction D<b>2</b>; therefore, even if the suction control portion <b>310</b> in the second state moves along the second direction D<b>2</b>, it will not reach the third position where the protruding portion <b>312</b> is in contact with the switching unit <b>330</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>) but will reach the second position where only a suction is driven (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the present embodiment, when the external instrument <b>50</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) is inserted, it is impossible to switch from the second state to the first state. In addition, when the suction control portion <b>310</b> moves from the second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>) to the third position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>), it is necessary to move the suction control portion <b>310</b> to the first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>) along the second direction D<b>2</b>, then switch from the second state to the first state by rotation, and move the suction control portion <b>310</b> along the second direction D<b>2</b>. Therefore, when the operation is performed using the external instrument <b>50</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>) or only a suction is performed, it is further possible to prevent the operation portion <b>20</b> from being activated by accident and injuring the patient.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In summary, according to the medical device of the present disclosure, the work of debridement and suction can be performed at the same time based on the structure of the channel connected with the operation portion so as to ensure good visibility in the process of surgery. At the same time, when combined with an external device such as a cautery device and the operation portion is confirmed to have stopped, it is also possible to perform cautery and suction at the same time, or suction only.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">The aforementioned description merely represents the preferred embodiment of the present disclosure. It should be noted that various changes and modifications of the present disclosure are allowed without departing from the concepts and principles of the present disclosure. People skilled in the art should understand the present disclosure is limited by claims and various equivalent alternation based on the specification and FIGS. are consequently viewed as being embraced by the scope of the present disclosure.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
