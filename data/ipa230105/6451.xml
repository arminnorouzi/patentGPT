INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0002" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to an arrangement for a redundant control system, which includes a first rack which is formed with a plurality of slots for receiving individual assemblies, which form a first automation system when assembled in a modular manner, and additionally includes a second rack with a further plurality of slots for receiving further individual assemblies, which likewise form a second automation system when assembled in a modular manner.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention additionally relates to high-availability automation devices where. as a general rule. two automation devices run in parallel and control a process, such that should one automation system fail then, as a general rule, the other automation system assumes control in a smooth manner.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The goal of the platform independent Open Platform Communications OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) protocol and its information models is to facilitate standardized and interoperable communication for industrial automation. The interoperability in this context is the ability of industrial automation systems (or their parts of) to exchange data with unambiguous, shared meaning. This characteristic greatly reduces implementation effort and enables communication with cross-manufacturer industrial equipment. Apart from this, applications that operate on data from industrial equipment can be developed independently from the equipment, no matter where in an architecture the applications execute. The only prerequisite for communication with an industrial automation system is to use the OPC UA communication interface and its standardized information model. In order to feature the standardized and interoperable communication, new industrial automation systems may be designed to be compliant with the OPC UA standard.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">EP 0 497 174 A1 discloses a method and an apparatus for operating an automation system with a redundant construction consisting of two subsystems.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to supply power or voltage, these two subsystems require a power supply assembly. In order to also increase the availability of the power supply, as a general rule two redundantly operating power supply assemblies can be or are also used in each subsystem.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">With two power supply assemblies, it is possible for a redundant power supply of a rack to be constructed. In order to also construct a redundant power supply for the second rack, this likewise must be populated with two redundant power supply assemblies. This kind of power supply redundancy is always recommended if the availability of the controller is to be improved further still, particularly if the controllers are to be operated on an unreliable network.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with the known prior art, as a general rule two racks are installed in redundant automation systems, where the racks are either installed in one control cabinet or in control cabinets that are separate from one another. Particularly in the redundant automation system, the redundancy of the power supply of the racks is of additional importance. A fault in the power supply assembly should not lead to the failure of the rack. In this context, redundant power supplies are mostly implemented by plugging additional, redundant power supply assemblies into the rack. In a redundant automation system which is mounted in a control cabinet, in this context four power supply assemblies are plugged in within immediate spatial proximity to one another, for example. The slots required for this purpose then can no longer be used for other assemblies in the rack.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In conventional automation systems or the racks thereof which are designed in a duplicate manner, it is disadvantageous that the space available for additional assemblies, such as in the control cabinet, is reduced, because two slots must be sacrificed for a redundant power supply at least for each automation system or for each of the racks.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is an object of the present invention to provide an arrangement of racks that enables power supply redundancy and nevertheless requires fewer slots for the redundant power supply assemblies.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This and other objects and advantage are achieved in accordance with the invention by an arrangement in which a slot of a first rack is formed as a first supply module receptacle with a first contact structure, and a slot of a second rack is formed as a second supply module receptacle with a second contact structure, where the first and the second supply module receptacle are constructed such that they structurally and electrically complement one another from a perspective between the first rack and the second rack to form a supply base module, where the first contact structure is configured to supply the first and the second rack with a supply voltage and the second contact structure is configured to supply the second and the first rack with a supply voltage, and the supply base module formed by the supply module receptacles is configured to receive a first supply voltage module, a second supply voltage module and a third supply voltage module.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The object of the invention is thus achieved by modularizing the power supply assemblies that were previously used in a monolithic manner, where the modularization of the power supply assemblies now enables a more efficient construction of the racks and thus a more effective use of space in a control cabinet. In accordance with the invention, the power supply assembly has now been modularized, where for a start a supply module receptacle, a contact structure and a supply base module with corresponding receiving spaces for the supply voltage modules are available as a kind of assembly system.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">If, in the case of two racks, there is likewise a desire for a redundant power supply, then a constituent part of the rack is configured such that both racks can be contacted with respect to a supply voltage. Accordingly, a slot is formed as a first supply module receptacle. It is possible for a supply voltage module for supplying the rack to be plugged into the supply module receptacle. In this context, the contact structure is configured such that both a left-hand rack and also a right-hand rack can be supplied with a supply voltage.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">If the racks are arranged such that they stand directly adjacent to one another and if a supply base module was formed from the individual supply module receptacles, then three supply voltage modules can be plugged in. In this context, all three supply voltage modules are capable of supplying both racks with a supply voltage in a secure manner. It is considered to be a particular advantage that the supply voltage modules can be replaced on an individual basis during ongoing operation. What is known as a &#x201c;two out of three&#x201d; redundancy (2oo3) is produced for the power supply of the two racks. Each of the three supply voltage modules could now fail, without there being any risk to the power supply of both racks.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">With respect to a high-availability control of an industrial process, it is advantageous if the first automation system and the second automation system are each established as a system for increasing the fail-safe operation via a changeover function between the two automation systems in the event of a failure on one side of an automation system.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, should a complete failure of the system be caused and both automation systems must restart again, then it is advantageous if the arrangement is provided with a monitor, which is configured to record a current system state of each of the two automation systems, where the monitor is furthermore configured, following a failure of the two automation systems, to support a prioritized startup of the automation system for which a temporally more recent system state is available.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">In many application cases, the redundant automation system should restart after turning on the power supply with the most recent system state. The most recent system state possibly differs between the automation devices of the two racks, if for example the power supplies thereof have failed at different points in time.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Furthermore, it is advantageous if the supply base module is constructed in a divisible manner, which makes it possible to &#x201c;swap out&#x201d; or replace a rack during operation without the respective other automation system failing.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">Other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.
