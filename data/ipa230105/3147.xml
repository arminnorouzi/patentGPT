Such sensors may be used to measure operational parameters of the muffler, such as NOx concentration, NH3 concentration, temperature, pressure, etc.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is well-known to design an engine exhaust muffler in the form of an elongated cylinder with a double-walled shell formed of an inner wall and an outer wall, preferably with a thermal insulation material between the two, in order to limit the temperature of the muffler's outer surface and/or to raise the temperature inside for optimizing the exhaust gas conversion process. When a sensor is mounted on the muffler, this sensor is mounted in a sensor port comprising a boss that is usually welded inside an opening provided in the inner wall. The boss may be provided with an inner thread into which the sensor casing can be screwed so that the sensing portion of the sensor is inserted in the inner volume of the muffler. On the opposite side, the sensor must be accessible in order to connect it to a measurement unit. To this aim, an opening is provided through the outer wall.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Due to the gap between the walls and even more so when the gap is filled with insulation material, an important temperature difference appears between the inner and outer walls of the muffler, once the muffler reaches an operational temperature. As a consequence of this, the inner and outer wall undergo important dimensional shifts with respect to each other, both in the axial direction and in the radial direction of the muffler. The opening provided in the outer wall therefore needs to be considerably larger than the area required for accessing the sensor, so that the relative shift of the walls can take place without damaging the sensor or its connection towards the measurement unit.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Especially in large mufflers, such as the ones used in large agricultural machines, for example combine or forage harvesters, the relative shifts between the inner and outer walls can be in the order of several millimetres, requiring therefore a large gap between the sensor and the outer wall, i.e. a large opening in the outer wall surrounding the boss of the sensor port.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">This opening gives access to dirt or debris, leading to a fire hazard as dirt or dust particles come into contact with the high temperature of the muffler's inner wall. This problem is particularly acute in working environments containing high amounts of dirt or debris particles, such as in an agricultural context.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention is related to a muffler in which the above-described problems have been resolved. The present invention is related to a sealing assembly for a sensor port of a double-walled muffler, and to a muffler provided with such a sealing assembly, as disclosed in the appended claims. The sealing assembly comprises at least an outer plate and a washer-type element, preferably all made of thin steel plate material, for example stainless steel plate of about 0.3 mm thickness. According to an embodiment, the assembly further comprises an inner plate. In that case, the plates are assembled one on top of the other and have overlapping openings. The washer-type element has a planar portion provided with an aperture, and a tube portion protruding from the edge of the aperture. The planar portion is caught between the plates or between the single outer plate and the muffler. The assembly is configured in a manner that allows a lateral movement of the washer-type element relative to the plate or plates. The assembly is mounted on a sensor port that is provided with a boss fixed to the inner wall of the double muffler wall, and with an opening in the outer wall surrounding the boss. The tube portion is fitted over the boss and the single plate or the assembly of the plates is fixed to the outer wall of the muffler, thereby closing off the sensor port from the exterior of the muffler. Any radial or lateral movement of the boss relative to the outer wall is able to take place without losing the sealing function, due to the lateral freedom of movement of the washer-type element relative to the plate or plates, and due to the fact that the boss is able to move relative to the tube portion in a direction perpendicular to the plate or plates, i.e. in a radial direction of the muffler.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The sealing assembly thereby effectively closes off the sensor port, while still allowing any movement of the boss relative to the outer wall, as a consequence of the temperature difference between the inner and outer wall.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an image of a prior art muffler that is suitable for use in an agricultural machine such as a combine harvester.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>a </i></figref>is a detail of a sensor port in the muffler shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b><i>b </i></figref>is a section view of the sensor port.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>shows the components of a sealing assembly applicable in a muffler according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b </i></figref>is an image of the sealing assembly in the assembled state.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>is a section view of the sealing assembly and of two sensor ports, prior to mounting the assembly onto these ports.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b </i></figref>is a frontal view of the two sensor ports.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a </i></figref>is a section view of the sealing assembly and the sensor ports, with the assembly mounted thereon.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b </i></figref>is a frontal view of the sensor ports with the assembly mounted thereon.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a detail of the mounted sealing assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>b</i></figref>, which allows a more detailed view of the positions of the various constituent components.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a detail of an alternative configuration in terms of the dimensions of the inner and outer plate of the sealing assembly and of the openings provided therein.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b </i></figref>are views prior and after assembling the components, of a sealing assembly according to the invention, configured to close off a single sensor port.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment wherein the tube portion of the movable washer of the sealing assembly is oriented away from the muffler's outer wall.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment wherein the sealing assembly comprises a single cover plate.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Preferred embodiments will now be described with reference to the drawings.

The shell comprises an inner wall <b>10</b> and the outer wall <b>11</b>. Preferably, thermal insulation material (not shown) is present in the space between these walls <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>. The sensor port <b>4</b> comprises a boss <b>12</b> that is fixed, preferably welded inside an opening in the inner wall <b>10</b> of the shell. The boss <b>12</b> comprises a central opening <b>14</b>, preferably a threaded opening, into which the sensor <b>5</b> can be screwed tight.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">As seen in the drawings, the outer wall <b>11</b> comprises an opening <b>13</b> around the boss <b>12</b> and the sensor <b>5</b> that is considerably larger than the cross-section of the boss <b>12</b>, in order to allow a movement of the inner and outer walls <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> relative to each other as a consequence of the temperature difference between the two walls, without damaging the sensor <b>5</b>. These openings <b>13</b> are present around all the sensor ports <b>4</b> and represent access locations for dirt, dust or other debris entering the area between the walls <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a muffler <b>1</b> according to the present invention, such openings <b>13</b> are closed off from the environment by a sealing assembly as described hereafter. First an embodiment of the sealing assembly is described that is designed to cover a 2-sensor port arrangement similar to the pairs of sensor ports <b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The invention is however not limited to this particular arrangement, and alternative embodiments will be described further in this specification.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>a </i></figref>shows the components of the sealing assembly before these components are assembled together. The assembly comprises an inner cover plate <b>20</b>, an outer cover plate <b>21</b> and two washer-type elements <b>22</b>. The term &#x2018;washer-type element&#x2019; is used in the appended claims in order to distinguish these elements from what is technically understood to be a &#x2018;washer&#x2019;, i.e. a ring-shaped element used for example for securing bolts. For the sake of brevity, the term &#x2018;washer&#x2019; will nevertheless be used in the detailed description, when referring to the &#x2018;washer-type elements&#x2019; <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The terms &#x2018;inner plate&#x2019; and &#x2018;outer plate&#x2019; refer to the position of the cover plates relative to the muffler when the assembly is mounted thereon: the inner plate <b>20</b> is closer to the muffler than the outer plate <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Both cover plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> are formed of thin steel, preferably stainless steel, which may be as thin as 0.3 mm. It is preferred to use thin plate material which can be easily adapted to the curvature of a muffler and/or to a tilted position of the sensor, which may be required for certain types of sensors. A thicker plate material is however not excluded from the scope of the invention, and the invention is not limited to any particular thickness of the plate material used for the various components of the sealing assembly.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the embodiment shown, the inner plate <b>20</b> is smaller than the outer plate <b>21</b> and placed inside the outer circumference of the outer plate, but this is not a requirement. Both plates may have the same outer dimensions or the inner plate <b>20</b> could be larger than the outer plate <b>21</b>, even though it is preferable that only the outer plate <b>21</b> is visible when the assembly is mounted on the muffler.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> are each provided with a pair of openings, labelled <b>23</b> for the inner plate <b>20</b> and <b>24</b> for the outer plate <b>21</b>, and placed relative to each other at a distance corresponding to the distance between two sensor ports onto which the assembly is to be mounted. In the embodiment shown, the openings <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> in the inner and outer plates have the same shape and size, so that they can be aligned to each other, forming common openings in the assembly of the plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>, when these plates are mounted together.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">The washers <b>22</b> each comprise a planar portion <b>25</b> provided with a central aperture <b>26</b> and a tube portion <b>27</b> protruding from the edge of the central aperture <b>26</b>. The washers <b>22</b> are equally preferably formed of thin stainless steel plate material, preferably having the same thickness as the plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">When these various components are assembled together, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>, to obtain the sealing assembly <b>15</b>, the planar portions <b>25</b> of the washers <b>22</b> are inserted between the inner and outer plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>, with the tube portions <b>27</b> protruding through the openings <b>23</b> of the inner plate <b>20</b>. The inner and outer plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> are attached to each other by a number of spot welds <b>30</b> along the circumference of the inner plate <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>. This may also be a continuous weld or any other suitable attachment means. Preferably, the plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> are attached only along the edge of the smaller of the two plates, or along their common edge, when the two plates have the same outer dimensions. In any case, the plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> are not attached to each other across the entirety of their overlapping surfaces. At least in an area around the aligned openings <b>23</b> and <b>24</b>, the plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> are not attached to each other, enabling the washers <b>22</b> to shift laterally relative to the plates, i.e. in a direction parallel to the plates. This is enabled also by the fact that the cross section of the outer surface of the tube portion <b>27</b> is considerably smaller than the area of the opening <b>23</b> in the inner plate <b>20</b>, through which opening <b>23</b> the tube portion <b>27</b> is protruding, i.e. there is a considerable gap between the tube portion <b>27</b> and the edge of the opening <b>23</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">As noted above, the overlapping openings <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> are the same in size and in shape in this embodiment and are aligned to each other so that the common opening formed by two aligned openings <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> in the assembly of the plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> has the same shape and dimensions as the openings themselves. It is however also possible to apply an opening <b>24</b> in the outer plate <b>21</b> that is larger or smaller than the opening <b>23</b> in the inner plate <b>20</b> with the openings placed one inside the other, or the openings in the outer and inner plates could partially overlap, so that the common opening is defined by the intersection between the overlapping openings. The common opening is however subjected to conditions related to the dimensions of the boss and/or the sensor, as described hereafter.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>a </i></figref>shows the sealing assembly <b>15</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b><i>b</i></figref>, before being mounted on a pair of sensor ports <b>4</b>, each provided with a boss <b>12</b> of the same dimensions. As best seen in the frontal view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b><i>b</i></figref>, the outer wall <b>11</b> is here provided with one large opening <b>13</b> that surrounds the two adjacent sensor ports <b>4</b>. The tube portions <b>27</b> of the assembly are dimensioned in correspondence with the bosses <b>12</b>, in such a manner that the tube portions <b>27</b> can be closely fitted onto said bosses <b>12</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i></figref>. The assembly is mounted onto the sensor ports <b>4</b>, by placing the tube portions <b>27</b> around the bosses <b>12</b> until the outer plate <b>21</b> contacts the outer wall <b>11</b> of the muffler shell. The outer plate <b>21</b> is larger than the opening <b>13</b> and fully overlaps this opening. The opening <b>13</b>, the inner plate <b>20</b> and the planar portions <b>25</b> of the washers <b>22</b> are shown in dotted lines in the frontal view of the mounted assembly in FIG. <b>5</b><i>b</i>. In this particular embodiment, the inner plate <b>20</b> is smaller than the opening <b>13</b> and is positioned inside this opening, but this is not a requirement of the invention (see further). The outer plate <b>21</b> can be attached to the outer wall <b>11</b> by roll spot seam welding or by any other suitable attachment means.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The tube portions <b>27</b> are fitted closely around the bosses <b>12</b> so that the assembly effectively closes off the gap between the bosses <b>12</b> and the edge of the large opening <b>13</b>. Nevertheless, the &#x2018;close fit&#x2019; of the tube portions <b>27</b> still allows a movement of the bosses <b>12</b> relative to the tube portions <b>27</b> in a direction perpendicular to the plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>, i.e. in a radial direction of the muffler. Radial displacements of the bosses <b>12</b> relative to the outer wall <b>11</b> are thereby allowed without subjecting the sealing assembly to stress. Also, lateral displacements of the bosses <b>12</b> relative to the outer wall <b>11</b> are allowed without any danger to the sealing function of the assembly because of the close fit of the tube portions <b>27</b> around the bosses <b>12</b> and the fact that the washers <b>22</b> are moveable relative to the plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> in any direction parallel to these plates. Any lateral movement of the bosses <b>12</b> relative to the outer wall <b>11</b> is followed by the washers <b>22</b>, i.e. the washers <b>22</b> move along with the bosses <b>12</b> by shifting relative to the plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>, so that the planar portion <b>25</b> of the washers <b>22</b> continues to close off the gap between the tube portion <b>27</b> and the opening <b>23</b> in the inner plate <b>20</b>, as well as the gap between the boss (and a sensor mounted thereon) and the opening <b>24</b> in the outer plate <b>21</b>. This requires of course that the dimensions of the planar portions <b>25</b> are large enough so that the gap between the bosses <b>12</b> and the opening <b>13</b> in the outer wall <b>11</b> is closed off by said planar portions <b>25</b> and by the plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>, regardless of the position of the boss <b>12</b> relative to the outer wall <b>11</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The sealing function as described above implies that the common opening defined by openings <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> is sufficiently large compared to the cross section of the bosses <b>12</b> and the tubular portions <b>27</b>, and possibly of the sensors mounted onto the bosses <b>12</b>, so that the bosses <b>12</b> and the tubular portions <b>27</b> as well as the sensors remain at a distance from the edge of either of the openings <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> as the bosses are displaced laterally with respect to these openings. This condition holds regardless of whether the openings <b>23</b> and <b>24</b> are the same size and shape and fully overlapping (as in the embodiment shown), or whether they are different in size and/or shape.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A detail (rectangle R indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>) of the mounted sealing assembly is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, indicating the various components described above. As stated, alternative configurations are possible, for instance in terms of the dimensions of the inner and outer plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> and the way in which the assembly is attached to the outer wall <b>11</b> of the muffler. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an alternative configuration, but others are possible, as is clear to the skilled person. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the inner and outer plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> have the same outer dimensions. The inner plate <b>20</b> is now attached to the outer wall <b>11</b> of the muffler. It is seen that the outer plate <b>21</b> is slightly bent towards the inner plate <b>20</b> in the area outside the washers <b>22</b>, due to the fact that both plates are formed of thin material. This however does not obstruct the lateral movement of the washers <b>22</b> relative to the plates, which is ensured preferably by welding the plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> together only along their outer edges, as for example by a plurality of spot welds <b>30</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Another difference with the first embodiment, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, and applicable independently of changes in the relative outer dimensions of the plates, is that the opening <b>23</b> in the inner plate <b>20</b> is larger than the opening <b>24</b> in the outer plate <b>21</b>. The opening <b>24</b> therefore defines the common opening obtained by the overlapping openings <b>23</b> and <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrate a sealing assembly according to the invention, that is suitable for sealing off a single sensor port. The various components described above are present here as well and are indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b><i>a </i>and <b>8</b><i>b </i></figref>by the same reference numerals. The characteristics and possible alternatives described above are applicable also to this single-port embodiment. Likewise, assemblies according to the invention may be designed for a group of any number of ports higher than 2, by adapting the dimensions and the number of the various components described above. Such embodiments could include higher numbers of cover plates, for example one single outer cover plate <b>21</b> and a separate inner cover plate <b>20</b> for each sensor port. If the sensor ports are sufficiently close together, a single washer <b>22</b> could be provided that is fitted to multiple bosses <b>12</b>, the washer comprising a single planar portion <b>25</b>, multiple apertures <b>26</b> and multiple tube portions <b>27</b> protruding from said apertures <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates an alternative configuration, according to which the sealing assembly is mounted with the tube portion <b>27</b> oriented away from the muffler, and fitted to a boss <b>12</b> that protrudes outward from the outer wall <b>11</b> of the muffler. This is possible only when the boss <b>12</b> is effectively realised in this way, i.e. protruding sufficiently beyond the outer wall <b>11</b>. This embodiment illustrates that the tube portion <b>27</b> may protrude through the opening <b>23</b> of the inner plate <b>20</b> (as in the previous embodiment), or through the opening <b>24</b> in the outer plate <b>21</b> (as in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). Apart from this difference, all the components as well as the characteristics and functionalities described above are applicable also to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to alternative embodiments of the invention, the inner and the outer cover plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b> are not directly attached to each other. According to one such embodiment, the inner plate <b>20</b> is maintained in place only by the outer plate <b>21</b>. In this case, the outer plate <b>21</b> must be larger than the inner plate <b>20</b> and fully overlap the inner plate, and the inner plate <b>20</b> must be considerably larger than the opening <b>13</b> in the outer wall <b>11</b> of the muffler <b>1</b>. The outer plate <b>21</b> is then fixed to the muffler's outer wall <b>11</b>, for example by roll spot seam welding in a peripheral area of the outer plate <b>21</b>, and thereby holds the inner plate <b>20</b> against said outer wall <b>11</b>. Preferably the inner plate <b>20</b> is maintained essentially immobile, for example by the fact that the spot seam welds are applied close to the outer circumference of the inner plate <b>20</b>, and possibly aided by high friction forces between the plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>, to avoid that the inner plate <b>20</b> becomes displaced relative to the outer plate <b>21</b> to such a degree that the sealing function is lost.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the inner plate <b>20</b> is smaller than the outer plate <b>21</b> and placed fully within the circumference of the outer plate <b>21</b>, while being larger than the opening <b>13</b> in the outer muffler wall <b>11</b>, it is also possible to attach both the inner and the outer plate to the muffler wall <b>11</b>, without attaching them directly to each other. This last embodiment of the sealing assembly cannot be assembled fully before attaching it to the muffler, but it is assembled in the course of attaching it to the muffler. This process comprises: attaching the inner plate <b>20</b> to the muffler wall <b>11</b>, for example by spot seam welds, placing the washer <b>22</b> over the boss <b>12</b> of the sensor port, and attaching the outer plate <b>21</b> to the muffler wall <b>11</b>, for example also by spot seam welds, so that the washer <b>22</b> is mounted between the two plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>, thereby realizing the sealing functionality as described above.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A further alternative embodiment of the sealing assembly comprises not two plates, but a single cover plate. In this case, the outer plate <b>21</b> plays the role of the single cover plate, having an opening <b>24</b> that overlaps the opening <b>13</b> in the outer muffler wall <b>11</b>. This embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. The planar portion <b>25</b> of the washer <b>22</b> is now held between the single cover plate <b>21</b> and the outer wall <b>11</b> of the muffler. The cover plate <b>21</b> is attached to the muffler wall for example by spot seam welds, indicated by the dotted lines <b>31</b>, in a peripheral area of the plate <b>21</b>. This leaves sufficient area between the plate <b>21</b> and the muffler wall <b>11</b> for the washer <b>22</b> to move relative to said muffler wall <b>11</b> and relative to the plate <b>21</b>, in a direction parallel to the wall <b>11</b>. The tube portion <b>27</b> of the washer <b>22</b> is fitted to the boss <b>12</b> in the same way as described above for the embodiments comprising two cover plates. The single plate embodiment is equally preferably assembled as it is being attached to the muffler, by the steps of: fitting the washer <b>22</b> over the boss <b>12</b>, and placing the planar portion <b>25</b> of the washer against the outer wall <b>11</b> of the muffler, followed by placing the single cover plate <b>21</b> over the washer <b>22</b> and attaching the plate <b>21</b> to the outer wall <b>11</b>, for example by spot seam welds <b>31</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">The latter embodiment can also be applied to seal off a group of closely spaced sensor ports <b>4</b>, by providing a single cover plate <b>21</b> and a separate washer <b>22</b> for each sensor port, when each sensor port is provided with its own opening <b>13</b> around the boss <b>12</b>. When one opening <b>13</b> surrounds multiple bosses <b>12</b>, it would be possible to provide a single cover plate <b>21</b> and one or more washers <b>22</b> that comprise a single planar portion <b>25</b> having multiple apertures <b>26</b> with multiple tube portions <b>27</b> protruding from the apertures of the single planar portion <b>25</b>.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to any embodiment of the sealing assembly (single plate or inner/outer plate), the outer cover plate <b>21</b> is attached to the outer wall <b>11</b> of the muffler. In most embodiments said outer cover plate <b>21</b> is attached directly to said wall. When the outer plate <b>21</b> is smaller than the inner plate <b>20</b>, the outer plate is directly attached to the inner plate <b>20</b>, said inner plate being directly attached to the muffler wall. So in this case the outer plate <b>21</b> is attached to the muffler wall <b>11</b> via the inner plate, which also represents an embodiment of the outer plate being &#x2018;attached to the outer wall of the muffler&#x2019;.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Also according to any embodiment, the planar portion <b>25</b> of the washer <b>22</b> is mounted between the outer cover plate <b>21</b> and the muffler. When the sealing assembly comprises an inner plate as well, the planar portion <b>25</b> is mounted between the plates <b>20</b> and <b>21</b>, and is thereby still &#x2018;between the outer plate and the muffler&#x2019;.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
