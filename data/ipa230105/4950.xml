In one embodiment, the features disclosed herein will establish and build upon a customer-payment provider relationship.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the following discussion, the term &#x201c;retailer&#x201d; is used to define a company or conglomeration that includes one or more brands. The term &#x201c;brand&#x201d; refers to a specific section of the retailer that includes a number of stores. The term &#x201c;store&#x201d; refers to a single sales location, a store could be a physical store (e.g., brick and mortar) or it could be a virtual store (e.g., a location that is accessed via the web).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The term &#x201c;customer&#x201d; is used herein to describe an actual or potential consumer of the retailer's goods and/or services.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The term &#x201c;co-branded credit account&#x201d; is used herein to describe a general purpose open-end revolving line of credit which is established by a credit provider for an accountholder pursuant to the terms of a credit agreement and in accordance with credit account association rules and regulations, and marketed with the retailer's mark and the trade names and/or logos of a credit account association. In one embodiment, a co-brand credit card has a major/well-known credit card provider Logo in conjunction with a brand specific emblem. The co-brand credit card can be used anywhere (or almost anywhere) a credit card can be used. There can be rewards, offers, financing, etc. as customer incentive. It is an open-ended, revolving credit product. There is often a credit limit, you can purchase as long as there is credit available, it is paid down by the customer making payments (monthly, minimum, in-full, overtime, etc.), and it remains an open account indefinitely, e.g., until canceled by customer or by credit account provider.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, the co-branded credit account can have an associated physical card, e.g., a credit card that is carried by a customer and includes the credit account information required for a purchase. In one embodiment, the co-branded credit account can have an associated virtual card that can be stored in a mobile wallet or otherwise digitally stored by the customer and includes the credit account information required for a purchase. In one embodiment, the co-branded credit account can have both a physical card and a virtual card.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The term &#x201c;private label credit card&#x201d; (PLCC) is used herein to describe a credit account that is intended for use at a specific brand of stores. The PLCC is a type of revolving credit plan managed by a bank or commercial finance company. The PLCC is often issued without an expiration date. In one embodiment, a branded credit card can be used at any store under the brand/retailer. In one embodiment, there may be lower credit limits than a co-branded credit card. In one embodiment, branded credit cards can include rewards, offers, financing, etc. as customer incentive. It is an open-ended, revolving credit product. There is often a credit limit, you can purchase as long as there is credit available, it is paid down by the customer making payments (monthly, minimum, in-full, overtime, etc.), and it remains an open account indefinitely, e.g., until canceled by customer or by credit account provider.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, the PLCC account can have an associated physical card, e.g., a credit card that is carried by a customer and includes the credit account information required for a purchase. In one embodiment, the PLCC account can have an associated virtual card that can be stored in a mobile wallet or otherwise digitally stored by the customer and includes the credit account information required for a purchase. In one embodiment, the PLCC account can have both a physical card and a virtual card.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, a PLCC can be part of a &#x201c;universal PLCC&#x201d; (UPLCC) which is a private label account that issues with an association logo on the back of the associated credit card, the UPLCC usually has limited use. In some cases, the UPLCC can be a part of a conglomeration of different brands that utilize the same card association. For purposes of clarity, in the following discussion the term PLCC is used to describe both the PLCC and the UPLCC.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The term &#x201c;cardholder&#x201d; is used herein to describe a customer that has at least one credit account. As discussed herein, the cardholder could be a customer with a physical card, a virtual card, or both a physical and a virtual card.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The term &#x201c;buy now pay later (BNPL)&#x201d; is used herein to refer to a payment product that is not a new credit product being opened and/or established. Instead, a customer's existing account (such as a debit card, a bank card, a bank account, a co-brand credit account, a PLCC account, a UPLCC account, an installment loan, or the like), is used to back the BNPL product which is generated and used to perform the transaction.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Prior to the time of the transaction, the customer provides the account to be used to obtain payments therefrom and the payment plan is established and agreed upon by the customer. In one embodiment, the BNPL will make an initial payment charge to the customer's credit account (or other customer accounts as discussed above) at the time of the transaction, and then the rest of the payments for the purchase will be automatically charged as installment payments from the credit account provided and based on the customer accepted terms in the BNPL agreement.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the following discussion, a mobile device (or mobile phone) refers to a computing device that has ingrained telephony capability via a mobile carrier.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In contrast, a non-phone mobile device refers to any computing device such as a laptop, desktop, notebook, or the like that does not have ingrained telephony capability via the mobile carrier. Thus, a mobile device that utilizes only the Internet, Wi-Fi, or the like to make phone calls would be an example of a non-phone mobile device.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In general, a BNPL application obtains identification information about a customer and uses the identification information to make a BNPL determination. For example, if a customer wants to obtain BNPL financing, the customer would have to provide identifying information for the customer, the customer's mobile device, or a combination thereof. The identifying information is used to identify a customer's existing credit account and, in one embodiment, perform a credit check of the customer's credit history and qualifications based on the BNPL issuer's criteria.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It should be appreciated that the obtaining or accessing of customer information conforms to applicable privacy laws (e.g., federal privacy laws, state privacy laws, etc.) and applicable fair credit reporting act laws. In one embodiment, prior to accessing customer information, the customer affirmatively &#x201c;opts-in&#x201d; to the services described herein. Moreover, depending on present or future credit account requirements, rules and regulations, the BNPL application aspects described herein may be more or less formal.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment, if the BNPL application is web-based, it may not be able to access the GPS data on the mobile device. However, in one embodiment, the web-based app is able to use the location information provided by the communication provider (carrier) to obtain location data that is similar to the mobile device GPS data. One way to obtain the information would be to use an API to push the carrier information to the mobile web application.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, the BNPL application is a non-integrated application, e.g., custom code is hosted and managed by credit account provider. In one embodiment, the BNPL application is an integrated application, e.g., it provides a brand the bones of the front end such that the brand can host and modify the front end based on their own individualized criteria, while the back end remains hosted and managed by the BNPL provider. In one embodiment, the application is a hybrid, e.g., the BNPL provider will host and manage the entire product, but they will receive front end input/design/criterion from the brand that will be used by the BNPL provider to customize the front end for the brand.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">Operation</heading><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a top plan view of a store <b>100</b> having a POS <b>104</b> is shown in accordance with an embodiment.

In-store examples of the BNPL offer <b>105</b> could be a poster or other media on a wall in the store <b>100</b>, a tri-fold or other media by the POS <b>104</b>, displayed on a screen in the store, displayed on an associate's tablet or other mobile device in the store, printed on the floor, etched in the glass, part of a sticker, etc. On-line examples include the BNPL offer <b>105</b> displayed on a webpage, in an app, and the like.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In one embodiment, the interaction between the customer's mobile device and the BNPL offer <b>105</b> feature is initiated by the customer's mobile device interacting with the BNPL offer <b>105</b>. For example, in one embodiment, BNPL offer <b>105</b> is scanned by the customer <b>101</b> with the customer's mobile device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one embodiment, BNPL offer <b>105</b> is provided via a beacon such as one or more of beacons <b>103</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>103</b>-<i>n</i>. In general, the one or more of beacons <b>103</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>103</b>-<i>n </i>are devices that are configured to be communicatively coupled with customer's mobile device <b>110</b>, such as via NFC, Bluetooth, WiFi, or the like. In one embodiment, one or more of beacons <b>103</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>103</b>-<i>n </i>is an iBeacon&#x2122;, which is an indoor positioning system from Apple Inc. For example, the iBeacon is a low-powered, low-cost transmitter that can notify nearby iOS and/or Android devices of their presence. Although an iBeacon is provided as a specific example, the beacons are not limited to only that brand. Different beacons from other companies would also be acceptable.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one embodiment, the result of the customer's mobile device <b>110</b> interacting with the BNPL offer <b>105</b> is the generation of an electronic message (e.g., a text message, email, etc.) that is formatted and addressed (e.g., a text number or other short code) to deliver the electronic message to the appropriate agency. By having the BNPL offer <b>105</b> interaction cause the customer's mobile device <b>110</b> to automatically generate and format the electronic message, the customer is saved the time required to open and address the electronic message. Moreover, the insertion of clerical errors will be reduced/removed since the customer is not keying in the formatted information (e.g., appropriate agency email, short code, text number, or the like).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment, since the electronic message is formatted from instructions provided during the customer's mobile device <b>110</b> interaction with the BNPL offer <b>105</b>, the initial generated electronic message will include whatever information was predefined to be obtained by the BNPL offer <b>105</b> as deployed by the appropriate agency. Such information could include a request for customer ID information, a request for device ID information, a generation of metadata associated with the electronic message that includes device ID information, location information, customer ID information, etc. In one embodiment, the automatic generation of the electronic message from the interaction with the BNPL offer <b>105</b> could include automatic insertion of one or more pieces of customer or device information, a request for authorization to send an email with the automatically inserted information, a request for manual input of one or more of the pieces of information, a combination of automatic and manually input information, or the like.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one embodiment, BNPL offer <b>105</b> is provided by an application on the customer's mobile device <b>110</b> after the customer's mobile device <b>110</b> is determined to be in store <b>100</b>, within range of beacon <b>103</b>-<b>1</b> and/or <b>103</b>-<i>n</i>. In yet another embodiment, the BNPL offer <b>105</b> is provided on the customer's mobile device <b>110</b> when a location capability of the customer's mobile device <b>110</b> determines that the customer <b>101</b> is located near store <b>100</b>. In general, near store <b>100</b> refers to a location such as, within the bounds of the store, within a few yards of the store, within the mall in which store <b>100</b> is located, within a beacon or WiFi broadcast range of store <b>100</b>, or within a block of store <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">For purposes of the present discussion, the mobile device location service, can be, but is not limited to, GPS, WiFi, cellular service, beacon derived location determination and the like. Moreover, the location determined by the mobile device location service may be useful even at differing levels of accuracy. For example, a GPS enabled mobile device <b>110</b> can provide location information that is accurate to within a few meters while a cellular service, beacon or WiFi location capabilities of mobile device <b>110</b> can provide a location radius or location area. For example, the mobile device <b>110</b> being located within range of a beacon, within the overlapping area of a number of cellular service towers, etc.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one embodiment, the location of the mobile device can be determined via geo-fence, beacon range, a ping, NFC, WiFi, or the like. Moreover, the location may be an actual location or a relative location.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">For example, actual location information may be obtained by the customer's mobile device location services, such as but not limited to, GPS, WiFi, cellular service, beacon derived location determination, and the like. Moreover, the location determination can be useful even at differing levels of accuracy. For example, a GPS enabled mobile device would provide location information that is accurate to within a few meters and would be lat long coordinates (or similar).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">In contrast, relative location information is location information determined via a broadcasting or receiving station (e.g., cellular service, beacon, WiFi access point, hotspot, or the like). The relative location would be the location of the station and a broadcast radius (or area) of coverage for the station. Moreover, if the device is picked up by two or more different stations, then the location could be further refined as being within the overlapping broadcast radii of the number of different stations. For example, although the actual location of the mobile device may not be known, if the mobile device is interacting with a beacon <b>103</b>-<i>n</i>, then the relative location of the mobile device would have to be in range of beacon <b>103</b>-<i>n </i>broadcast radius. Similarly, a geo-fence could be used to determine that the location of the mobile device is within the defined geo-fenced area, although the actual location of the mobile device within the geofenced area may not be known.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one embodiment, mobile device <b>110</b> will use a positioning determining system such as global positioning system (GPS) or the like to determine location information. In another embodiment, the mobile device may be able to determine a location within a given radius, such as the broadcast range of a beacon, WiFi hotspot, overlapped area covered by a plurality of mobile telephone signal providers, or some combination thereof.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">BNPL application is accessed at a web site, from an in-store application, by scanning a visual code such as a barcode, a QR code on a physical item such as a poster, or the like. In another embodiment, the BNPL offer <b>105</b> is received by a beacon broadcast, WiFi broadcast, email, or the like. In one embodiment, BNPL application obtains authorization from mobile device <b>110</b> to access location information on the mobile device <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Location information refers to the location of the mobile device <b>110</b> at different times of the day as generated by a positioning system on the mobile device <b>110</b>, by location information on the customer's home computer system or the like. Because of the different positioning systems available on a mobile device and/or a non-phone mobile device, the location information can include differing levels of accuracy. For example, a GPS enabled mobile device <b>110</b> can provide location information that is accurate to within a few meters or less. In contrast, location information derived from cellular service, beacon, WiFi location capabilities, and the like can provide a location radius or location area that may be within 10-50 meters or even larger.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one embodiment, a location information evaluator uses location information to determine an actual address. For example, in one embodiment, the location information provided by mobile device <b>110</b> are provided as coordinates data. In order to determine an address, location information evaluator cross-references the coordinate data with one or more different coordinate-to-address determination sources such as: mapping software, surveyor data that includes business and/or residential information, County assessor's information, or other coordinate-to-address determiners. Further operation of location information evaluator is shown and described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a block diagram of a customer identification system <b>200</b> is shown in accordance with an embodiment. In one embodiment, customer identification system <b>200</b> includes a BNPL offer <b>105</b>, mobile device <b>110</b>, a user specific information engine <b>220</b>, and a BNPL product provider <b>230</b>. Although a number of applications and components are shown in customer identification system <b>200</b>, it should be appreciated that the components and applications may be located separately from one another. For example, one or more of the components and applications may be found on one or more locations, such as, but not limited to, a computer in the store <b>100</b>, a server at a remote location, on the cloud <b>226</b> or the like.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">In general, BNPL offer <b>105</b> is an offer for a BNPL product intended to be used for a single purchase. In one embodiment, BNPL offer <b>105</b> may include an incentive such as a discount percentage, a free gift, a coupon, a surprise gift, a surprise reward, or the like. As stated herein, BNPL offer <b>105</b> may be located on a physical item or received by the customer's mobile device, e.g., via a beacon broadcast, WiFi broadcast, email, text, SMS, social media alert, app alert, or the like. In yet another embodiment, BNPL offer <b>105</b> may be provided by an app on the customer's mobile device once the mobile device is within a certain vicinity of the store.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">A number of different options may be available to respond to the BNPL offer <b>105</b>. For example, the response may be in the form of a message interaction, as shown and described in further detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A through <b>6</b>F</figref>. In one embodiment, the response to the BNPL offer <b>105</b> requires the customer to provide a device ID <b>216</b> and a user ID <b>218</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In general, device ID <b>216</b> can be different depending upon the device. For example, a mobile device ID: includes identification characteristics such as, a mobile device telephone number or mobile device ID such as the mobile device's serial number, international mobile equipment identity (IMEI), integrated circuit card identifier (ICCID) (e.g., the SIM card number), mobile equipment identifier (MEID), secure element chipset identify (SEID), a media access control (MAC) address, Internet protocol (IP) address, universal unique identifier (UUID), model number, product number, serial number, or the like.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one embodiment, device ID <b>216</b> that is requested for the process is based upon an evaluation of which of the possible device IDs would provide the best capability for fraud prevention. For example, a customer's mobile number could be easily obtained (e.g., via social media, public records, white pages, Internet search, etc.) so it would be a lower device ID option on a fraud scale. In contrast, the customer's mobile device serial number, IMEI, ICCID, MEID, SEID, or the like is much less likely to be obtained fraudulently (via social media, public records, guessed, etc.) so it may be that one of the IMEI, ICCID, MEID, SEID, or the like would be the device ID with the highest fraud prevention value.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">User ID <b>218</b> can be the customer's identification information such as, name, zip code, social security number or portion thereof, driver's license number or portion thereof, or the like that is used to identify a specific customer.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one embodiment, the user ID <b>218</b> that is requested for the process is based upon an evaluation of which of the possible user IDs would provide the best capability for fraud prevention. For example, a customer's birthday could be easily obtained (e.g., via social media, public records, etc.) so it would be a lower user ID option on a fraud scale. Similarly, a customer's address could be easily obtained (e.g., via social media, public records, etc.) so it would also be a lower user ID option on a fraud scale. Further, a customer's email could be easily obtained (e.g., via social media, public records, etc.) or easily guessed, so it would also be a lower user ID option on a fraud scale. In contrast, a social security number (or last four, six, seven, five, middle three, five, first 6, 7; middle three+last two; or any other amount or combination of the nine social security numbers) is much less likely to be obtained fraudulently (e.g., via social media, public records, guessed, etc.) so it may be that a pre-selected portion of the SSN (or a changing selected portion of the SSN) would be the user ID with the highest fraud prevention value.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Thus, a customer's response to BNPL offer <b>105</b> will include enough information for the customer identification system <b>200</b> to identify the customer <b>101</b> for purposes of providing the customer with a BNPL application.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In one embodiment, user specific information engine <b>220</b> will receive a message from a customer's mobile device <b>110</b> in response to the BNPL offer <b>105</b>. The message will include device ID <b>216</b> and user ID <b>218</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one embodiment, user specific information engine <b>220</b> will use device ID <b>216</b> and user ID <b>218</b> to obtain user specific information <b>223</b> to prepopulate an electronic form such as a BNPL application. In general, user specific information <b>223</b> could be at least two of: a name and full or partial address, a driver's license number, a social security number, or the like.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">In one embodiment, user specific information engine <b>220</b> may access the different search locations via the cloud <b>226</b>. An example of cloud <b>226</b> is a network such as the Internet, local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), or the like.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">One embodiment uses the device ID <b>216</b> and user ID <b>218</b> information to perform a proprietary search <b>5</b> of at least one proprietary database <b>16</b>. In general, the proprietary database <b>16</b> may be one or more databases such as a credit accounts database, or the like, that store a company's private database such as an Alliance Data Legacy database or the like. Proprietary database <b>16</b> will include user specific information <b>223</b> for customers that have existing accounts with the company, have previously applied for an account, or the like.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one embodiment, the proprietary search <b>5</b> will only search a database related to a specific company. For example, if the BNPL product provider <b>230</b> is a specific company, e.g., Nash's skate and bike emporium, then in a company specific database search, only the existing customer information related to Nash's skate and bike emporium will be searched. For example, a check is performed to see if the customer has an existing PLCC account, e.g., is already an existing customer in the database.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079">However, if the proprietary search <b>5</b> is for a group of companies, a shared information database, or the like, then all of the customer information in the databases may be searched for a match with the device ID <b>216</b> or the user ID <b>218</b>. For example, if the database includes Nash's skate and bike, Mike's hardware, and Tarrin's dress stores, and all three companies are sharing information, then the search would encompass all three store's databases of information.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">For example, the search would use an internal account holder proprietary database <b>16</b> to see if the customer has another account within the shared information database. If the customer does not have a Nash's skate and bike account, the underlying credit account management, e.g., Alliance Data database, is searched to see if the customer has an account at a different brand associated with Alliance Data. In one embodiment, the customer's existing account could be a co-brand credit account, a PLCC account, a UPLCC account, an installment loan, another BNPL product, or the like.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">In one embodiment, customer information <b>6</b> that is found in the proprietary database <b>16</b> will be verified using a confidence factor <b>7</b>. For example, if only one record is found and it is 5 days old, the confidence in the found records would likely be below the confidence factor threshold. In contrast, if 2 years of records are found, such as prior accounts, present accounts, memberships, rewards information, and the like, then the confidence in the user specific information <b>223</b> found in the records would be above the confidence factor threshold. If the user specific information <b>223</b> is above the confidence factor threshold, then the user specific information <b>223</b> is deemed valid. At that point, the user specific information <b>223</b> is returned via return information <b>12</b> to user specific information engine <b>220</b> and then passed on to BNPL product provider <b>230</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">One embodiment incorporates one or more of several fraud mitigation business rules to attempt to prevent fraudulent activity; e.g., to validate the found records. These business rules include logic that looks at specific activity on a customer's account that point to potentially fraudulent activities. In addition, a fraud mitigation tool may be implemented. The fraud mitigation tool will use device and internet protocol (IP) information to predict if the BNPL application can be trusted or will eventually become fraudulent.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">For example, in one embodiment, the fraud mitigation tool will ignore any credit accounts that meet situations such as, but not limited to, the following: It is associated within a brand(s) that have been determined to have a high propensity for fraud. It is currently in a derogatory status. The account was opened within a defined number of days, where the number of days is controlled by internal parameters and can be tightened, loosened or turned off. The phone number matched has been changed within a defined number of days, where the number of days is controlled by internal parameters and can be tightened, loosened or turned off. An authorized buyer has been added to the account within a defined number of days, where the number of days is controlled by internal parameters and can be tightened, loosened or turned off. The address has been changed within a defined number of days, where the number of days is controlled by internal parameters and can be tightened, loosened or turned off. The account has been inactive within a defined number of months, where the number of months is controlled by internal parameters and can be tightened, loosened or turned off. Multiple accounts are found for the mobile device number, zip code and last 4 digits of the SSN but all accounts are not the same person, and the like.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">If no user specific information <b>223</b> is found during the proprietary search <b>5</b> or if the found user specific information <b>223</b> cannot be validated, then the device ID <b>216</b> and user ID <b>218</b> are passed on to a secondary search <b>25</b>. At secondary search <b>25</b>, a second source search engine <b>28</b> will search at least one secondary source database <b>26</b>. One example of secondary source database <b>26</b> is a reverse phone number look up. However, other secondary source databases may be searched such as, but not limited to: social media sites, search engines, online public and/or private records, reverse name and phone number engines, and the like. In one embodiment, the user specific information <b>223</b> may be obtained by performing a secondary source database <b>26</b> search with the user ID <b>218</b> and the device ID <b>216</b>.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In one embodiment, the secondary search <b>25</b> may be for example, a real-time call to a reverse phone look-up product to try and locate the customer. In general, reverse phone look-up products provide accurate and current customer telephone information. In many cases, the data is updated regularly from a broad range of sources, including regional bell operating companies, white pages and proprietary sources. One embodiment also integrates validation and authentication aspects that add further benefits to append address information for a customer. In general, validation and authentication aspects match customer name and zip code information that was returned from the reverse phone look-up, against data from a secondary source to return full address data.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">If the customer is found <b>36</b>, then the user specific information <b>223</b> is returned via return information <b>12</b> to user specific information engine <b>220</b>.

As stated herein, device ID <b>216</b> can be different depending upon the device. In one embodiment, device ID <b>216</b> that is requested for the process is based upon an evaluation of which of the possible device IDs would provide the best capability for fraud prevention. For example, a customer's mobile number could be easily obtained (e.g., via social media, public records, white pages, Internet search, etc.) so it would be a lower device ID option on a fraud scale. In contrast, the customer's mobile device serial number, MEI, ICCID, MEID, SEID, or the like is much less likely to be obtained fraudulently (via social media, public records, guessed, etc.) so it may be that one of the IMEI, ICCID, MEID, SEID, or the like would be the device ID with the highest fraud prevention value</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">With reference now to <b>515</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, one embodiment receives a user identifier for the customer.

In one embodiment, the user ID <b>218</b> that is requested on the page displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> is based upon an evaluation of which of the possible user IDs would provide the best capability for fraud prevention. For example, a customer's birthday could be easily obtained (e.g., via social media, public records, etc.) so it would be a lower user ID option on a fraud scale. Similarly, a customer's address could be easily obtained (e.g., via social media, public records, etc.) so it would also be a lower user ID option on a fraud scale. Further, a customer's email could be easily obtained (e.g., via social media, public records, etc.) or easily guessed, so it would also be a lower user ID option on a fraud scale. In contrast, a social security number (or last four, six, seven, five, middle three, five, first 6, 7; middle three+last two; or any other amount or combination of the nine social security numbers) is much less likely to be obtained fraudulently (e.g., via social media, public records, guessed, etc.) so it may be that a pre-selected portion of the SSN (or a changing selected portion of the SSN) would be the user ID with the highest fraud prevention value.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the result of the customer's mobile device <b>110</b> interacting with the BNPL offer <b>105</b> is the generation of an electronic message (e.g., a text message, email, etc.) that is formatted and addressed (e.g., a text number or other short code) to deliver the electronic message to BNPL product provider <b>230</b>. By having the interaction between the BNPL offer <b>105</b> and the customer's mobile device causing the customer's mobile device <b>110</b> to automatically generate and format the electronic message, the customer is saved the time required to open and address the electronic message.

Thus, instead of having to type in the information, the customer would simply verify that the information is correct and make any changes accordingly. Similarly, if some of the information was missing, the customer would be able to fill in only the missing portions without having to complete the entire form. Thus, the customer would see a significant reduction in the number of keystrokes for the pre-filled forms which would increase throughput, and decrease frustration and the time needed to fill out the forms.</p><p id="p-0123" num="0122">In one embodiment, the customer identifies the account, e.g., customer's credit account information <b>611</b>, to be used to obtain payments therefrom for the BNPL product. In one embodiment, when the customer has a number of existing accounts (such as a co-brand credit account, a PLCC account, a UPLCC account, an installment loan, or the like), the customer will have the option to select/elect which account will be used. In one embodiment, when the customer has a number of existing accounts (such as a co-brand credit account, a PLCC account, a UPLCC account, an installment loan, or the like), the BNPL producer <b>360</b> will automatically select/elect which account will be used.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123">In the case of the plurality of existing customer accounts, once the customer account is identified, the customer's credit account information <b>611</b> to be used to obtain payments therefrom will come from the customer identified account.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">In one embodiment, BNPL product information including payment option terms and/or conditions <b>612</b> describes the payment plan that is established and agreed upon by the customer. In one embodiment, the BNPL product information including payment option terms and/or conditions <b>612</b> will take an initial payment at the time of the transaction, and then the rest of the payments for the purchase are automatically taken out as installment payments from the initial account provided based on the customer accepted terms in the BNPL agreement.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">In one embodiment, included in BNPL product information including payment option terms and/or conditions <b>612</b> is an autopayment scenario. In one embodiment, the autopayment will be prefilled by the system using the customer's credit account information <b>611</b>. For example, the offer would be to obtain the BNPL product and make the payments automatically from the customer's credit account. If the customer does not want to set up the autopay, then in one embodiment, the BNPL application process is stopped and no BNPL product is obtained.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">In one embodiment, the autopayment scenario is not a requirement. This could be based on a customer's credit score, risk factors, or the like. For example, if the customer has a credit score that is higher than a pre-defined threshold, the autopayment is not a requirement, such that if the customer chooses not to join an autopayment process, the ability to continue the BNPL application process is not interrupted.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">In one embodiment, if the customer has a credit score that is higher than a pre-defined threshold, the autopayment scenario could include an opportunity for a discount or reward if the customer selects the autopayment scenario. For example, the customer could receive an extended no interest grace period, a reduction of any associated fees, a reduced interest rate, or the like.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">For example, a customer wants to purchase a watch for 400 dollars. At the time of checkout, the customer will select the BNPL product for payment. In one embodiment, the BNPL product will allow them to pay a percentage now and then have the remaining payments withdrawn from (or charged to) their account at the predefined and agreed upon payment schedule.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">In one embodiment, the due at transaction time percentage can be a specific amount, e.g., 25% for example, or it could be based on the purchase price and the total number of monthly payments. For example, if the transaction is 500 dollars, the customer could choose a BNPL product with 5 equal payments such that the first payment due at time of purchase is 100 dollars and then there will be four additional payments taken out at the agreed upon payment schedule.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">In one embodiment, the payment schedule can be a monthly schedule, weekly schedule, bi-weekly schedule, etc. For example, if the customer is paid every two weeks, the customer may choose a BNPL product with a payment schedule that includes a payment every two weeks after the date of their paycheck being received. In another embodiment, regardless of when the customer is paid, the customer may choose a payment schedule that includes a payment once a month.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">In one embodiment, the BNPL product includes a number of options such as payment amount per payment and the payment timeframe. For example, if the customer is looking at making a 500-dollar transaction, they could be offered a BNPL1 that is 5 monthly payments of 100 dollars, BNPL2 that is 10 monthly payments of 50 dollars, BNPLX that is 50% due at transaction and then some number of weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly payments to cover the remaining 250 dollars.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In one embodiment, one or more different BNPL product options are presented to the customer as one or more payment scenarios. In other words, the BNPL product can be offered to the customer with a number of different payment scenarios such that the customer can select the payment amount and schedule, and use the BNPL product with the appropriate terms to complete the transaction. E.g., one or more optional payback schedules including amounts, number of payments, different interest rates, available offers, discounts, and the like.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">In one embodiment, the BNPL product could include an incentive that will cause the customer to use the BNPL product instead of using an existing credit account or installment loan option. In one embodiment, the incentive could be a discounted interest rate, a coupon, an offer for a service, etc.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In one embodiment, the BNPL product is offered prior to the customer reaching the checkout. In so doing, when receiving the BNPL product, the customer may be inclined to spend (e.g., fill a cart with one or a number of products) an amount that is up to the BNPL offered amount. As such, the customer would be comfortable to take the product (or products) to checkout in person or on-line, knowing that they had been provided with a BNPL product that would cover the purchase amount they have in their cart.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In one embodiment, as stated herein, the different transaction payment scenarios may include different offers dependent upon the customer's credit history. For example, a customer with a good credit history could be offered a BNPL product that has a no interest plan. Similarly, depending upon the goals of the BNPL product provider <b>230</b>, the BNPL product provider <b>230</b> may decide to weigh the BNPL product with respect to the existing customer credit account in order to drive one or more different customers toward the BNPL product. In one embodiment, the weighing may be based upon a customer's credit history, a brand or retailer's desires, available incentives, and the like.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">In one embodiment, if the customer previously had a BNPL product, the customer may provide or identify one or more existing co-branded credit account, PLCC credit account, installment loan, etc.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0137">In one embodiment, once the customer <b>101</b> identifies their account (or selects the specific account from the plurality of accounts they want to use to back the BNPL), in one embodiment, they will also have access to one or more previously used BNPL products. From this, the customer <b>101</b> can decide if they would want to pay for the transaction with the existing co-branded and/or PLCC credit account or apply for/utilize another BNPL product. In one embodiment, if the customer chooses to use another BNPL product, in one embodiment, they will continue through the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>C-<b>6</b>E</figref> to obtain a new BNPL product for making a new transaction.</p><p id="p-0139" num="0138">Once the customer has verified the information on the BNPL application, the customer will select the apply or place order <b>615</b> input to provide the BNPL application to BNPL product provider <b>230</b>. In one embodiment, apply or place order <b>615</b> input includes a signature (or electronic signature) portion.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0139">In one embodiment, after the customer selects the apply or place order <b>615</b> input to provide the BNPL application to BNPL product provider <b>230</b>, a verification is sent. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>, a screen capture <b>620</b> of the BNPL application requesting a verification code <b>621</b> as viewed on a customer's mobile device <b>110</b> is shown in accordance with an embodiment.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0140">In one embodiment, BNPL product information including payment option terms and/or conditions <b>612</b> will include an optional opportunity for the customer to change the terms and conditions, interest rate, any grace period information, the breakdown of payments, and the like.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0141">If the customer chooses to review the opportunities offered by the optional changes to the BNPL product information including payment option terms and/or conditions <b>612</b>, the customer will move to the modify one or more aspects thereof. For example, the customer will be able to review offers, additional fees, additional opportunities, and the like available by selecting a non-default monthly payment amount (or length of the BNPL product payback schedule).</p><p id="p-0143" num="0142">For example, the customer could receive a discount for a reduced BNPL product term. That is, the customer has the opportunity to pay off the BNPL product within a time period that is shorter than the default time period. For example, if the customer pays off the BNPL product in 2 months, there would be no interest charged and the BNPL product fee would be reduced to 5 dollars. If that opportunity is accepted, the amount of the BNPL product would be 505 dollars (e.g., 500 dollars+5-dollar fee) broken down over 2 months thereby resulting in a monthly payment of 252.50 per month for the next 2 months.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0143">If the customer accepts the reduced term and conditions and any additional terms and conditions that are included therewith, then the customer will select the apply or place order <b>615</b> input. In one embodiment, instead of obtaining a discount by reducing the BNPL product term, the customer could select to modify the payment options by extending the BNPL product term and obtain a reduced monthly payment amount. In one embodiment, extending the BNPL product term will also result in a larger cost than the cost included in the BNPL product information, including payment option terms and/or conditions <b>612</b>.</p><p id="p-0145" num="0144">In one embodiment, a reduced monthly payment amount, will provide a limit as to the longest allowable term, have a predefined minimum monthly payment amount, or the like. In one embodiment, the reduced monthly payment amount could provide a BNPL product term range, a minimum monthly payment range, or the like. In one embodiment, when the customer looks at the different options, the appropriate BNPL product fee will be incorporated into the BNPL product information including payment option terms and/or conditions <b>612</b>.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0145">For example, if the customer would like to make monthly payments of 50 dollars toward the BNPL product, the customer would select the 50-dollar payment option and the modified BNPL product information including payment option terms and/or conditions <b>612</b> would be presented to the customer. In one embodiment, when the customer chooses to pay 50 dollars a month toward the BNPL product, the BNPL product fee would be increased by a defined amount and presented to the customer along with the terms and conditions. For example, the amount of the one-time BNPL product would be 520 dollars (e.g., 500 dollars+10-dollar fee+10 dollars in interest). Since the customer has selected to pay 50 dollars a month, the customer's BNPL product term would be 11 months, with 10 months of 50-dollar payments and the 11th month being a 20-dollar payment.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0146">If the customer accepts the modified BNPL product information including payment option terms and/or conditions <b>612</b>, then the customer will select the apply or place order <b>615</b> input.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0147">Similarly, if the customer would like to make 10 monthly payments on the BNPL product, the customer would select the 10 month payment option and the modified BNPL product information including payment option terms and/or conditions <b>612</b> will be presented to the customer. In one embodiment, when the customer chooses to pay back the BNPL product over a selected number of month that are longer than the default number of months, the BNPL product fee would be increased by a defined amount and presented to the customer along with the terms and conditions. For example, the amount of the one-time BNPL product would be 520 dollars (e.g., 500 dollars+10-dollar fee+10 dollars in interest). Since the customer has selected a BNPL product term of 10 months, the monthly payment would be 52 dollars per month.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0148">If the customer accepts the modified BNPL product information including payment option terms and/or conditions <b>612</b>, then the customer will select the apply or place order <b>615</b> input.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0149">With reference now to <b>530</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, once the customer passes the credit screening, one embodiment provides the BNPL product pass <b>170</b> to the customer.

In general, system <b>800</b> includes a fraud determination module <b>805</b> which receives address information from the location information evaluator <b>804</b> which determines the address from the raw location information <b>803</b> provided by mobile device <b>110</b>. System <b>800</b> also includes cloud <b>226</b> which may be any type of wired or wireless network connection including private, public, Local, Wide, Internet, and the like.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0188">In one embodiment, fraud determination module <b>805</b> is a rules-based fraud determination engine that can change the weighting of risk factors, etc. For example, the BNPL application accessed from a non-phone computing device provides a first authentication (e.g., a non-phone computing device ID) and a user ID. The inclusion of a phone number in the BNPL application process allows for a second factor authentication (e.g., a mobile device ID). However, if the information provided in the BNPL application (e.g., the name, address, phone number, email, etc.) does not match, the fraud determination module can provide that a first weight. In another example, if the non-phone computing device is at a first location, and the second factor authentication (e.g., the mobile device) is in a different location (or a certain distance away from) the non-phone computing device, fraud determination module <b>805</b> can provide that a second weight that is different than the first weight.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0189">In one embodiment, the user ID and/or the device ID information that is obtained can be used to evaluate for fraud. For example, the user ID that is provided to the application process is ranked or evaluated for its fraud potential. For example, 1 is the lowest fraud risk and 10 is the highest. If the customer's zip code is provided it may be ranked at a 7 out of 10 for fraud. In contrast, if the last 6 of the customer's SSN is provided it may be ranked at a 2 out of 10 for fraud.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0190">Similarly, the device ID that is provided to the BNPL application process is ranked or evaluated for its fraud potential. For example, 1 is the lowest fraud risk and 10 is the highest. If the mobile number is provided, it may be ranked at a 5 out of 10 for fraud. In contrast, if the non-phone computing device UUID is provided, it may be ranked at a 2 out of 10 for fraud.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0191">The fraud risk is then evaluated. The evaluation could be for one of the identifiers, both of the identifiers, or a combination of the identifiers. For example, in one embodiment when the fraud scale base is 10, the single identifier fraud risk would be evaluated as low if it is a 3 or below, medium if it is between 4-5, high if it is between 6-8, and unacceptable if it is 9 or above.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0192">If both of the fraud rankings are added together the scale could remain the same or could be different. For example, the scale could remain the same, be doubled, have the range changed such that 15 (or whatever value is selected) is the new top range, etc. For example, the fraud risk for the combined value (using a top range of 15) would be evaluated as low if it is a 4 or below, medium if it is between 5-8, high if it is between 9-11, and unacceptable if it is 12 or above.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0193">In another embodiment, the scale could be out of any number, e.g., 20, 50, 100, etc. depending upon the desired granularity.

In one embodiment, the location information <b>803</b> generated by a positioning system tracking such as GPS <b>118</b> on the mobile device <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, the positioning system is on the mobile device, and is one or more of, but is not limited to, GPS, WiFi, cellular service, beacon derived location determination, NFC ranges, Bluetooth range, and the like. In another embodiment, the positioning system is virtual, which means that the positioning system is not on the mobile device <b>110</b> but is an interface, such as a GPS chip interface, that functions with software or web applications allowing the location functionality to work outside of a traditionally defined mobile device <b>110</b> or BNPL application.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0234">Because of the different positioning systems available on a mobile device, the location information <b>803</b> provided by one or more positioning systems on the mobile device <b>110</b> can include differing levels of accuracy. For example, a GPS enabled mobile device <b>110</b> can provide location information <b>803</b> that is accurate to within a few meters or less. In contrast, location information <b>803</b> derived from cellular service, beacon or WiFi location capabilities of mobile device <b>110</b> can provide a location radius or location area that may be within 10-50 meters or even larger. For example, the mobile device <b>110</b> being located within range of a beacon at ninth street, a Wi-Fi hot-spot at a given coffee shop, within range or a single cellular service tower, within an overlapping area of a number of cellular service towers, a combination of the above, and the like.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0235">In one embodiment, included with the location information <b>803</b> would be a level of accuracy. For example, location information <b>803</b> may be identified as having a high level of accuracy (0-5 meters), a medium level of accuracy (6-20 meters), a low level of accuracy (&#x3e;20 meters), or the like. Although a number of different accuracies are discussed, it should be appreciated that there may be more or fewer levels of accuracy associated with location information <b>803</b>. Further, the ranges of the different levels of accuracy disclosed may also be different based on preference, guidelines, needs, and the like.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0236">Additionally, location information <b>803</b> may be determined by the positioning system at constant intervals, at pre-assigned time periods, when location determination commands are received, based on the use of the mobile device <b>110</b>, an application on the mobile device <b>110</b>, when a change is noted by the positioning system, and the like. Further, location information <b>803</b> may be recorded in the memory of the mobile device every time a location determination is made by the positioning system, at constant intervals, at pre-assigned time periods, when location storage commands are received, when a change is noted in the location information <b>803</b>, and the like. Likewise, the level of accuracy may be determined each time location information <b>803</b> is generated by the positioning system, only when the level of accuracy has changed, at certain intervals of location information <b>803</b> generation, or the like.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0237">At <b>853</b>, location information <b>803</b> includes historic location information stored in a memory of the mobile device. Historic location information refers to location information <b>803</b> that is not real-time location information. Historic location information will include a date/time stamp. The historic location information would allow the stored location information to be searched, sorted, and evaluated. In one embodiment, the historic location information includes all location information <b>803</b> stored on the memory of the mobile device <b>110</b>. Historic location information may cover the entire period the customer has owned the mobile device. In another embodiment, the time range for the historic location information is limited. For example, the location data may only be obtained for a pre-defined time range, e.g., the past 2 years, 1 year, 6 months, 3 months, 3 weeks, 5 days, etc. Although a number of time ranges are provided, it should be understood that the time range may be customer definable, application pre-defined, established by the credit provider, established by law or statute, state or country dependent, or the like.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0238">At <b>854</b>, location information <b>803</b> includes real-time location information obtained from the positioning system. Real-time location information would be location information <b>803</b> that is generated in real time by the positioning system. The real-time location information would be constantly replaced as location information <b>803</b> generated by the positioning system received at the computer system, e.g., location information evaluator <b>804</b>.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0239">In one embodiment, location information <b>803</b> provided by mobile device <b>110</b> is coordinate data. Therefore, to determine an address, the coordinate data is cross-referenced with one or more different coordinate-to-address determination sources such as: mapping software, surveyor data that includes business and/or residential information, County assessor's information, or other coordinate-to-address determiners.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0240">Included with location information <b>803</b> would be the level of accuracy of the location information. As such, when the location information coordinate data is cross-referenced with the one or more different coordinate-to-address determination sources, the resulting address may be specific or may be a general ballpark area.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0241">The high level of accuracy indication about the coordinate data would likely allow a specific address to be determined when location information <b>803</b> is cross-referenced with the one or more different coordinate-to-address determination sources.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0242">The medium level of accuracy indication about the coordinate data may allow a specific address to be determined when location information <b>803</b> is cross-referenced with the one or more different coordinate-to-address determination sources, or may result in a general address area. The determination would be based on the actual level of accuracy, the density of businesses and residences within the radius of the location information, and the like. For example, in an area with houses on acre plots, the medium level of accuracy would indicate a specific house. However, in an area with clusters of businesses, such as a strip mall, the medium level of accuracy may only be able to narrow the business address to one of a few different possibilities.</p><p id="p-0244" num="0243">Except for the most rural cases or the largest company buildings, the low level of accuracy indication about the coordinate data would not allow a specific address to be determined when location information <b>803</b> is cross-referenced with the one or more different coordinate-to-address determination sources. However, even at the low level of accuracy, the number of possible street names for a home or business address would be reduced.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0244">In one embodiment, the customer's likely home location is determined from location information <b>803</b> provided by mobile device <b>110</b>. The computer system, e.g., location information evaluator <b>804</b>, would evaluate the historical location information received from the device for a plurality of prior overnight time periods over a plurality of different nights. For example, location information <b>803</b> can be organized into time periods, e.g., midnight to 5 am and then reviewed for a prior time period, e.g., weeks, months, etc.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0245">The likely home location is then determined based on the historical location information evaluation. For example, by sorting and then tallying the locations of mobile device <b>110</b> during the selected time period (e.g., the past 45 days), it is likely that the location that is found most often is where the customer resides at night. Thus, it is likely the customer's home location.</p><p id="p-0247" num="0246">The customer's likely home location, and the associated accuracy value of location information <b>803</b>, is then cross-referenced with the one or more different coordinate-to-address determination sources to generate an address. If the accuracy of the likely home location is high enough, a complete address for the customer's likely home is obtained. The complete address is then prefilled into the home address portion of BNPL application.</p><p id="p-0248" num="0247">However, if the accuracy of the likely home location is not high enough to obtain a specific address, at least some level of information about the likely home location is obtained and provided to BNPL application. For example, a prefill capability for the BNPL application can be simplified, or a drop-down menu populated, by knowing what is local to the likely home location. As such, when the customer is filling out the street address, the likely home location information is used to limit the number of possible streets that are offered in a drop-down menu, a quick fill such as a type completion algorithm, or the like.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0248">For example, if the customer starts typing with the letter &#x2018;M&#x2019;, the limited number of possible streets within the likely home location area will cause BNPL application to offer only those M street names. In this example, Maple, Moore, and Murray. After the customer types &#x2018;M&#x2019;, the application will present the customer with the prefill options of Maple, Moore, and Murray, from which the customer can select. Alternatively, if the customer continues by typing a &#x2018;u&#x2019;, the prefill will complete Murray as it is the only street within the likely home location containing those starting letters. Similarly, in the drop-down menu context, every street name within the likely home location would be provided in the drop-down menu and the customer would select the correct street name from the drop-down menu.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0249">Likewise, the customer's likely work address is determined from location information <b>803</b> provided by mobile device <b>110</b>. The computer system, e.g., location information evaluator <b>804</b>, would evaluate the historical location information received from the device for a plurality of prior daytime periods over a plurality of different days. For example, the location information <b>803</b> can be organized into time periods, e.g., 9 am to 4 pm, and then reviewed for a prior time period, e.g., weeks, months, etc.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0250">A likely work address is then determined based on the historical location information evaluation. For example, by sorting and then tallying the locations where mobile device <b>110</b> was located during the selected time period (e.g., the past 30 days), it is likely that the location that is found most often is where the customer works. Thus, it is likely the location of the customer's work address.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0251">Similar to above, the customer's likely work location, and the associated accuracy value of location information <b>803</b>, is then cross-referenced with the one or more different coordinate-to-address determination sources, to generate an address. If the accuracy of the likely work location is high enough, a complete work address for the customer is likely obtained. The complete work address is then prefilled into the work address portion of BNPL application.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0252">As recited above, if the accuracy of the likely work location is not high enough to obtain a specific address, at least some level of information about the likely work location is obtained and provided to BNPL application. For example, a prefill capability for the BNPL application can be simplified, or a drop-down menu populated, by knowing what is local to the likely work location. As such, when the customer is filling out the street address, the likely work location information is used to limit the number of possible streets that are offered in a drop-down menu, the quick fill type completion algorithm, or the like.</p><p id="p-0254" num="0253">It should be appreciated that information for a number of different locations can be obtained in the same manner as described above. For example, the historical location information could be used, by the computer system, to determine an amount of time that the customer has spent at a store location. The amount could be the total amount of time, the amount of time over the past month, week, or the like. If the amount of time surpasses an established threshold, the BNPL product pass <b>170</b> would receive a recommendation for an initial credit limit increase for the customer.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0254">Thus, the location information can be used to determine one or more of: a full or partial home address, a full or partial work address, a location where the application was completed, locations where the customer spends a lot of time, locations where the customer does not go, and the like.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0255"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref> is a flowchart <b>875</b> of a method for using position location information to verify information provided by customer <b>101</b> on the BNPL application, in accordance with an embodiment. With reference now to <b>880</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>, one embodiment compares, at the computer system, e.g., location information evaluator <b>804</b>, the location information from the positioning system with other location information provided on the BNPL application.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0256">In one embodiment, the other location information provided within the BNPL application is information provided by the customer. Additionally, BNPL application could include other location information obtained from a driver's license scan or search, from a search utilizing the mobile number provided by the mobile device, from the user specific information engine <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> which uses some customer identification and/or device identification information to perform a search for information. One or more of the sources may provide the resultant information into the BNPL application.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0257">Verification</p><p id="p-0259" num="0258">For example, location information <b>803</b> was used by location information evaluator <b>804</b> to determine that the customer's home address is 123 Market Street. The other sources have also provided a home address of 123 Market Street to be prefilled into BNPL application. Since the comparing of the location information <b>803</b> obtained from mobile device <b>110</b> with the information for the BNPL application obtained from another source matches, a verification of the probable home address is made.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0259">In the updating example, location information evaluator <b>804</b> determined that the customer's home address is likely 123 Market Street. However, information obtained from one or more of the other sources have provided a different home address, e.g., 99 Onion Way to be prefilled into BNPL application. Since the comparison of the location information <b>803</b> obtained from mobile device <b>110</b> with the information obtained from another source resulted in a difference between the two possible addresses, the information obtained from the one or more other sources is replaced with the location information <b>803</b> during the prefilling of BNPL application.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0260">In one embodiment, in addition to replacing the location information obtained from the one or more other sources with the location information <b>803</b> from mobile device <b>110</b> in the BNPL application, the location information <b>803</b> from mobile device <b>110</b> can also be provided to the one or more of the other sources that had provided a different address. Such that the one or more other sources, e.g., <b>220</b> et al., will contain the updated location information.</p><p id="p-0262" num="0261">Since there are a number of home addresses found, location information evaluator <b>804</b> compares the likely home address determined from the downloaded location information <b>803</b> with the home address provided on the BNPL application.</p><p id="p-0263" num="0262">Referring now to <b>881</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>C</figref>, one embodiment makes, at the computer system, e.g., fraud determination module <b>805</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, a risk assessment based on a result of the comparison. The following discussion utilizes the home address for the comparison. However, it should be appreciated that any or all addresses determined to be of interest in the application, e.g., home, work, etc. can be subject to comparison. However, for purposes of clarity, the following example refers to the home address.</p><p id="p-0264" num="0263">For example, when the comparison results in a similar or a matching home address as described in the verification portion, a risk solution from the risk assessment, would likely result in a low concern for fraud, e.g., it is likely that the address in the BNPL application is correct.</p><p id="p-0265" num="0264">In contrast, when the comparison results in a dissimilarity, as described in the updating/replacing section, a risk assessment would likely result in a concern of medium or high-level fraud. For example, depending upon the source that provided the conflicting location information, the level of fraud risk would likely, but not necessarily, be different. For example, if the information was input by user specific information engine <b>220</b>, the difference may be due to an incorrect match with the customer, the customer having moved, or the like. In that case, the level of fraud risk may be set to medium which would, in one embodiment, result in the customer receiving a BNPL product at a reduced monetary value.</p><p id="p-0266" num="0265">However, if the incorrect information was input into BNPL application by the customer, the difference is likely due to error or deceit. Thus, a risk assessment would likely result in a higher fraud risk. In one embodiment, due to the higher fraud risk, the customer would receive a denial of the credit account, e.g., no credit account <b>545</b>.</p><p id="p-0267" num="0266">Alternatively, prior to denying the credit account, the customer may receive an additional question about the inconsistency of the home address provided in BNPL application. If the customer recognizes the mistake, and corrects the field to include a home address that matches the historical location information determination, then it is probable that the fraud risk level would be lowered to either medium or a low concern, e.g., the customer receiving a BNPL product with no reduction in value.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Example Computer System Environment</heading><p id="p-0268" num="0267">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, portions of the technology for providing a communication composed of computer-readable and computer-executable instructions that reside, for example, in non-transitory computer-readable medium for storing instructions of a computer system.
