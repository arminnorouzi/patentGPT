The present embodiments have significant engineering applications for nondestructive onsite sensitization assessment of metal alloys (such as aluminum alloys) in various industries such as transportation (maintaining of ships, airplanes, vehicles, oil/gas pipelines), nuclear (maintaining of nuclear power station), construction (maintaining of steel structure, bridge, and facility), and metallurgical engineering (Al alloy manufacture and treatment) industries.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">An alloy is generally comprised of a matrix metal element mixed with one or more other elements. Generally, an alloy is a polycrystalline material with the interface among solid crystallites of the alloy as the grain boundaries (GBs). Sensitization is characterized by the formation of a new phase precipitate preferably along the GBs due to migration of specific atoms when exposed to elevated temperature for a period of time, which causes the GBs to have different physical and chemical properties from the homogenous alloy and to be susceptible to intergranular corrosion (IGC) and stress corrosion cracking (SCC). The general alloys susceptible to sensitization includes the aluminum alloys and stainless steel.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aluminum (Al) alloys are extensively used in marine transportation and military applications due to their high strength-to-weight ratio, formability, cold workability as well as weldability. For example, the 5xxx series magnesium-aluminum (Mg&#x2014;Al) alloys provide the combined properties of high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent corrosion resistance, and therefore, are often used as the primary structural material for building high-speed ships and vessels in marine transportation or military applications. The magnesium (Mg) alloying element is used to strengthen the original aluminum material by solid solution strengthening. However, these materials are susceptible to sensitization over time after exposure to elevated temperature.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Sensitization of the 5xxx alloys is characterized by the formation of precipitates primarily along the material grain boundaries (GBs), such as the magnesium rich &#x3b2;-phase (Mg<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>3</sub>, &#x2dc;Mg 37.5 wt %) precipitates in 5xxx alloys. When exposed to harsh environments in service, such as sea water, a galvanic coupling is formed between the aluminum matrix and the &#x3b2;-phase precipitates, leading to preferential dissolution of these precipitates and resulting in IGC cracking. Sensitization decreases the mechanical and chemical properties of the material and increases the susceptibility to IGC and stress corrosion cracking (SCC) at moderate or even low temperatures (65&#xb0; C.) [1]. The 5xxx aluminum alloys were used as the critical construction materials in the design and construction of state-of-the-art Navy ships [2]. Sensitization caused material degradation is currently one of the most important problems that is costly and needs to be taken care of. Therefore, technologies for rapid and nondestructive onsite characterization of aluminum alloy sensitization are highly desired to improve the work efficiency and reduce the total ownership cost.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A few methodologies have been reported for characterization of the degree of sensitization (DoS) in metal alloys, including the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards, ultrasonic methods, metallographic imaging, X-ray diffraction (XRD), eddy current testing (ECT), and electrochemical methods [2-8]. These techniques have their own advantages and drawbacks with most of them being laboratory-based technologies or to be improved for onsite applications with efficiency and economy [3-7]. Specifically for the 5xxx alloys, the standard method for quantification of the DoS is the ASTM G67 nitric acid mass loss test (NAMLT) technique which uses the mass loss of the material after immersed in concentrated nitric acid for 24 hours to quantify the DoS values [8]. The DoS value is the amount of mass loss of the alloy in unit of mg/cm<sup>2 </sup>calculated from the ASTM G67 test. This method is quantitative and accurate but needs samples to be cut from material, which will damage the related structures. Also, this technology is also a laboratory-based technology as well as time consuming. Some other reported techniques for characterizing the DoS levels have their own drawbacks for onsite applications [3-5]. One currently available technique used for onsite testing of sensitization on ships is the electrochemical method (also referred as the DoS probe), which utilizes electrochemical measurements of the relationships between the current and time to quantify the DoS levels. However, this technology needs surface polishing (e.g., 4&#x2033; diameter to 1200 grit), test area heating to up to 50&#xb0; C., a typical measurement time of 75 min, and expensive maintenance [2]. Therefore, there is still an expectation and need for developing field portable technologies for onsite characterization of an alloy sensitization with the characteristics of being fast, cheap, and flexible to be calibrated for multiple alloys.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present embodiments provide methods for determining sensitization of an alloy by correlating the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) measurements with the degree of sensitization (DoS) to determine the sensitization of an alloy.

The following description shows, by way of illustration, combinations and configurations in which the aspects and features can be put into practice. It is understood that the described aspects, features, and/or embodiments are merely examples for purposes of explanation, and that one skilled in the art may utilize other aspects, features, and/or embodiments or make structural and functional modifications without departing the scope of the present disclosure.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present embodiments provide systems and methods to determine the sensitization of an alloy by correlating the LIBS measurements with the DoS. Certain embodiments use artificial intelligence (AI) approaches. LIBS is an optical emission spectroscopy technique used for chemical composition analysis. Characteristics of LIBS include real-time in-situ analysis, no sample preparation, nearly non-destructive, multi-element analysis, remote detection, and a typical limit of detection (LoD) down to a few ppm. In LIBS measurements, a plasma is generally induced via breakdown of the ablated material by pulsed lasers. The excited atoms/ions transition to lower energy levels and emission chemical element characteristic photons during the plasma cool-down process. The optical emission from the plasma is collected and coupled into spectrometers for spectroscopic measurements. Hence, LIBS measurements semi-quantitatively provide the information of chemical composition of the material with the typical LoD down to a few ppm and are used for chemical analysis of an alloy in the present embodiments.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Generally, the amount of the new phase precipitates positively correlates with the DoS values. Selective chemical etching of the new phase precipitate induces quantitative chemical composition change on the etched alloy surfaces, which is correlated with the DoS values and can be probed by LIBS. Quantitative correlations between the LIBS measurements and the DoS values can be established using AI approaches/algorithms and can be used to determine the sensitization of an alloy. Hence, correlating the LIBS measurements from the selectively etched alloy surfaces with the DoS values provides a method to determine sensitization of an alloy. For purposes of illustration, the 5456 Al&#x2014;Mg alloy is used as an exemplary alloy to illustrate an embodiment. More specifically, there are generally more &#x3b2;-phase (e.g., Mg<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>3</sub>, with Mg&#x2dc;37.5 wt %) precipitates along the GBs for the 5xxx exemplary alloys with higher DoS values. Selective chemical etching of the &#x3b2;-phase causes a negative correlation between the residual Mg concentration on the etched surfaces and the DoS values. Generally, the Al&#x2014;Mg alloy is considered as unsensitized with a DoS value of 15 mg/cm<sup>2 </sup>or less, indeterminate with a DoS value within the range of 15-25 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, and sensitized with a DoS value greater than 25 mg/cm<sup>2 </sup>[1, 9]. Determination of the material DoS level as unsensitized, indeterminate, or sensitized is important to support modernization planning, repair and maintenance activities.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present embodiments provide systems and methods for determining sensitization of an alloy by correlating the LIBS measurements with the DoS to determine the sensitization of an alloy. The embodiments advantageously enable nondestructive onsite sensitization assessment of metal alloys in the transportation industry, nuclear industry, construction industry, and metallurgical engineering industry, among others. More specifically, in embodiments, selective chemical etching induced quantitative chemical composition change, correlating with the DoS, on the etched alloy surfaces may be probed by LIBS. Artificial intelligence (AI) analysis of the chemical composition change due to measurements of selectively chemical etched surfaces are correlated with the DoS to establish calibration models to determine the sensitization of an alloy. The selective chemical etching and LIBS measurements involved may slightly affect the alloy surface within sub-millimeter in depth and sub-square centimeter in area. Hence, the methods induce no influences on the structural integrity and can be characterized as nondestructive.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to an embodiment, a method includes the following features (using the 5456 Al&#x2014;Mg alloy as an example for purposes of illustration):</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">(1) Selective chemical etching of the new phase precipitate of an alloy to induce quantitative chemical composition concentration change, correlated with the DoS values, on the alloy surface. Take the 5xxx aluminum alloy as an example, the &#x3b2;-phase (Mg<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>3</sub>, Mg&#x2dc;37.5 wt %) in the 5456 Al&#x2014;Mg alloy is chemically different from the homogeneous alloy (Mg&#x2dc;5 wt %). In addition, the amount of &#x3b2;-phase (Mg<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>3</sub>) precipitates positively correlates with the DoS. Therefore, selective chemical etching of the &#x3b2;-phase precipitates induces different amounts of Mg concentration change on the etched alloy surfaces, with the residual Mg concentration on the etched surfaces negatively correlating with the DoS. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>(<i>a</i>) to <b>1</b>(<i>c</i>)</figref> show laser microscope images of an etched surfaces of a 5456 alloy correlating with the DoS values of 7.1 (unsensitized), 20.2 (indeterminate), and 47.3 (sensitized) mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The DoS values of the used alloys were identified by the ASTM G67-13 nitric acid mass loss test (NAMLT). Before the chemical etching, the sample surfaces were polished, e.g., using sandpapers to 800-grit. The polished surfaces were then immersed into nitric acid (70%) for 2 hours at room temperature for selective &#x3b2;-phase etching.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">(2) LIBS measurements to semi-quantitatively probe the chemical composition change on the etched surface due to selective chemical etching. For example, a single pulse LIBS system with gating may be used for measurements to probe the chemical composition of the laser locally ablated material. It should be appreciated that a single pulse LIBS system or a multiple pulse LIBS system may be used, with or without gating.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a schematic illustrating aspects of an exemplary embodiment of an LIBS system <b>100</b>. A pulsed laser beam is generated by pulsed laser beam source <b>110</b> and focused onto the target surface <b>120</b> (e.g., &#x201c;sample&#x201d;) by an optical lens <b>115</b> to locally ablate the material and induce plasmas on the target surface. The excited atoms/ions in the plasma transit to lower energy levels during plasma cooling and emit chemical element characteristic photons, the light of which is collected by an optical collection element <b>125</b>, which may include one or multiple lenses, such as a pair of lenses, and coupled into a spectrometer <b>130</b> via an optical fiber for spectroscopic measurements. The spectrometer <b>130</b> communicates with a computer system <b>140</b> including one or more processors and associated memory and storage for data storage and data processing. A LIBS spectrum provides semi-quantitative information of the chemical composition of the material locally ablated by the laser. The sample may be held by a motor controlled 3-axis stage (not shown) for area scanning, e.g., to provide a fresh surface for each laser pulse. A laser displacement sensor may be fixed above the sample surface to assure consistent focal distance for all samples by tracking the position of sample surfaces. In an embodiment, the spectrometer <b>130</b> is externally triggered and synchronized with the pulsed laser for gating measurements, with the synchronization moment as the gate delay time zero. A gate delay and gate width of 0.3 &#x3bc;s and 5 &#x3bc;s, respectively, were used for LIBS measurements in an example.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The semi-quantitative chemical composition information on the etched surfaces correlating with different DoS values were probed by LIBS. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the LIBS spectra, each normalized and averaged from 2000 laser pulse measurements, measured from the etched surfaces correlating with the DoS values of 7.1 (black line), 20.2 (red line), and 47.3 (blue line) mg/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, peak intensities of the emission line of Mg I 383.5 nm (a combination from Mg I 382.9, 383.2, and 383.8 nm) negatively correlates with the DoS values, indicating less residual Mg concentration on the etched surfaces with higher DoS values. This is consistent with the material property change as described in selective chemical etching that the residual Mg concentration negatively correlates with the DoS of the 5xxx Al&#x2014;Mg alloys after selective &#x3b2;-phase etching. The quantitative chemical composition change due to selective chemical etching was successfully probed by LIBS since LIBS has a typical LoD down to a few ppm.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">(3) Establishment of calibration models by correlating the LIBS spectra with the DoS, e.g., using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches/algorithms, to determine sensitization of an alloy. For example, a statistical method of principal component and discriminant function analysis (PC-DFA) was used to establish a calibration model by correlating the LIBS spectra with the DoS values to determine sensitization of the 5456 Al&#x2014;Mg alloy from LIBS spectra unknown to the model. In a specific example, to establish a calibration model and validate the model performance, 400 LIBS spectra correlating with each DoS value were used for data training and prediction, with 350 of them used for data training and the remaining 50 used for prediction test. The statistical multivariate analysis method of PC-DFA was used for data training and prediction. Before the PC-DFA, all LIBS spectra within the wavelength range of 240-400 nm were pre-processed by a standard normal variate technique without background removal to minimize multiplicative error. In PC-DFA, principal component analysis (PCA) was firstly performed on the LIBS spectra to reduce the data dimensions into principal components (PCs) which were then used as inputs for discriminant function analysis (DFA). The PCs sequentially carry the most important information of the dataset, whereas DFA maximize the separation among groups while minimizing variation within group.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this exemplary study, the initial 10 PCs were retained for DFA, altogether carrying 87.95% of the most important information of the dataset. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows the scatterplots of the first two PCs of the PC-DFA of the training (open circular symbols, 350 LIBS spectra correlating with each DoS value) and test (solid square symbols, 50 LIBS spectra correlating with each DoS value) data correlating with different DoS values of the 5456 alloy. The training data correlating with different DoS values were correctly separated in PC-DFA with an accuracy of 94.2%. The performance of the established calibration model was then evaluated by an external validation method for DoS determination. The test data were unknown to the established model. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the established calibration model accurately assigned the test data to their correlating DoS groups with the correct assignment probabilities of 100%, 100% and 82%, respectively, for the DoS groups of 7.1, 20.2, and 47.3 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>. (See, Table 1, below) Therefore, the test data were accurately determined to correlate DoS groups with high confidence, demonstrating the feasibility of the method for determining sensitization of an metal alloy.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00001" num="00001"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="266pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 1</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Results of external validation of multivariate calibrated model for DoS determination.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="119pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Test data correlated</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>with DoS levels</entry><entry>No. of test</entry><entry>Prediction results</entry><entry>Identification of</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>(mg/cm<sup>2</sup>)</entry><entry>data</entry><entry>Unsensitized</entry><entry>Indeterminate</entry><entry>Sensitized</entry><entry>DoS levels</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Unsensitized (7.1)</entry><entry>50</entry><entry/><entry>0</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>Unsensitized</entry></row><row><entry>Indeterminate (20.2)</entry><entry>50</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>100%</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>Indeterminate</entry></row><row><entry>Sensitized (47.3)</entry><entry>50</entry><entry>0</entry><entry>&#x2002;18%</entry><entry>82%</entry><entry>Sensitized</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">All references, including publications, patent applications, and patents, cited or discussed herein are hereby incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each reference were individually and specifically indicated to be incorporated by reference and were set forth in its entirety herein.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">The use of the terms &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; and &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; and similar referents in the context of describing the disclosed subject matter (especially in the context of the following claims) are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context.
