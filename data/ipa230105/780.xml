Lipid encapsulated mRNA formulations, such as lipid nanoparticle (LNP) compositions show high degree of cellular uptake and protein expression. However, presently these formulations are typically in liquid forms, and are required to be administered usually in the form of injections, or via nebulizers. These modes of administration are less desired by the patient than some less invasive routes, for example, metered dose inhalers. Lyophilized formulations sometimes do not offer reliable particle uniformity in dry state, or ease of handling and distribution. Lyophilized powder has to be dissolved in an appropriate solvent prior to dispensing to a patient and can undergo degradation within a few hours. Repeated freeze thawing of mRNA preparations is not recommended due to the potential for mRNA and/or LNP instability.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides, among other things, a dry powder (i.e., spray-dried) formulation of mRNA encapsulated with lipid based nanoparticles for more efficient mRNA delivery and more efficacious mRNA therapy. Prior to the present invention, one of the challenges of spray-drying lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA arose from the fact that both mRNA and the lipid nanoparticle components are structurally labile at the high temperatures and/or pressures needed for adequate spray-drying. For example, an inlet temperature of a spray-dryer ranges between 80&#xb0; C. to 98&#xb0; C. Lipids tend to melt and/or aggregate at the high inlet temperature at or near the spray nozzle. This causes hindrance to the flow of the formulation through the nozzle into the drying chamber, disrupts uniform dispersion of the spray and produces undesirable particle characteristics and poor yield. The present invention has unexpectedly solved this problem with the addition of a polymer to the mRNA and lipid nanoparticle mixture before subjecting the mixture to the spray-drying process. As described herein, the inventors observed that adding a polymer to an mRNA and lipid mixture effectively prevents aggregation of lipid nanoparticles and facilitates dry powder formation of fine particles containing mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles suitable for inhalation.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">More surprisingly, despite the extremely unstable nature of mRNA, dry powder formulations prepared according to the present invention, even under high temperatures and/or high pressures associated with spray-drying, are stable and able to maintain a high degree of mRNA integrity even after long term storage at various temperatures. In addition, a dry powder formulation prepared according to the present invention is also characterized with high LNP encapsulation efficiency of mRNA, resulting in high cellular delivery of mRNA. Therefore, the present invention fulfils a long-standing need in the mRNA therapy field for a stable dry powder form of mRNA therapeutic, which can easily be stored, transferred, and dispensed. Further, the dry powder formulations of mRNA according to the present invention can be administered as dry powder to a patient, e.g. in metered doses or weighed out and reconstituted in single-use amounts, without the need for freezing single-use aliquots of liquid.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the present invention provides a dry powder formulation for delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) containing a plurality of spray-dried particles comprising mRNA encoding a protein or a peptide, one or more lipids, and one or more polymers.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect, the present invention provides a dry powder formulation for delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) containing a plurality of spray-dried particles comprising one or more lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating mRNA encoding a peptide or polypeptide, and one or more polymers.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In still another aspect, the present invention provides a dry powder formulation for delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) containing a plurality of spray-dried particles comprising one or more nanoparticles encapsulating mRNA encoding a peptide or polypeptide, the nanoparticles comprising one or more lipids, and one or more polymers.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a dry powder formulation for delivery of cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR) messenger RNA (mRNA) containing a plurality of spray-dried particles comprising mRNA encoding a CFTR protein, one or more lipids, and one or more polymers. In some embodiments, the one or more lipids form one or more lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) encapsulating the mRNA encoding the CFTR protein.

The process involves, in general, removal of moisture from a composition by passing a liquid form of the composition through an apparatus; a simplified diagrammatic depiction is provided as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. In brief, a liquid formulation comprising the composition of interest is passed through a narrow inlet spray &#x2018;atomizer&#x2019; nozzle into a first chamber, which is the drying chamber. Usually the liquid formulation is passed in a steady stream. The liquid formulation is sprayed as tiny droplets into the drying chamber. A stream of heated air or gas is also led into the drying chamber to form an air current. Passage of the formulation through this heated current disperses the incoming droplets, dries them into the solid particulate form. This product is led into a second chamber by flow through a connector or pipe. The second chamber is the cyclone powder collector. Here, the air circulation generates a cyclone, and the powder particles are collected via a vortex stream into a collection vessel attached to the outlet end. The cyclone chamber is attached to an exhaust fan, which helps cool the components. The inlet and outlet temperatures are operator adjustable. The respective inlet and outlet temperatures, the chamber temperatures, the liquid feed flow rate (aspirator %), pressure, nature of the heated air current and most importantly, the composition of the liquid feed are suitably adjusted for optimal drying of any particulate matter.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some embodiments, the inlet temperature is adjustable within a range of 40&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C.

One such sizing method is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,323, incorporated herein by reference. Sonicating a liposome suspension either by bath or probe sonication produces a progressive size reduction down to small ULV less than about 0.05 microns in diameter. Homogenization is another method that relies on shearing energy to fragment large liposomes into smaller ones. In a typical homogenization procedure, MLV are recirculated through a standard emulsion homogenizer until selected liposome sizes, typically between about 0.1 and 0.5 microns, are observed. The size of the liposomes may be determined by quasi-electric light scattering (QELS) as described in Bloomfield, Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng., 10:421-150 (1981), incorporated herein by reference. Average liposome diameter may be reduced by sonication of formed liposomes. Intermittent sonication cycles may be alternated with QELS assessment to guide efficient liposome synthesis.</p><p id="p-0110" num="0109">Suitable mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles contain one or more of cationic lipids, PEGylated lipids, non-cationic lipids, and cholesterol-based lipids.</p><p id="p-0111" num="0110">Cationic Lipids</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">As used herein, the term &#x201c;cationic lipids&#x201d; refers to any of a number of lipid and lipidoid species that have a net positive charge at a selected pH, such as at physiological pH.

Its measurement brings detailed insight into the causes of dispersion, aggregation or flocculation, and can be applied to improve the formulation of dispersions, emulsions and suspensions. The ZP indicates the degree of repulsion between close and similarly charged particles in the dispersion. High ZP indicates highly charged particles. Generally, high ZP (negative or positive) prevents aggregation of the particles due to electric repulsion and electrically stabilizes the nanoparticle dispersion. On the other hand, in case of low ZP, attraction exceeds repulsion and the dispersion coagulates or flocculates. Zeta potential can be measured by photon correlation spectroscopy using available equipment systems, for example, Zetasizer Nano (Malvern Instruments).</p><p id="p-0331" num="0179">Sphericity of a nanoparticle is a measure of how closely a particle reassembles a sphere.
