More specifically, example embodiments relate to an exercise machine comprising a plurality of exercise platforms and supported by a plurality of repositionable arms, a plurality of actuators, and a plurality of shock absorbers operable to reposition the exercise platforms relative to a substantially horizontal axis.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">Related Art</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Any discussion of the related art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such related art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Resistance exercise machines of the type having a sliding, substantially horizontal exercise platform, such as Pilates apparatuses or stationary rowing machines, are intended to provide for resistance training by moving the platform reciprocally along one or more longitudinal rails that guide the platform's linear movement during exercise. Fitness trainers will appreciate that when exercisers lift all or a portion of their own body weight during a resistance exercise they experience an increase in caloric energy consumption and accelerated muscle fatigue. This has the benefit to exercisers of reducing the amount of exercise time required to achieve desired results compared to exercising without lifting a portion of their body weight.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Reducing the duration of exercisers' training sessions also provides a commercial benefit for fitness facilities. Many fitness facilities generate revenue based on the number of exercisers they can serve during their hours of operation. Reducing the duration of individual exercisers' training sessions increases the number of exercisers who can sequentially use facilities' exercise machines during the hours of operation, thus increasing revenue. Therefore, facility owners, fitness trainers, and exercisers all will appreciate the benefits of increased cardiovascular exercise on a machine comprising a movable platform and that can be elevated at one or both ends to add or subtract a portion of the exerciser's body weight to the baseline level of resistance provided for by the exercise machine.</p><heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Example embodiments are directed to a novel exercise machine for performing resistance exercises. An example machine generally comprises a lower support structure and an upper exercise structure that includes front and back stationary exercise platforms and a movable exercise platform. A plurality of resistance springs with selector knobs enable an exerciser to select and apply a bias force against the movable platform.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The exercise platforms are arranged in a common plane. In one position the platforms are substantially aligned in a horizontal plane. However, the distal ends of the machine may be selectively raised or lowered via the operation of cooperating components to incline the plane and add or subtract a variable portion of the exerciser's body weight to the resistance level provided by the exercise machine itself. This provides an efficient method for increasing the intensity of the exerciser's training and for shortening the exercise time needed for the exerciser to achieve desired results.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A plurality of novel trolley wheel assemblies support the movable platform on a pair of parallel rails and allow it to reciprocate between the stationary platforms. The rails include adjacent upper and lower sloped surfaces that are substantially perpendicular. The trolley wheel assemblies include a plurality of load wheels in rolling engagement with the upper sloped surfaces of the rails and at least one clamp wheel in rolling engagement with the lower sloped surfaces of the rails thereby minimizing lateral and uplift movement of the movable platform during exercise.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A plurality of travel limit decelerators are mounted on the rails at locations intended to engage the movable platform as it reaches its limits of travel on the rails. The travel limit decelerators function to rapidly and smoothly decelerate and bring the platform to a stop without damaging the platform or other machine components.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, some of the embodiments of the adjustable exercise machine in order that the detailed description thereof may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are additional embodiments of the adjustable exercise machine that will be described hereinafter and that will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.

A lifting yoke <b>128</b> is movably connected between the distal ends of the arms <b>108</b>, <b>109</b> as previously described. A back actuator <b>126</b> has a lower proximal end rotatably connected to the base <b>100</b> and a linearly extendible distal end connected to the lifting yoke <b>128</b> in the manner previously described. The actuator <b>126</b> is operable to increase or decrease the elevation of the distal ends of the arms <b>108</b>, <b>109</b> by extending or retracting a piston rod rotatably connected at its distal end to the lifting yoke <b>128</b> in the manner previously described.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">The back end lifting structure further comprises a plurality of shock absorbers <b>127</b>. The lower proximal ends of the shock absorbers <b>127</b> are rotatably connected to the base <b>100</b>, and the extendable rods comprising the upper distal ends of the shock absorbers <b>127</b> are rotatably connected to a transverse structural member <b>124</b> extending between and affixed at opposed ends to the arms <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>. As previously described, the lower proximal and upper distal ends of the shock absorbers <b>127</b> may be rotatably connected to the base <b>100</b> and to the transverse structural member <b>124</b> respectively via bearing flanges <b>104</b> and pivot bearings <b>105</b> in substantially the same manner as the lower proximal end of the back actuator <b>126</b> is pivotably connected to the base <b>100</b>. It should be noted that while the plurality of shock absorbers <b>127</b> may be hydraulic, pneumatic, spring-type or another type consistent with the operation and functions described herein, they may also comprise spring-based shock absorbers <b>127</b> with piston travel lengths of sufficient dimension so that an internal or external coil spring remains at least partially compressed when the arms <b>108</b>, <b>109</b> are positioned at their maximum preferred elevation.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The spring-based shock absorbers <b>127</b> serve three key functions. First, the total compressive force produced by the plurality of springs produces a sufficient arm lifting force to counteract some or all of the weight of the upper frame <b>111</b> and an exerciser. The residual continuous force rating of the shock absorber <b>127</b> springs, even at full extension of the shock absorber <b>127</b> pistons, also reduces the lifting force required to be generated by the actuator <b>126</b>. Therefore, the combination of the springs and the linear actuator <b>126</b> reduces the continuous force rating that would otherwise be required of a linear actuator to lift the upper frame <b>111</b> of the exercise machine <b>110</b> without the assistance of the spring-based shock absorbers <b>127</b>. This is a commercially valuable innovation that substantially reduces the production cost of the exercise machine <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">Second, the shock absorbers <b>127</b> are connected to the base <b>100</b> at their lower proximal ends and to the transverse structural member <b>124</b> at their distal ends. The transverse structural member <b>124</b> extends substantially perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the exercise machine <b>110</b> between the arms <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>. The spring force from the shock absorbers <b>127</b> is thus distributed across the transverse structural member <b>124</b> perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the machine <b>110</b>. This arrangement minimizes the torsional forces that would otherwise be present when only one actuator <b>126</b> is used for lifting the distal ends of the arms <b>108</b>, <b>109</b>. Cancelling or at least substantially controlling the torsional forces relative to the longitudinal axis of the lift supports <b>160</b>, <b>163</b> is an important function of the shock absorbers <b>127</b> as it provides a stabilized exercising plane for an exerciser regardless of the angle of elevation of the exercise machine <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">Third, the use of spring-based shock absorbers <b>127</b> provides for more rapid changes in elevation of the exercise machine <b>110</b>. This function is important so that the positioning of the exercise machine <b>110</b> can be changed quickly to facilitate the transition between different exercises of an exercise routine without stopping for repositioning. It will be appreciated that the speed of the linear actuator's <b>126</b> extension and retraction of a shock absorber <b>127</b> frequently corresponds inversely to the continuous force rating of the shock absorber <b>127</b>. In other words, at a given voltage rating, the speed rating will decrease as the force increases. The use of spring-based shock absorbers <b>127</b> reduces the load rating requirement for the actuator <b>126</b>, thereby allowing a higher speed actuator <b>126</b> to be used in place of a slow speed, high force-rated actuator <b>126</b> that would otherwise be required if spring-based shock absorbers <b>127</b> were not used.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">C.

The movable platform <b>120</b> may ride on a plurality of wheels attached to the underside of the movable platform <b>120</b>. The primary function of the wheels is to reduce friction on the movable platform <b>120</b> as it reciprocates over its intended range of motion on a single plane.

This continual violent contact between the movable platform <b>120</b> and exercise machine <b>110</b> structure causes undue wear and damage to the exercise machine <b>110</b> that shortens mean time between failure and increases maintenance costs.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">Referring primarily to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>A</figref>, an example exercise machine <b>110</b> with a movable platform <b>120</b> and a plurality of movable platform travel limit decelerators <b>137</b> is illustrated. The movable platform travel limit decelerators <b>137</b> constitute a novel means of minimizing damage to the example exercise machine <b>110</b> and/or the movable platform <b>120</b> under the circumstances just described. More specifically, the travel limit decelerators <b>137</b> provide for a rapid deceleration of the movable platform <b>120</b>. The travel limit decelerators <b>137</b> thus provide a more precise and smooth method of stopping the movable platform <b>120</b> as compared to the use of resilient members, such as rubber bumpers, which provide a more violent deceleration, and which ultimately wear away from repeated impact and require frequent replacement.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In the example exercise machine <b>110</b>, the travel limit decelerators <b>137</b> are mounted to one or both of the substantially opposite ends of one or more of the rails <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> such that they will engage with a structural component of the movable platform <b>120</b>, for example a surface of one of the trolley assemblies <b>129</b>, <b>130</b> as the movable platform <b>120</b> reaches its permissible limit of travel so that the movable platform <b>120</b> can be brought to a smooth, gentle, non-damaging stop at the travel limit.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Referring primarily to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b>B and <b>27</b>-<b>29</b></figref>, close up details of one of the example travel limit decelerators <b>137</b> are shown in connection with a corresponding trolley assembly <b>129</b>, <b>130</b> and alone in several different perspectives. The travel limit decelerator <b>137</b> is connected to a surface of a rail <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, for example the upper sloping surface <b>112</b><i>a </i>of right rail <b>112</b>, via a mount <b>138</b> at a longitudinal location along the rail <b>112</b> to engage the movable platform <b>120</b> as it approaches or reaches the desired limit of travel of the movable platform <b>120</b>. The travel limit decelerator comprises a decelerator body <b>139</b> with a shaft <b>140</b> and decelerator plunger <b>141</b>. The decelerator body <b>139</b> is attached to the mount <b>138</b>, for example via a mounting flange with the shaft <b>140</b> and plunger <b>141</b> extending outwardly in the direction of the trolley assembly <b>129</b>, <b>130</b> so as to engage the assembly as the movable platform <b>120</b> approaches the desired limit of travel. The movable platform <b>120</b> and preferably a fixed structural component thereof, such as the trolley mounting member <b>131</b>, move at a velocity in the direction of the deceleration limiter <b>137</b>, and upon engaging the deceleration plunger <b>141</b> just described, begin to compress the plunger <b>141</b> and shaft <b>140</b> into the decelerator body.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">The decelerator body may comprise a spring and/or a fluid displacement cylinder similar in function to a spring-based or fluid based shock absorber.

An exemplary adjustment mechanism <b>142</b> will not require disconnecting the travel limit decelerator <b>137</b> from the rail <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> surface. For example, the adjustment mechanism <b>142</b> may comprise a locking nut or nuts through which the decelerator body <b>139</b> passes longitudinally. With the nut loosened, the decelerator body <b>139</b> can slide longitudinally to bring the shaft <b>140</b> and plunger <b>141</b> nearer to or further from the desired point of travel limit.
