Its key to high-efficiency power conversion is the utilization of the fast switching of power semiconductor devices, like MOSFETs and IGBTs. Consequently, fast and strong voltage fluctuations are generated. Typically, a primary semiconductor switch has three nodes: a control node like the gate of a MOSFET, a switching node like the drain of a MOSFET, and a reference ground node like the source of a MOSFET. The role of the drain and source may exchange. Preferably, the reference ground is a &#x201c;quiet&#x201d; node with relatively stable voltage referring to the earth, while the switching node is a &#x201c;noisy&#x201d; one that exhibits strong fluctuations.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Practically, there are some stray capacitive paths from the converter to the earth. Noise generated by the converter flows to the earth via the stray paths and enters the power network.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">For example, a power converter may be enclosed by a conductive case made from metal, which is an equipotential surface. Then, there are stray capacitive paths from the converter to the case. Such a conductive case has 1) a stray capacitive path to the earth if it is floating, or 2) a short path to the earth if it is connected to an earth line. For safety, the floating case is usually enclosed by insulating materials.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">The high-frequency fluctuations propagate through the paths mentioned above to the earth and the power network. It is regarded as a common-mode (CM) disturbance in EMI studies. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, there is shown an exemplary CM disturbance path conducted from the semiconductor switch(es) to the earth through the stray capacitors and then back to the switch through power input rails. The disturbance can be observed by measuring the line current or the line-to-earth voltage.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">For suppression of the disturbance from switching converters, EMI filters may be added. In mitigating the conducted CM disturbance, there are two methods: 1) use chokes to form a high-impedance path for high-frequency disturbance propagation, i.e., the common-mode choke; 2) use capacitors to shunt the disturbance and make it circulate within the converter instead of flooding outwards, i.e., the Y-cap. These two methods are usually applied simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">Without wishing to be bound by theory, the drawback of a choke is the bulkiness and the weight. The drawback of a Y-cap is the effect of increasing AC leakage current to the earth. The leakage current is hazardous if it flows through a human body. Even though the leakage current is conducted to the earth without flowing through the human body, an overwhelming amount of current will trip a residue current device (RCD), which leads to a power cutoff instantly. Therefore, the Y-cap capacitance is usually very limited.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">Active EMI filtering circuits may be used instead for reduction of filter size and enhancing of filter performance. For example, the active filtering technique based on fast linear amplification may be applied. The noise signal is amplified and then injected into the converter system to impose a stronger filter response than passive elements. As an example, an active-enhanced Y-cap can circulate the high-frequency noise more effectively.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Meanwhile, the capacitance can be small enough to avoid excessive leakage current. The core part of prior-art active filtering techniques is the fast amplifier, which requires high bandwidth, high gain, and high fidelity. Such an idealized amplifier is hard to implement and stabilize. Moreover, faster amplifiers usually consume higher power.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an active EMI reduction method using a synchronization program and waveform-matching hardware design. It is based on the knowledge of the noise source behavior.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">Preferably, based on the knowledge of a switching node waveform, an active synchronous noise shunt can be built. The shunt utilizes switching actions synchronized and aligned with the converter's switching node(s) to make the disturbance current circulate inside a converter. Then, the EMI emission is nulled.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The present embodiments show the circuit building techniques, which mimic the common-mode noise generation process in a switching mode power converter, to absorb the noise current. The sync-shunt employs logic or digital circuits to control. It sinks the noise current through a capacitor.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">Preferably, an active filtering technique may be implemented without using high-speed linear amplifiers. The Y-cap driver is switching at the same frequency as the power converter, which is relatively low. Moreover, the only component to sustain high voltage is the Y-cap. Therefore, the cost, as well as power consumption, are low. Because of the simplicity of the control and driving circuit, the hardware size can be made compact.
