id="p-0026" num="0025">(Detection Device)</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Hereinafter, a detection device according to embodiments of the present disclosure will be described with reference to the drawings.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the drawings, the same or corresponding parts are denoted by the same reference characters. In the description of the present embodiment, redundant descriptions of the same or corresponding parts will be omitted or simplified appropriately.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">First, an outline of an operation of abnormality detection of an infusion tube by a detection device according to the present disclosure will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Although details will be described below, the detection device according to the present disclosure irradiates an infusion tube attached to the detection device with an infrared ray, receives an infrared ray reflected by the infusion tube, and generates a captured image obtained by imaging the infusion tube. The detection device detects blockage of the infusion tube and air bubbles in the infusion tube based on the generated captured image.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a path of an infrared ray emitted from the outside of the infusion tube in a width direction toward the infusion tube. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a solid or broken arrow indicates an infrared ray, and the thickness of the arrow indicates the intensity of the infrared ray. Furthermore, the solid arrow indicates incident light and transmitted light of an infrared ray emitted toward the infusion tube, and the broken arrow indicates an infrared ray reflected by the infusion tube. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an infrared ray emitted from the outside of the infusion tube in a width direction toward the infusion tube travels in the order of air outside the infusion tube, a side wall of the infusion tube, a liquid or air bubbles in the infusion tube, a side wall of the infusion tube, and air outside the infusion tube. At this time, a part of the infrared ray passes through a boundary between substances having different refractive indexes, and the other part of the infrared ray is reflected at the boundary between the substances having different refractive indexes. As an example, it is assumed that the side wall of the infusion tube, the liquid in the infusion tube, and the air bubbles in the infusion tube are vinyl chloride, water, and air, respectively. In this case, the refractive indexes of the side wall of the infusion tube, the liquid in the infusion tube, and the air bubbles in the infusion tube are, for example, 1.54, 1.33, and 1.0, respectively. Since the refractive index of the side wall of the infusion tube is larger than the refractive index of each of the other substances, a larger amount of the infrared ray is reflected at the boundary between the side wall of the infusion tube and each of the other substances.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an example of a captured image of the infusion tube captured by the detection device. The captured image illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is captured in a state in which the infusion tube extending in the vertical direction of the drawing is irradiated with an infrared ray from the left side in the horizontal direction of the drawing. In the present embodiment, in the captured image captured by the detection device, a portion where the intensity of the received infrared ray is high is bright, and conversely, a portion where the intensity of the received infrared ray is low is dark. Therefore, in the captured image, a region including both side walls of the infusion tube is displayed brightly in the extending direction of the captured infusion tube.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, the detection device can measure a light intensity value of each pixel included in the captured image by an image process such as an edge detection process, and can specify a high light intensity region R having a light intensity value equal to or more than a predetermined threshold as a region including both side walls of the infusion tube captured in the captured image based on a light intensity distribution in the captured image.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The detection device determines whether or not the infusion tube is blocked based on a light intensity distribution in the captured image. Specifically, when the infusion tube is blocked, the amount of liquid flowing in the infusion tube changes, and the thickness of the infusion tube changes. For example, when blockage occurs on a downstream side of a portion of the infusion tube captured in the captured image, the internal pressure of the portion increases, and the infusion tube captured in the captured image becomes thicker. Meanwhile, when the blockage occurs on an upstream side of the portion captured in the captured image of the infusion tube, the amount of liquid flowing in the portion decreases, and the internal pressure of the portion decreases. As a result, the infusion tube captured in the captured image becomes thinner.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Therefore, the detection device can determine whether or not the infusion tube is blocked based on the outer diameter D of the infusion tube captured in the captured image.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">The detection device can further determine whether or not there are air bubbles in the infusion tube based on a light intensity distribution in the captured image. The captured image illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is captured in a state in which there is no air bubble in the infusion tube above a broken line and there are air bubbles in the infusion tube below the broken line. In the infusion tube, the light intensity distribution in the captured image is different between the portion where there are air bubbles inside and the portion where there is no air bubble inside due to a difference in refractive index between water and air. Specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in a case where there are air bubbles inside, the intensity of a reflected infrared ray increases when the infrared ray is incident on the inside of the infusion tube from the side wall of the infusion tube as compared with a case where there is no air bubble inside. Therefore, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in the captured image, a region R<b>1</b> of the infusion tube including a side wall on an infrared ray light source side is brighter and a width W<b>1</b> thereof is thicker in the portion where there are air bubbles inside. Furthermore, in the portion where there are air bubbles inside, when the infrared ray is incident on the inside of the infusion tube from the side wall of the infusion tube, the intensity of the reflected infrared ray increases, and the intensity of transmitted infrared ray decreases. As described above, in the captured image, in the portion where there are air bubbles inside, a region R<b>2</b> of the infusion tube including a side wall on a side opposite to the light source is darker and a width W<b>2</b> thereof is thinner.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Therefore, the detection device can determine whether or not there are air bubbles in the infusion tube based on the width W (W<b>1</b> or W<b>2</b>) of at least one of the regions R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b> each including a side wall of the infusion tube captured in the captured image.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the present embodiment, a captured image captured by the detection device is described on the assumption that a region where the intensity of a received infrared ray is high is bright, and a region where the intensity of the received infrared ray is low is dark. Therefore, the detection device specifies a high light intensity region having a light intensity value equal to or more than a predetermined threshold in the captured image as a region including both side walls of the infusion tube captured in the captured image. However, in the captured image, a region where the intensity of the received infrared ray is high may be displayed darkly, and a region where the intensity of the received infrared ray is low may be displayed brightly. In such a case, the detection device may specify a low light intensity region having a light intensity value equal to or less than a predetermined threshold in the captured image as a region including both side walls of the infusion tube captured in the captured image.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Next, a configuration of a detection device <b>1</b>A, which is a first embodiment of the detection device according to the present disclosure, will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram illustrating a schematic configuration of the detection device <b>1</b>A according to the first embodiment of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of a first housing <b>11</b> of the detection device <b>1</b>A. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, an infusion tube <b>200</b> attached to the detection device <b>1</b>A is indicated by a two-dot chain line. The detection device <b>1</b>A includes a receiving plate <b>2</b>, a contact portion <b>3</b>, an irradiation unit <b>4</b>, a light guide <b>5</b>, an imaging unit <b>6</b>, an output unit <b>7</b>, and a control unit <b>8</b>. In the present embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the detection device <b>1</b>A includes the first housing <b>11</b> to which the infusion tube <b>200</b> is attached, and a second housing <b>12</b> facing the first housing <b>11</b> with the infusion tube <b>200</b> interposed therebetween. In the detection device <b>1</b>A, the receiving plate <b>2</b>, the contact portion <b>3</b>, and the light guide <b>5</b> are disposed in the first housing <b>11</b>, and the irradiation unit <b>4</b>, the imaging unit <b>6</b>, the output unit <b>7</b>, and the control unit <b>8</b> are disposed in the second housing <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The receiving plate <b>2</b> is formed of a plate-like member. A surface of the receiving plate <b>2</b> abuts on the infusion tube <b>200</b> when the infusion tube <b>200</b> is attached to the detection device <b>1</b>A. In the present disclosure, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a direction in which the infusion tube <b>200</b> attached to the detection device <b>1</b>A extends is referred to as an extending direction. A direction orthogonal to the extending direction on the surface of the receiving plate <b>2</b> is referred to as a width direction. A direction orthogonal to the extending direction and the width direction is referred to as a height direction. Furthermore, in the infusion tube <b>200</b>, a direction orthogonal to the extending direction is referred to as a radial direction. The radial direction of the infusion tube <b>200</b> includes the width direction and the height direction of the infusion tube <b>200</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The contact portion <b>3</b> is configured to come into contact with the infusion tube <b>200</b> from both sides of the infusion tube <b>200</b> in the radial direction at two locations spaced apart from each other in the extending direction of the infusion tube <b>200</b> attached to the detection device <b>1</b>A. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the contact portion <b>3</b> includes a first contact portion <b>3</b>A and a second contact portion <b>3</b>B. The first contact portion <b>3</b>A and the second contact portion <b>3</b>B protrude from the receiving plate <b>2</b> in the height direction at positions spaced apart from each other in the extending direction of the infusion tube <b>200</b> on the surface of the receiving plate <b>2</b>. Each of the first contact portion <b>3</b>A and the second contact portion <b>3</b>B includes two protrusions facing each other so as to come into contact with the infusion tube <b>200</b> from both sides of the infusion tube <b>200</b> in the width direction.
