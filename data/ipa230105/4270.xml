id="abstract"><p id="p-0001" num="0000">A touch display device is disclosed. Since a touch electrode line included in the display device is divided into two or more touch electrode line parts connected to different touch routing lines, an entire load of the touch electrode line and the touch routing line can be reduced. As a portion of the touch routing line is disposed on an active area and touch routing lines connected to different touch electrode line parts are connected to each other between the active area and a touch driving circuit, an entire load can be reduced without an increase of a non-active area and an increase of a channel due to the touch routing lines, and a performance of a touch sensing can be improved.</p></abstract><drawings id="DRAWINGS"><figure id="Fig-EMI-D00000" num="00000"><img id="EMI-D00000" he="169.59mm" wi="131.74mm" file="US20230004271A1-20230105-D00000.TIF" alt="embedded image"
