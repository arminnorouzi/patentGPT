They are characterized by complex processes, high capital and operating costs, including various equipment, raw materials, energy, catalysts, and relatively low profitability. In some respects, modern processes are ineffective, inflexible, polluting, and far from optimal. Improving the efficiency of these industrial processes can have a significant impact on pollutant emissions, energy and material efficiency, profit margins and financial benefits. Inadequate process monitoring technologies, such as chromatography-based sensors or spectral instruments, cannot meet the industry requirements for a combination of high accuracy and real-time process control.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">One of many examples of industrial processes in need of improvement and optimisation are the world's power plants using natural gas as an energy source. In today's global gas market, consumers receive gas from several sources, such as natural gas fields, shale gas production, liquefied natural gas and biogas. Real-time monitoring of gas composition (input and output gas) improves turbine control and can improve performance, protect the environment and prevent turbine damage. Gas turbines can operate with a very wide range of energy sources, but unpredictable changes in gas composition can damage the turbines. In petrochemical processes, the purity of the gases entering the reactors is critical to the quality of the final product. A small number of pollutants can negatively affect the entire batch, and therefore real-time monitoring can allow better control of the incoming gases and prevent such negative effects.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Modern gas chromatographs are almost universally used to measure natural gas composition and its heating value. Ward et al (in &#x201c;<i>Real time monitoring of a biogas digester with gas chromatography, near</i>-<i>infrared spectroscopy, and membrane</i>-<i>inlet mass spectrometry</i>&#x201d;, Bioresource Technology 102, 2011, pp. 4098-4103) employed four methods for monitoring an anaerobic digestion process at a pilot scale. Methods used to measure gases include membrane inlet mass spectrometry (MIMS) and micro-gas chromatography (&#x3bc;-GC). The &#x3bc;-GC method requires little maintenance, while the MIMS method requires frequent cleaning and background measurements. In addition, the &#x3bc;-GC method measures hydrogen, methane, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen sulphide very accurately, while the MIMS accurately measures methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide, reduced organic sulphur compounds and p-cresol, also in headspace. However, while accurate, these methods are very slow.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an attempt to overcome the aforementioned problem of relatively slow measurements with a gas chromatograph, G. E. Fodor (1996) under the contract to U.S. Army TARDEC Mobility Technology Centre in Belvoir, Va. (Contract No. DAAK70-92-C-0059) developed the use of mid-band Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) as a fast and reasonably reliable laboratory or field method for assessing the composition and properties of natural gas, and to demonstrate the feasibility of using FTIR as an on-line natural gas analyser. A very fast experimental FTIR protocol has been developed for the simultaneous determination of methane, ethane, propane and butane in nitrogen from real-time FTIR spectra. This method is based on correlations found between several known gas compositions and their FTIR spectra. However, conventional FTIR instruments used for gas detection and analysis in industry are expensive, require some experienced operators, cannot be used directly on gas lines, cannot respond quickly enough for monitoring purposes, and have low sensitivity.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Spontaneous Raman spectroscopy has been used in industry for over twenty years. Most analytes, including gases, have a unique &#x201c;Raman fingerprint&#x201d; that can be used to specifically and very accurately detect and measure analytes and their concentrations. Although it is a powerful tool for chemical and biochemical analysis, providing specific vibrational signatures of chemical bonds, analysers based on spontaneous Raman spectroscopy are nevertheless hampered by long acquisition times and often low sensitivity, which requires the use of powerful lasers. In fact, this is a trade-off between real-time measurement and resolution. Its effectiveness is even more limited when testing low concentration target samples.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Stimulated Raman scattering belongs to a family of spectroscopic methods based on the phenomenon of light scattering. While the history of this technique parallels that of laser light sources, recent advances have spurred a resurgence in its use and development that has spanned across scientific fields and spatial scales. SRS is a nonlinear optical technique that tests the same vibrational modes of molecules that are observed in spontaneous Raman scattering of light. However, although spontaneous Raman scattering of light is an incoherent method, SRS is a coherent process, and this fact offers several advantages over traditional Raman scattering methods.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Raman amplification is expected to follow the SRS mechanism. In general, it is expected that above a certain threshold for pump photons, as soon as Raman photons are generated at an intensity above the system loses, the stimulated Raman scattering will be amplified according to the stimulated Raman scattering related equations:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mrow>   <mfrac>    <msub>     <mi>dI</mi>     <mi>R</mi>    </msub>    <mi>dz</mi>   </mfrac>   <mo>=</mo>   <mrow>    <mrow>     <msub>      <mi>g</mi>      <mi>R</mi>     </msub>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <msub>      <mi>I</mi>      <mi>p</mi>     </msub>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <msub>      <mi>I</mi>      <mi>R</mi>     </msub>    </mrow>    <mo>-</mo>    <mrow>     <msub>      <mi>a</mi>      <mi>R</mi>     </msub>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <msub>      <mi>I</mi>      <mi>R</mi>     </msub>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mrow>  <mo>&#x2062;</mo>  <mtext></mtext>  <mrow>   <mfrac>    <msub>     <mi>dI</mi>     <mi>p</mi>    </msub>    <mi>dz</mi>   </mfrac>   <mo>=</mo>   <mrow>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <mo>-</mo>      <mfrac>       <msub>        <mi>w</mi>        <mi>p</mi>       </msub>       <msub>        <mi>w</mi>        <mi>R</mi>       </msub>      </mfrac>     </mrow>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <msub>      <mi>g</mi>      <mi>R</mi>     </msub>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <msub>      <mi>I</mi>      <mi>p</mi>     </msub>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <msub>      <mi>I</mi>      <mi>R</mi>     </msub>    </mrow>    <mo>-</mo>    <mrow>     <msub>      <mi>a</mi>      <mi>p</mi>     </msub>     <mo>&#x2062;</mo>     <msub>      <mi>I</mi>      <mi>p</mi>     </msub>    </mrow>   </mrow>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0011" num="0000">where I<sub>R </sub>is the intensity of the Raman signal of a specific transition, I<sub>p </sub>is the pump intensity, w<sub>R </sub>and w<sub>p </sub>are the angular frequencies of the Raman and pump beams, respectively, a<sub>R </sub>and a<sub>p </sub>are the losses of the Raman and pump beams, respectively, g<sub>R </sub>is the Raman gain coefficient which is transition- and wavelength-dependent, z is the coordinate along the fibre axis.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0009">In the present application, the term &#x201c;Raman&#x201d; or &#x201c;Raman signal&#x201d; refers to Stokes as well as anti-Stokes Raman lines in the spectrum.

In the case of self-stimulated Raman amplification, I<sub>R </sub>is initially zero and only pump laser is coupled to the fiber to start with. As Raman photons are generated spontaneously, they are amplified along the fiber in accordance to the stimulated Raman scattering mechanism.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0011">Modern solutions to control the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio and low resolution of the stimulated Raman scattering systems require high peak power, narrow spectral width, very stable and accurate low-noise optical components such as photodiodes and laser sources, together with high-resolution, low-noise analogue-to-digital converters. However, these components are expensive and, in many cases, need to be made to order. Moreover, the system architecture is too complex, cumbersome, relatively fragile, and difficult to align or maintain alignment. It also cannot be used outdoors. Alternatively, there are various commercially available lasers that are less accurate, inherently unstable, have a high background, and are subject to wavelength drift. The development of a method for using such unstable lasers in Raman spectroscopy can significantly reduce the cost and size of the device, as well as increase the reliability of the system. However, for this reason, and despite the aforementioned advantages of stimulated Raman scattering over other methods used in molecular analysis, the use of stimulated Raman scattering has not yet been implemented in the industry.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0012">As mentioned above, the stimulated Raman scattering spectroscopic instruments are currently used only in the academic institutions. However, it has been a long-felt need to create a relatively small in size, robust and capable of operating in industrial environments, device for on-line, real-time, high-resolution monitoring of gases on a molecular level in industrial processes. A robust, real-time, high-resolution industrial molecular analyser directly sampling tens of intermittent stages of the industrial plant processes, taking into account safety precautions in various aggressive, hazardous and explosive environments, whilst performing the completely automatic analysis with relatively low maintenance cost (no moving parts, no consumables and high durability) is highly desirable. Such device disclosed in the present application, used for real-time control and massive data collection of industrial processes, through real-time response and high-resolution monitoring of the target molecules composition, is suitable for on-field, industrial conditions in a wide range of temperatures and monitoring conditions, including corrosive environments, high noise and vibrations.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0013">The present invention describes a stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) spectrometer for real-time, high-resolution molecular analysis of one or more target gases in a gas sample, based on two hollow-core optical fibres (<b>420</b>, <b>450</b>) illuminated by a single high-power, short-pulse laser pump (<b>15</b>). The first fibre (<b>420</b>) is prefilled with high concentration target gases. Interaction of each target gas with the pump laser beam generates the corresponding Raman lines based on self-stimulated Raman scattering (SSRS) phenomenon inside the first fibre (<b>420</b>).

For purposes of explanation, specific configurations and details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present application. However, it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the present application may be practiced without the specific details presented herein. Furthermore, well-known features may be omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the present application.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0057">The term &#x201c;comprising&#x201d;, used in the claims, is &#x201c;open ended&#x201d; and means the elements recited, or their equivalent in structure or function, plus any other element or elements which are not recited. It should not be interpreted as being restricted to the means listed thereafter; it does not exclude other elements or steps. It needs to be interpreted as specifying the presence of the stated features, integers, steps or components as referred to, but does not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps or components, or groups thereof. Thus, the scope of the expression &#x201c;a device comprising x and z&#x201d; should not be limited to devices consisting only of components x and z. Also, the scope of the expression &#x201c;a method comprising the steps x and z&#x201d; should not be limited to methods consisting only of these steps.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0058">Unless specifically stated, as used herein, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; is understood as within a range of normal tolerance in the art, for example within two standard deviations of the mean. In one embodiment, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; means within 10% of the reported numerical value of the number with which it is being used, preferably within 5% of the reported numerical value. For example, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; can be immediately understood as within 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.1%, 0.05%, or 0.01% of the stated value. In other embodiments, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; can mean a higher tolerance of variation depending on for instance the experimental technique used. Said variations of a specified value are understood by the skilled person and are within the context of the present invention. As an illustration, a numerical range of &#x201c;about 1 to about 5&#x201d; should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited values of about 1 to about 5, but also include individual values and sub-ranges within the indicated range.

It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the specification and relevant art and should not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein. Well-known functions or constructions may not be described in detail for brevity and/or clarity.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0060">It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;on&#x201d;, &#x201c;attached to&#x201d;, &#x201c;connected to&#x201d;, &#x201c;coupled with&#x201d;, &#x201c;contacting&#x201d;, etc., another element, it can be directly on, attached to, connected to, coupled with or contacting the other element or intervening elements may also be present.

The first hollow-core optical fibre (<b>420</b>) is used to generate the appropriate Raman signal (Stokes or anti-Stokes) and is pre-filled with high concentration target gases. A high-power short-pulse pumping laser (<b>15</b>) is coupled with this first fibre (<b>420</b>), in which the interaction of each target gas with the pumping laser generates the corresponding Raman lines (Stokes or anti-Stokes) based on self-stimulated Raman scattering (SSRS) phenomena. The laser beam at the exit from the first fibre (<b>420</b>) contains a signal from a high-power pump laser and the corresponding Raman lines and actually constitutes a combined beam of amplified self-stimulated Raman signals propagating with the pump laser beam. This beam, also called a &#x201c;wavelength comb&#x201d;, is coupled with the second hollow-core optical fibre through an interface (second interface) that allows the laser and gas to enter the second hollow-core fibre.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0079">Along the second hollow-core fibre (<b>450</b>), the SRS phenomenon occurs where each target gas interacts with a common pump and with the appropriate Raman signal, thereby amplifying the corresponding Raman line. The accumulated gain of the amplified Raman signals at the end of the second fibre (<b>450</b>) correlates with the concentration of each target gas. The system is calibrated accordingly. At the output of the second fibre (<b>450</b>), the pump signal is filtered and the beam containing only Raman signals is sent to the receiver subsystem (<b>30</b>) for spectral analysis. Comparison of the Raman signal intensities at the input (reference signals) and the amplified Raman signals at the output of the second fibre (<b>450</b>) allows the measurement of the target gas concentrations at very low concentrations (below 100 ppm).</p><p id="p-0053" num="0080">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrating the amplification of the self-stimulated Raman scattering. High-power pump pulse propagates through a hollow-core optical fibre and interacts with gas molecules filling the hollow core optical fibre (<b>800</b>). Because the pulse is very high-power, its intensity remains nearly constant throughout the fibre (for all molecular interactions), and pump laser losses are expected to be on the order of 1-100 W of the initial pulse of 4-20 kW peak power (<b>801</b>). At the entrance to the hollow-core optical fibre, the Raman signal is zero (<b>802</b>). The short-term interaction of the pump laser beam with gas molecules generates a spontaneous Raman signal (<b>803</b>). If the pump power exceeds a certain threshold, the generated Raman signal exceeds its losses in the hollow-core optical fibre. As a result, SRS becomes the dominant phenomenon, and the Raman signal is nonlinearly amplified when the laser light propagates in the hollow-core optical fibre (<b>804</b>). At the exit from this hollow-core optical fibre, the Raman signal is several orders of magnitude higher than the spontaneous Raman signal (<b>805</b>). In addition to absorption by gas molecules, the fibre itself can be regarded as a significant source of losses, depending on its spectral transmission curve and the nature of mode propagation along the fibre. Ideally, all photons propagate in the main central mode and therefore interact with the gas. In practice, some photons travel in different modes and their contribution to the Raman signal is unknown.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0081">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> that illustrates the spectroscopical concept behind the stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) spectrometer of the present invention based on a single laser (<b>15</b>) and two hollow-core optical fibres (<b>420</b> and <b>450</b>). A conventional SRS spectroscopy implementation uses two lasers sources with a spectral distance corresponding to a particular Raman transition in one of the measured gases of interest. The SRS phenomenon is carried out by the same gas only so that the SRS signal correlates with the concentration of this gas. The present invention describes a general-purpose on-site spectrometer or molecular analyser capable of rapidly generating a high-resolution Raman spectrum of a gas sample, which is a target gas or a mixture of gases in about 1-5 seconds based on applying combination of two Stimulated Raman techniques: Self-Stimulated Raman Scattering in the first fibre (<b>420</b>) and Stimulated Raman Scattering in the second fibre (<b>450</b>).</p><p id="p-0055" num="0082">The present invention performs a parallel, simultaneous SRS process for multiple gases of interest. The gas mixture in the first hollow-core fibre (<b>420</b>) constitutes a composition of target gases with high concentration and high pressure. It is illuminated by one pump laser (<b>15</b>) (common for all gases) with a sequence of short pulses (<b>701</b>, <b>721</b>, <b>741</b>) having high-peak power (<b>703</b>), which is typically between 5 kW to 30 kW, and a pulse width (<b>702</b>) of nanosecond or sub-nanosecond duration. There are no Raman signals (<b>704</b>, <b>706</b>, <b>708</b>) at the entrance to the first fibre (<b>420</b>), and the only signals there are pump signals (<b>701</b>, <b>721</b>, <b>741</b>). As these pulses (pump signals) propagate through the first fibre (<b>420</b>), several specific Raman signals (including Stokes and anti-Stokes) appear simultaneously. Concentration and pressure of the prefilled gases in the first fibre (<b>420</b>) are sufficient to generate the self-stimulated Raman scattering (SSRS) phenomenon (as described above).</p><p id="p-0056" num="0083">There are several Raman signals (<b>724</b>, <b>726</b>, <b>748</b>) appearing at the exit of the first fibre (<b>420</b>), wherein each signal corresponds to a specific gas in the gas mixture. The SSRS phenomenon occurs simultaneously for all gases in the mixture, wherein for each particular gas in the mixture, the signal intensity or amplitude (<b>725</b>, <b>727</b>, <b>729</b>) corresponds to the pump power, the particular gas concentration and this particular gas Raman cross-section.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0084">Thus, the combined beam at the exit from the first fibre (<b>420</b>) contains the pump signal and the generated self-stimulated Raman signal. This combined beam also defined as a &#x201c;comb&#x201d; signal is directed into the second hollow-core optical fibre (<b>450</b>). In most cases, the concentration of the target gases in the gas sample is insufficient to enable the SSRS phenomenon. However, the comb laser signal containing the pair of laser signals entering the second fibre (<b>450</b>) overcomes this insufficiency. Since the gases prefilled in the first fibre (<b>420</b>) are essentially the same gases as the target gases in the gas sample in the second fibre (<b>450</b>), the Raman signals in the comb signal correspond to each of these target gases and enable the stimulated Raman scattering phenomenon on the molecules of these gases inside the second fibre (<b>450</b>).</p><p id="p-0058" num="0085">The combined beam propagates through the second fibre (<b>450</b>), interacts with the molecules of the target gases in the gas sample and generates the SRS phenomenon, where energy from the pump signal is transferred to the Raman signals. At the exit from the second fibre (<b>450</b>), the amplitude or intensity of the Raman signals (<b>744</b>, <b>746</b>, <b>748</b>) is therefore significantly increased, where this increase is actually the SRG (stimulated Raman gain) for each gas (<b>745</b>, <b>747</b>, <b>749</b>). These SRGs are correlated to the target gases concentration (the required measured parameter), as well as to the pump laser power, the Raman signal power at the entrance to the first fibre (<b>420</b>), the specific gas Raman cross-section and other system parameters, such as the length of the second fibre (<b>450</b>), gas pressure, temperature etc. All these system parameters can be measured and used to extract the specific gas concentration form the specific gas SRG value.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0086">To achieve a high resolution of spectral measurements of target gases, spectrometers based on the SSRS phenomenon must use high-peak power nano- or picosecond lasers. Relatively small diameter of the hollow core of an optical fibre in these spectrometers provides illumination of more than 10 MW/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is necessary for the SSRS phenomenon. The length of the hollow-core optical fibre must exceed a minimum length (usually several meters) in order to provide the amplification described in the present invention.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0087">The hollow core fibres of the present invention have a specific spectral transmission curve. In general, hollow core optical fibres are a specific type of glass fibres that, unlike conventional optical fibres, allow the guidance of an optical wave in the hollow region of the fibre. Their most promising advantages are, therefore, directly-linked to the absence of glass material in the fibre core, which, in principle, may be expected to imply, not only lower nonlinearity and dispersion, but also lower attenuation. In other words, hollow-core fibres are optical fibres which guides light essentially within a hollow region, so that only a minor portion of the optical power propagates in the solid fibre material (typically a glass). The hollow core can be filled with gas or enable gas to flow through it. The hollow region of the fibre is relatively small (approximately 50 &#x3bc;m in diameter), the gas is located (static or flow through) in that region. Such confined environment is optimal for the quantum-optics interaction (which is SRS in the present case) between the gas and the laser, as the laser intensity is very high across the full length of the fibre. SRS amplification is exponential with the interaction length and permitted only above high level of light intensity and high gas concentration.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0088">A specific example of the hollow-core fibre architecture is a Photonic-Crystal Hollow-Core Fibre (PCHCF) containing a pattern of silica rings (with circular or elliptical cross-section) around the hollow core. This structure confines light in hollow cores with confinement characteristics, which are not possible in conventional optical fibres, because in the conventional fibres, the refractive index of the fibre core has to be higher than that of the surrounding cladding material, and there is no way of obtaining a refractive index of glass below that of air or vacuum, at least in the optical spectral region. By tuning the structure of the silica rings, it is possible to control the spectral transmission curve of the fibre and consequently, suppress non-desired wavelengths.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0089">It is of ultimate importance for the SRS spectrometer of the present invention to match the transmission curve of the fibre to the wavelength of the pump laser and to the target Raman signals. This will amplify only the target Raman signals and suppress unwanted scattering signals at other wavelengths. For example, in the case of using a hollow-core optical fibre with good transmission in the range of 500-700 nm, the use of pumping at a wavelength of 532 nm makes it possible to amplify the Stokes signals of all hydrocarbon gases while simultaneously suppressing anti-Stokes signals, which are characteristic for these gases. On the contrary, the use of a hollow core fibre with good transmission at a wavelength of 700-1100 nm and a pump laser at a wavelength of 1064 nm makes it possible to amplify anti-Stokes gases and suppress Stokes signals.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0090">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> schematically showing the laser source (<b>10</b>) together with the molecular gas analysis subsystem (<b>40</b>) of the SRS spectrometer of the present invention according to a first embodiment.

It also comprises a gas port/s connected to the gas inlet (<b>150</b>). Upon entering the first fibre (<b>420</b>), the laser beam interacts with the gas molecules present in the hollow core of the first fibre (<b>420</b>), thereby causing the SSRS phenomena. The first fibre (<b>420</b>) can be several meters long, depending on the original design of the spectrometer.

In other words, the beam splitter is used to sample small portion of the laser beam to be used as a reference signal, while the remaining larger portion of the laser beam is coupled with the second fibre (<b>450</b>) via a window. A small valve at the outlet of the first fibre (<b>420</b>) is used to flush this fibre when needed.

The highly concentrated gases in the hollow core of the first optical fibre (<b>420</b>) are static, that is, they do not leave the first fibre and only serve to generate a Raman signal when their molecules interact with the pumping laser beam.

The receiver subsystem (<b>30</b>) is mainly intended to extract the SRG of each wavelength and calculate the concentration out of the SRG for each target gas in the mixture. The two beams that enter the receiver subsystem (<b>30</b>) are the reference signal, which is the Raman signal at the entrance to the second fibre (<b>450</b>), and the Raman amplified signal, which is a sequence of short pulses having very short pulse duration (<b>604</b>) of typically 0.5-1.5 ns with the repetition rate of typically 5-20 kHz as generated by the laser (<b>15</b>). The pump and other undesired wavelengths are blocked at the exit from the second fibre (<b>450</b>). Each beam pulse then contains the plurality of Raman signals at different wavelengths (<b>601</b>, <b>611</b>, <b>621</b>) of the reference beam and at the wavelengths (<b>602</b>, <b>612</b>, <b>622</b>) of the Raman amplified beam. In order to extract the SRG for each target gas in the gas sample, the beams should be spectrally separated, followed by comparing the amplitude of the amplified Raman signal (<b>607</b>) to the amplitude of the reference Raman signal (<b>605</b>) and then extracting the SRG (<b>606</b>) from their difference.

In this embodiment, the receiver subsystem (<b>30</b>) operates sequentially, i.e., it handles each single target gas from the gas sample at a time. This receiver subsystem (<b>30</b>) is configured to measure a certain target gas, to perform the measurement and then to measure another target gas. After measuring all the target gases, the concentration is reported to the host system and/or presented on the GUI (graphical user interface) of the processing unit (<b>20</b>) that displays the information, controls the measurement sequence and sets the receiver subsystem (<b>30</b>) to the specific gas parameters.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0131">Signals from the gas analysis subsystem (<b>40</b>) are delivered to the optical frontend (<b>32</b>) of the receiver subsystem (<b>30</b>) via the optical fibres (<b>60</b> and <b>70</b>). In the optical frontend (<b>32</b>), each of the combined light beam is delivered to a monochromator (<b>321</b>, <b>322</b>) to select only the wavelength which is relevant to the specific target gas from the gas sample that is being measured at that time. The monochromators (<b>321</b>, <b>322</b>) are based, for example, on a rotated grating or on acousto-optic tuneable filter. In both cases, the monochromators are controlled by the electronic processing unit (<b>20</b>) to pass only a specific wavelength and block all other wavelengths. The monochromator (<b>321</b>, <b>322</b>) is selected according to the spectral bands of interest as noted above. For example, Stokes lines generated by pumping at 532 nm or anti-Stokes lines generated by pumping at 1064 nm. It must have a wide dynamic range because the gas concentration is in a small difference range between the output of the second hollow core optical fibre and the reference. The spectral resolution must correspond to the minimal spectral difference of the target Raman signals, which is normally approximately 1 nm. In this embodiment, each beam is filtered via its dedicated monochromator. In other embodiments, the beam can be alternatively merged, so that each pulse will arrive at a different timing, and a single monochromator for this single beam will be used then.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0132">In most cases, the intensity of Raman signals generated in the first fibre (<b>420</b>) is too high to be detected by a standard silicon photodiode. Controlled optical attenuators (<b>323</b>, <b>324</b>) are therefore used to adjust the Raman signal intensity and ensure that the photodiodes (<b>326</b>, <b>327</b>) will not become saturated. The wavelength attenuation is pre-calibrated, wherein for each measured target gas in the gas sample, a specific attenuation is configured by the electronic processing unit (<b>20</b>). A configurable optical delay line (<b>325</b>) is used to align the timing of the two pulses, so that the pulses are arrived at the photodiodes (<b>326</b>, <b>327</b>) at the same time with the accuracy below 10 picoseconds. A pair of the high-speed silicon photodiodes (<b>326</b>, <b>327</b>) is used to capture the laser pulses and convert them to electronics signals.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0133">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, two signals are introduced to the analogue frontend (<b>34</b>). As explained above (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and the accompanied description), the SRG is a very tiny signal &#x201c;sitting&#x201d; on a very strong Raman signal. In order to achieve the sufficient resolution of the SRG, a high-speed high-resolution Analog-to-Digital Convertor (ADC), such as 5-GHz 14-bits ADC, is used. This is the most straightforward solution that may fit certain applications. However, at low gas concentrations, this resolution may not be enough, not to mention that it is a very expensive solution. Therefore, in some embodiments, the SRG is extracted and amplified using an analogue processor (<b>342</b>). At first stage of the analogue processing, the two signals are amplified. Then, using a high frequency operational amplifier, the SRG is extracted and amplified as explained above, i.e. by subtracting the reference signal from the amplified Raman signal. An automatic gain control (AGC) block (<b>344</b>) is used to optimise (amplify or attenuate) the SRG amplitude to the ADC resolution.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0134">The amplified SRG in combined with the reference signal at different timing to a signal that continues two pulses, one is the SRG and the second is the generated Raman signal, both signals are required in order to calculate the concentration. These signals are converted to digital samples using a high-speed ADC (<b>361</b>) (typically 5 GHz, 8/10 bit). In addition, the analogue frontend (<b>34</b>) generates a trigger for the digital receiver (<b>36</b>) by generating a digital transistor-transistor logic (TTL) signal out of the reference signal (<b>346</b>). This trigger is required to indicate to the digital receiver (<b>36</b>) that the samples follow the trigger containing the amplified Raman data. This is because most of the samples acquired by the ADC are not relevant, since the duty-cycle of the signal is very low, which is only a few dozens of samples out of the millions of samples containing the relevant information. This mechanism turns the receiver subsystem (<b>30</b>) into an asynchronous subsystem suitable for handling signals with high timing jitter and without the need for an external trigger. It also enables the use of the passive Q-switch as a laser source, which is much simpler and cheaper that the active Q-switch.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0135">As described above, the interaction of the high-power pump pulse with the gas in the hollow-core fibre generates the SRS phenomenon. However, additional quantum optics phenomena occur during the propagation of the pump pulse along the hollow-core fibre and generate additional optical signals, for example fluorescence signals. These optical signals are considered a noise in the system. The nature of the Raman phenomenon as well as the SRS is that this is an instantaneous phenomenon while the other phenomena are relatively slower (in the order of 5-500 ns). In addition to the optical noise, there is electronics noise in various frequencies. In low concentration, all these noises are higher than the SRG signal. A common approach to overcome this issue is to use a look-in-amplifier. However, the signals generated by the passive Q-switch have a very low duty-cycle and high jitter, and therefore, this method is impractical. Using a time-gated receiver, in which only the specific samples that contain the relevant information are selected and all the other samples with the noise are discarded, makes it possible to overcome this significant issue.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0136">A hardware-based digital receiver (<b>36</b>), for example a FPGA (field-programmable gate array), can be attached to the high-speed ADC (<b>361</b>) to implement the time-gated receiver and to store the high-frequency information. All the samples from the ADC (<b>361</b>) are temporary stored in the digital receiver (<b>36</b>) comprising the digital receiver logic (<b>362</b>) configured to receive a trigger from the analogue frontend (<b>346</b>) that indicates the SRS event, and an output buffer (<b>363</b>) configured to select and store a predefined number of samples with the relevant information. When the digital receiver (<b>36</b>) stores a predefined SRS events, which is typically 256 to 1024 bit, it indicates to the electronic processing unit (<b>20</b>) that the SRS data is ready in the output buffer (<b>363</b>) and this data is copied to the electronic processing unit (<b>20</b>) for further processing.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0137">The data processing software (SW) block (<b>381</b>) of the electronic processing unit (<b>20</b>) reads the SRS data received from the output buffer (<b>363</b>) and runs the signal-to-noise ratio improvement algorithms on the received SRS data, thereby generating the readable SRG value of a specific target gas. The concentration calculation SW block (<b>383</b>) is used for normalising the SRG values using the known amplification and attenuation parameters processed in the optical frontend (<b>32</b>) and in the analogue frontend (<b>34</b>), as well as for measuring the reference signal.

In this embodiment, the molecular gas analysis subsystem (<b>40</b>) allows to improve the detection limit, to increase the number of target gases and to reduce the cross-spectral interference between the gases which have very close Raman shifts (in comparison to the separation limit of the spectral separation devices (<b>321</b>, <b>322</b>) of choice).

These generator optical fibres (<b>420</b> and <b>425</b>) are prefilled with different target gases with high concentration, where the gases having similar Raman shifts are fed into different fibres (<b>420</b> and <b>425</b>). Since hollow-core optical fibres are polarisation maintaining, each one of the generator optical fibres (<b>420</b> and <b>425</b>) emits polarised light (the SSRS light is emitted with the same polarisation of its pump), the relative polarisation of the two output light beams can be adjusted by carefully positioning the ends of the fibres. Polarisation beam combiner (<b>475</b>) combines the output of the generator fibres (<b>420</b> and <b>425</b>) into a single beam and allows coupling of this beam into the second hollow-core optical fibre (<b>450</b>) through the interface (<b>430</b>) as described in detail above.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0147">The second hollow-core optical fibre (<b>450</b>) can contain all the target gases, even those with similar Raman shifts. As mentioned above, since these optical fibres are polarisation maintaining and the SRS occurs when the interacting beams are with the same polarisation, cross interference between gases with similar Raman shift is avoided, and orthogonal polarisations contain optical information about different gases.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0148">Output polarisation beam splitter (<b>478</b>) separates the two polarisations, and they are coupled into two different fibres (<b>70</b> and <b>75</b>) transmitted to the receiver subsystem (<b>30</b>) for spectral analysis. These two different beams having different polarisation are analysed separately in different time domain. The above description makes use of polarisation in order to allow simultaneous detection of all target gases in the gas sample. Similar design of the molecular gas analysis subsystem (<b>40</b>) can use more than a single generator fibre intermittently using optical MUXs without special polarisation arrangements.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0149">Thus, the SRS spectrometer of the present invention comprises the two major subsystems, which can be placed remotely from each other. The molecular gas analysis subsystem (<b>40</b>) is placed in close proximity to the measuring point of the gas sample, while the receiver subsystem (<b>30</b>) together with the laser source (<b>10</b>) are placed in a safe environment. In most cases, the measuring point is located outdoor, and frequently the outdoor environment is explosive and/or hazardous. The receiver subsystem (<b>30</b>) and the laser source (<b>10</b>) are optoelectrical subsystems which are very sensitive to the environment conditions (temperature, humidity etc.) Therefore, it is preferable to place the receiver subsystem (<b>30</b>) together with the laser source (<b>10</b>) in the protected environment, such as a control room or a closed shelter. It is possible to place the receiver and the laser near the measurement point, but it will be very complicated and expensive to add all the required protection means, such as an anti-explosive enclosure and temperature regulation mechanism. On the other hand, in many cases it is not possible and/or very complicated to deliver the gas sample to protected environment, since the sample can be a flow of an explosive and/or hazardous gas. Also, in some cases, the composition of the sample gas changes when the gas flows through a long sampling pipe, resulting in inaccurate measurements.</p><p id="p-0103" num="0150">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> showing the SRS spectrometer of the present invention according to a third embodiment.

A regular high-power fibre cannot maintain the polarisation of the beam necessary for the SSRS spectroscopy. Also, since the pulse intensity in the fibre is very high (above 5 MW/cm<sup>2</sup>), the regular high-power fibre will be damaged by such high intensity. Consequently, only the special optical power delivery fibre can be used, such as a hollow-core fibre. However, these fibres are expensive and do not fit for remote operation over long distances.</p><p id="p-0104" num="0151">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the third embodiment therefore presents a different solution to maintain the separation of the SRS spectrometer of the present invention into the two subsystems obviating the need for the special optical power delivery fibre. In the third embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the laser source (<b>10</b>) is separated into two parts. The single high-power laser (<b>15</b>) comprising the laser driver and controller (<b>11</b>) and the high-power laser source (<b>12</b>) (typically a 808-nm high-power multi-emitter laser diode) is placed in a safe environment, because it contains high-power and sensitive electronic elements.

This configuration fits laboratories or can be used for analysis of non-explosive gases, such as flue gas emitted into the atmosphere that needs to be monitored for environmental protection. In such spectrometer, the laser source (<b>10</b>) is attached to the molecular gas analysis subsystem (<b>40</b>) and the laser beam is delivered in free space, thereby simplifying the entire laser delivery system.</p><p id="p-0107" num="0154">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a gas sample delivery subsystem (<b>90</b>) is added to enable continuous monitoring of the process. The gas sample delivery subsystem (<b>90</b>) comprises valves, pumps, pressure regulators and filters (<b>902</b>, <b>904</b>). In some cases, an optional sample preparation module (<b>905</b>) is also included. The sample preparation, which includes heating to a specific temperature and drying of the sample, is crucial for IR-based spectrometers, such as FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) or NDIR GFC (Non-Dispersive Infrared Gas Filter Correlation), since measurements with these spectrometers are very sensitive to the sample conditions. While this sample preparation is complicated and expensive, the SRS spectrometer of the present invention is not sensitive to the sample conditions, which considerably simplifies the measurements. In the case of high humidity, such as power plant emission, a partial drying of the gas sample may be required though. In that case, the sample preparation module (<b>905</b>) may be added in a form of a microfluidic drying module saving significant cost on handling gas samples with sample volumes in the range of microliters.</p><p id="p-0108" num="0155">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> showing the SRS spectrometer of the present invention according to a fifth embodiment. In this embodiment, the reference signal at the entrance to the second fibre (<b>450</b>) is not measured, thus simplifying the entire optical system. The second optical interface (<b>430</b>) in the molecular gas analysis subsystem (<b>40</b>) does not include a sampling function, and the beam from the first fibre (<b>420</b>) is delivered to the second fibre (<b>450</b>) as is. The fibre (<b>60</b>) that delivers the reference signal to the receiver subsystem (<b>30</b>) in the above configurations is not required here. The optical frontend (<b>32</b>) of the receiver subsystem (<b>30</b>) therefore includes only one optical processing path vs two parallel processing paths in the above configurations. However, the significant simplicity and cost saving on the optical side of the SRS spectrometer of the present embodiment requires a more complex analogue frontend (<b>34</b>) and a more complex digital receiver (<b>36</b>).</p><p id="p-0109" num="0156">In order to extract the SRG of each gas in the gas sample, the power of the Raman signal must be used. In the first configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), the power of the Raman signal is calculated from the reference signal sample. However, in the present case (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>), it is &#x201c;artificially&#x201d; generated for each gas by the receiver subsystem (<b>30</b>) as follows. A reference gas, which is an additional gas that is not present in the gas sample, is added to the first fibre (<b>420</b>), after which a Raman signal of this reference gas is generated in the first fibre (<b>420</b>). The power or intensity of this Raman signal does not change in the second fibre (<b>450</b>).</p><p id="p-0110" num="0157">The receiver subsystem (<b>30</b>) measures the power of this signal frequently as this power can indicate of any changes in other Raman signals generated in the first fibre (<b>420</b>). The ratio between this reference gas signal and the Raman signals of each target gas in the sample is constant and can be measured during system calibration process and stored in the electronic processing unit (<b>20</b>). The reference signal power for each gas in the gas sample is then calculated from the reference gas Raman signal and ratio stored in the electronic processing unit (<b>20</b>).</p><p id="p-0111" num="0158">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, an additional block (<b>348</b>) is added to the analogue frontend (<b>34</b>) of the present configuration. This block (<b>348</b>) includes DAC for each gas in the sample and a software for the DAC to generate an analogue signal with the power of the corresponding reference signal. A radio-frequency (RF) mixer is used to generate a pulse at the timing of the Raman amplified signal with the power of the reference signal. From this point on, the receiver processing chain continues as described in the first embodiment.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0159">The SRS spectrometer of the present invention can be used for real-time, high-resolution, on-site gas analysis for many applications in all segments of the process industry, such as oil and gas, renewable energy, chemicals, semiconductors, food and more. However, each specific application must be tuned to a set of target gases within the predefined (expected) concentration range. The process of tuning the SRS spectrometer for each specific application includes setting the following parameters: the pump laser power, the length of the two hollow-core fibres (<b>420</b> and <b>450</b>), and the predefined concentration of each gas in the first fibre (<b>420</b>). For a given laser power and fibre length, the concentration of each gas in the first fibre (<b>420</b>) must be determined according to the expected concentration of the same target gas and according to the Raman cross section of that gas in the gas sample in the second fibre (<b>450</b>). In a typical gas with a typical Raman cross-section and an expected concentration of 10-5000 ppm, the gas concentration in the first fibre (<b>420</b>) should be set so that the generated Raman signal is between 100 mW and 1 W at the output from the first fibre (<b>420</b>).</p><p id="p-0113" num="0160">The dynamic range of the receiver subsystem (<b>30</b>) is very wide and can be calibrated to detect a wide range of concentrations over a wide range of Raman signal powers. If the concentration of the target gas in the gas sample is expected to be very low and the gas has a relatively large Raman cross-section, such as pentane in natural gas, a large SRS amplification is required, and this gas concentration in the first fibre (<b>420</b>) must therefore be high. If the concentration of the target gas in the gas sample is expected to be low and the gas has a small Raman cross-section, such as carbon dioxide, the concentration of this gas in the first fibre (<b>420</b>) can be kept moderate. In a special case where the concentration of the target gas in the gas sample is expected to be very high, such as methane in natural gas, the first fibre (<b>420</b>) is not prefilled with this gas at all, and the concentration of this gas is measured based on the Raman signal of this gas generated in the second fibre (<b>450</b>), which is based on the SSRS phenomenon. Calibrating such a gas would be a special case because the Raman versus concentration curve for this gas is not linear. In case there is a wide variety of target gases and concentrations in the gas sample, the pump laser power, which is constant in the fifth configuration described above, can be electronically controlled and adjusted for each target gas, thereby increasing the dynamic range of the SRS spectrometer.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0161">In case the expected target gas composition contains a very wide concentration range that cannot be achieved by setting the target gas concentration in the first fibre (<b>420</b>), dynamic control of the pump laser can be used to increase the flexibility of the system. This is done using a set of optical manipulators (<b>403</b>) in the laser source subsystem (<b>10</b>). For example, if the expected concentration of one of the target gases in a gas sample is very low (1-10 ppm) when measuring that gas, the pump laser power can be increased to generate high pump power and high-power Raman signal in the first fibre (<b>420</b>). The increased power of these two lasers increases the sensitivity and improves the detection limit of the system.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0162">In some cases where a very high-resolution measurement for a specific gas is required, the acquisition time for that gas can be increased by defining larger blocks of repeated SRG samples of that specific gas stored in the digital receiver (<b>36</b>). A large number of repetitive samples provides an improved signal-to-noise ratio and better measurement resolution.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0163">As described above, the measured SRG of each gas is proportional to the concentration of that gas in the gas sample. The measured SRG is the electronic amplitude that must be normalised to optical power using dynamic parameters such as gain and attenuation recorded via the optical interface (<b>32</b>) and analogue interface (<b>34</b>), as well as constant parameters such as the conversion curve of the photodiode.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0164">When the gas concentration in the sample is low (for example, the gas concentration in the second fibre), the relationship between the gas concentration and the measured SRG can be described by the following equation:</p><p id="p-0118" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00002" num="00002"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <mi>SRG</mi>  <mo>=</mo>  <mrow>   <mi>C</mi>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mfrac>    <msub>     <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>     <mi>p</mi>    </msub>    <msub>     <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>     <mi>s</mi>    </msub>   </mfrac>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <msub>    <mi>&#x3c3;</mi>    <mi>R</mi>   </msub>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <msub>    <mi>P</mi>    <mi>p</mi>   </msub>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <msub>    <mi>P</mi>    <mi>s</mi>   </msub>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <mfrac>    <mi>Z</mi>    <mi>A</mi>   </mfrac>   <mo>&#x2062;</mo>   <msub>    <mi>X</mi>    <mi>n</mi>   </msub>  </mrow> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0119" num="0000">where C is the target gas concentration;</p><p id="p-0120" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00003" num="00003"><math overflow="scroll"> <mfrac>  <msub>   <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>   <mi>p</mi>  </msub>  <msub>   <mi>&#x3c9;</mi>   <mi>s</mi>  </msub> </mfrac></math></maths></p><p id="p-0121" num="0000">is the ratio between the pump frequency and the Raman signal frequency of the target gas,<ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0013" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0013-0001" num="0165">&#x3c3;<sub>R </sub>is the normalized Raman cross-section of the target gas,</li>        <li id="ul0013-0002" num="0166">P<sub>p </sub>is the pump power in the second fibre (<b>450</b>),</li>        <li id="ul0013-0003" num="0167">P<sub>s </sub>is the Raman power in the second fibre (<b>450</b>),</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0122" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00004" num="00004"><math overflow="scroll"> <mfrac>  <mi>Z</mi>  <mi>A</mi> </mfrac></math></maths></p><p id="p-0123" num="0000">is the fibre length divided by the fibre cross-sectional area, and<ul id="ul0014" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0015" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0015-0001" num="0168">X<sub>n </sub>are the system parameters, i.e., physical constants and parameters that can be defined and measured, such as pressure or temperature.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0124" num="0169">Using the above equation, the concentration of the target gas is calculated.
