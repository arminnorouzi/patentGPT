Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">The technical field of the invention is that of methods for pairing between a sensor and a concentrator in an on-board environment and more particularly that of methods for pairing between a sensor and a concentrator that are remote in an on-board environment and of which the data coming from the sensor has to have integrity and the origin guaranteed.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a method for pairing between an on-board sensor and a concentrator and in particular a method for pairing between an on-board and remote sensor and concentrator. The present invention also relates to a sensor, a concentrator and a mobile terminal making it possible to implement the method for pairing.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNOLOGICAL BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order fora concentrator, that has for role to collect in a centralised manner data coming from different sensors, to be able to collect information of which the origin and the integrity have to be guaranteed with a given sensor, a reciprocal recognition phase called pairing is indispensable.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">When the concentrator and the sensor are on board a device such as an aircraft or a car, it is common that the sensor is located in a highly restrictive environment. The concentrator is placed at a distance from the sensor in a less restrictive environment.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the case of replacing or mounting a sensor, the pairing is carried out in an operational environment, i.e. when the sensor and the concentrator are on board the device. Recourse to an NFC (Near Field Communication) component cannot therefore be considered since the distance between the sensor and the concentrator, from about a metre to several metres in the operational environment, is too substantial and cannot be reduced to a few centimetres (as the concentrator cannot be moved). Likewise, solutions that have recourse to data transport via light beams (IrDA technology for &#x201c;Infrared Data Association&#x201d;, such as for example infrared connections) cannot be used because obstacles are present between the sensor and the concentrator.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">[FIF. <b>1</b>] Pairing in an operational environment is conventionally carried out by a method <b>10</b> of which the chaining of the steps is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The method <b>10</b> is implemented by an operator located in the vicinity of the sensor <b>202</b> and provided with a human-machine interface <b>204</b> capable of communicating with the concentrator <b>201</b> via a communication mode such as Wi-Fi, 3G or 4G. During a first step <b>11</b>, the operator presses a button to place the sensor <b>202</b> in pairing mode. During a second step <b>12</b>, the sensor <b>202</b> emits a pairing request, a light-emitting diode <b>2020</b> of the sensor <b>202</b> blinks to indicate that it is in pairing mode. During a third step <b>13</b>, the concentrator <b>201</b>, in a continuous listening mode, receives the pairing request, carries out the pairing and sends a pairing confirmation to the sensor <b>201</b>. During a fourth step <b>14</b>, the concentrator <b>201</b> sends a pairing confirmation notification to the operator via the human-machine interface <b>204</b>. The operator optionally provides data concerning the sensor <b>202</b> to the concentrator <b>201</b>. The concentrator <b>201</b> and the sensor <b>202</b> are then paired. During a fifth step <b>15</b>, the concentrator <b>201</b> and the sensor <b>202</b> exchange data.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to this method, there is no guarantee that the concentrator has been paired with the correct sensor and inversely, for example, the sensor <b>202</b> is paired with another concentrator. This case can be of an unintentional origin during a pairing phase of two different devices. This method is also vulnerable to an attack of the &#x201c;man in the middle&#x201d; type which has for consequence to no longer guarantee the integrity of the operational device since the authenticity of the sensor or of the concentrator is no longer guaranteed. In this international context, a malicious actor from the sensor <b>202</b> standpoint, usurps the identity of the concentrator <b>201</b>, and/or from a concentrator <b>201</b> standpoint usurps the identity of the sensor <b>202</b>. The data exchanged between the sensor <b>202</b> and the concentrator <b>201</b> once the pairing is carried out is intercepted and modified by a third party and is then no longer confidential and has lost its integrity.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is therefore a need for a method of secure pairing between an on-board and remote sensor and concentrator, carried out in an operational environment.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention offers a solution to the problems mentioned hereinabove, by making it possible to pair in an operational environment an on-board sensor and concentrator separated from one another, guaranteeing the integrity of the data exchanged.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A first aspect of the invention relates to a method for secure pairing between a sensor and a concentrator, the concentrator and the sensor being on-board and remote, the sensor comprising at least one light-emitting diode, the method being implemented using a mobile terminal configured to communicate with the concentrator via a secure channel, and comprises the following steps:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0011">Putting the concentrator into pairing mode and emitting by the concentrator, of a so public concentrator key;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0012">Putting the sensor into pairing mode and emitting by the sensor, of a pairing request comprising pairing information encrypted with the public concentrator key, and a public sensor key;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0013">Generating, by the concentrator, of a confirmation code and emitting of a pairing request confirmation comprising confirmed pairing information and the generated confirmation code, the pairing request confirmation being encrypted with the public sensor key;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0014">Converting by the sensor, of the confirmation code received into a sequence of light signals and execution of the sequence of light signals by the light-emitting diode;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0015">Converting by the mobile terminal, of the sequence of light signals executed into a sequence of light signals confirmation code;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0016">Sending by the mobile terminal via the secure channel, of the sequence of light signals confirmation code to the concentrator;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0017">Comparing, by means of the concentrator, the sequence of light signals confirmation code and the generated confirmation code:        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0018">Deactivating of the confirmation code by the concentrator and:            <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">                <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0019">If the sequence of light signals confirmation code does not match the generated confirmation code, generating a warning via the mobile terminal and deleting by the concentrator of the pairing information;</li>                <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0020">If the sequence of light signals confirmation code matches the generated confirmation code, pairing of the sensor and of the concentrator using pairing information and exchanging information between the sensor and the concentrator.</li>            </ul>            </li>        </ul>        </li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0012" num="0021">Thanks to the invention, using a confirmation code transmitted first from the concentrator to the sensor then from the sensor to the concentrator makes it possible via comparison with the confirmation code stored in the concentrator to detect a non-compliant pairing operation, whether caused by fraud or an involuntary error, such as for example a pairing attempt with an incorrect sensor. Generating a warning makes it possible to inform the operator carrying out the pairing operation of the failure of the pairing operation.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0022">The confirmation code being transmitted from the sensor to the concentrator via a mobile terminal communicating with the concentrator via a secure channel makes it possible to secure the transmission of the confirmation code from the mobile terminal to the concentrator and using a sequence of light signals to communicate the confirmation code from the sensor to the mobile terminal makes it possible to secure the transmission of the confirmation code from the sensor to the mobile terminal since, in order to acquire or enter the sequence of light signals, a malicious person has to be in the vicinity of the sensor and therefore of the operator. A malicious person therefore cannot at a distance intercept the confirmation code during the transmission thereof from the sensor to the concentrator and usurping the identity of the sensor or of the concentrator by intercepting the confirmation code during the transmission thereof from the concentrator to the sensor is not possible since if no confirmation code or if a modified confirmation code is sent to the concentrator, the pairing will not take place.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0023">Encrypting the data exchanged between the sensor and the concentrator before pairing makes it possible to secure the data exchanges before pairing.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0024">In addition to the characteristics that have just been mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the method according to the first aspect of the invention can have one or more additional characteristics among the following, taken individually or in any technically permissible combination.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0025">According to an embodiment, the mobile terminal communicates with the concentrator via a short-range communication mode.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0026">Thus, a malicious person would have to be in the vicinity of the concentrator and of the mobile terminal in order to intercept the communications between the mobile terminal and the concentrator.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0027">According to an embodiment compatible with the preceding embodiment, putting the concentrator into pairing mode is carried out by an operator via the mobile terminal.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0028">Thus, the operator located in the vicinity of the sensor can put the concentrator into pairing mode at a distance from the concentrator.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0029">According to an embodiment compatible with the preceding embodiments, putting the sensor into pairing mode is carried out by an operator by pressing a pairing button of the sensor.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0030">Thus, the operator located in the vicinity of the sensor can easily put the sensor into pairing mode.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0031">According to an embodiment compatible with the preceding embodiments, the pairing request is emitted in a loop in the form of radiofrequency frames by the sensor.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0032">Thus, the chances of the concentrator receiving the pairing request are maximised with respect to a single send.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0033">According to an embodiment compatible with the preceding embodiments, the pairing request confirmation further comprises a shared key and the information exchanged between the sensor and the concentrator is encrypted with the shared key once the sensor and the concentrator are paired.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0034">Thus, the data exchanges between the paired sensor and the concentrator are secure and a procedure for defining keys for the exchanges of keys after pairing is avoided.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0035">According to an embodiment compatible with the preceding embodiments, the confirmation code is randomly generated by the concentrator.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0036">Thus, the concentrator does not store beforehand a list of useable confirmation codes that can be obtained by a malicious person.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0037">According to an embodiment compatible with the preceding embodiments, the sequence of light signals emitted by the light-emitting diode comprises light signals of different wavelengths.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0038">Thus, each light-emitting diode of the sensor can use a larger number of sequences of light signals.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0039">According to a first embodiment compatible with the preceding embodiments, converting the sequence of light signals executed into a sequence of light signals confirmation code comprises entering by an operator, of the sequence of light signals via a human-machine interface of the mobile terminal and converting by the mobile terminal of the sequence of light signals entered into a sequence of light signals confirmation code.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0040">Thus, the mobile terminal can be devoid of a camera and the operator can verify and/or modify the sequence of light signals entered.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0041">According to a second embodiment compatible with the preceding embodiments, converting the sequence of light signals executed into a sequence of light signals confirmation code comprises acquiring the sequence of light signals by a camera of the mobile terminal and converting by the mobile terminal of the sequence of light signals acquired into a sequence of light signals confirmation code.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0042">Thus, acquiring the sequence of light signals is not subject to human errors contrary to the first embodiment, but the operator cannot verify and/or modify the sequence of light signals acquired.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0043">According to an embodiment compatible with the preceding embodiments, the method of the invention further comprises a step of sending, from the mobile terminal to the concentrator via the secure channel, data entered by an operator via a human-machine interface of the mobile terminal, the data entered being deleted by the concentrator if the sequence of light signals confirmation code does not match the generated confirmation code and used for the pairing and retained by the concentrator if the sequence of light signals confirmation code matches the generated confirmation code.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0044">Thus, if the pairing requires data to be entered by an operator, this data is supplied to the concentrator in a secure way.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0045">According to an embodiment compatible with the preceding embodiments, the method of the invention further comprises a step of sending, from the concentrator to the mobile terminal via the secure channel, a pairing confirmation.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0046">Thus, operator is informed of the success of the pairing operation.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0047">A second aspect of the invention relates to a mobile terminal for the implementation of the method according to the first aspect of the invention comprising a human-machine interface and being configured to:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001"

configured to implement the steps of the first embodiment of the method of the invention implemented by or via the mobile terminal.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0053">According to an embodiment, the mobile

invention relates to a method for secure pairing between an on-board sensor and concentrator that are distant from one another.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0083">The term &#x201c;pairing between two devices&#x201d; means the reciprocal recognition phase between the two devices, required so that the data can, once the pairing is carried out, be exchanged with integrity and with a guarantee of origin between the two devices. Pairing comprises for example the exchanging of encryption keys that will be used to encrypt the data exchanged once the pairing is carried out, or the exchanging of information concerning the type of data that will be exchanged once the pairing is carried out.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0084">Thus, in the context of the invention, if the sensor is a pressure sensor, the concentrator is informed that the data that will be transmitted by the sensor will be pressure data, not, for example, temperature data, and the concentrator can then consequently adapt the data processing.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0085">The term &#x201c;concentrator&#x201d; means a device configured to collect data coming from a plurality of other devices, such as sensors, and manage the collected data.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0086">The concentrator comprises a memory that allows it to store data and a processor that allows it to perform calculations.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0087">The sensor comprises at least one light-emitting diode.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0088">Each light-emitting diode can for example emit a light signal at different wavelengths. Thus, a light-emitting diode is for example capable of emitting a green light signal and a red light signal.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0089">A light-emitting diode is for example capable of emitting in each colour of the visible range, for example in each colour of the rainbow.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0090">A light-emitting diode is for example capable of emitting a light signal in a wavelength that does not belong to the visible range, for example in the infrared range.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0091">The sensor is for example a pressure sensor, a temperature sensor, a light sensor or an acoustic sensor.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0092">In the context of the invention, &#x201c; the sensor and the concentrator are remote&#x201d; means that the distance that separates the sensor and the concentrator is such that a malicious person can position themselves between the sensor and the concentrator without being seen from the location of the sensor. The distance that separates the sensor and the concentrator is for example greater than about ten metres.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0093">The sensor and the concentrator are both devoid of a human-machine interface.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0094">The term &#x201c; human-machine interface&#x201d; means an interface that allows for two-way interaction between a device equipped with the human-machine interface and an operator. According to this definition, a button is not a human-machine interface since a button does not allow the device equipped with the button to interact with an operator and since no information is sent by the button.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0095">The sensor and the concentrator are on board a device that is, for example, a vehicle and more particularly an aircraft.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a diagrammatical representation of the case where the concentrator <b>201</b> and the sensor <b>202</b> are on board an aircraft <b>300</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0097">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the aircraft <b>300</b> has on board a concentrator <b>201</b> and a plurality of sensors <b>202</b>. The concentrator <b>201</b> is located inside the aircraft <b>300</b> while each sensor <b>202</b> is located at a wheel of a landing gear. The sensors <b>202</b> are for example pressure sensors giving the pressure of the wheel on which they are mounted. A given sensor <b>202</b> is then separated by several metres from the concentrator <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0098">The method of the invention is implemented using a mobile terminal <b>203</b>, playing the role of a trusted entity, communicating with the concentrator <b>201</b> via a secure channel <b>205</b>.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0099">The term &#x201c;secure channel&#x201d; means a channel allowing for the transmission of a flow of data that is encrypted, authenticated and that has integrity.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0100">The secure channel <b>205</b> uses for example a security protocol based on TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), for example a VPN (Virtual Private Network) of the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) type or an application flow of the HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) type.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0101">The mobile terminal <b>203</b> comprises a human-machine interface <b>203</b> that allows for keying data and reading data.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0102">The mobile terminal <b>203</b> is for example a smartphone or a tablet.

The public concentrator key is for example emitted by radiofrequency.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0110">The term &#x201c;public key&#x201d; means a cryptographic key used for encrypting data in the technique of asymmetric cryptographic encryption. For a given entity, a public key is coupled with a private key used for the decrypting of data encrypted with the public key. The public key can be transmitted without restriction while the private key is secret, i.e. the private key is known only to the entity.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0111">The public concentrator key is then the public key used by the concentrator <b>201</b> to encrypt the data sent before the pairing. The public concentrator key is coupled to a private concentrator key that is known solely by the concentrator <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0112">A second step of the method <b>100</b> comprises a first substep <b>102</b>-<b>1</b> implemented by an operator, consisting of placing the sensor <b>202</b> in pairing mode.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0113">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, putting the sensor into pairing mode <b>202</b> can be carried out by an operator pressing a pairing button of the sensor <b>202</b>.

The public sensor key is coupled to a private sensor key known only by the sensor <b>202</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0119">Emitting the pairing request is for example carried out in a loop and in the form of radiofrequency frames.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0120">A third step <b>103</b> of the method <b>100</b> is implemented by the concentrator <b>201</b> upon reception of the pairing request emitted by the sensor <b>202</b> during the second substep <b>102</b>-<b>2</b> of the second step of the method <b>100</b>, the pairing information having been decrypted using the private concentrator key.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0121">The pairing information is stored in the memory of the concentrator <b>201</b>.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0122">The third step <b>103</b> of the method <b>100</b> consists of generating a confirmation code and of emitting a pairing request confirmation.
