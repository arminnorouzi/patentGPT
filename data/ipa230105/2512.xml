Substituents include neutral, anionic and/or cationic functional groups.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Known cyclodextrin derivatives such as alkylated cyclodextrins include, but are not limited to, sulfoalkyl ether cyclodextrins, alkyl ether cyclodextrins (e.g., methyl, ethyl and propyl ether cyclodextrins), hydroxyalkyl cyclodextrins, thioalkyl ether cyclodextrins, carboxylated cyclodextrins (e.g., succinyl-&#x3b2;-cyclodextrin, and the like), sulfated cyclodextrins, and the like. Alkylated cyclodextrins having more than one type of functional group are also known, such as sulfoalkyl ether-alkyl ether-cyclodextrins (see, e.g., WO 2005/042584 and US 2009/0012042, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).

For example, SAE or HAE moieties can have the same type or different type of alkylene (alkyl) radical upon each occurrence in an alkylated cyclodextrin composition. In such embodiments, the alkylene radical in the SAE or HAE moiety can be ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl or hexyl in each occurrence in an alkylated cyclodextrin composition.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0071">The alkylated cyclodextrins can differ in their degree of substitution by functional groups, the number of carbons in the functional groups, their molecular weight, the number of glucopyranose units contained in the base cyclodextrin used to form the derivatized cyclodextrin and or their substitution patterns. In addition, the derivatization of a cyclodextrin with functional groups occurs in a controlled, although not exact manner. For this reason, the degree of substitution is actually a number representing the average number of functional groups per cyclodextrin (for example, SBE<sub>7</sub>-&#x3b2;-CD has an average of 7 substitutions per cyclodextrin). Thus, it has an average degree of substitution (&#x201c;ADS&#x201d;) of 7. In addition, the regiochemistry of substitution of the hydroxyl groups of the cyclodextrin is variable with regard to the substitution of specific hydroxyl groups of the hexose ring. For this reason, substitution of the different hydroxyl groups is likely to occur during manufacture of the derivatized cyclodextrin, and a particular derivatized cyclodextrin will possess a preferential, although not exclusive or specific, substitution pattern. Given the above, the molecular weight of a particular derivatized cyclodextrin composition can vary from batch to batch.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0072">In a single parent cyclodextrin molecule, there are 3v+6 hydroxyl moieties available for derivatization. Where v=4 (&#x3b1;-cyclodextrin), &#x201c;y&#x201d; the degree of substitution for the moiety can range in value from 1 to 18. Where v=5 (&#x3b2;-cyclodextrin), &#x201c;y&#x201d; the degree of substitution for the moiety can range in value from 1 to 21. Where v=6 (&#x3b3;-cyclodextrin), &#x201c;y&#x201d; the degree of substitution for the moiety can range in value from 1 to 24. In general, &#x201c;y&#x201d; also ranges in value from 1 to 3v+g, where g ranges in value from 0 to 5. In some embodiments, &#x201c;y&#x201d; ranges from 1 to 2v+g, or from 1 to 1v+g.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0073">The degree of substitution (&#x201c;DS&#x201d;) for a specific moiety (SAE, HAE or AE, for example) is a measure of the number of SAE (HAE or AE) substituents attached to an individual cyclodextrin molecule, in other words, the moles of substituent per mole of cyclodextrin. Therefore, each substituent has its own DS for an individual alkylated cyclodextrin species. The average degree of substitution (&#x201c;ADS&#x201d;) for a substituent is a measure of the total number of substituents present per cyclodextrin molecule for the distribution of alkylated cyclodextrins within an alkylated cyclodextrin composition of the present disclosure. Therefore, SAE4-CD has an ADS (per CD molecule) of 4.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0074">Some embodiments of the present disclosure include those wherein: 1) more than half of the hydroxyl moieties of the alkylated cyclodextrin are derivatized; 2) half or less than half of the hydroxyl moieties of the alkylated cyclodextrin are derivatized; 3) the substituents of the alkylated cyclodextrin are the same upon each occurrence; 4) the substituents of the alkylated cyclodextrin comprise at least two different substituents; or 5) the substituents of the alkylated cyclodextrin comprise one or more of substituents selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted alkyl, substituted alkyl, halide (halo), haloalkyl, amine (amino), aminoalkyl, aldehyde, carbonylalkyl, nitrile, cyanoalkyl, sulfoalkyl, hydroxyalkyl, carboxyalkyl, thioalkyl, unsubstituted alkylene, substituted alkylene, aryl, arylalkyl, heteroaryl, and heteroarylalkyl.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0075">Alkylated cyclodextrin compositions can comprise plural individual alkylated cyclodextrin species differing in individual degree of substitution, such that the average degree of substitution is calculated, as described herein, from the individual degrees of substitution of the species. More specifically, a SAE-CD derivative composition can comprise plural SAE-CD species each having a specific individual degree of substitution with regard to the SAE substituent. As a consequence, the ADS for SAE of a SAE-CD derivative composition represents an average of the IDS values of the population of individual molecules in the composition. For example, a SAE<sub>5.2</sub>-CD composition comprises a distribution of plural SAE<sub>x</sub>-CD molecules, wherein &#x201c;x&#x201d; (the DS for SAE groups) can range from 1 to 10-11 for individual cyclodextrin molecules; however, the population of SAE-cyclodextrin molecules is such that the average value for &#x201c;x&#x201d; (the ADS for SAE groups) is 5.2.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0076">The alkylated cyclodextrin compositions can have a high to moderate to low ADS. The alkylated cyclodextrin compositions can also have a wide or narrow &#x201c;span,&#x201d; which is the number of individual DS species within an alkylated cyclodextrin composition. For example, a alkylated cyclodextrin composition comprising a single species of alkylated cyclodextrin having a single specified individual DS is said to have a span of one, and the individual DS of the alkylated cyclodextrin equals the ADS of its alkylated cyclodextrin composition. An electropherogram, for example, of an alkylated cyclodextrin with a span of one should have only one alkylated cyclodextrin species with respect to DS. An alkylated cyclodextrin composition having a span of two comprises two individual alkylated cyclodextrin species differing in their individual DS, and its electropherogram, for example, would indicate two different alkylated cyclodextrin species differing in DS. Likewise, the span of an alkylated cyclodextrin composition having a span of three comprises three individual alkylated cyclodextrin species differing in their individual DS. The span of an alkylated cyclodextrin composition typically ranges from 5 to 15, or 7 to 12, or 8 to 11.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0077">A parent cyclodextrin includes a secondary hydroxyl group on the C-2 and C-3 positions of the glucopyranose residues forming the cyclodextrin and a primary hydroxyl on the C-6 position of the same. Each of these hydroxyl moieties is available for derivatization by substituent precursor. Depending upon the synthetic methodology employed, the substituent moieties can be distributed randomly or in a somewhat ordered manner among the available hydroxyl positions. The regioisomerism of derivatization by the substituent can also be varied as desired. The regioisomerism of each composition is independently selected. For example, a majority of the substituents present can be located at a primary hydroxyl group or at one or both of the secondary hydroxyl groups of the parent cyclodextrin. In some embodiments, the primary distribution of substituents is C-3&#x3e;C-2&#x3e;C-6, while in other embodiments the primary distribution of substituents is C-2&#x3e;C-3&#x3e;C-6. Some embodiments of the present disclosure include an alkylated cyclodextrin molecule wherein a minority of the substituent moieties is located at the C-6 position, and a majority of the substituent moieties is located at the C-2 and/or C-3 position. Still other embodiments of the present disclosure include an alkylated cyclodextrin molecule wherein the substituent moieties are substantially evenly distributed among the C-2, C-3, and C-6 positions.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0078">An alkylated cyclodextrin composition comprises a distribution of plural individual alkylated cyclodextrin species, each species having an individual degree of substitution (&#x201c;IDS&#x201d;). The content of each of the cyclodextrin species in a particular composition can be quantified using capillary electrophoresis. The method of analysis (capillary electrophoresis, for example, for charged alkylated cyclodextrins) is sufficiently sensitive to distinguish between compositions having only 5% of one alkylated cyclodextrin and 95% of another alkylated cyclodextrin from starting alkylated cyclodextrin compositions containing.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0079">The above-mentioned variations among the individual species of alkylated cyclodextrins in a distribution can lead to changes in the complexation equilibrium constant K<sub>1:1 </sub>which in turn will affect the required molar ratios of the derivatized cyclodextrin to active agent. The equilibrium constant is also somewhat variable with temperature and allowances in the ratio are required such that the agent remains solubilized during the temperature fluctuations that can occur during manufacture, storage, transport, and use. The equilibrium constant can also vary with pH and allowances in the ratio can be required such that the agent remains solubilized during pH fluctuations that can occur during manufacture, storage, transport, and use. The equilibrium constant can also vary due the presence of other excipients (e.g., buffers, preservatives, antioxidants). Accordingly, the ratio of derivatized cyclodextrin to active agent can be varied from the ratios set forth herein in order to compensate for the above-mentioned variables.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0080">The alkylated cyclodextrins made according to a process of the present disclosure can be employed in compositions, formulations, methods and systems as such those disclosed in U.S. Pat.

In general, an underivatized cyclodextrin starting material in neutral to alkaline aqueous media is exposed to substituent precursor. The substituent precursor can be added incrementally or as a bolus, and the substituent precursor can be added before, during, or after exposure of the cyclodextrin starting material to the optionally alkaline aqueous media. Additional alkaline material or buffering material can be added as needed to maintain the pH within a desired range. The derivatization reaction can be conducted at ambient to elevated temperatures. Once derivatization has proceeded to the desired extent, the reaction is optionally quenched by addition of an acid. The reaction milieu is further processed (e.g., solvent precipitation, filtration, centrifugation, evaporation, concentration, drying, chromatography, dialysis, and/or ultrafiltration) to remove undesired materials and form the target composition. After final processing, the composition can be in the form of a solid, liquid, semi-solid, gel, syrup, paste, powder, aggregate, granule, pellet, compressed material, reconstitutable solid, suspension, glass, crystalline mass, amorphous mass, particulate, bead, emulsion, or wet mass.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0113">The disclosure provides a process of making an alkylated cyclodextrin composition comprising an alkylated cyclodextrin, optionally having a pre-determined degree of substitution, the process comprising: combining an unsubstituted cyclodextrin starting material with an alkylating agent in an amount sufficient to effect the pre-determined degree of substitution, in the presence of an alkali metal hydroxide; conducting alkylation of the cyclodextrin within a pH of 9 to 11 until residual unreacted cyclodextrin is less than 0.5% by weight, or less than 0.1%; adding additional hydroxide in an amount sufficient to achieve the degree of substitution and allowing the alkylation to proceed to completion; and adding additional hydroxide to destroy any residual alkylating agent.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0114">Adding an additional hydroxide can be conducted using a quantity of hydroxide, and under conditions (i.e., amount of additional hydroxide added, temperature, length of time during which the alkylating agent hydrolysis is conducted) such that the level of residual alkylating agent in the aqueous crude product is reduced to less than 20 ppm or less than 2 ppm.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0115">It is possible that the reaction milieu or the partially purified aqueous solution will comprise unreacted alkylating agent. The alkylating agent can be degraded in situ by adding additional alkalizing agent or by heating a solution containing the agent. Degrading an excess alkylating agent will be required where unacceptable amounts of alkylating agent are present in the reaction milieu following termination of the mixing. The alkylating agent can be degraded in situ by adding additional alkalizing agent or by heating a solution containing the agent.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0116">Degrading can be conducted by: exposing the reaction milieu to an elevated temperature of at least 60&#xb0; C., at least 65&#xb0; C., or 60&#xb0; C. to 85&#xb0; C., 60&#xb0; C. to 80&#xb0; C., or 60&#xb0; C. to 95&#xb0; C. for a period of at least 6 hours, at least 8 hours, 8 hours to 12 hours, 6 hours to 72 hours, or 48 hours to 72 hours, thereby degrading the alkylating agent in situ and reducing the amount of or eliminating the alkylating agent in the aqueous liquid.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0117">After the reaction has been conducted as described herein, the aqueous medium containing the alkylated cyclodextrin can be neutralized to a pH of 7 in order to quench the reaction. The solution can then be diluted with water in order to lower viscosity, particularly if further purification is to be conducted. Further purifications can be employed, including, but not limited to, diafiltration on an ultrafiltration unit to purge the solution of reaction by-products such as salts (e.g., NaCl if sodium hydroxide was employed as the base) and other low molecular weight by-products. The product can further be concentrated by ultrafiltration. The product solution can then be treated with activated carbon in order to improve its color, reduce bioburden, and substantially remove one or more drug degrading impurities. The product can be isolated by a suitable drying technique such as freeze drying, spray drying, or vacuum drum drying.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0118">The reaction can initially be prepared by dissolving an unsubstituted &#x3b1;-, &#x3b2;-, or &#x3b3;-cyclodextrin starting material in an aqueous solution of base, usually a hydroxide such as lithium, sodium, or potassium hydroxide. The base may be present in a catalytic amount (i.e., a molar ratio of less than 1:1 relative to the cyclodextrin), to achieve a pre-determined or desired degree of substitution. That is, the base may be present in an amount less than one molar equivalent for each hydroxyl sought to be derivatized in the cyclodextrin molecule. Because cyclodextrins become increasingly soluble in aqueous solution as the temperature is raised, the aqueous reaction mixture containing base and cyclodextrin can be raised to a temperature of 50&#xb0; C. to ensure complete dissolution. Agitation is generally employed throughout the course of the alkylation reaction.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0119">After dissolution is complete, the alkylating agent is added to start the alkylation reaction. The total amount of alkylating agent added throughout the reaction will generally be in excess of the stoichiometric amount required to complete the reaction relative to the amount of cyclodextrin, since some of the alkylating agent is hydrolyzed and/or otherwise destroyed/degraded during the reaction such that it is not available for use in the alkylation reaction. The exact amount of alkylating agent to use for a desired degree of substitution can be determined through the use of trial runs. The entire amount of alkylating agent needed to complete the reaction can be added prior to initiating the reaction. Because the system is aqueous, the reaction is generally conducted at a temperature between 50&#xb0; C. and 100&#xb0; C. The reaction can be conducted at a temperature less than 100&#xb0; C., so that specialized pressure equipment is not required. In general, a temperature of 65&#xb0; C. to 95&#xb0; C. is suitable.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0120">During the initial phase of the reaction (herein referred to as the pH-control phase), care should be taken to monitor the pH and maintain it at least basic, or in at a pH of 8 to 11. Monitoring of pH can be effected conventionally as by using a standard pH meter. Adjustment of the pH can be effected by adding an aqueous solution of hydroxide, e.g., a 10-15% solution. During the initial pH-control phase, unreacted cyclodextrin is reacted to the extent that less than 0.5% by weight, or less than 0.1% by weight, of unreacted cyclodextrin remains in solution. Substantially the entire initial charge of cyclodextrin is thus reacted by being partially substituted, but to less than the desired pre-determined degree of substitution. Residual cyclodextrin can be monitored throughout this initial phase, for example by HPLC as described below, until a desired endpoint of less than 0.5%, or less than 0.1%, of residual cyclodextrin starting material, has been achieved. The pH can be maintained and/or raised by adding concentrated hydroxide to the reaction medium continuously or in discrete amounts as small increments. Addition in small increments is particularly suitable.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0121">Once an alkylation procedure has been standardized or optimized so that it is known that particular amounts of reactants can be combined in a procedure which produces the desired degree of substitution in conjunction with low residual cyclodextrin, then the procedure can simply be checked at the end, as opposed to throughout or during the initial pH-control, to ensure that a low level of residual (unreacted) cyclodextrin starting material has been achieved. The following table sets forth a relationship between the amount of butane sultone charged into a reactor and the resulting average degree of substitution of the SAE-CD.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00005" num="00005"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="84pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="119pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry/><entry>Butane Sultone Charged</entry><entry/></row><row><entry/><entry>(Approximate equivalents</entry><entry>Corresponding Approximate</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>of BS per mole</entry><entry>Predetermined ADS</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>of cyclodextrin)</entry><entry>for SAE-CD formed</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="offset" colwidth="14pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="1" colwidth="84pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="119pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>2</entry><entry>2</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>3</entry><entry>3</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>4</entry><entry>4</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>5</entry><entry>5</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>6</entry><entry>&#x2002;&#x2009;5-5.5</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>7</entry><entry>5.5 to 6.5</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>8</entry><entry>6.5 to 7&#x2002;&#x2009;</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>9</entry><entry>7-8</entry></row><row><entry/><entry>12</entry><entry>8-9</entry></row><row><entry/><entry namest="offset" nameend="2" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0139" num="0122">It is noted that the initial pH of the reaction medium can be above 11, for example after combining the initial charge of cyclodextrin starting material and base, but prior to addition of alkylating agent. After an alkylating agent has been added and the reaction commences, however, the pH quickly drops, necessitating addition of base to maintain a basic pH of about 8 to about 11.</p><p id="p-0140" num="0123">Once the level of residual unreacted cyclodextrin has reached a desired level, e.g., below 0.5% by weight, during the pH control stage, the pH can be raised to above 11, for example a level above 12, by adding additional base to drive the reaction to completion. The pH can be at least 12 so that the reaction proceeds at a reasonable rate, but not so high that unreacted alkylating agent is hydrolyzed rapidly rather than reacting with cyclodextrin. During this latter phase of the reaction, additional substitution of the cyclodextrin molecule is effected until the pre-determined degree of substitution has been attained. The total amount of hydroxide added throughout the reaction is typically on the order of the amount stoichiometrically required plus a 10-20% molar excess relative to the amount of alkylating agent employed. The addition of more than a 10-20% excess is also feasible. The reaction end point, as noted above, can be detected by HPLC. A suitable temperature is 65&#xb0; C. to 95&#xb0; C. The HPLC system typically employs an anion exchange analytical column with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD). Elution can be by gradient using a two-solvent system, e.g., Solvent A being 25 mM (millimolar) aqueous sodium hydroxide, and Solvent B being 1 M sodium nitrate in 250 mM sodium hydroxide.</p><p id="p-0141" num="0124">Once the alkylation reaction is complete and the low residual cyclodextrin end point has been reached, additional hydroxide can be added to destroy and/or degrade any residual alkylating agent. The additional hydroxide is typically added in an amount of 0.5 to 3 molar equivalents relative to cyclodextrin, and the reaction medium is allowed to continue heating at 65&#xb0; C. to 95&#xb0; C., typically for 6 hours to 72 hours.</p><p id="p-0142" num="0125">After residual alkylating agent destruction, the resulting crude product can be additionally treated to produce a final product by being diluted, diafiltered to reduce or rid the product of low molecular weight components such as salts, concentrated, carbon treated, and dried.</p><p id="p-0143" num="0126">The pH is initially monitored to ensure that it remains at 8 to 11 as the alkyl derivatization reaction proceeds. In this initial stage, addition of a hydroxide to facilitate the alkylation can be staged or step-wise. Monitoring the pH of the reaction ensures that the reaction can be controlled such that the entire initial stock of cyclodextrin starting material is essentially reacted to the extent of effecting, on average, at least one alkyl substitution per cyclodextrin molecule. The entire cyclodextrin reactant is thus consumed at the beginning of the process, so that the level of residual (unreacted) cyclodextrin in the crude product is low, relative to the crude product produced by a process which features initially combining the entire stoichiometric or excess amount of base with cyclodextrin and alkylating agent and allowing the reaction to proceed uncontrolled. After the entire charge of cyclodextrin starting material has been partially reacted, the remaining hydroxide can be added to drive the reaction to completion by finishing the alkyl substitution to the pre-determined, desired degree. After the initial charge of cyclodextrin has been consumed in the first pH-controlled phase, the rate of hydroxide addition is not critical. Thus, the hydroxide can be added (e.g., as a solution) continuously or in discrete stages. In addition, the pH of the reaction medium should be maintained above about 12 so that the rate of reaction is commercially useful. Additional methods for making alkylated cyclodextrins are described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,751,957, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0144" num="0127">Reduction and Removal of Impurities in a Cyclodextrin Composition</p><p id="p-0145" num="0128">Initial pH control provides a means for reducing certain by-products from the reaction mixture. For example, an acid is produced as a result of the alkylation and the pH of the reaction mixture tends to decrease (i.e., become more acidic) as the reaction proceeds. On one hand, the reaction is maintained basic because if the reaction medium becomes acidic, then the reaction will slow considerably or stop. Accordingly, the pH of the reaction medium should be maintained at a level of at least 8 by adding aqueous hydroxide as needed. On the other hand, if the pH is allowed to exceed a certain level, for example, a pH greater than 12, then the reaction can produce a high level of by-products such as 4-hydroxyalkylsulfonate and bis-sulfoalkyl ether, thus consuming the alkylating agent starting material. By monitoring the pH of the reaction solution and maintaining the pH at 8 to 12, or 8 to 11, the reaction proceeds while producing a relatively low-level of by-products, and a relatively clean reaction mixture containing relatively low levels of the aforementioned by-products is provided.</p><p id="p-0146" num="0129">Reference above to a reactant being provided in an amount which is &#x201c;stoichiometrically sufficient,&#x201d; and the like, is with respect to the amount of reactant needed to fully derivatize the cyclodextrin of interest to a desired degree of substitution. As used herein, an &#x201c;alkali metal hydroxide&#x201d; refers to LiOH, NaOH, KOH, and the like. If it is desired to produce a product suitable for parenteral administration, then NaOH can be used.</p><p id="p-0147" num="0130">The degree of substitution can be controlled by using correspondingly lower or higher amounts of alkylating agent, depending upon whether a lower or higher degree of substitution is desired. Generally, the degree of substitution that can be achieved is an average of from 4.5 to 7.5, 5.5 to 7.5, or 6 to 7.1.</p><p id="p-0148" num="0131">The crude product of the process herein, i.e., the product obtained following residual alkylating agent destruction, contains a lower level of residual cyclodextrin than that produced by a process in which the base is initially added in a single charge, and is provided as a further feature of the disclosure. The crude product produced by the process of this disclosure typically contains less than 0.5% by weight residual cyclodextrin, or less than 0.1%. As explained below, the crude product is also advantageous in that it contains very low residual alkylating agent levels.</p><p id="p-0149" num="0132">Typically, the crude aqueous cyclodextrin product solution obtained following residual alkylating agent destruction is purified by ultrafiltration, a process in which the crude product is contacted with a semipermeable membrane that passes low molecular weight impurities through the membrane. The molecular weight of the impurities passed through the membrane depends on the molecular weight cut-off for the membrane. For the instant disclosure, a membrane having a molecular weight cutoff of 1,000 Daltons (&#x201c;Da&#x201d;) is typically employed. Diafiltrations and/or ultrafiltrations can be conducted with filtration membranes having a molecular weight cut-off of 500 Da to 2,000 Da, 500 Da to 1,500 Da, 750 Da to 1,250 Da, or 900 Da to 1,100 Da, or about 1,000 Da. The desired product which is in the retentate is then further treated with activated carbon to substantially remove impurities. The crude aqueous cyclodextrin product solution (i.e., obtained after residual alkylating agent destruction but before purification) is advantageous in that it contains less than 2 ppm residual alkylating agent based on the weight of the solution, less than 1 ppm, or less than 250 ppb. The crude solution can also contain essentially no residual alkylating agent.</p><p id="p-0150" num="0133">A final, commercial product can be isolated at this point by, e.g., filtration to remove the activated carbon, followed by evaporation of the water (via, e.g., distillation, spray dying, lyophilization, and the like). The final product produced by the instant disclosure advantageously contains very low residual levels of alkylating agent, e.g., less than 2 ppm based on the weight of the dry (i.e., containing less than 10% by weight water) final product, less than 1 ppm, less than 250 ppb, or essentially no residual alkylating agent. The final product containing less than 250 ppb of alkylating agent is accordingly provided as an additional feature of the disclosure. The alkylating agent is reduced following completion of the alkylation to the desired degree of substitution by an alkaline hydrolysis treatment as previously described, i.e., by adding extra hydroxide solution in an amount and under conditions sufficient to reduce the amount of unreacted alkylating agent in the dry product to the desired level below 2 ppm, less than 1 ppm, or less than 250 ppb.</p><p id="p-0151" num="0134">Activated carbon suitable for use in the process of the present disclosure can be phosphate-free, and can be powder or granular, or a suspension or slurry produced therefrom.

The artisan of ordinary skill in the art will be able to use these conventional methods to approximate the amount of each type of binding that is occurring in solution to determine whether or not binding between the species is occurring predominantly by non-covalent ionic binding or inclusion complex formation. Under conditions where non-covalent ionic bonding predominates over inclusion complex formation, the amount of inclusion complex formation, measured by NMR or circular dichroism, will be reduced even though the phase solubility data indicates significant binding between the species under those conditions; moreover, the intrinsic solubility of the acid-ionizable agent, as determined from the phase solubility data, will generally be higher than expected under those conditions.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0203">As used herein, the term &#x201c;non-covalent ionic bond&#x201d; refers to a bond formed between an anionic species and a cationic species.

An aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide is prepared by charging 61.8 kg of sodium hydroxide to 433 kg of water for a 12.5% w/w solution. The reactor contents are heated to between 40&#xb0; C. to 50&#xb0; C. before beginning the addition of 270 kg of &#x3b2;-CD over 30 to 60 minutes. The reaction temperature is adjusted to between 65&#xb0; C. to 95&#xb0; C. before the addition of 259 kg of 1,4-butane sultone over 30 to 60 minutes. Over the next 6 hours the pH of the solution is maintained above 9 using an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. Following the reaction an additional 13.5 kg of sodium hydroxide as a 20% solution is charged to the reaction.
