Performance is evaluated primarily on the basis of efficiency and reliability. To achieve good efficiency, it is necessary to have a sufficient volume of copper in order to limit Joule losses, and a short magnetic circuit to minimize iron losses. The cost of the motor is linked to the cost of the materials, but also to the production cost, and it is particularly important to propose an economical solution for producing the winding and assembling the motor and the sub-assemblies.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For the electrification of controls that were previously hydraulic or pneumatic, it is necessary to have powerful, reliable, robust and compact actuators.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Known in the state of the art is Japanese patent JP2010061957 proposing a motor equipped with a female connector forming the port for inserting a male connector.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The housing has an opening provided with a transverse groove referenced into which is inserted a projecting lug referenced provided on a terminal block referenced.

The stator, fitted with the electrical connection assembly, is overmolded with an electrically insulating resin. The housing has, in its rear part, a first angular wedging means complementary to a second angular wedging means provided at the rear part of the overmolded electrical connection assembly. The present disclosure also relates to a method for manufacturing such a motor.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0021">In order to meet the objective of robustness and taking into account the constraints of automated industrial production, the present disclosure generally results in a motor designed to allow simplified mechanical and electrical assembly of three sub-assemblies, namely a rotor, a stator block provided with the connectors and a housing, the stator block and the housing each forming a rigid one-piece block, with no moving parts liable to disturb the assembly.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0022">The stator block and the housing are designed to be complementary by a simple assembly ensuring the omnidirectional and, in particular, angular positioning and the mechanical wedging after engagement of the stator block in the housing.

A preferred embodiment is shown in the diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> with a &#x201c;parallel delta&#x201d; type connection (RB1 to RB6 symbolizing the coils of the stator).

More generally, the following characteristics for a three-phase motor with 2.N coils (6 coils, for example) are preferred:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0063">Three tracks of generally constant width, within &#xb1;10%, the width and the thickness being defined according to the electrical power required.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0064">Each of the tracks has one end forming a connecting tab (<b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>), extending toward a connection zone.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0065">The first and third tracks have an alternation of annular segments and radial protrusions, and extending over an arc of approximately 240&#xb0;.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0066">The second track has an alternation of annular segments and linking tabs that are positioned in the hollow space delimited by the radial protrusions of the first and third tracks.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0005" num="0067">Each of the tracks has one or more linking tabs for connection with a wire of an electric coil, the tabs extending in centrifugal directions.</li>        <li id="ul0004-0006" num="0068">The three tracks are temporarily connected by breakable bridges.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0059" num="0069">The next step, illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, involves folding back the radial protrusions and the linking tabs by one or more successive bending operations. In order to obtain the 2.N electrical interfaces with the coils on the outer periphery of the connection network, the linking tabs (<b>21</b> to <b>24</b>, <b>31</b> to <b>34</b>, <b>41</b> to <b>44</b>) are bent to be brought into the axial position at an angle of approximately 90&#xb0; with respect to the plane defined by the strip cut in the previous step. This simple bending step allows good control of the positioning of the linking tabs for the connection with the coil wires. The radial protrusions (<b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>47</b>, <b>48</b>) are then bent approximately 180&#xb0; inward (or outward) to thereby be folded under and into the projected surface of the power supply connection network, which avoids increasing the space requirement. This 180&#xb0; bending induces a local increase in the thickness of the connection network that is used to manage the supports (<b>60</b> to <b>65</b>), visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, intended to come onto the coil bodies during the electric welding operation: these supports provide better rigidity in compression and avoid excessive plastic volumes/thicknesses in the functional areas of the supports (contraction, shrinkage, imprecise dimensions). During overmolding, the plastic is injected into the volumes defined between the curved protrusions and the tracks to form areas for wedging the coils, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0070">Furthermore, the connecting tabs (<b>20</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>) are, in the example described, folded downward at 90&#xb0;, while the linking tabs with the wires of the coils are folded at 90&#xb0; in the opposite direction, upward.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0071">The radial protrusions (<b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>47</b>, <b>48</b>), requiring a more complex and therefore by definition less precise folding, do not comprise any connection element such as linking tabs or connecting tabs. Thus, during the bending operation of the protrusions, the positioning precision of the tabs, bent at 90&#xb0;, is not reduced by the deformation effect.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref> show a view of the stator (<b>200</b>), at least the upper part of which is overmolded.

The axial stop of the overmolded power connection network (<b>220</b>) is ensured by bringing the supports (<b>60</b> to <b>65</b>), not visible here, into contact on the upper faces (<b>93</b>, <b>94</b>) of the coil bodies (<b>91</b>). A precise, simple and robust positioning of the linking tabs (<b>22</b>, <b>31</b>) relative to the coil wires (<b>95</b>, <b>96</b>) is thus obtained in order to perform the electrical connection thereof, for example, by welding.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0077">The overmolded stator (<b>200</b>) also comprises a second signal connection network (<b>250</b>) included in the overmolding and placed in position on the first power connection network (<b>220</b>) by a set of pins and centering holes (<b>251</b>, <b>252</b>) engaging and collaborating with complementary shapes (<b>227</b>, <b>228</b>).
