comprising a lipid bilayer comprising an inner surface and an outer surface; (b) an anchor molecule embedded in the lipid bilayer; and (c) an antigen bound to the anchor molecule. Also disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, are smVLPs comprising a nanodisc comprising a synthetic, semisynthetic or natural lipid bilayer comprising an inner surface and an outer surface; an anchor molecule embedded in the lipid bilayer; and an antigen bound to the anchor molecule. Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, are vaccines comprising a seVLP or smVLP, and methods for their use and manufacturing.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">A benefit of some vaccines described herein is that they are cost-effective and safer than traditional vaccines or vaccines on the market. Some preventative viral vaccines on the market are based on inactivated or live-attenuated viruses. Formalin killed or inactivated polio, (Ipol&#xae;, Sanofi) and influenza (flu) (Afluria&#xae;, Seqiris; Fluzone&#xae;, Sanofi) vaccines are examples of inactivated viral vaccines, while the live-attenuated measles, mumps and rubella (MMR-II&#xae;, Merck) vaccines are examples of live-attenuated viral vaccines.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">I. OVERVIEW</heading><p id="p-0063" num="0062">The VLPs described herein have been developed to fill the need for providing a vaccine that is more cost-effective, safer, or faster to make than a traditional vaccine. VLPs are non-infectious particles resembling their parental viruses. In some embodiments, VLPs have antigens of their parental viruses, or have antigens that are similar to their parental viruses. In some embodiments, antigenic proteins of VLPs are produced in bacterial, yeast, insect, plant or mammalian expression systems by recombinant DNA methods. Beyond safety, another benefit of some VLPs is that they present the antigenic proteins in a structural array that are more easily recognized by pathogen associated molecular pattern recognition receptors (PAMPs) such as TLRs than other vaccines. In this way VLPs become an adjuvant to the antigenic proteins, in some embodiments. As a result, in some embodiments, VLPs are more immunogenic than individual soluble proteins of which they are composed.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">Some non-enveloped VLP vaccines include commercial vaccines for Hepatitis B (Engerix-B&#xae;, GSK) produced in yeast and HPV; Gardasil&#xae; 9, Merck; Cevarix&#xae;, GSK) produced in yeast and insect cells respectively, and these vaccines have a single protein, HBsAg of Hepatitis B virus and L1 of HPV that spontaneously form an empty icosahedral capsid shell. Some additional non-enveloped VLP vaccines include Hepatitis E virus (HEV) (Hercolinl&#xae;, Xiamen Innovax Biotech Co., China) produced in <i>E. coli, </i>Malaria (Mosquirix&#xae;, GSK) produced in insect cells, and two second generation Hepatitis B vaccines (Sci-B-Vac&#xae;, VBI Vaccines, Inc. and HEPLISAV-B&#xae;, Dynavax).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">Some VLPs are enveloped (eVLPs). eVLPs are more complex than nonenveloped VLPs in that they contain lipids derived from the expression system in which they are produced as well as one or more of the immunogenic proteins from the parental virus. These eVLPs get their lipid membrane from budding off of their host cells. For example, such eVLPs have been for HIV, Influenza, Chickungunya, SARS, Nipah, Ebola, Dengue, Rift Valley fever and Lassa virus. These eVLPs were produced in yeast, insect cells, mammalian cells and plants. But none of these eVLP vaccines have reached commercial production.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Problems have prohibited the commercial use of eVLPs and other vaccines. For example, a commercial eVLP vaccine is Inflexal&#xae;, an influenza vaccine. To produce Inflexal, influenza virus is grown in chicken eggs. Virions containing the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuroaminidase (NA) glycoproteins were solubilized with the detergent octaethylene glycol mono (n-dodecyl) ether, the nucleocapsid was removed by centrifugation, and the resulting crude undefined supernatant mixture was supplemented 10% with additional external phospholipids. These eVLPs were produced by mixing and removal of detergent. Inflexal was introduced in the European market in 1997. The cost of goods was a problem for Inflexal. In 2012 two contaminated lots of Inflexal were shipped from Switzerland to Italy, and the production of Inflexal was ended. These eVLPs contained egg derived protein and lipid contaminants, an undefined ratio of influenza HA and NA and an unknown amount of influenza M2. The mixing process and detergent removal producing eVLPs is poorly defined leading to the contamination that ended production.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">Thus, existing eVLPs have problems that limit their success. Some eVLPs are less stable than single protein capsid VLPs due to the lipid membrane. Some eVLPs are produced in lower yield in expression systems as they form by budding off the producer cells. Some eVLPs are contaminated by host cell proteins encapsulated within the eVLP in the process of budding from the cells of the expression system. Some eVLPs produced in the insect cell system are contaminated by baculovirus particles of near identical size and morphology. Some eVLPs are difficult to purify often requiring ultracentrifugation through sucrose gradients. Some embodiments of the vaccines described herein have solved one or more of these issues and provide a solution to the long felt need in the art for improved vaccines that are safe, free of contaminants, and effective.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">Previous vaccines have not included fully synthetic vesicles clean of other proteins or lipids derived from eggs. Making synthetic enveloped VLPs or vaccines solves the problem of the undefined nature of current VLP vaccines made from cells. In some embodiments, the vaccines provided herein are developed or produced quickly, whereas previous influenza vaccines, for example, took too long to develop or were too expensive to make to be fully effective during a particular flu season.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">Influenza A is responsible for up to half a million deaths worldwide each year. Although several subtypes commonly circulate in humans, in some embodiments new subtypes are introduced at any time through zoonotic infection. In some embodiments, the zoonotic infection comprises H5N1 or H7N9. Even though the seasonal vaccine is updated every year, these zoonotic transmissions are unpredictable and not accounted for in the vaccine. Currently available vaccines are not sufficient because (1) inactivated vaccines do not generate a robust mucosal immune response, and (2) live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) are problematic because they are over-attenuated, have restricted usage guidelines, and LAIV with HA and NA subtypes not present in seasonal strains cannot be used because of the risk of reassortment with wild type viruses. Currently available vaccines are designed to be protective against specific strains and reformulated every year and do not provide universal protection. Specific pre-pandemic vaccines, both inactivated and LAIV, against avian influenza viruses have not been very immunogenic. A universal vaccine aimed to stem zoonotic influenza infections from becoming pandemics could supplement the current seasonal vaccine and would be beneficial to public health. In some embodiments, a universal vaccine protects against all avian subtypes, against 16 avian HA subtypes (H1 to H16) or is manufactured quickly in the event of a pandemic.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">In some embodiments, the VLPs comprise a polyvalent mixture of influenza seVLPs each containing a single influenza A HA subtype (or a single NA subtype) to avoid a problem of immunodominance of HA over NA. In some embodiments, the VLPs are seVLPs or smVLPs containing influenza A NA proteins. In some embodiments, the VLPs comprise two or more different antigens, for example influenza A NA proteins and influenza A matrix proteins, such as M1, M2, or both. These polyvalent VLPs are non-infectious, safe, and easy to manufacture and use. In some embodiments, these polyvalent VLPs are used to provide a broadly protective &#x2018;universal&#x2019; pre-pandemic vaccine and a more broadly reactive seasonal vaccine.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the vaccines are delivered intranasally, intramuscularly, intradermally, systemically, or intravenously to elicit broadly reactive immunity to conserved epitopes on the influenza virus HA head and stalk as well as to NA epitopes and thus to confer protection to a wide range of influenza A viruses. In some embodiments, although HA is antigenically diverse, conserved epitopes in the HA receptor binding and stalk domains allow cross-reactive vaccines to be produced.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, a subunit vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is developed by expressing a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a mammalian cell line, purifying the protein, and formulating it into membrane bound particles (VMLP) to be used in combination with a dual adjuvant system. In some embodiments, aspects in the development of a subunit vaccine include determine a potency of the antigen used in the vaccine. To this end, the natural cellular receptor target of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), may be leveraged in a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ability of SARS-CoV-2-S to bind ACE-2 can be quantified with this assay and used as an indicator of SARS-CoV-2-S potency. In some embodiments, stability of the SARS-CoV-2-S is measured over time, in different storage conditions or in different formulations.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, modifications of the sandwich ELISA can also be used as a measure of whether a subunit vaccine has elicited an efficacious immune response. The ability of antibodies to neutralize the binding of SARS-CoV-2-S to ACE-2 is shown herein to correlate with protective immune responses. As a result, assays described herein can be used to screen people to see if they have SARS-Cov-2 neutralizing antibody (NAb). In addition, the amount of NAb can be measured and correlated with the level of NAb required to protect people from COVID-19. Currently, NAb is measured biologically with either live SARS-CoV-2 virus (BSL3 required and high coefficient of variation, (CV)) or with pseutotyped virus such as VSV expressing a reporter gene and the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (BSL2 required and high CV). An improvement described herein turns the NAb test into a simple BLS1 quantitative immunoassay with a low CV. Commercial immunoassays in various formats are envisioned.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, to develop the sandwich ELISA, a mammalian expression vector is commissioned to generate the ectodomain of ACE-2 corresponding to the first 740 amino acids (SEQ ID NO: 17) of the protein (SEQ ID NO: 18). In some embodiments, ACE-2 was purified using ion-exchange chromatography and tested to determine whether it had retained its enzymatic activity using a fluorogenic substrate assay. In some embodiments, high-binding ELISA plates were coated with ACE-2 overnight, blocked with bovine serum albumin and then incubated with different concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-S to determine the linear range of the assay. In some embodiments, an &#x201c;in-house&#x201d; SARS-CoV-2-S (VrS01) was compared to commercially available SARS-CoV-2-S. In some embodiments, to ensure binding to ACE-2 was specific to the SARS-CoV-2-S, binding was compared to &#x201c;in-house&#x201d; hemagglutinin. In some embodiments, heat stress, pH stress, and commercially available polyclonal antibody raised against the S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2-S were tested for their ability to affect SARS-CoV-2-S/ACE-2 binding.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some embodiments, purified recombinant ACE-2 can be used for the capture step of a sandwich ELISA used to test the potency of recombinant SARS-CoV-2-S as a vaccine antigen. The binding interaction between these molecules is disrupted when SARS-CoV-2-S has been stressed with pH or heat, suggesting this assay is sensitive to changes in the quality and conformation of SARS-CoV-2-S. There is a linear relationship in the binding interaction with ACE-2 over a large range of SARS-CoV-2-S concentrations, and when recombinant SARS-CoV-2-S is incorporated into membrane bound particles, the ACE-2 binding relationship remains linear and is not inhibited by other components of the vaccine formulation. Binding to ACE-2 is specific to SARS-CoV-2-S, as hemagglutinin from the B/Colorado '17 strain of influenza does not bind to ACE-2 when assayed at the same concentrations. Finally, a commercially available polyclonal antibody raised against the Si subunit of SARS-CoV-2-S may inhibit binding to ACE-2. Thus, an ACE-2 binding based sandwich ELISA is a powerful tool in determining SARS-CoV-2-S potency and/or stability and has utility in determining whether sera from vaccinated individuals have neutralizing antibodies. Non-limiting examples of some such embodiments are included in Examples 12-16.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">II.

Influenza Antigens</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">In some embodiments, the antigen is an influenza virus antigen, or a variant or fragment thereof. Influenza virus is a segmented negative-strand RNA virus included in the Orthomyxoviridae family. There are three types of Influenza viruses, A, B and C. Influenza A virus (IAV): A negative-sense, single-stranded, segmented RNA virus, which has eight RNA segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, NS, HA and NA) that code for 11 proteins, comprising RNA-directed RNA polymerase proteins (PB2, PB1 and PA), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), hemagglutinin (subunits HA1 and HA2), the matrix proteins (M1 and M2) and the non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2). This virus is prone to rapid evolution by error-protein polymerase and by segment reassortment. The host range of influenza A is quite diverse, and comprises humans, birds (e.g., chickens and aquatic birds), horses, marine mammals, pigs, bats, mice, ferrets, cats, tigers, leopards, and dogs. In animals, most influenza A viruses cause mild localized infections of the respiratory and intestinal tract. In some embodiments, highly pathogenic influenza A strains, such as H5N1, cause systemic infections in poultry in which mortality reaches 100%. In some embodiments, animals infected with influenza A act as a reservoir for the influenza viruses and certain subtypes cross the species barrier to humans.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">In some embodiments, the antigen is an influenza A virus antigen, or a variant or fragment thereof. Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes based on allelic variations in antigenic regions of two genes that encode surface glycoproteins, namely, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) which are required for viral attachment and cellular release. There are currently 18 different influenza A virus HA antigenic subtypes (H1 to H18) and 11 different influenza A virus NA antigenic subtypes (N1 to N11). In some embodiments, 1-H16 and N1-N9 are found in wild bird hosts and are a pandemic threat to humans. H17-H18 and N10-N11 have been described in bat hosts and are not currently thought to be a pandemic threat to humans.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">Specific examples of influenza A include, but are not limited to: H1N1 (such as 1918 H1N1), H1N2, H1N7, H2N2 (such as 1957 H2N2), H2N1, H3N1, H3N2, H3N8, H4N8, H5N1, H5N2, H5N8, H5N9, H6N1, H6N2, H6N5, H7N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N4, H7N7, H7N9, H8N4, H9N2, H1ON1, H1ON7, H1ON8, H11N1, H11N6, H12N5, H13N6, and H14N5. In one example, influenza A comprises those known to circulate in humans such as H1N1, H1N2, H3N2, H7N9, and H5N1.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">In animals, some influenza A viruses cause self-limited localized infections of the respiratory tract in mammals and/or the intestinal tract in birds. In some embodiments, highly pathogenic influenza A strains, such as H5N1, cause systemic infections in poultry in which mortality reaches 100%. In 2009, H1N1 influenza is the most common cause of human influenza. A new strain of swine-origin H1N1 emerged in 2009 and is declared pandemic by the World Health Organization. This strain is referred to as &#x201c;swine flu.&#x201d; H1N1 influenza A viruses were also responsible for the Spanish flu pandemic in 1918, the Fort Dix outbreak in 1976, and the Russian flu epidemic in 1977-1978.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">In some embodiments, the antigen comprises an influenza B virus antigen, or a variant or fragment thereof. Influenza B virus (IBV) is a negative-sense, single-stranded, RNA virus, which has eight RNA segments. The capsid of IBV is enveloped while its virion comprises an envelope, matrix protein, nucleoprotein complex, a nucleocapsid, and a polymerase complex. The surface projection are made of neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin. This virus is less prone to evolution than influenza A, but it mutates enough such that lasting immunity has not been achieved. The host range of influenza B is narrower than influenza A, and is only known to infect humans and seals. Influenza B viruses are not divided into subtypes, but are further broken down into lineages and strains. Specific examples of influenza B include, but are not limited to: B/Yamagata, B/Victoria, B/Shanghai/361/2002 and B/Hong Kong/330/2001.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">In some embodiments, the antigen is an influenza virus antigen or protein, or a fragment thereof.

In some embodiments, synthetic 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and synthetic 1,2-choleoyl-S7-glycero-3-phosphoetanolamine (DOPE) are used. In some embodiments, DSPE-peg2000 (1,2 distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phophoethanoamine-N[amino(polyethelene glycol)-2000] (ammonium salt), or a related lipid, is used (for example, mixed with a purified antigen) to make the VLP. In some embodiments, the lipid component is supplemented with sterol such as cholesterol, or with a sterol derivative at a ratio of 0-30 mol % of total added phospholipid. In some embodiments, the VLPs are made with, and comprise or consist of synthetic or essentially pure components. Some embodiments include an exogenously added, non-viral phospholipid species of defined quality, purity and chemical structure. Some embodiments include synthetic or essentially pure PC and/or PE species. In some embodiments, the VLP is made by combining DOPC, DOPE, cholesterol, and DSPE-peg2000.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0250">In some embodiments, the VLPs are produced with a ratio of DOPE to DOPC between 4:1 and 0.5:1. In some embodiments, a sterol or sterol derivative is added to increase the storage stability of the seVLPs. Examples of sterol derivatives include cholesterol, cholesterol hemisuccinate, phytosterols such as lanosterol, ergosterol, and vitamin D and vitamin D related compounds. In some embodiments, the amount of cholesterol to DOPC and DOPE combined is about 20 mol %.</p><p id="p-0253" num="0251">Some embodiments include a predetermined ratio of antigen to lipids. A distinguishing feature of some embodiments of this disclosure is the insertion of the antigen into the membrane of the seVLP during the microfluidic mixing. To prepare seVLPs, a Nanoassemblr&#x2122; Benchtop (Precision Nanosystems, Inc., Vancouver, Canada) is used with a 300 p.m Staggered Herringbone Micromixer. In some embodiments, the lipids are dissolved at a predetermined ratio in methanol or ethanol, and the antigen is dissolved in PBS, 10 mM, pH 7.4 aqueous buffer containing 0.1-10% octyl glucoside (n-octyl-&#x3b2;-d-glucoside) (OG), a detergent. Another detergent is 1,2-dicaproyl-sn-glycero-3-phosocholine (DCPC). In some embodiments, the antigens with transmembrane domains are kept in detergent(s) prior to forming seVLPs. In some embodiments, a critical micelle concentration (c.m.c.) of OG and DCPC is 25 mM and 14 mM respectively. In some embodiments, a c.m.c. below 5mM is used to remove the detergent by dialysis. As an example, influenza rHA protein in aqueous buffered saline and 15 &#x2014; 20 mM DCPC is mixed with DOPE, DOPC, cholesterol and 2-5 mM DCPC in ethanol with the Nanoassemblr&#x2122; Benchtop such that the eluant is slightly below the 14 mM c.m.c. of DSPC. In some embodiments, this fast detergent removal leads to simultaneous coalescence of lipid-detergent and lipid-protein detergent micelles resulting in direct co-reconstitution of lipids and proteins forming homogeneous seVLPs. In some embodiments, without detergent, the transmembrane domains of antigens form aggregates, which in the case of influenza HA, leads to rosette formation. In some embodiments, such aggregation is irreversible. In some embodiments, seVLPs comprise200-500 nmol DOPC, 600-1000 nmol DOPE, about and 200-300 nmol cholesterol per mg of recombinant influenza membrane protein(s). The flow rate ratio between the aqueous and solvent stream is between 1:1 to 5:1 (aqueous:alcohol) with a 3:1 ratio preferred. The total flow rate is 1-10 mL/min. seVLPs were purified and concentrated using 750 kD tangential flow (TFF) column Spectra/Por&#xae; Dialysis membrane, Biotech CE Tubing, Spectrum Laboratories, USA).</p><p id="p-0254" num="0252">In some embodiments, the VLP (e.g. seVLP) has a narrow size distribution. In some embodiments, lipid vesicles or VLPs have a diameter (particle size) in the range of 40 to 200 nm, from 50 nm to 150 nm, or from 70 nm to 130 nm. In some embodiments, the lipid vesicles or VLPs have a homogeneous size distribution with less than 15% or 10% of the VLPs having a particle size above 150 nm, and less than 15% or 10% below 50 nm. In some embodiments, the modal diameter is below 90 nm. In some embodiments, cholesterol lowers the need for DOPC and stabilizes the seVLPs.</p><p id="p-0255" num="0253">In some embodiments, microfluidic preparation of the VLPs is used. In some embodiments, the VLPs are not prepared by sonication, and/or or detergent removal is not performed by dialysis. In some embodiments, microfluidic preparation of the VLPs tightens the size variation to a more uniform size compared to VLPs such as eVLPs prepared by sonication or detergent removal by dialysis.</p><p id="p-0256" num="0254">Some VLPs are made without the use of a detergent in one or more steps, or in all of the steps, of the method. In some embodiments, the VLP (e.g. smVLP) is produced with polymer based nanodiscs. In some embodiments, a smVLP is made by a method that includes the use of a polymethacrylate (PMA) copolymer. In some embodiments, the methacrylate copolymer is made to mimic the amphipathic helical structure of a natural apolipoprotein that forms a lipid bilayer nanodisc. In some embodiments, amphipathic a-helical peptides are used to form nanodiscs. In some embodiments, an amphipathic structure of these proteins and peptides is beneficial to form lipid nanodiscs. In some embodiments, to mimic the amphiphilic nature of such proteins or peptides, amphiphilic polymethacrylate random copolymers comprising hydrophobic and hydrophilic side chains are used to produce a nanodisc-forming polymer. In some embodiments, their monomer sequence is random, but the amphiphilic polymethacrylate random copolymer provides an amphiphipathic structure upon its interaction with a lipid bilayer. In some embodiments, hydrophobic butyl methacrylate and cationic methacroylcholine chloride of the resultant polymer interact with hydrophobic acyl chains and anionic phosphate headgroups of lipids, respectively, to form a lipid nanodisc formation surrounded by the polymer. In some embodiments, the copolymers are synthesized using free radical polymerization initiated by azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN). In some embodiments, the molecular weight of a polymer is adjusted by varying the amount of methyl 3-mercaptopropionate used as a chain-transfer agent. In some embodiments, the hydrophobic/cationic ratio is varied by the feed ratio of two monomers. In some embodiments, the resultant polymer is purified by reprecipitation in diethyl ether, which in some embodiments provides the benefit of complete removal of unreacted monomers.</p><p id="p-0257" num="0255">In some embodiments, the ability of each synthesized polymer to solubilize lipids is examined by carrying out turbidity measurements on large unilamellar vesicles of DMPC (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) prepared by the extrusion method (LUVs of 100 nm in diameter). In some embodiments, the addition of a polymer to DMPC vesicles results in a decrease of the solution turbidity in many cases, reflecting polymer-induced fragmentation of vesicles and resulting lipid nanodisc formation. In some embodiments, an optimization of the amphiphilic balance is beneficial to obtain efficient nanodisc-forming polymers.</p><p id="p-0258" num="0256">In some embodiments, nanodiscs comprise or are formed using styrene maleic acid (SMA) polymers or co-polymers. In some embodiments, addition of the SMA to a synthetic or biological lipid membrane leads to the spontaneous formation of nanodiscs. In some embodiments, such polymer-bounded nanodiscs comprise a bilayer organization of incorporated lipid molecules that is conserved. In some embodiments, an advantage of using SMA is the ability of the SMA polymer to directly extract proteins from a native cell membrane environment. Depending on the origin of the lipid material, the terms SMALPs is used in some embodiments for particles derived from synthetic liposomes and synthetic natural nanodiscs is used in some embodiments to refer to isolations from biological membranes. In some embodiments, the use of SMALPs comprises the isolation of a membrane protein with detergents, insertion of the membrane protein into a liposome and then the formation of the nanodisc with the addition of SMA. In some embodiments, this has the advantage that the lipids are defined in vitro. In some embodiments, a native nanodisc system combines a solubilizing power similar to detergents with the small particle size of nanodiscs, while conserving a minimally perturbed native lipid environment that stabilizes the protein.</p><p id="p-0259" num="0257">In some embodiments, SMALPs are made of poly(styrene-co-maleic acid) (SMA). In some embodiments, the SMA is incorporated into membranes and spontaneously forms SMALPs. In some embodiments, a Styrene Maleic Anhydride Co-polymer reagent uses a styrene to maleic acid ratio of 2:1. In some embodiments, an anhydride polymer powder is obtained and converted to an acid using hydrolysis. In some embodiments, The Styrene Maleic Anhydride Co-polymer is dissolved in 1 M NaOH. In some embodiments, the reaction is carried out while heating and refluxing a solution. In some embodiments, after cooling at room temperature. In some embodiments, the Styrene Maleic Anhydride Co-polymer is precipitated by reducing the pH to below 5 by the addition of concentrated HCl. In some embodiments, the precipitate is washed three times with water followed by separation using centrifugation. In some embodiments, at the end of the third wash the precipitate is resuspended in 0.6 M NaOH. In some embodiments, the solution is precipitated and washed again, and resuspended in 0.6 M NaOH. In some embodiments, the pH is then adjusted to pH 8. In some embodiments, the polymer is lyophilized. In some embodiments, the Styrene Maleic Anhydride Co-polymer is added to a suspension of lipid. In some embodiments, the SMA interacts with the lipid bilayer, self-assembling into SMALPs.</p><p id="p-0260" num="0258">In some embodiments, when used as VLPs presenting antigens to the immune system the nanodisc technology provides a spectrum of membrane VLPs (mVLPs) of mVLPs (from natural mVLPs derived from cells, to semi-synthetic semi-synthetic mVLPS where exogenous lipids are supplemented to the lipid mix to fully smVLPs where all the lipids are defined and supplied in vitro.</p><p id="p-0261" num="0259">In some embodiments, DIBMA or SMA provides the ability of directly extracting membrane proteins from native cell membranes. In some embodiments, (e.g. when VLPs described herein comprise influenza HA, NA or M2 antigens produced by recombinant DNA methods), this simplifies vaccine nanodisc formation. In some embodiments, DIBMA is directly added to cell membranes to extract vaccine antigen(s) produced by recombinant methods that are embedded in the membrane of the protein expression system. In some embodiments, DIBMA is obtained from Anatace. In some embodiments, the antigen of a nanodisc comprising DIBMA comprises a HIS tag at, for example, the C-terminus of the antigen. In some embodiments, the antigen and/or the DIBMA nanodiscs are purified by IMAC chromatography. In some embodiments, the nanodiscs comprise an antigen (e.g. HA) embedded in a flat lipid membrane of the producer cell defined by a belt of DIBMA In some embodiments, DIBMA is supplemented with DMPC (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine). In some embodiments, such supplementation provides the benefit of improving extraction of the antigen from the producer cells. In some embodiments, the VLPs comprise native nanodiscs.

Hemagglutination Titer Assay</p><p id="p-0296" num="0294">In some embodiments, following production and purification of a vaccine provided herein, a hemagglutination titer assay is performed. In some embodiments, such assays are performed to measure or evaluate hemagglutinating units (HAU). In some embodiments, this is used to evaluate that the VLP (e.g. seVLP or smVLP) presents functional HA trimers and is in some embodiments used to quantify HA protein in the VLP preparation. Hemagglutination titers are also used to quantify the amount of influenza virus used a challenge virus, or for example to quantify amount of virus (titering) present in the lungs or respiratory tract of challenged animals. In some embodiments, vaccinated subjects show a reduction in viral titers as compared to mock-vaccinated subjects.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0295">In some embodiments, the assay is used to quantify the amount of VLP or also to quantify virus in a sample, such as a lung sample from a virus challenged subject previously administered a vaccine provided herein. In some embodiments, vaccine is serially diluted (e.g., 2-fold from 1:4 to 1:4096) and then added to wells containing red blood cells (RBCs). In some embodiments, the RBC solution (such as 0.75% to 1% RBC) is added to the wells. In some embodiments, the mixture is then incubated for 30 min at room temperature, which allows the RBC to settle. In some embodiments, the samples are then analyzed for their resulting agglutination pattern, for example by examining microtiter wells in which the sample is placed. For example, in a microtiter plate placed on its edge, the RBC in the RBC control wells will flow into a characteristic teardrop shape (no influenza virus is present so there is no agglutination). In some embodiments, wells that contain influenza virus agglutinate the RBC to varying degrees. In some embodiments, the wells with the greatest amount of virus will appear cloudy, because the virus has cross-linked red blood cells, preventing their pelleting. In some embodiments, lesser amounts of virus in succeeding wells result in partial agglutination, but the pellet will not stream into a teardrop shape similar to the pellets in the RBC control wells. In some embodiments, the endpoint is determined as the greatest dilution of the vaccine resulting in complete agglutination of the RBC.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0296">In some embodiments, a number of hemagglutinating units (HAU) in the sample being titered is determined. The HA titer is the reciprocal of the dilution of the last well of a series showing complete agglutination of the RBC (e.g., if the last dilution is 1:640, the titer of the sample is 640 HA units/5 &#x3bc;l sample).</p><p id="p-0299" num="0297">2. Hemagglutination Inhibition (HA1) Assay</p><p id="p-0300" num="0298">In some embodiments, following administration of a vaccine provided herein, a hemagglutination inhibition (HA1), assay is performed. In some embodiments, influenza viruses agglutinate red blood cells, a process called hemagglutination. In some embodiments, in the presence of specific antibody to the surface hemagglutinin, hemagglutination is blocked. In some embodiments, this phenomenon provides the basis for the HA1 assay, which is used to detect and quantitate specific antiviral antibodies in serum. Thus, HA1 measures the presence of antibodies that block HA receptor binding (as assessed by hemagglutination of RBC).</p><p id="p-0301" num="0299">In some embodiments, sera to be evaluated for the presence of antibodies against the head of hemagglutinin is treated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE) at 37&#xb0; C. overnight. In some embodiments, the following day, RDE is inactivated by incubation at 56&#xb0; C. for 1 hour. In some embodiments, assay plates used are 96-well, nonsterile, non-tissue culture-treated, round-bottom microtiter plates. In some embodiments, two-fold serial dilutions are carried out on each sample down the plate from row B through row G. 50 &#x3bc;l of working dilution of viral antigen (a set number of HAU) is added to all wells of the microtiter plates except for row H (the RBC control wells) and the antigen control wells. In some embodiments, the plates are incubated for 30 min at room temperature. 50 &#x3bc;l 1% RBC suspension in PBS is added to all wells and the plates incubated for 30 to 45 min at room temperature. In some embodiments, the microtiter plate is analyzed to read the agglutination patterns. In some embodiments, the negative control wells (those containing normal serum without anti-influenza antibodies) will appear cloudy, because the influenza virus has completely agglutinated the RBC. In some embodiments, the positive control wells (those containing known anti-influenza antiserum) will have RBC pellets similar in appearance to the row H control pellets as long as there is sufficient anti-influenza antibody to inhibit agglutination. In some embodiments, with increasing serum dilution, the amount of antibody will decrease so that increasing amounts of RBC agglutination become apparent. In some embodiments, the hemagglutination inhibition (HA1) titer for each serum sample is the reciprocal of the greatest dilution which completely inhibits the agglutination of the RBC (e.g., the last well in a dilution series forming an RBC pellet). In some embodiments, the HA1 titer for each sample is the mean of the endpoint titers of its duplicate dilution series. In some embodiments, if the titer of the duplicates differs by more than one two-fold dilution, the HA1 titer is repeated for that sample.</p><p id="p-0302" num="0300">3. Influenza Virus Neutralization Assay</p><p id="p-0303" num="0301">In some embodiments, following administration of a vaccine provided herein, a neutralization assay is performed. In some embodiments, serum samples from subjects who received a vaccine provided herein are diluted, influenza virus is added, and the amount of serum necessary to prevent virus growth determined. In some embodiments, neutralization assesses the presence of antibodies that inhibit viral replication. In some embodiments, antibodies to the stalk of HA, for example, neutralize viral replication but not affect hemagglutination because the epitope is not around the receptor binding domain. In some embodiments, antibodies that bind to the head and inhibit hemagglutination are usually neutralizing.</p><p id="p-0304" num="0302">In some embodiments, the serum samples are incubated in tissue culture medium (such as DMEM/5% FBS containing antibiotics), for example in 96-well, round-bottom, tissue culture-treated microtiter plate. In some embodiments, the serum samples are serially diluted, for example in duplicate adjacent wells of a microwell plate (for example initially diluted 1:10 to a dilution of the sample of 1:640). In some embodiments, previously titered influenza virus (of any subtype) are diluted to contain 1 TCID<sub>50/50 </sub>&#x3bc;l. In some embodiments, equal amounts of the working stock virus (such as about 50 TCID<sub>50</sub>) are added to each serum sample (comprising the serial dilutions), and incubate at 37&#xb0; C. for 1 hr. In some embodiments, with this protocol, the same neutralization titer is obtained if the final amount of virus is between 10 to 100 TCID<sub>50</sub>. In some embodiments, following the incubation, tissue culture medium (such as DMEM/5% FBS with antibiotics) containing 2.5&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>MDCK cells/ml (or other cells) are added to the serum samples (e.g., to all wells of the microtiter plate). In some embodiments, this is incubated overnight in a humidified 37&#xb0; C., 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator. In some embodiments, some influenza viruses grow better at temperatures of 34&#xb0; to 35&#xb0; C., and thus those temperatures are used. In some embodiments, the media is removed, and replaced with tissue culture medium (such as DMEM with antibiotics) containing trypsin (such as 0.0002%), and the mixture incubated in a humidified 37&#xb0; C., 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator for 4 days. In some embodiments, subsequently, sterile 0.5% RBC/PBS solution is added, and the mixture incubated at 4&#xb0; C. for 1 hr, and the wells checked for the presence of agglutination. In some embodiments, the virus neutralization titer of a particular serum sample is defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum where both wells show no agglutination of the RBC.</p><p id="p-0305" num="0303">In some embodiments, samples (e.g., in a microwell) containing influenza virus neutralizing antibodies at sufficient concentration prevent the virus from infecting the cells so that viral multiplication will not take place. In some embodiments, the addition of RBCs to these wells will result in the formation of a pellet of RBC. In contrast, in some embodiments, samples (e.g., in a microwell) that had none or less than neutralizing concentrations of anti-influenza antibody will have influenza virus present at the end of the 4-day incubation. In some embodiments, the RBC added to these samples will agglutinate. In some embodiments, influenza virus cross-links the red blood cells, inhibiting their settling in the microwell, and the wells therefore appear cloudy.</p><p id="p-0306" num="0304">4. Neuraminidase Inhibiting (NI) Antibody Titer Assay</p><p id="p-0307" num="0305">In some embodiments, neuraminidase inhibiting (NI) antibody titers are determined if a vaccine contains an NA protein. In some embodiments, to measure NI antibody titers, reassortant viruses containing the appropriate NA are generated, for example by using plasmid-based reverse genetics. In some embodiments, the appropriate NA are the same one(s) present in the vaccine administered to the subject. In some embodiments, the NI assay is performed using fetuin as a NA substrate. An exemplary method is provided below.</p><p id="p-0308" num="0306">In some embodiments, the NI titer is the inverse of the greatest dilution of sera that provides at least 50% inhibition of NA activity. In some embodiments, it is expected that use of the VLPs disclosed herein will decrease or even eliminate challenge virus titers in subjects who received the VLPs. In some embodiments, subjects who receive the VLPs are expected to have at least 10-fold, at least 20-fold, at least 50-fold, or even 100-fold less virus in the lungs than subjects who did not receive the VLPs (e.g., are mock vaccinated).</p><p id="p-0309" num="0307">In some embodiments, NI antibody titers are determined in an enzyme-linked lectin assay using peroxidase-labeled peanut agglutinin (PNA-PO) to bind to desialylated fetuin. In some embodiments, NA activity is determined by incubating serial dilutions of purified, full length NA on fetuin coated microtiter plates. In some embodiments, after 30 min incubation at RT, plates are washed, and PNA-PO added. In some embodiments, after 1 h incubation at RT, plates are again washed and the peroxidase substrate 3,3&#x2032;,5,5&#x2032;-tetramethylbenzidine added and color development allowed to proceed for 10 min. In some embodiments, color development is stopped and the plates the OD450 measured. In some embodiments, dilution corresponding to 95% NA activity is determined.</p><p id="p-0310" num="0308">In some embodiments, NI titers against an NA subtype are measured beginning at a 1:20 dilution of sera followed by 2-fold serial dilutions in 96-well U-bottomed tissue culture plates. In some embodiments, NAs corresponding to 95% maximum activity are added to diluted sera and incubated for 30 min at RT after which sera/NA samples are transferred to fetuin coated microtiter plates. In some embodiments, plates are incubated for 2 h at 37&#xb0; C., washed and PNA-PO added. In some embodiments, the plates are incubated at RT an additional hour, washed and peroxidase substrate TMB added. In some embodiments, color development is stopped after 10 min and the OD450 of the plates measured. In some embodiments, the NI titers are the reciprocal dilution at which 50% NA activity is inhibited. In some embodiments, the lower limit of quantitation for the assay is 20; titers lower than 20 are considered to be negative and assigned a value of 10. In some embodiments, a good or positive response produces a value of &#x3e;30, while a poor or no response produces a value &#x3c;20.</p><p id="p-0311" num="0309">5. Viral Lung Titers and Pathology</p><p id="p-0312" num="0310">In some embodiments, viral lung titers and pathology are determined. In some embodiments, tissue samples, such as lung samples (e.g., inflated lung samples) are fixed (e.g., 24 h fixation in 10% formaldehyde), embedded (e.g., in paraffin), cut into sections (e.g., 1 to 10 &#x3bc;m, such as 5 &#x3bc;m), and mounted.</p><p id="p-0313" num="0311">In some embodiments, influenza virus antigen distribution is evaluated by immunohistochemistry using an appropriate antibody. In some embodiments, the antibody is a polyclonal or monoclonal antibody that is either specific for the virus used to challenge the subject or one that is cross-reactive to different influenza virus strains. In some embodiments, it is expected that use of the vaccines disclosed herein will decrease or even eliminate virus titers in subjects who received the vaccines. In some embodiments, subjects who receive the vaccines are expected to have at least 10-fold, at least 20-fold, at least 50-fold, or even 100-fold less virus in the lungs than subjects who did not receive the vaccines (e.g., are mock vaccinated). In some embodiments, it is expected that use of the vaccines disclosed herein will decrease or even eliminate symptoms of influenza infection, such as bronchitis, bronchiolitis, alveolitis, and/or pulmonary edema, in subjects who received the vaccines. In some embodiments, subjects who receive the vaccines are expected to have at least 20%, at least 50%, at least 75%, or at least 90% less bronchitis, bronchiolitis, alveolitis, and/or pulmonary edema (or such reductions in severity of these symptoms) as compared subjects who did not receive the vaccines (e.g., are mock vaccinated).

While IgG ELISA may model the magnitude of specific immune responses, it does not differentiate between antibodies which functionally inhibit the virus, and those which may bind non-essential (or structurally occluded) epitopes of the target protein. Neutralization assays, in which post-immune sera is tested for its ability to block virus entry into permissive cells in vitro, can be a powerful tool to predict efficacy in vivo. In order to avoid the need to use the highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 for such an assay, a pseudotype assay is being developed in which a replication-deficient reporter lentivirus is packaged using the COVID-S protein. If this pseudotype virus can transduce permissive cells in vitro, it should be possible to use it as a surrogate for authentic SARS-CoV-2 in neutralization assays.

For reconstitution as seVLPs, 0.65 mg of lipids (phosphatidyl choline (50 mg/ml), and plant cholesterol (20 mg/ml) in a ratio of 2:1) were dissolved in 130 &#x3bc;l 10% OG. 200 ug of OG-micellized VrS01 was then added to the dissolved lipids and the total volume was made up to 0.65 mL, giving an end concentration of &#x2dc;4% OG. The sample was dialyzed against numerous changes of small volumes (26 ml) of PBS for 24 hours at 4&#xb0; C. The sample was then dialyzed against 4&#xd7;32 ml PBS over 24 hours. The sample was then transferred to 4&#xd7;2 L over 48 hours, to remove OG. All dialysis steps were against VDB (10 mM NaP, 140 mM NaCl; pH 7.2) at 4&#xb0; C. seVLPs were 230-250 nm in average diameter as determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Malvern Zetasizer-NS, as compared to empty DOPC/chol liposomes prepared in parallel (no VrS01 incorporation), which had average diameters of 190-200 nm.</p><heading id="h-0054" level="1">Example 20</heading><heading id="h-0055" level="1">Immunogenicity of VrS01 seVLPs in Sprague-Dawley Rats</heading><p id="p-0408" num="0419">VaxiPatch arrays were prepared as described in Examples 7 and 8, from print mixes formulated to contain either 100 or 500 ng of seVLP-VrS01, along with liposomal adjuvant at a dose of 500 ng QS-21 and 500 ng 3D(6-Acyl)-PHAD per patch, with 0.5% (w/v) FD&#x26;C No.1 blue dye for visualization. These were applied to 8 Sprague Dawley rats (4 males, 4 females) in the same manner as Example 8. Briefly, Sprague-Dawley rats, with hair previously removed, were treated with arrays utilizing 5 minute direct pressure to the midline of the back while under isofluorane anesthesia. Serum was collected by saphenous vein bleeds at 2, 3, and 4 weeks post-treatment. On week 5, animals from both groups received an additional VaxiPatch boost by the same method, consisting of 175 ng seVLP-VrS01 plus adjuvant as described above (500 ng QS-21, 500 ng 3D(6-Acyl)-PHAD. Sera was again drawn and tested 2 weeks post-boost.</p><p id="p-0409" num="0420">Specific IgG responses in the sera were evaluated by ELISA assay on plates coated overnight at 4&#xb0; C. in 100 mM carbonate buffer with full-length rS (Immune Tech, IT-003-032p) at 0.5 &#x3bc;g/mL. Five-fold serial dilutions from 1:100 to 1:12,500 were tested, using an HRP-conjugated polyclonal goat antibody against rat IgG for detection (Jackson labs, 112-035-143). Positivity was assigned based on signal in excess of twice the blank wells of the plate, and used to assign endpoint titers.</p><p id="p-0410" num="0421"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref> summarizes specific IgG responses to VrS01 in SD rats. The left panel shows the time-course of the VrS01 treatment groups based on the log10 of their assigned endpoint titers, with arrows indicating the timing of both vaccination treatments. Error bars represent SEM (n=8 per group). The right panel compares endpoint titers from individual animals within the 500 ng treatment group, at 4 weeks post initial vaccination, and 2 week post-boost.
