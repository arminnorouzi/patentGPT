The isolated gate driver system allows a single isolator to drive two FETs, such as MOSFETs, and utilizes local FET voltage sensing (current FET polarity) to eliminate measurement and processing delays. The isolated gate driver system enables both signal and power to be transmitted over an isolation barrier, which in various embodiments is provided by a low-cost, high-reliability pulse transformer.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one or more embodiments, two FET switches are coupled back-to-back in each leg of a single-phase cycloconverter; in such embodiments, one of the FETs in each cycloconverter leg is continuously ON for almost all of a first half of an AC mains cycle, and the other FET is continuously ON for almost all of the second half of the AC mains cycle. By sensing the drain voltages at each of the FETs, the isolated gate driver system is able to determine which FET in each 4Q switch should remain ON for nearly all of each AC mains cycle. The isolated gate driver system is thus able to recreate a &#x201c;continuously ON for nearly half a mains cycle&#x201d; function using only one gate signal (i.e., the gate signal of the non-continuously activated FET in the 4Q switch). The recreated gate signal has a 50% duty cycle, enabling the isolated gate driver system to use a gate drive transformer to provide isolation as well as to transfer both power and gate signaling. As such, the isolated gate driver system requires only a single isolated channel per cycloconverter leg.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additionally, the isolated gate driver system detects the desired gate signal and the voltage across a pair of unidirectional switches that form a bidirectional switch; using the detected information, the isolated gate driver system can identify which unidirectional switch in the pair to activate.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one or more embodiments, the isolated gate driver system comprises a four-channel driver module, pulse transformer gate drivers, and gate driver modules, where the four-channel driver module and the gate driver modules may be implemented as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of a power converter <b>100</b> in accordance with embodiments of the present disclosure.
