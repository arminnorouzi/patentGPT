To the extent appropriate, a claim of priority is made to the above-disclosed application.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for controlling an electronic device in a smart home system.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The number of things being connected to internet presently increases at an exponential rate. This number is expected to be doubled within five years. In a home, such connected things may include household items, lighting, home alarms, etc., but also home furnishing products such as, e.g., a couch or a dinner table. The rapid development of connected things, and particularly constantly connected smartphones, may leave little room for digital silence in a family. For instance, attention to a smartphone screen due to the increasing amount of available information, notifications, etc., has gradually been prioritized in favor of human conversations during, e.g., dinner time and/or other family gatherings in the home. Further, the number of connected things may give an illusion that all electronic devices in a home control themselves according to an expected behavior. Hence, home safety may be jeopardized, e.g., in connection with home alarm systems, etc.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hence, there is need for an approach to provide a relaxing digital environment in a home. Further, there is need for an approach to enhance safety in a home.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, it is an object of the invention to provide an approach for providing a relaxing digital environment in a home.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another object of the invention is to provide an approach for enhancing safety in a home.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect, there is provided a computer implemented method in a smart home system, the method comprising</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">defining, by sensing an indoor position of a wearable electronic device comprising an indoor positioning module, an area in a real-world indoor environment,</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">attributing a rule to the defined area, the rule comprising one or more settings to be applied to one or more electronic devices upon a user being detected in the defined area.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This may facilitate setting up a digital and/or physical environment in the real-world indoor environment, wherein the physical environment herein generally refers to a physical state of an electronic device. The sensing of an indoor position of the wearable electronic device, e.g., a smartphone, may by way of example be done by using light detection and ranging, LiDAR, augmented reality, AR, or the like. The term &#x201c;smartphone&#x201d; as used herein, is preferably to be interpreted as a normal smartphone as of a smartphone commonly available at the date of filing of this disclosure. However, any future equivalent of today's smartphone may be an equally applicable interpretation, provided the future equivalent is a mobile electronic device configured to communicate wirelessly with another electronic device. The rule may be a rule associated with a setting of a smartphone, such as setting the smartphone in one or more of &#x201c;Airplane mode&#x201d;, &#x201c;Private browsing&#x201d;, &#x201c;Silent mode&#x201d;, etc. Alternatively, the rule may be any change of lighting, sound level, heat level, etc. For instance, should the defined area be a floor area on which a dinner table is placed, the attributed rule to that area may be to set any smartphone located in the area in &#x201c;Silent mode&#x201d;. Alternatively, or additionally, the attributed rule may be to turn off a television, adjust a ceiling light, or the like. Yet another alternative of the attributed rule may be to enable and/or disable streaming services or other digital services such as applications associated with the wearable electronic device. Hence, this approach may facilitate setting up a location based preferred digital and/or physical environment. Thus, a location based privacy in the home may be facilitated. Further, the approach may facilitate saving electrical power, as the one or more electronic devices may be turned off by the one or more settings associated with rules attributed thereto.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to a second aspect, there is provided a smart home controller comprising circuitry configured to execute:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">an area defining function configured to, based on an indoor position received from a wearable electronic device, define an area in a real-world indoor environment; and</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">a rule attributing function configured to attribute a rule to the defined area, the rule comprising one or more settings to be applied to one or more electronic devices upon a user being detected in the defined area.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The above-mentioned features of the first aspect, when applicable, apply to this second aspect as well. In order to avoid undue repetition, reference is therefore made to the above. The smart home controller may be a router or a gateway. The smart home controller may communicate wirelessly with the wearable electronic device and the one or more electronic devices, which may provide efficient routing of network data traffic and prioritization of the same.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a third aspect, there is provided a computer implemented method for controlling one or more electronic devices in a smart home system, the method comprising</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">detecting presence of a user in a defined area having a rule attributed thereto, the rule comprising one or more settings to be applied to the one or more electronic devices upon the user being detected in the defined area,</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">controlling the one or more electronic devices according to the rule in response to the detected presence of the user in the defined area.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The detection of presence of the user in the defined area may be done by an image sensor or a depth sensor, thereby facilitating a relatively well-defined location of the user in the defined area. Alternatively, or additionally, the user may carry a physical tag that may facilitate a relatively well-defined location in the defined area. By way of example, the physical tag may be an external or, in a smartphone, built in ultra-wideband, UWB, tag for communication of a relatively well-defined location in the defined area. The presence of the user in the defined area may thereby control an electronic device located elsewhere. For instance, the defined area may be an area in a living room in a home. Upon detecting the user being located in the area in the living room, an example rule attributed to the area may be switching off a ceiling light in a bedroom. Hence, this may facilitate saving electrical power. Further, detecting presence of a plurality of users in the defined area, a rule attributed to the defined area may be to set a smart device of a respective user in &#x201c;Silent mode&#x201d; and/or any equivalent thereof. This may facilitate human interaction between family members in a family. By way of example, the rule may be applied when the family members sit around the dinner table, where the dinner table thereby be associated with the defined area. Hence, (digital) privacy may thereby be facilitated.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another advantage may be facilitating safety in a home. For instance, when a user goes to bed, one or more doors of the home may be locked and/or a home alarm system may be turned on. This may apply to other buildings or vehicles in connection with the estate on which the home of the user is located. Such a building may, e.g., be a garage. Hence, a garage door may be closed (if open) and locked, and an alarm system installed thereto may be activated when the user goes to bed. The same may apply for, e.g., a car, i.e., locking its doors and activating a car alarm. In this example, the bed is located on the defined area. To avoid locking the doors and turning on the home alarm system if resting on the bed during day time, rule attributed to the defined area may depend on the time of the day.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a fourth aspect, there is provided a smart home controller comprising:</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">circuitry configured to execute:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0022">a presence detecting function configured to detect presence of a user in a defined area in a real-world indoor environment,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0023">a rule function configured to check whether the defined area having a rule attributed thereto, the rule comprising one or more settings to be applied to one or more electronic devices upon the user being detected in the defined area, and</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0024">a control function configured to, in response to a positive check whether the defined area having a rule attributed thereto, generate one or more control signals comprising instructions for controlling the one or more electronic devices according to the rule; and</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0023" num="0025">a communication unit configured to send the one or more control signals to the one or more electronic devices.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0026">The above-mentioned features of the third aspect, when applicable, apply to this second aspect as well. In order to avoid undue repetition, reference is therefore made to the above. By way of example, the smart home controller may be a gateway or a hub. The communication unit may communicate wire-based or wirelessly with the one or more electronic devices.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0027">According to a fifth aspect, there is provided a smart home system comprising:</p><p id="p-0026" num="0028">a presence detecting device configured to detect presence of a user in a defined area of a real-world indoor environment,</p><p id="p-0027" num="0029">a smart home controller comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0030">circuitry configured to execute:        <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">            <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0031">a rule function configured to check whether the defined area having a rule attributed thereto, the rule comprising one or more settings to be applied to one or more electronic devices upon the user being detected in the defined area, and</li>            <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0032">a control function configured to, in response to a positive check whether the defined area having a rule attributed thereto, generate one or more control signals comprising instructions for controlling the one or more electronic devices according to the rule,</li>        </ul>        </li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0033">a communication unit configured to send the one or more control signals to the one or more electronic devices.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0028" num="0034">The above-mentioned features of the third and fourth aspects, when applicable, apply to this fifth aspect as well. In order to avoid undue repetition, reference is therefore made to the above.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0035">According to a sixth aspect, there is provided a toggle button device comprising:</p><p id="p-0030" num="0036">a toggle button configured to generate an activation signal in response to a user toggling the toggle button;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0037">an indoor position module configured to determine an indoor position of the toggle button device;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0038">a communication unit configured to, in response to the user toggling the toggle button, generate an output signal, wherein a type of output signal is dependent on the indoor position, or the output signal comprises the indoor position.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0039">The toggle button device may be viewed as being functioning as the previously discussed wearable electronic device having a reduced number of features compared to, e.g., a smartphone or a smartwatch, etc. Hence, the toggle button device may provide a simpler and cheaper approach for a location-based privacy and/or facilitating home security.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0040">According to a seventh aspect, there is provided a toggle button system comprising a toggle button device, and a gateway configured to receive the output signal generated by the toggle button device, and control one or more electronic devices based on the output signal.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0041">Generally, all terms used in the claims are to be interpreted according to their ordinary meaning in the technical field, unless explicitly defined otherwise herein. All references to &#x201c;a/an/the [element, device, component, means, step, etc.]&#x201d; are to be interpreted openly as referring to at least one instance of said element, device, component, means, step, etc., unless explicitly stated otherwise.

This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided for thoroughness and completeness, and to fully convey the scope of the invention to the skilled person.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0057">In connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> there is shown a flowchart of a computer implemented method <b>100</b> for defining an area and attributing a rule to the area in a real-world indoor environment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> may advantageously be viewed in parallel in connection with the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The method <b>100</b>, applicable in a smart home system, comprises defining <b>110</b>, by sensing an indoor position <b>10</b> of a wearable electronic device <b>12</b> comprising an indoor positioning module, an area <b>14</b> in a real-world indoor environment. The method <b>100</b> further comprises attributing a rule to the defined area <b>14</b>, the rule comprising one or more settings to be applied to one or more electronic devices upon a user being detected in the defined area <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0058">The wearable electronic device <b>12</b> may be a smart device, e.g. a smartphone, a smart watch, smart glasses, smart jewelry, a smart tag, a smart fob, a smart ring, etc. Typically, the smart device is attributed with a user. The wearable electronic device <b>12</b> may be capable of communicating with other electronic devices. Preferably, the communication is wireless. A wireless communication may facilitate a freedom of movement for the user while carrying the wearable electronic device.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0059">The area <b>14</b> in the real-world indoor environment may be defined using augmented reality, AR, techniques such as light detection and ranging, LiDAR, or the so-called AR-kit, etc., in combination with the indoor position <b>10</b> of the wearable electronic device using any beacon technology having position determining properties such as an ultra-wideband, UWB, module. Assisting technologies, such as an accelerometer built in the electronic device, may be possible to provide for higher accuracy upon determining the position of the electronic device. The accelerometer may advantageously be implemented in the event of movement of the electronic device, but less useful in static objects, such as a sofa or a dinner table since forces on such static objects in practice are constant. The step of defining the area <b>10</b> will be further described below.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0060">The rule may be a rule associated with a digital service of a smart device. Such a digital service may comprise one or more of, notifications, location services, a sensor such as a microphone, private browsing, child-safe browsing, &#x201c;Airplane mode&#x201d;, &#x201c;Silent mode&#x201d;, Bluetooth&#xae;, reminders, speech recognition, AI assistant, applications and communication limits, etc. Alternatively, or additionally, the rule may be any change of lighting, sound level, heat level, etc. of the one or more electronic devices thereof. Hence, the one or more electronic devices may comprise a smart device, a router, a smart home appliance such as a home alarm, a television, a blind, etc. For instance, if the defined area <b>14</b> is a floor area on which a dinner table is placed, the attributed rule to that defined area <b>14</b> may be to set any smart device located in that defined area in &#x201c;Silent mode&#x201d;. Alternatively, or additionally, the attributed rule to the area <b>14</b> may be to turn off a television, adjust a ceiling light, or the like. Hence, this approach may facilitate setting up a location based preferred digital and/or physical environment. The rule attributed to a specific defined area may be associated with a specific user of the wearable electronic device being present in the specific defined area. Alternatively, the rule attributed to the area <b>14</b> may be to control router settings of a router such that wireless communication of data between the router and one or more wearable electronic devices is controlled (e.g. prevented, allowed, limited, reported, etc.), optionally for specific applications and/or digital services. This may prevent, e.g., receiving messages or notifications on a smart device, thereby facilitating a location-based privacy. This may also prevent or limit the use of specific applications and/or digital services such as video streaming services or games.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0061">The indoor position module may be configured to wirelessly communicate with a smart home controller to determine characteristics of the wireless signals, such as a signal strength, allowing determining the indoor position of the wearable electronic device <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the indoor positioning module may be configured to communicate with an external electronic device having a known position in the home, such as a BLE sensor or a UWB sensor, or the like, wherein the external electronic device communicates with the smart home controller. The indoor positioning module may be an active physical tag, such as an ultra-wideband, UWB, module. The UWB module may preferably be built into the wearable electronic device <b>12</b>. Apart from being capable of transmitting a relatively large amount of data per time unit, UWB may allow determining positions down to centimeter precision. It is appreciated that such a precision may be comparable to the physical dimensions of the wearable electronic device <b>12</b>. Should even higher precision being desired and/or possible, either by UWB or other similar means, a location of the wearable electronic device <b>12</b> may refer to a center of mass of the wearable electronic device <b>12</b>. Another example of an active physical tag is a Bluetooth low energy, BLE, module, typically built into the wearable electronic device <b>12</b>. When using a single active physical tag, measurements of distances, directions and orientations may be possible. This may be further facilitated by utilizing beamforming, i.e., by focusing a wireless signal towards a specific receiving device. Alternatively, a plurality of external active physical tags may be possible. In such a situation, the plurality of external active physical tags may be freestanding, hence being separate from the wearable electronic device (although the wearable electronic device may also comprise a BLE and/or UWB module). Such a plurality of external active physical tags may allow trilateration, which may allow to further improve a position accuracy of the wearable electronic device.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0062">Alternatively, the indoor position module may communicate with an external passive physical tag. By way of example, the external passive physical tag may be a Near-field communication, NFC, tag or a Radio Frequency Identification, RFID, communication tag. Hence, when the wearable electronic device is located in vicinity of such an NFC module having a known position, the wearable electronic device may communicate a relatively well-defined position, provided the wearable electronic device comprises built-in NFC communication means for communicating with the NFC tag. Hence, a stored position of the external passive physical tag may provide a position of the wearable electronic device in response to an established connection between the wearable electronic device and the passive physical tag. To provide an aesthetically pleasing impression, the NFC tag may form an integral part of, e.g., a table, such as being built into a tabletop of the table, or the like. The discussion regarding the NFC tag may equally well apply to an RFID tag, should the indoor position module be an RFID tag. Any adequate passive or active indoor position module is possible within the scope of the claims. This embodiment facilitates an easy way of determining a user position by for example placing the smart phone on such an external passive physical tag to &#x201c;check in&#x201d; at, e.g., the dinner table to automatically apply the rule attributed to the dinner table.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0063">Respective electronic device of the one or more electronic devices may preferably be a smart device and/or a smart home appliance. A smart home appliance is understood being an electronic device connected to other electronic devices or networks via different wireless protocols such as Bluetooth, Zigbee, Thread, NFC, Wi-Fi, LiFi, 5G, etc., that can operate, at least to some extent, interactively and autonomously. A smart home appliance herein may be a dishwasher, a lamp, a blind, a television, a carpet, a motorized window or door, a home alarm system and/or a part of a home alarm system, an oven, a refrigerator, a washing machine, a door lock, etc. A plurality of smart home appliances in a home may form an Internet of Things, IoT, network. Respective smart home appliance in such an loT network may comprise an active physical tag used to estimate the position of a wearable electronic device <b>12</b> in the real-world indoor environment. In the event of the loT network being utilized for such a purpose, the number of freestanding physical tags may be reduced to further facilitate an aesthetically pleasing impression of the real-world indoor environment.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0064">The attributed rule to the defined area <b>14</b> may be set by a user. Alternatively, the rule may be suggested by the smart home system based on a history of user defined rules attributed to similar areas. Alternatively, or additionally, the rule may be estimated by statistical data analysis, a trained neural network or any equivalent type of machine learning, ML, means implemented in the smart home system. In such a case, regions of the real-world indoor environment may be monitored (by radar, mmWave, LiDAR, etc.) in which one or more specific activity zones may be recognized. Such an activity zone may at least partly correspond to the defined area <b>14</b> and may correspond to a specific activity (e.g., eating or watching TV) or a specific type of activity (e.g., socializing or sitting). For instance, if, in an ML implementation, a dining area (dinner table) is recognized, an attributed rule associated with wearable electronic devices within a corresponding activity zone (and/or activity) thereof may be setting the wearable electronic devices in a specific mode, e.g., silent mode. The recognized activity may be, at least in an initial phase of establishing the method <b>100</b> in the smart home system, followed by suggesting a set of rules such that a specific rule may be manually chosen (i.e., a preferable rule) by the user. Hence, a behavior pattern of the user may emerge over time such that another recognized activity zone in the real-world indoor environment may be followed by suggesting a reduced set of rules, or automatically attribute a single rule for the other recognized activity zone. A similar rule attributing procedure may additionally or alternatively be present in a statistical fashion. For instance, if an area <b>14</b> and/or an activity zone associated with the area <b>14</b> has been defined <b>110</b> (by automatic recognition or manually), this may be followed by suggesting a set of rules such that a specific rule may be manually chosen by the user. Over time, statistics of manually chosen rules may be acquired, which may result in suggesting a reduced set of rules in future similar situations. Put in other words, the method <b>100</b> may attribute a rule to the defined area <b>14</b> (e.g., an activity zone) by suggesting a set of rules by means of ML, statistics, or a combination thereof, from which set the user chooses a preferable rule, thereby reducing the set of rules in future suggestions.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0065">The step of defining the area <b>14</b> may comprise detecting a piece of furnishing <b>50</b> by analyzing an image captured by a camera of the wearable electronic device <b>12</b>, displaying, on a display <b>16</b> of the wearable electronic device <b>12</b>, an augmented reality, AR, or virtual reality, VR, representation of the real-world indoor environment with the piece of furnishing <b>50</b> being highlighted, and defining the area as an area being occupied by the piece of furnishing. It should be appreciated that the piece of furnishing may include the case of a group of pieces of furnishing. Such a group of pieces of furnishing may be a sofa set, a dinner table set including a dinner table and dinner chairs, etc. Any other combination of pieces of furnishing forming a group of pieces of furnishing may be applicable, such as a sofa and a coffee table, a coffee table and a carpet, a bed and a bedside table, or the like. An area occupied by such a group of pieces of furnishing may be defined similarly as for the piece of furnishing described elsewhere in this text.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0066">The defined area may be viewed as a base area of a volume extending perpendicular from the base area. Hence, the method <b>100</b>, applicable in a smart home system, may comprise defining, by sensing an indoor position of a wearable electronic device comprising an indoor positioning module, a volume in a real-world indoor environment. The method may hence further comprise attributing a rule to the defined volume, the rule comprising one or more settings to be applied to one or more electronic devices upon a user being detected in the defined volume. The volume may have a height corresponding to a distance between a flooring and a ceiling of the real-world indoor environment. Other heights may be equally possible, such as heights being in a span of 0.5-1.5 meters, etc.</p><p id="p-0061" num="0067">The piece of furnishing may be a sofa, a carpet, a chair, a dinner table, a coffee table <b>50</b>, a bed, or the like. Hence, it is understood that the term &#x201c;piece of furnishing&#x201d; comprises any piece of furniture. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, the piece of furnishing is exemplified by a table <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0068">The camera may be any digital camera, such as a digital camera built into a smart device. The image captured by the camera may thereby be a digital image. The AR or VR representation of the real-world environment may visualize and/or augment a set of candidate objects within the real-world environment that may have their services configured. The user may view such an AR or VR representation through a set of smart glasses. Hence, the real-world indoor environment may be viewed through a transparent display on which objects may be augmented. The user may optionally choose such an object manually to be added to the set of candidate objects. The AR or VR representation of the real-world indoor environment may allow to select a specific piece of furnishing <b>50</b> within the AR or VR representation of the real-world indoor environment such that the area <b>14</b> occupied by the specific piece of furnishing <b>50</b> may be defined. Whenever the piece of furnishing, in the AR- or VR representation of the real-world indoor environment, is highlighted, it is understood that the piece of furnishing <b>50</b> is colored in a relatively distinct color, or that the piece of furnishing <b>50</b> is colored in its real color(s) whereas its surroundings is gray-scaled, or the like. Alternatively, the highlighting may be any adequate way of distinguishing the piece of furnishing, such as artificial rendering of a surface of the piece of furnishing <b>50</b> by a pattern being possibly periodic, pronouncing an edge of the piece of furnishing, etc. The type of highlighting, e.g., color, type of pattern, etc., may indicate which rule should be applied. Optionally, the user may acknowledge whether the piece of furnishing <b>50</b> is a desired piece of furnishing, and/or whether an edge of the piece of furnishing coincides with reality, etc. In connection with the AR highlighting, information concerning a current state and settings of the highlighted object may be communicated to the user. A current state of the highlighted object may include which rule is attributed to the highlighted object and further information of that rule. The settings may, e.g., include a time period during which the rule shall apply. This will be further described below. The defined area may be a vertical projection of the piece of furnishing such that an outermost circumferential edge of, e.g., a tabletop of a table defines a floor area <b>14</b><i>b </i>which the table <b>50</b> is considered to occupy. This scenario is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. The area may, equally plausible, be defined by the area spanned by intersections between free ends <b>54</b> of a set of table legs <b>52</b> and the floor <b>20</b>. By way of example, provided the table <b>50</b> comprises four legs <b>52</b> arranged such that the intersections form a rectangle, the defined area <b>14</b><i>a </i>may be the rectangle in question.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0069">To build or load a spatial representation (i.e. calculating/determining a 3d space) of the real-world indoor environment and objects, such as pieces of furnishing, therein, an electronic device having AR capabilities, e.g., the wearable electronic device, combined with a position sensitive sensor, possibly built into the wearable electronic device, may be used. The digital camera may detect a set of feature points in a first captured digital image while the digital camera is located on a first location. Preferably, the set of feature points in the captured digital image are relatively distinct in that the feature points comprise one or more corners of a piece of furnishing, a center of a small object having a relatively large difference in color compared to a color of its nearby surroundings, or the like. By changing the location of the digital camera while maintaining a substantially similar view angle, a second captured digital image may comprise at least a portion of the set of feature points to be detected. From the positions of the feature points of the first and the second captured digital image a transformation matrix may be calculated. The transformation matrix may include a translation, rotation and scaling, where scaling may be applicable should the first and the second digital image be captured using different zoom settings of the digital camera. Hence, a spatial representation of the real-world indoor environment may be calculated using an ordinary digital camera. Once a spatial representation of a piece of furnishing has been determined, an area on which the piece of furnishing occupies may be readily be obtained by, e.g., projecting 3D coordinates of the piece of furnishing to a horizontal plane, i.e., a flooring of the real-world indoor environment. Alternatively, the digital camera may be supported by a positioning sensor to further facilitate calculation of the spatial representation, and thereby an area occupied by a piece of furnishing. A LiDAR sensor may alternatively be used to calculate the spatial representation of the real-world indoor environment. If using a LiDAR, a single LiDAR sensor position may be enough to capture coordinates representing the real-space indoor environment. A flooring area occupied by a piece of furnishing may thus be calculated similarly as per the above, i.e., a vertical projection of a point cloud, captured by the LiDAR, representing the piece of furnishing in question. By using the position of the wearable electronic device (determined by the positioning sensor of the wearable electronic device) and the above mentioned alternatives of determining positions for objects relative to the position of the wearable electronic device, a coordinate system of the home and the objects therein may be determined. The positioning sensor of the wearable electronic device may include an UWB/BLE sensor or a GPS sensor, or any other suitable sensor for determining an indoor location of the wearable electronic device. Alternatively, a spatial representation of the real-world indoor environment and objects therein may be generated utilizing the wearable electronic device for measuring distances to points in the environment. Combined with distances to beacons and/or cameras may allow to determine the defined area from positions of the beacons and/or cameras.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0070">The method may further allow to define a threshold distance D<b>1</b> with respect to the defined area such that the rule may be applied also when the user and/or the wearable electronic device <b>12</b> is located within the threshold distance from the defined area. The threshold distance D<b>1</b> may be such that it defines an edge <b>32</b> of a second defined area <b>30</b> configured to cover the defined area <b>14</b>. The threshold distance D<b>1</b> may be a shortest distance between a specific point of the edge <b>32</b> and an edge <b>22</b> of the defined area <b>14</b>. The threshold distance D<b>1</b> may vary between the defined area <b>14</b> and the second defined area <b>30</b>. Hence, the second defined area <b>30</b> does not necessarily be a simple linear scaling of the defined area <b>14</b> but may have a different geometrical shape. By way of example, the defined area <b>14</b> may be rectangular while the second defined area <b>30</b> may be circular or elliptical, or vice versa. Hence, when the wearable electronic device and/or the user is/are located in a region being vertically displaced from the defined area, the rule attributed to the defined area may be applied. Hence the region may be any three-dimensional, 3D, coordinate located within a vertical pillar having the defined area as its base area; see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref>. Preferably, the base area is a floor area of a flooring of the indoor real-space environment. Optionally, the user may adjust boundaries of the defined area <b>14</b> such as scaling the defined area, changing geometry of the defined area <b>14</b>, shift a center of the defined area <b>14</b>, or the like.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0071">In connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref> there are shown examples of how to define the area. The step of defining the area <b>14</b> in the real-world indoor environment may comprise defining corners <b>70</b> of the area <b>14</b> by sensing positions <b>10</b> of the wearable electronic device <b>12</b> upon actuation of corner setting inputs being registered. A corner setting input may be an input set by the user while the wearable electronic device is located on a corner <b>70</b> of the area <b>14</b> to be defined. The corners <b>70</b> of the area <b>14</b> may be corners of a rectangle if the area is rectangular, e.g., for a rectangular table associated with a rectangular defined area <b>14</b>. Hence, the number of corners may be four. However, any number of corners is possible. The area may be defined by an area enclosed by the corners <b>70</b>, wherein each adjacent pair of corners are connected by a straight line. Hence, provided four corners are considered, these four corners may be associated with four interconnected straight lines. The skilled person appreciates that, given a set of corners located such that spanning an area, a plurality of combination of straight lines may be possible, except for when the number of corners is three, i.e., spanning a triangle. However, generally, the area in question may be such that the straight lines are arranged to maximize the area to be defined by the corners <b>70</b>. Provided a rectangular geometry is to be defined, the method <b>100</b> may allow defining only three corners, whereafter the fourth corner may be calculated by utilizing symmetry properties of a rectangle. This may be equally plausible with any other geometry having certain symmetry properties. It should be further appreciated that a rectangle may be defined upon defining an even smaller number of corners provides information of orientation of the area, etc. is communicated. For each corner <b>70</b>, the wearable electronic device <b>12</b> may communicate its own location <b>10</b> with the smart home controller such that the smart home controller registers the location of the wearable electronic device <b>12</b>, and thereby the location of the defined area. The wearable electronic device <b>12</b> may communicate its own location <b>10</b> with the smart home controller by, e.g., a built-in UWB module. Alternatively, or additionally, an image sensor with a known position, forming part of a camera or a radar-based device such as LiDAR or mmWave, may be used to determine the locations <b>10</b> of the wearable electronic device <b>12</b> such that the corners <b>70</b> per the above may be determined.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0072">Alternatively, the user may place the wearable electronic device on a specific location, whereby a dome around the location is established forming a region in which the rule is attributed. In such a situation, a radius of the doom may be automatically estimated, or manually set by the user.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0073">The step of defining the area in the real-world indoor environment may comprise defining a center <b>80</b> of the area <b>14</b> by sensing positions of the wearable electronic device <b>12</b> upon actuation of center setting input being registered. This is demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>. The center <b>80</b> of the area <b>14</b> may be a center of mass of the area <b>80</b>. Defining a center <b>80</b> of the area <b>14</b> may be desirable if a circular area is to be defined. In such a situation, the wearable electronic device <b>12</b> may communicate its own location <b>10</b> while physically being located on the center <b>80</b> of an intended circular area <b>14</b>. Further, a user may provide a desirable radius of the intended circular geometry, such that the circular area may be defined. The skilled person appreciates that a circular or elliptic area may be defined from a set of coordinates. For instance, given that a plurality of coordinates have been communicated with the smart home controller, the smart home controller may interpolate the plurality of points to estimate or approximate any desirable geometry, e.g., a circle or an ellipse. Such an interpolation may, e.g., include a least square method or the like. Alternatively, the wearable electronic device <b>12</b> may itself, from the plurality of coordinates, estimate or approximate a set of parameters associated with a circle or an ellipse, the set of parameters comprising, e.g., a center, focal points, a radius, major/minor axes, etc. The skilled person appreciates that this reasoning is applicable to any other adequate geometry of the area to be defined.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0074">The method may further comprise at least one of defining an extension of the area by registering an extension input and defining a shape of the area by registering a shape input. The extension of the area may depend on a size of the object. The extension of the area may scale linearly with the size of the object. The extension of the area may be in a plane of the defined area <b>14</b> and/or along an extension perpendicular to the defined area <b>14</b>, e.g., along a vertical extension from the defined area <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0075">The method <b>100</b> may further comprise prompting a user to define the area in the real-world indoor environment by displaying an instruction on a display <b>16</b> of the wearable electronic device <b>12</b>. The instruction may be an instruction video displayed on a display of the wearable electronic device. This feature is equivalently applicable should the wearable electronic device <b>12</b> lack a display, which may be the case for, e.g., smart jewelry, etc. In such a situation the instruction may be displayed on a display connected to the wearable electronic device, the display possibly being a display of a smartphone, of AR- or VR glasses, or the like. Alternatively, or in combination, the instruction may be a text instruction. Alternatively, or in combination, the instruction may be an animation displayed on a display. Alternatively, or in combination, the instruction may be a voice instruction.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0076">The rule may further comprise a time period during which the rule is to be applied to the one or more electronic devices. Returning to the above-mentioned example regarding the dinner table, the rule may, apart from being attributed in connection with a vertically extending region having a base area spanned by a vertical projection of the dinner table (possibly extended as described above), also be limited to a time period, preferably being a time period coinciding with a typical dinner time. The time period may be set manually by the user, or estimated, where the estimation may be based on a history of time periods during which dinner is eaten. Should there be a plurality of involved wearable electronic devices, respective wearable electronic device may be associated with differing time periods, if desirable. The time period may be any adequate time period, such as a periodically occurring time period, i.e., the same time period for every day. Alternatively, the time period may occur on a single day every week, a plurality of days every week, etc. The time period may be subject to a schedule, the schedule possibly being non-periodic.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0077">The method may further comprise storing the defined area and the rule attributed thereto in a database comprising defined areas and rules attributed thereto. The database may be stored in a smart home controller. The smart home controller may e.g. be an Internet of Things, loT, hub (gateway, etc.,), or any type of cloud service. Alternatively, or in combination, the defined area <b>14</b> and the rule attributed thereto may be stored on the wearable electronic device <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0078">Disclosed herein is also a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored thereon instructions for implementing the method <b>100</b> having the features described above, when executed on a device having processing capabilities.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0079">In connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, there is, highly schematically, shown a smart home controller <b>200</b> comprising circuitry <b>210</b> configured to execute an area defining function <b>212</b> configured to, based on an indoor position received from a wearable electronic device <b>12</b>, define an area <b>14</b> in a real-world indoor environment, and a rule attributing function <b>214</b> configured to attribute a rule to the defined area <b>14</b>, the rule comprising one or more settings to be applied to one or more electronic devices upon a user being detected in the defined area. The smart home controller <b>200</b> may be an Internet of Things, IoT, hub, or any type of cloud service.

As also described to some extent above, when an object or a user is located &#x201c;in the defined area&#x201d; is to be understood as the object or the user is located in a three-dimensional, 3D, region being located vertically above the defined area.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0081">The detection of the presence of the user in the defined area <b>14</b> may be done by an image sensor. Such an image sensor may form part of an image capturing device such as a digital camera, a depth camera, a LiDAR, a millimeter wave radar, mmWave, an infrared camera, or the like. Yet again, returning to the example of the dinner table as per the above, the presence of the user sitting at the dinner table may be detected as soon as a vertical projection of a portion of a volume of the user is located within the defined area in connection with the dinner table. Alternatively, also briefly described above, the dinner table may be associated with a threshold distance D<b>1</b>, such that presence may be detected as soon as the user is located within the threshold distance D<b>1</b> from the defined area <b>14</b>. Such a threshold distance D<b>1</b> may be of the order of a decimeter or a meter. The detection of the presence of the user may alternatively be done by a positioning module in a wearable electronic device <b>12</b> carried by the user. Such a positioning module may be as described above, e.g., being a UWB or BLE module built into the wearable electronic device <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0082">The one or more electronic devices to be controlled in accordance with the rule may comprise a plurality of electronic devices, wherein the rule comprises one or more individual settings for each electronic device of the plurality of electronic devices. By way of example, the plurality of electronic devices may comprise one or more smart devices. Alternatively, or in combination, the plurality of electronic devices may include a router, and/or one or more smart home appliances. An individual setting of an electronic device may include turning off the electronic device, setting the electronic device in &#x201c;stand by&#x201d; mode, or the like.

Alternatively, or additionally, the availability of a service may be to control a router. In such a situation, the Wi-Fi communication between the router and a wearable electronic device associated with respective user may be turned off as soon as one or more users are detected in the defined area. The control of an availability of a service of the one or more electronic devices may, apart from facilitating privacy and encouraging human interaction, save electrical power.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0084">The one or more settings may be set to control a physical state of the one or more electronic devices. A physical state as referred to herein may be one or more of an electronic device being on or off. A physical state as referred to herein may be a light level of a light emitting electronic device such as a lamp, a television, a display, or a light adjusting electronic device for controlling a light scene. The light adjusting electronic device being, e.g., an electronically controlled blind. A physical state as referred to herein may be a sound level of a sound emitting device such as turning off a kitchen fan, a set of loudspeakers, a doorbell, etc. A physical state as referred to herein may be a heat level such as controlling an air conditioner, a radiator system, or the like. Another example of a physical state may be locking/unlocking a front door and possibly windows of a home, and activation/deactivation of a home alarm system. Hence, another scenario may take place at night, such that when all users have gone to bed, the front door may be locked, and the home alarm system may be activated. This may facilitate a safe home. A related scenario may take place when a user comes home from work/school, whereby the front door may be unlocked, and the home alarm system may be deactivated. Such a deactivation may include additional security such as, e.g., voice/face/eye/fingerprint recognition being communicated by the wearable electronic device to obscure entrance in the home for intruders.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0085">The control of a physical state of the one or more electronic devices may facilitate saving electrical power. For instance, if all family members of a family sits around the dinner table in a living room or in a kitchen, ceiling lights, television(s), computers, etc. in remaining spaces of the home may be turned off, set in sleep mode or the like. In some embodiments, the rule may thus specify which users/devices that needs to be detected within a specific area in order for the rule to apply.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0086">The method <b>300</b> may further comprise detecting an activation of a physical toggle button, wherein the act of controlling the one or more electronic devices is to be performed on a condition that the activation of the physical toggle button is detected. The physical toggle button may be stationary positioned in the real-world indoor environment. The real-world indoor environment may comprise a plurality of physical toggle buttons. By way of example, each room in the home may have a physical toggle button. For example, the physical toggle button may be located in proximity to a bed in a bedroom or in proximity to a dining table in a dining room. This may facilitate enhanced security of the home, saving of electrical power, etc. Alternatively, the physical toggle button may be mobile. In case of a mobile physical toggle button the setting to be applied by activating the physical toggle button may be set to vary depending on the location of the mobile physical toggle button.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0087">The method <b>300</b> may further comprise detecting a predetermined user gesture, wherein the act of controlling the one or more electronic devices is to be performed on a condition that the predetermined user gesture is detected.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0088">A user gesture may generally be captured by an imaging sensor to determine skeletal and joint coordinates of the body of the user. The imaging sensor may form part of a camera, a LiDAR, an mmWave, an RGBD device, or the like. The determined skeletal and joint coordinates may be mapped against a predetermined set of coordinates, i.e., a set of predetermined user gestures. Detecting the predetermined user gesture may thereby be a best match between the user gesture and the set of predetermined user gestures. The match may depend on a calculated probability. Alternatively, the match may include additional parameters such that situation specific user gestures, e.g., interaction with other objects or users while performing the user gesture.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0089">The predetermined gesture may be raising a hand, e.g., an open hand or a fist, sitting down on a chair, a hand clap, holding up one or more fingers, etc. Another example may be that when the user sits down on an armchair a setting of the wearable electronic device <b>12</b> may be changed or updated, wherein the setting may include turning on or off &#x201c;Private browsing&#x201d;, &#x201c;Silent mode&#x201d;, or the like. This may facilitate accommodation of private regions in a home for a relaxing and/or customized digital environment. Alternatively, sitting down on the armchair may turn on/off a TV, change ceiling lighting, etc. The act of sitting down on a piece of furnishing may trigger different settings to be applied to one or more electronic devices in the smart home system, the different settings depending on (a type of) the piece of furnishing. For instance, sitting on a chair around the dinner table may trigger certain settings to be applied to a specific electronic device, while sitting on an armchair may trigger other settings to the same or another electronic device, etc. This may reduce a number of physical sensors in a home, such as pressure sensors or light sensors, since a user-furniture interaction per the above may effectively function as such an, e.g., presence detecting sensor. The skilled person appreciates that there are numerous alternatives in connection with this feature.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0090">The rule may further comprise a time period during which the rule is applicable, such that method <b>300</b> may comprise determining a time stamp when the user is detected as present in the defined area, wherein the act of controlling is to be performed on a condition that the determined time is within the time period. Yet again, by considering the example of the dinner table, the time stamp may be determined in response to the user sitting down on a chair in connection with the dinner table. Thereafter the one or more electronic devices may be controlled according to the above description during a time period. The time period may be any adequate time period, such as 30 minutes, one or more hours, etc. The time period may be manually set by the user. Alternatively, the method may determine the time period by comparison against a history of typical time periods applicable to dinners in connection with the dinner table. Should the user, or all users of a plurality of users if applicable, have left the dinner table before the time period have expired, the rule may be terminated. A termination of the rule may thereby include setting the one or more electronic devices in a state similar to or same as prior to the time stamp of a start of the time period, e.g., before dinner time. This &#x201c;reversing&#x201d; may alternatively or additionally further be applied in situations where the rule is not associated with a time period. That is, the rule may be applied once a user enters the defined area associated with the dinner table, while the rule is terminated to set the one or more electronic devices in a state similar to as prior to the user entered the defined area.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0091">The act of detecting presence of the user may comprise at least one of detecting an indoor position of a wearable electronic device attributed to the user, detecting a position of a physical tag attributed to the user, and monitoring the defined area by a camera. As per the above, the indoor position of a wearable electronic device may be detecting by any standard wireless communication means such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc. A preferable wireless communication means may be an UWB module built into the wearable electronic device <b>12</b>, facilitating detecting the indoor position with a relatively high accuracy, such as decimeter- or even centimeter accuracy. It is to be noted that a bandwidth of today's UWB technology may be further extended in the future, and thereby possibly providing a higher position accuracy than being possible today, i.e., at the date of filing of this disclosure. Hence, any future equivalent of today's UWB may be applicable within the scope of the claims. The physical tag attributed to the user may be a UWB module. In this case, the physical tag, i.e., the UWB tag, is a separate device configured to communicate its position directly or indirectly with a smart home controller. Any other adequate physical tag may be possible within the present scope. For instance, the physical tag may be a Near-field communication, NFC, tag configured to communicate its position to a smart home controller via the wearable electronic device.

As previously described, the wearable electronic device <b>12</b> may be any one of a smartphone <b>12</b>, a smart tag, a smart fob, a smart watch, smart jewelry, a smart ring, etc. The tracking may be done by, e.g., UWB or NFC technologies according to the above-mentioned text. Alternatively, any equivalent to these technologies may be used for tracking. In the event the tracking device being a monitoring camera, the tracking may be done by analyzing digital images captured by the monitoring camera. The tracking may be done locally at the monitoring camera, or in another device such as a cloud server, by the smart home controller or in any other suitable external device receiving the images from the monitoring camera. The monitoring camera may be an ordinary digital camera configured to capture and communicate an ordinary digital image or a digital video stream with the smart home controller <b>400</b>. Alternatively, the monitoring camera may be a depth camera configured to capture a depth image such as an RGBD image. From the digital image the position of the user or the wearable electronic device <b>12</b> may be detected. Such a detection may be facilitated using, e.g., image segmentation and/or a perspective transformation algorithm to determine the position. Further, skeletal motion of the user may be determined to recognize user gestures and control an electronic device accordingly.
