In some embodiments, the electrically conductive tape comprises an electrically conductive backing with a first major surface and a second major surface, and an electrically conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer with a first major surface and a second major surface, where the second major surface of the pressure sensitive adhesive layer is in contact with the first major surface of the electrically conductive backing. The pressure sensitive adhesive comprises an acrylate-based copolymeric matrix, a crosslinker, an electrically conductive filler, and at least one antioxidant. The acrylate-based copolymeric matrix comprises the reaction product of a polymerizable mixture comprising at least one first (meth)acrylate monomer comprising an alkyl(meth)acrylate with a homopolymer Tg of less than &#x2212;50&#xb0; C., and at least one second (meth)acrylate monomer comprising a hydroxyl-functional alkyl(meth)acrylate with a homopolymer Tg of less than &#x2212;10&#xb0; C. The electrically conductive tape is capable of being laminated to and cleanly removed from a substrate surface, after being subjected to at least one of the conditions comprising exposure to a basic cleaning solution at a temperature of from 50-90&#xb0; C. for at least 30 minutes, and subject to plasma vapor deposition conditions including exposure to temperatures of up to 200&#xb0; C. for up 24 hours.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The conductive tape maintains conductivity between the electrically conductive backing and the substrate to which it is applied through the electrically conductive pressure sensitive adhesive layer through-out the processing steps. The electrically conductive backing functions to protect the substrate during processing. The electrically conductive pressure sensitive adhesive ensures that the electrically conductive backing is grounded to the substrate when processed. This helps to ensure that the substrate does not experience poor results related to the electrically conductive backing not being grounded. The electrically conductive pressure sensitive adhesive not only ensures the electrically conductive tape's grounding performance, but also resists the harsh processing environment, and providing clean removal from the substrate surface after processing. For example, the electrically conductive backing needs to be grounded during plasma vapor deposition processing or the vapor deposition material being deposited onto the substrate near the tape will experience non-uniform application results (thickness, appearance, uniformity, etc).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also disclosed are methods of preparing articles. In some embodiments, the method comprises providing a substrate with a surface to which plasma vapor deposition is to be carried out, providing an electrically conductive tape article as described above, cleaning the masked surface with a basic solution comprising application of a basic cleaning solution with a pH of 13-14 at a temperature of 50-100&#xb0; for 30-60 minutes, exposing the masked surface to plasma vapor deposition comprising exposure of the surface to a temperature of 100-200&#xb0; C. for from 2-24 hours, and cleanly removing the electrically conductive tape article from the substrate surface.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Also disclosed are laminated articles. In some embodiments, the laminated article comprises a three-dimensional substrate with at least a first major surface, a second major surface, and a third major surface that define a volume at least partially comprising substrate material, and an electrically conductive tape as described above, where the first major surface of the pressure sensitive adhesive layer is in contact with at least a portion of the first major surface and optionally the second major surface of the substrate to envelope a portion of the volume of the substrate.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present application may be more completely understood in consideration of the following detailed description of various embodiments of the disclosure in connection with the accompanying drawings.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a cross sectional view of an embodiment of an electrically conductive tape article of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a cross sectional view of an article to be masked to form a laminate article of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a cross sectional view of a laminate article of this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a cross sectional view of another laminate article of this disclosure.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the following description of the illustrated embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, in which is shown by way of illustration, various embodiments in which the disclosure may be practiced.

Adhesives are frequently supplied as tapes generally comprise a backing, or substrate, and an adhesive. Adhesive tapes that are used in the manufacture of articles to protect or temporarily hold in place components of the article during processing are sometimes called processing tapes. Processing tapes are not retained in the final article but are removed following one or more processing steps. In some instances, processing tapes are subjected to extreme conditions such as high temperatures, high pressures, exposure to chemicals such as solvents, abrasives, etching materials, and the like and yet are expected to remain adhered during the processing steps without flowing, dripping or slipping and also to be removable after the processing steps are completed. Examples of processing tapes include masking tapes, where the masking tape is applied to a surface to cover it and protect it from a process, such as being painted, the paint is applied, and the masking tape is removed to give a surface with adjacent areas that are painted and unpainted.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">One of the processes that can require masking is Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD). PVD Coating refers to a variety of thin film deposition techniques where a solid material is vaporized in a vacuum environment and deposited on substrates as a pure material or alloy composition coating.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">As the process transfers the coating material as a single atom or on the molecular level, it can provide extremely pure and high-performance coatings which for many applications can be preferable to other methods used. At the heart of every microchip, and semiconductor device, durable protective film, optical lens, solar panel and many medical devices, PVD Coatings provide crucial performance attributes for the final product. It is used in a wide variety of industries like optical applications ranging from eye glasses to self-cleaning tinted windows, photovoltaic applications for solar energy, device applications like computer chips, displays and communications as well as functional or decorative finishes, from durable hard protective films to brilliant gold, platinum or chrome plating.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The two most common Physical Vapor Deposition Coating processes are Sputtering and Thermal Evaporation. Sputtering involves the bombardment of the coating material known as the target with a high energy electrical charge causing it to &#x201c;sputter&#x201d; off atoms or molecules that are deposited on a substrate like a silicon wafer or solar panel. Thermal Evaporation involves elevating a coating material to the boiling point in a high vacuum environment causing a vapor stream to rise in the vacuum chamber and then condense on the substrate.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">Because of the high energy conditions of the PVD process, masking is frequently carried out by physically attaching a masking tool to the surface or by forming a mask on the substrate surface by a coating and curing method. Metal tool masking designs are used as they are longer lasting in PVD processing and also need to be grounded to ensure they do not impact the PVD processing. Each of these methods has drawbacks. Physical attachment can be a ponderous and slow method of masking a surface, and the coating and curing method requires removal of the mask, which can be difficult and time consuming. As manufacturers of articles desire quicker processes with fewer steps, these methods of masking are becoming less and less desirable. Therefore, a quicker and easier method of masking substrate surfaces for high energy processes such as PVD is needed.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this disclosure, electrically conductive masking tapes are described that have the desirable combination of properties of adhering to substrate surfaces, remaining adhered even during the harsh conditions required for PVD processes, providing for the tape to be grounded to the substrate during processing to minimize negative impacts of the tape in the PVD processing, and yet are cleanly removable upon completion of the PVD process. By cleanly removable it is meant that essentially no residue from the tape is left on the substrate surface upon removal. This is an important feature because if residue is left behind, a cleaning step is required to remove it. Residue from the tape can result from a variety of sources. Among the sources of residue: are adhesive flow during the PVD process; adhesion build during the PVD process such that the tape is not easily removed; or degradation of the adhesive polymer causing degradation products to be left on the substrate surface upon removal of the tape.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The electrically conductive masking tapes of this disclosure therefore have the properties of adhering strongly to the substrate surface, the adhesive layer of tape does not flow during processing, and yet the adhesion does not build to such an extent that the tape is not cleanly removable from the substrate surface. Additionally, the tape is able to mask substrates that have three-dimensional surfaces. In this disclosure, three-dimensional surfaces refer to surfaces that are not entirely flat but contains elements that protrude from the substrate surface. The tape is able to envelope these three-dimensional surfaces such that the three-dimensional features of the substrate surface are covered and protected by the tape. The tape is also designed to provide a sharp, clean masking line so that upon removal, the finished PVD processing has left a sharp, clean, defect-free edge to the desired specification limits on the substrate surface. PVD edges can be inspected at various magnification levels to ensure compliance to desired appearance requirement. The resultant masked edge can be inspected at 1&#xd7;, 2&#xd7;, 5&#xd7;, 10&#xd7;, 100&#xd7; magnification based on application needs.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The electrically conductive masking tapes comprise an electrically conductive backing and a pressure sensitive adhesive layer, where the pressure sensitive adhesive layer comprises a (meth)acrylate-based matrix, a crosslinking agent, an electrically conductive filler, and an antioxidant.

three times with a tissue wetted with isopropanol using heavy hand pressure. The cleaned panels were air dried for 10 min. 25.4 mm&#xd7;200 mm adhesive tape samples were placed onto the stainless steel panels, and a 1 kg rubber roller was rolled back and forth once on top of the tape to adhere the tape sample to the surface of the stainless steel panel.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0062">Aging conditions: Tape samples were cut into 1 inch (25.4 mm) wide strips, and the strips were then adhered to the surface of stainless steel panels as described above. The test panels were put into an oven at room temperature. The oven was then heated up to 150&#xb0; C., and the samples were held at 150&#xb0; C. for 8 hrs.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0063">Cleaning conditions: The 1 inch (25.4 mm) wide tape strips were adhered to the surface of stainless steel panels as described above. A NaOH aqueous solution having a pH of 13-14 was prepared and heated to 85-90&#xb0; C. The test panels were immersed in the heated base solution for 30 min, then rinsed with water. 180&#xb0; peel force test (23&#xb0; C., 60% Relative Humidity): All samples were held at a temperature of 23&#xb0; C. and a relative humidity of 60% for 20 min prior to peel testing at room temperature. Procedures of the room temperature peel force tests are as described in ASTM International Standard D3330-04(2018), &#x201c;Standard Test Method for Peel Adhesion of Pressure-Sensitive Tape.&#x201d; Peel strength tests were performed using an INSTRON tensile tester (available from Instron, Norwood, Mass., US) at a peeling speed of 304.8 mm/min. For the purposes of these examples, tapes are considered to be &#x201c;easily removable&#x201d; when the peel strength is less than 0.6 N/mm.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0064">Removability: Removability of the adhesive was assessed by examining the amount of residue on the stainless steel after testing. The removability rating scale ranged from 0 (large amounts or adhesive left on the surface throughout the adhered area) to 5 (no visible residue remaining on the stainless steel surface). For a removability rating of 4, the residual adhesive on the stainless surface was approximately 0-5% of the total adhered area. For removability ratings of 3, 2 and 1, the residue adhesive on the stainless surface was 5-10%, 10-15% and &#x3e;15% of the adhered area, respectively.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0065">Conductivity (XY-Axis Electrical Resistance through Adhesive): A strip of the electrically conductive tape (10 mm&#xd7;50 mm) was placed with adhesive side down between the electrodes on special PCB board. The electrodes are gold plated copper surface (ENIG: Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold plated). The size of PCB board is 50 (X-axis) mm&#xd7;75 (Y-axis) mm and the thickness is 1.6 mm. The electrode on the board has a 10 mm width. The distance between electrodes is 30 mm. After initial hand lamination to provide for a 10 mm&#xd7;10 mm contact area between the tape and electrodes, a 2 kg rubber roller was applied across the tape one time. These application methods simulate a typical manufacturing process that might be used to apply the tapes to a surface. After 20 minutes of dwell time, the DC resistance between the electrodes was measured with a micro-ohm meter. The resistance results are recorded after 5-30 seconds as initial resistance.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0066">For the conductivity test method and substrate shown, the preferred range of contact resistance is &#x3c;2000 mOhms, preferably &#x3c;700 mOhms and most preferred resistance is &#x3c;300 mOhms and even &#x3c;50 mOhms. The conductivity levels and preferred ranges can vary based on surface type and if the surface of the test method noted was changed to different metal. Changes such as replacing the gold plated surface (ENIG) to a 316 stainless steel surface with no additional plating, would cause the conductivity values to shift in a ratio from the values for the current test method substrate, and would involve using an updated test method with the different test substrate: (for example 316 stainless steel, 304 stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, etc versus the currently used ENIG substrate) based on the exact substrate used for a specific application being masked.</p><heading id="h-0011" level="2">Results</heading><p id="p-0072" num="0067">Table 5 summarizes the peel test results on samples before and after cleaning in 85-90 C NaOH solution and after aging at 150&#xb0; C. for 8 hours.
