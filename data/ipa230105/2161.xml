The system pre-estimates a dimension required by all of the merchandise according to an order data, and selects a sheet material according to the size to form a finished container. The dimension of the unfolded sheet material before folding into the finished container is quite small. In terms of warehouse space utilization, a space required by a single finished and folded box is able to stack dozens of sheet materials, so that the warehousing efficiency is greatly improved.

In other words, the system decides the sheet material to be folded according to needs only when receiving the order data. The sheet material has a small dimension (which is generally a flat paperboard) before folding and easy to stack. In terms of warehouse space utilization, a space required by a single finished and folded box is able to stack dozens of sheet materials, so that the warehousing efficiency is greatly improved and a dynamic storage logistic can be achieved. Furthermore, once the sheet material is formed into the container, the folding, loading, sealing and shipping processes are performed, which means that the time a folded box retained in the warehousing facility is short. Due to the configurations of the box folding module and the sealing module, an on-demand box supplying can be achieved without human presence on-site, so that the packing efficiency is effectively improved, and the warehousing space needed for storage is reduced.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><us-claim-statement>What is claimed is:</us-claim-statement><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
