obtained by polymerizing a monomer composition M, comprising at least one tert-butyl acrylate and/or tert-butyl methacrylate monomer, by radical emulsion polymerization.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The presently claimed invention relates to the use of an aqueous polymer latex as a binder or co-binder in a waterborne coating composition, wherein the aqueous polymer latex is obtained by polymerizing a monomer composition M, comprising at least one tert-butyl acrylate and/or tert-butyl methacrylate monomer, by radical emulsion polymerization. The waterborne coating composition essentially contains a titanium dioxide pigment.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) is frequently used as a pigment in water-borne coating compositions, such as latex paints. Besides whiteness, TiO<sub>2 </sub>provides opacity or hiding power to the coating, which means that the coating is opaque and conceals an undersurface or substrate surface to which the coating is applied. The opacifying capacity or hiding power of such a coating or paint is a measure of the coating's ability to conceal a surface to which the coating is applied.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It was found that the opacifying capacity is a function of the spacing between the particles of opacifying pigment in the dried applied coating. The opacifying capacity of a coating is maximized when the light scattering capability of the opacifying pigment, namely TiO<sub>2</sub>, is maximized. Maxi-mum light scattering efficiency occurs when the TiO<sub>2 </sub>pigment particles have a certain spacing, so that the light scattering capability of each particle does not interfere with the light scattering capability of its neighboring particles. This condition may occur in coatings containing sufficiently low levels of TiO<sub>2 </sub>such that the individual TiO<sub>2 </sub>particles are isolated from each other. The coatings containing such low levels of TiO<sub>2</sub>, however, do not provide sufficient whiteness and hiding at typical dried coating thicknesses. Achieving the desired levels of hiding and whiteness typically requires higher levels of TiO<sub>2</sub>. At these higher levels, a statistical distribution of TiO<sub>2 </sub>particles occurs, which results in at least some of the TiO<sub>2 </sub>particles being in such close proximity to one another that there is a loss of light scattering efficiency due to crowding of the opacifying pigment particles. In short, the efficacy of the TiO<sub>2 </sub>pigment as a hiding or opacifying pigment is reduced, when the TiO<sub>2 </sub>particles are not homogeneously dispersed in the coating composition. In fact, TiO<sub>2 </sub>particles tend to agglomerate upon film formation and drying. It has been suggested that the opacifying capacity of a coating can be improved by employing a polymer latex binder that promotes the homogeneity of the TiO<sub>2 </sub>particle distribution and that promotes the interaction between binder and pigments.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">EP 1 398 333 A1 discloses that the spacing of TiO<sub>2 </sub>pigment particles and its resultant efficiency can be improved by employing a multistage polymer latex comprising a first polymer having polymerized units of multi-ethylenically unsaturated monomers and at least one pendant absorbing group selected from phosphorous acid groups, phosphorous acid full-ester groups, polyacid side chains, and a second polymer which is essentially free of such pendant absorbing groups. In order to achieve acceptable hiding power, the polymer dispersions of EP 1 398 333 A1 require expensive phosphorous containing monomers. Moreover, the coating formulations are not always stable and tend to flocculate resulting in the formation of grit in the coatings.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">EP 2 426 155 A1 discloses an aqueous multistage polymer dispersion containing polymerized units of phosphorous-containing acid monomers. The polymer dispersions are prepared by emulsion polymerization, where the phosphor containing acid monomers are added pulse-wise at an early stage of the emulsion polymerization. The multistage polymer dispersions are capable of absorbing TiO<sub>2 </sub>pigment particles and used for preparing so-called pre-composites of the TiO<sub>2 </sub>pigment and the aqueous multistage polymer dispersion. These pre-composites can be used in water-borne paints. The multistage polymer dispersions are suggested to achieve improved hiding power at acceptable scrub resistance and grit formation.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">WO 2013/116318 A1 discloses a process for preparing aqueous multistage polymer dispersions containing polymerized units of phosphor containing acid monomers, polymerized units of a carboxylic acid or sulfur acid monomer and polymerized units of a multi-ethylenically unsaturated monomer. The process is performed as an emulsion polymerization of a monomer emulsion in a preformed polymer dispersion, which comprises the polymerized units of phosphor containing acid monomers, polymerized units of a carboxylic acid or sulfur acid monomer and polymerized units of a multi-ethylenically unsaturated monomer. Based on the total polymer, the majority of phosphor containing acid monomers and polymerized units of a multi-ethylenically unsaturated monomer are contained in the preformed polymer dispersion. The polymer dispersions of WO 2013/116318 A1 are used for preparing pre-composites of the TiO<sub>2 </sub>pigment particles and should provide improved compatibility with TiO<sub>2 </sub>pigment particles and reduced grit formation.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to WO 2013/040040 A1 grit formation in paints, which contain pre-composites of the TiO<sub>2 </sub>pigments and polymer latices, can be reduced, if the pre-composites of the TiO<sub>2 </sub>pigment are prepared by a two-step process, wherein the first step an aqueous slurry of a TiO<sub>2 </sub>pigment is contacted with an absorbing polymer latex, as described in EP 1 398 333 A1 or EP 2 426 155 A1, at a high pH in order to inhibit interaction between the TiO<sub>2 </sub>pigment and the absorbing polymer latex particles and subsequently in a second step the pH is lowered to promote interaction between the TiO<sub>2 </sub>pigment and the absorbing polymer latex particles. According to EP 2692752 A1 grit formation in paints, which contain pre-composites of the TiO<sub>2 </sub>pigments and polymer latices and associative thickeners, can be reduced, if the TiO<sub>2 </sub>pigment particles contain a water-soluble dispersant comprising structural units of a sulfonic acid monomer adsorbed on the surface of the pigment particles. This method suffers from the use of specific dispersants, which are not readily commercially available. The synthesis of the dispersants requires multiple solvents and specialty monomers.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The means suggested by prior art for improving the hiding or opacifying efficacy of the TiO<sub>2 </sub>pigments are not satisfactory, as either the absorbing polymer dispersion requires expensive phosphorous containing monomers for achieving acceptable hiding or opacifying efficacy and flocculation stability or require expensive dispersants or tedious methods of preparing the TiO<sub>2 </sub>pigment/polymer pre-composites.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, it is an object of the presently claimed invention to provide an aqueous polymer dispersion, which is capable of promoting a homogeneous distribution of the TiO<sub>2 </sub>pigments and which promotes the interaction between binder and pigments. The aqueous polymer dispersions should not require expensive phosphor containing monomers in order to achieve a good hiding/opacifying efficacy. Moreover, the aqueous polymer dispersions should provide for a good stability of the coating compositions and do not tend to form grit.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Surprisingly, it was found that the use of an aqueous polymer latex as a binder or co-binder in a waterborne coating composition, wherein the aqueous polymer latex is obtained by polymerizing a monomer composition M, comprising at least one tert-butyl acrylate and/or tert-butyl methacrylate monomer, by radical emulsion polymerization lead to a good hiding power/opacifying efficacy.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, the first aspect of the presently claimed invention is directed to the use of an aqueous polymer latex as a binder or co-binder in a waterborne coating composition, which contains a titanium dioxide pigment, wherein the aqueous polymer latex is obtained by polymerizing a monomer composition M by radical emulsion polymerization, wherein the monomer composition M comprises:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0013">a) &#x2265;40.0 wt. % to &#x2264;79.8 wt. % of t-butyl acrylate or t-butyl methacrylate;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0014">b) &#x2265;20 wt. % to &#x2264;59.8 wt. % of n-butyl acrylate,</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0015">c) &#x2265;0.1 wt. % to &#x2264;3.0 wt. % of at least one mono-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid having 3 to 6 carbon atoms;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0016">d) &#x2265;0.1 wt. % to &#x2264;3.0 wt. % acrylamide and/or meth acrylamide derivatives.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0014" num="0017">The second aspect of the presently claimed invention is directed to an aqueous coating composition comprising:<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0018">i) at least one aqueous polymer latex as defined as in first aspects; and</li>        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0019">ii) a titanium dioxide pigment.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0015" num="0020">The third aspect of the presently claimed invention is directed to an aqueous polymer latex which is obtained by polymerizing a monomer composition M by radical emulsion polymerization, wherein the monomer composition M comprises:<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0021">a) &#x2265;40.0 wt. % to &#x2264;79.8 wt. % of t-butyl acrylate or t-butyl methacrylate;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0022">b) &#x2265;20 wt. % to &#x2264;59.8 wt. % of n-butyl acrylate,</li>        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0023">c) &#x2265;0.1 wt. % to &#x2264;3.0 wt. % of at least one mono-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acid having 3 to 6 carbon atoms;</li>        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0024">d) &#x2265;0.1 wt. % to &#x2264;3.0 wt. % acrylamide and/or meth acrylamide derivatives.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0016" num="0025">Before the present compositions and formulations of the presently claimed invention are described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular compositions and formulations described, since such compositions and formulation may, of course, vary.

For conditioning, the polymers are poured out, dried over-night, then dried at 120&#xb0; C. in a vacuum drying cabinet for 1 h. At measurement, the sample is heated to 150&#xb0; C., cooled rapidly, and then measured on heating at 20&#xb0; C./min up to 150&#xb0; C. The value reported is the mid point temperature.</p><p id="p-0100" num="0180">Average particle diameter: The weight-average particle diameter is measured by HDC (Hydrodynamic Chromatography fractionation). HDC measurements are carried out using a PL-PSDA particle size distribution analyzer (Polymer Laboratories, Inc.), by injecting a small amount of sample into an aqueous eluent containing an emulsifier, resulting in a concentration of approx. 0.5 WI and pumping the resulting mixture through a glass capillary tube of approx. 15 mm diameter packed with polystyrene spheres. As determined by their hydrodynamic diameter, smaller particles can sterically access regions of slower flow in capillaries, such that on average the smaller particles experience slower elution flow. The fractionation can be finally monitored using e.g. an UV-de-tector which measured the extinction at a fixed wavelength of 254 nm.</p><p id="p-0101" num="0181">Solid contents: The solids content was determined by drying the sample and measuring its dry weight. Therefore, a solids content device Satorius MA 45 was used with constant weight program. A sample of 1.5 g was prepared in a tared small aluminum pan with glass fiber pad and covered with a cap. The drying program &#x201c;120&#xb0; C. Automatic&#x201d; is started. The glass fiber pad is pre-dried with the same program. Every sample solids content is calculated by a double determina-tion.</p><p id="p-0102" num="0182">Opacity Testing:</p><p id="p-0103" num="0183">Test 1</p><p id="p-0104" num="0184">On a Leneta card, the paints were applied with 3 different wet film thicknesses (50 &#x3bc;m, 100 &#x3bc;m and 150 &#x3bc;m) and subsequently dried for 24 h at 23&#xb0; C. and 50% relative humidity.</p><p id="p-0105" num="0185">The contrast ratio (Rb/Rw) was determined spectrophotometrically as the ratio of reflected light from the coating over the black portions (Rb) and the white portions (Rw) of the card expressed as a percentage.
