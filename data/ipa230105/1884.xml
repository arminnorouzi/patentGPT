For example, many vehicles have detection sensors built into seatbelt latches that trigger an alert when the vehicles are driving without a seatbelt clip inserted. Such systems can be fooled by occupants placing fake seatbelt clips (e.g., not connected to seatbelts) into the buckles.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">More recently, advanced systems of seatbelt misuse detection have been developed. For example, some systems have been developed that determine whether seatbelts cross chests of occupants. These systems can also be fooled by occupants wearing shirts with prints of seatbelts on them (e.g., a stripe going across their chest).</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">This document is directed to techniques and hardware for relative movement-based seatbelt use detection. The techniques may include one or more methods for relative movement-based seatbelt use detection. The hardware may include means (e.g., one or more processors) of performing relative movement-based seatbelt use detection. The hardware may also include computer-readable media (e.g., non-transitory storage media) comprising instructions that, when executed, cause one or more associated systems to perform relative movement-based seatbelt use detection.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some aspects described below include a method. The method includes receiving, from one or more sensors, sensor data indicating attributes of an interior of a vehicle. The method also includes determining, based on the sensor data, that a seatbelt is crossing a chest of an occupant of the vehicle. The method further includes tracking, based on the sensor data, one or more occupant portions of the occupant over time and one or more seatbelt portions of the seatbelt over time. The seatbelt portions correspond to respective ones of the occupant portions. The method also includes determining, based on the tracking, relative movements between the occupant portions and their corresponding seatbelt portions. The method further includes establishing, based on the relative movements, that the seatbelt is a fake seatbelt and outputting, to a vehicle system of the vehicle, an indication of the fake seatbelt.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Some aspects described below include another method. The other method includes receiving image data over time from one or more cameras with fields of view that include an occupant of a vehicle. The other method also includes inputting at least a portion of the image data into a machine-learned model that is trained to look for relative movement between one or more occupant portions of the occupant and respective seatbelt portions of a seatbelt that correspond to the occupant portions. The other method further includes receiving, from the machine-learned model, an indication that the relative movement indicates that the seatbelt is a fake seatbelt and outputting, to a vehicle system of the vehicle, an indication of the fake seatbelt.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some aspects described below include one or more components and/or one or more systems comprising one or more processors configured to perform the above methods, portions thereof, and/or other methods, flows, and techniques described below.

For example, some vision-based systems can be fooled by an occupant wearing a shirt with a seatbelt printed on it. Fooling such systems (e.g., wearing a seatbelt shirt instead of properly using a seatbelt) is not only illegal in many cases, it is also unsafe.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">The methods and systems herein enable relative movement-based seatbelt use detection. Image data of an occupant of a vehicle is received over time. The image data is then input into a machine-learned model or other module that determines whether relative movement between one or more portions of the occupant and corresponding portions of a seatbelt are less than a threshold amount. If the relative movement is less than the threshold amount, an indication of seatbelt misuse is output to a vehicle component. By basing the indication of seatbelt misuse on relative movement between the occupant and the seatbelt, seatbelt use detection may be improved. Improving seatbelt use detection may increase safety and legality in many environments.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="2">Example Environment</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an example environment <b>100</b> where relative movement-based seatbelt use detection may be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also illustrates an example flow <b>102</b> of relative movement-based seatbelt use detection. The example environment <b>100</b> is within a vehicle <b>104</b> (not shown). The vehicle <b>104</b> may be any type of object that utilizes seatbelts (taxi, car, truck, motorcycle, e-bike, boat, air vehicle, and so on). The vehicle <b>104</b> contains a vehicle system <b>106</b> that is configured to perform relative movement-based seatbelt use detection.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">The vehicle system <b>106</b> contains a movement tracking module <b>108</b> that receives image data and tracks positions of an occupant <b>110</b> and a seatbelt <b>112</b> associated with the occupant <b>110</b> (e.g., corresponding to a seat the occupant <b>110</b> is sitting in). Specifically, the movement tracking module <b>108</b> tracks one or more occupant portions <b>114</b> and one or more seatbelt portions <b>116</b> that correspond to respective occupant portions <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">For example, as illustrated, one of the occupant portions <b>114</b> (e.g., occupant portion <b>114</b>-<b>1</b>) may correspond to a shoulder of the occupant <b>110</b> (left shoulder or right shoulder depending upon a configuration of the seatbelt <b>112</b>, seat location, whether the vehicle <b>104</b> is right or left-hand drive, etc.), and the corresponding seatbelt portion <b>116</b> (e.g., seatbelt portion <b>116</b>-<b>1</b>) may be a portion of the seatbelt <b>112</b> that crosses that shoulder. Another of the occupant portions <b>114</b> may correspond to a hip of the occupant <b>110</b> (left hip or right hip depending upon the configuration of the seatbelt <b>112</b>), and the corresponding seatbelt portion <b>116</b> may be a portion of the seatbelt <b>112</b> that crosses that hip.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Although illustrated as being on a single side of a seatbelt portion <b>116</b>, an occupant portion <b>114</b> may be on both sides of the corresponding seatbelt portion <b>116</b> (e.g., partially surrounding it) either initially or as the occupant <b>110</b> moves. As the occupant <b>110</b> moves, a seatbelt portion <b>116</b> may move under the corresponding seatbelt portion (if it is not configured to be under or around the seatbelt portion <b>116</b> to begin with). Furthermore, the occupant portion <b>114</b> may be on the opposite side of the seatbelt portion <b>116</b>. Those of ordinary skill will realize that any number of techniques may be used to isolate the occupant portions <b>114</b> and their corresponding seatbelt portions <b>116</b> from the image data.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The movement tracking module <b>108</b> is configured to track relative movement or motion between the occupant portions <b>114</b> and their corresponding seatbelt portions <b>116</b>. Any number of known techniques may be used to determine relative movement (e.g., pixel shift, point tracking, tracks, point tracking, centroid tracking).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The movement tracking module <b>108</b> may generate a seatbelt misuse indication <b>118</b> that indicates a misuse of the seatbelt <b>112</b> or that the seatbelt <b>112</b> is fake responsive to determining that the relative movement between one or more of the occupant portion/seatbelt portion pairs does not indicate a real seatbelt. For example, if the seatbelt <b>112</b> is fake (e.g., it's printed on a shirt), the seatbelt portions <b>116</b> may move with the occupant portions <b>114</b>. However, if the seatbelt <b>112</b> is real, the occupant portions <b>114</b> may move independently of their corresponding seatbelt portions <b>116</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">Any number of techniques may be used to determine when to generate the seatbelt misuse indication <b>118</b>. For example, the movement tracking module <b>108</b> may determine that an average relative movement between some or all of the occupant portion/seatbelt portion pairs is less than a threshold value, that a single relative movement between one of the occupant portion/seatbelt portion pairs is less than the threshold value (or another value), that a sum of the relative movement between some or all of the occupant portion/seatbelt portion pairs is less than a threshold value, or any other way of thresholding an amount of movement between the occupant <b>110</b> and the seatbelt <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The seatbelt misuse indication <b>118</b> may be received by a vehicle component <b>120</b> that is configured to cause an alert (e.g., visual, auditory, haptic) to the occupant <b>110</b> or a driver of the vehicle <b>104</b> (if the occupant <b>110</b> is not the driver) that the occupant <b>110</b> is not properly seat belted. Furthermore, the vehicle component <b>120</b> may send a notification to an external system that may alert a third party (e.g., parent, insurance company, law enforcement) of the seatbelt misuse. The vehicle component <b>120</b> may also receive a seatbelt use indication from the movement tracking module <b>108</b> that indicates a proper seatbelt use. The seatbelt use indication may cause the vehicle component <b>120</b> to refrain from performing any additional actions (e.g., the alert).</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">By tracking relative movement/movement between occupant portions <b>114</b> and their corresponding seatbelt portions <b>116</b>, the vehicle system <b>106</b> is able to detect fake seatbelts (e.g., those printed on shirts) that may fool conventional seatbelt detection systems. Doing so may increase the safety of occupants (e.g., the occupant <b>110</b>) through increased proper use of seatbelts (e.g., because the alert is worse for the occupant <b>110</b> than wearing the seatbelt <b>112</b>).</p><heading id="h-0008" level="2">Example System</heading><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an example of the vehicle system <b>106</b>.

In another example, the seatbelt portions <b>116</b> may include a portion from a shoulder of the occupant <b>110</b> to a b-pillar of the vehicle <b>104</b> and/or a portion from a hip of the occupant <b>110</b> to a seatbelt receiver corresponding to the seatbelt <b>112</b>. Furthermore, different seatbelt portions <b>116</b> may be used for different steps of the relative movement-based seatbelt use detection.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">At decision <b>304</b> the seatbelt detection module <b>302</b> determines if the seatbelt <b>112</b> is across a chest of the occupant <b>110</b>. For example, if the seatbelt portions <b>116</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>116</b>-<b>2</b> are not found, the decision <b>304</b> may be a no. The seatbelt detection module <b>302</b> may alternatively or in addition, look for another seatbelt portion <b>116</b>-<b>3</b> that is in a middle of the chest of the occupant <b>110</b>. In some implementations, the seatbelt detection module <b>302</b> may determine if a stripe is crossing the chest of the occupant <b>110</b>, indicating that a seatbelt is crossing it. If the seatbelt portion <b>116</b>-<b>3</b> is not found, the decision <b>304</b> may be a no.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">If it is determined that the seatbelt <b>112</b> is not across the chest of the occupant <b>110</b> (e.g. a no out of decision <b>304</b>), the seatbelt detection module <b>302</b> may generate or otherwise cause the seatbelt misuse indication <b>122</b>. However, if it is determined that the seatbelt <b>112</b> is across the chest of the occupant <b>110</b> (e.g., a yes out of decision <b>304</b>), the seatbelt detection module <b>302</b> may send or otherwise indicate the positions of the seatbelt portions <b>116</b> to a relative movement module <b>306</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The relative movement module <b>306</b> determines locations, and tracks movement of, the occupant portions <b>114</b> that correspond to the seatbelt portions <b>116</b>. For example, the relative movement module <b>306</b> may track occupant portion <b>114</b>-<b>1</b> and/or other occupant portions. The relative movement module <b>306</b> also compares the movement of the occupant portions <b>114</b> relative to their corresponding seatbelt portions <b>116</b>. For example, the relative movement module <b>306</b> may determine a relative movement between the occupant portion <b>114</b>-<b>1</b> and the seatbelt portion <b>116</b>-<b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">At decision <b>308</b>, the relative movement module <b>306</b> determines if the relative movement is less than a threshold. For example, the decision may be based on a single of the relative movements (e.g., between only one seatbelt portion <b>116</b> and occupant portion <b>114</b>) or a combination of the relative movements (e.g., an average, median, sum). If the relative movement is greater than (or equal to depending on implementation) the threshold, then the decision <b>308</b> may be no, indicating a proper seatbelt use indication (e.g., seatbelt use indication <b>310</b>). In some implementations, a no out of decision <b>308</b> may cause the relative movement module <b>306</b> to refrain from outputting an indication. If the relative movement is less than the threshold (or equal to depending on implementation), then the decision <b>308</b> may be yes, indicating or establishing a misuse of the seatbelt <b>112</b> or that the seatbelt <b>112</b> is fake.
