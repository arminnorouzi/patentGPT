id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to the field of non-destructive contact-free characterization of a mechanical and/or physico-chemical property of a sample, by analysis of the acoustic wave produced by an interaction with pump and probe laser beams.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The technical field is more particularly that of photo-acoustics, in particular, the ultra-fast, non-destructive measurement of the mechanical, thermal, or optical properties of a sample (solid, liquid, or gaseous inert matter or living cell). &#x201c;Ultra-fast measurement&#x201d; means a measurement having a temporal resolution on the order of a picosecond.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The pump-probe method makes it possible to use very short laser pulses to measure ultra-fast phenomena in matter, such as the movement of atoms or the excitation of electrons.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">For this, a very short and intense laser pulse, the &#x201c;pump,&#x201d; is sent to a sample to excite it. A second weaker pulse, the &#x201c;probe,&#x201d; is sent immediately after, which makes it possible to measure the effect of the initial excitation. By repeating and modifying the time between the first and the second pulse, it is thus possible to reconstruct the evolution of the excitation over time and to make a recording over a time window of a measurement of the light intensity in the photodetector or of the number of photons counted by the photodetector.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The absorption of a first so-called &#x201c;pump&#x201d; laser pulse causes sudden heating and therefore surface expansion, which, depending on the geometry of the object studied, either propagates in the form of an acoustic pulse lasting a few picoseconds or excites the resonant vibrations of the system. The acoustic pulses or vibrations are detected using a second time-delayed pulse (by optical method in the case of the homodyne only), &#x201c;the probe,&#x201d; by the interferometric measurement of the changes in the optical reflectivity coefficient induced by transient sound waves.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">The field of picosecond acoustics has developed in recent years and has enabled the study of the elastic properties of thin films, multilayer systems, nanostructures and nanoparticles, the detection of stress and disorder phenomena at interfaces, adhesion measurement, etc.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Picosecond acoustics have also been used for the study of massive systems. At the same time, industrial applications in the field of non-destructive evaluation in the microelectronics industry have emerged and led to the development of commercial measuring devices.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the prior art, the article &#x201c;Measuring the mechanical properties of matter at the nanometer scale using picosecond acoustics&#x201d; PHOTONIQUES N<sup>o</sup>94, Nov. 1, 2018, page 30)33 XP055734848, the article by Allaoua Abbas &#x201c;Development of a heterodyne pump-probe device&#x201d; of May 9, 2013 XP055734712, as well as the thesis &#x201c;Development of a heterodyne pump-probe device: application to picosecond acoustic imaging&#x201d; defended by Allaoua Abbas on May 9, 2014 (https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00988758/document) are known.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This document describes the operating principle of a heterodyne bench. Two pump and probe pulse trains, issued from different lasers, are combined (RO) before being focused on the sample being studied by which they are reflected and then directed toward a photodetector using suitable optics. The rejection of the pump signal diffused by the sample is done either using polarizers, if the polarizations of the beams have been kept crossed, or using an interferometric filter, if the wavelengths of the pump and the probe are quite separated. Alternatively, a non-polarizing beam splitter may be used.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The difference &#x394;f, called the beat frequency, between the repetition frequency of the probe f<sub>Probe </sub>and pump f<sub>Probe</sub>+&#x394;f trains, increasingly delays the probe pulses with respect to the pump pulses. At each pump excitation, the pump-probe delay increases by the quantity &#x3b4;<sub>het</sub>, the value of which is given by the relationship:</p><p id="p-0013" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3b4;<sub>het</sub><i>=T</i><sub>probe</sub><i>&#x2212;T</i><sub>pump</sub>,<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0014" num="0000">where &#x3c4;<sub>probe </sub>and &#x3c4;<sub>pump </sub>are, respectively, the periods of the probe and pump lasers. &#x3b4;<sub>het </sub>may also be expressed as a function of f<sub>probe </sub>and &#x394;f using the formula:</p><p id="p-0015" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00001" num="00001"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>&#x3b4;</mi>   <mi>het</mi>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo>  <mfrac>   <mrow>    <mi>&#x394;</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mi>f</mi>   </mrow>   <mrow>    <msub>     <mi>f</mi>     <mi>probe</mi>    </msub>    <mo>(</mo>    <mrow>     <mrow>      <mi>&#x394;</mi>      <mo>&#x2062;</mo>      <mi>f</mi>     </mrow>     <mo>+</mo>     <msub>      <mi>f</mi>      <mi>probe</mi>     </msub>    </mrow>    <mo>)</mo>   </mrow>  </mfrac> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0016" num="0012">The delay increases until the pump and probe pulses again arrive at the same instant on the sample. This precise moment is called coincidence. The time between two coincidences is the time it takes for the probe to go through all the pump-probe delays. This time is called the beat period, and its value is given by the inverse of the beat frequency &#x394;f. The transient signal obtained by studying the variation of the intensity of the probe collected by the photodetector during a beat period thus corresponds to the response of the sample dilated in time. This dilation of the time scale is similar to the stroboscopic effect, observable on a macroscopic scale, and which, under certain conditions, makes it possible to freeze or slow down movements of a periodic nature.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0013">The relationship that binds the temporal scale of the dilated time &#x3c4;<sub>diluted</sub>, which corresponds to the time scale of the acquisitions, and the physical time scale T<sub>physical</sub>, which corresponds to the true dynamics of the sample, is:</p><p id="p-0018" num="0000"><maths id="MATH-US-00002" num="00002"><math overflow="scroll"> <mrow>  <msub>   <mi>T</mi>   <mi>physical</mi>  </msub>  <mo>=</mo>  <mfrac>   <mrow>    <mi>&#x394;</mi>    <mo>&#x2062;</mo>    <mrow>     <mi>f</mi>     <mo>&#xb7;</mo>     <msub>      <mi>T</mi>      <mi>dilated</mi>     </msub>    </mrow>   </mrow>   <msub>    <mi>f</mi>    <mi>master</mi>   </msub>  </mfrac> </mrow></math></maths></p><p id="p-0019" num="0014">Two delays may be defined:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0015">The first in dilated time, &#x394;&#x3c4;<sub>het</sub>, corresponds to the time between the coincidence and the moment when the reflectivity value of the probe is read.</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0016">The second in physical time, &#x3b4;&#x3c4;<sub>het</sub>, corresponds to the time between the probe and the pump excitation preceding it.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0020" num="0017">The interaction with the material results in the formation of acoustic waves with high spectral content, which allows the characterization of samples with nanometric dimensions by a photodetector. Differential detection makes it possible to partly overcome the fluctuation of the intensity of the probe laser. Moreover, this makes it possible to bring the levels of the average signals back to the neighborhood of 0 and to take advantage of the minimum step for quantifying the acquisition map.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0018">This thesis also proposes a solution for imaging a surface of a sample by controlling the relative positions of the focal spots of the pump and the probe on the sample. This control makes it possible to mesh the space around an excitation in order to map the transient phenomena generated by the excitation.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0019">Also known is the Neta TECH article &#x201c;JAX-M1&#x201d; January 2018 XP055735269 as well as the Japanese patent JP H05172737.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0020">The French patent FR2892511 is also known, which describes a heterodyne optical sampling device equipped with two pulsed laser sources capable of emitting, respectively, a pump beam and a probe beam of respective repetition frequencies Fs and Fp with Fs&#x2260;Fp, an element combining the pump and probe beams intended to be sent to a sample and which comprises a signal channel including a system for the photodetection of the response signal of the sample and connected to this signal channel, and a system for acquiring the response signal. It is mainly characterized in that, as the acquisition system comprises an acquisition triggering element, it comprises, connected to this triggering element, a synchronization channel including a device for measuring the beat frequency IFs-Fpl.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0021">Finally, the United States patent application publication US2004/196453 is known, which relates to a laser probe and a thermal pump to form a complete image used to detect defects under the surface.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0022">The solution proposed in the prior art has multiple drawbacks resulting from the scanning used for the deflectometry and the generation of surface waves (measurement of the transverse properties of the material).</p><p id="p-0026" num="0023">A first drawback, recognized in the document, is the difficulty of controlling the movements at such high frequencies, and of maintaining synchronization between the pulse trains and the photodetection.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0024">A second drawback lies in the analysis times induced by these scans, which are indicated in the thesis as being able to reach several hours. Such durations are hardly compatible with industrial use, for example, for sample control in a production cycle.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0025">Such durations are downright prohibitive for the analysis of samples having a very short lifespan, for example, an isolated living cell, the lifespan of which does not exceed a few minutes.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0026">Finally, the point interaction leads to local information that does not take into account the mechanical, chemical, and physical links with the neighboring local areas and which, as a result, provide a type of characterization of a surface of the sample, which is both disturbed by the remanence of neighboring pulses and by the absence of consideration of the global characteristics of the analyzed surface.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0027">In summary, the problem encountered by the person skilled in the art is to be able to construct one or more maps (1D in one dimension or 2D in two dimensions) representative of the physical properties (mechanical, thermal, or optical) of various samples, in time frames compatible with operational requirements such as: compliance with production line inspection rates, non-alteration of the sample under the transient conditions necessary for measurement, reduction of measurement times, increase in the quantities of data collected.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0031" num="0028">In order to remedy these drawbacks, the present disclosure relates, in its most general sense, to a method for the non-destructive contact-free physical characterization of a sample by repeated excitations of the surface of a sample with a sequence of laser pulses comprising at least one pump pulse by a first &#x201c;pump&#x201d;

The acquisition is carried out by probe signal discretization of n points by a photodetector with an element array with subtraction from the signal after disturbance of the signal before disturbance, then by the digitization of the differential signal and the temporal reconstruction of the sample response.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0057">The equipment for mapping a physical characteristic of a sample according to the present disclosure, described by way of example, comprises a system (<b>100</b>) of two laser sources producing two beams (<b>110</b>, <b>120</b>), a pump beam (<b>120</b>) and a probe beam (<b>110</b>) offset temporally with possible adjustment of the delay.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0058">The pump beam (<b>120</b>) has a form factor in a line or in a square array form, with a non-Gaussian form (&#x201c;top hat beam&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0054" num="0059">The probe beam (<b>110</b>) has a form factor in a line or in a square array form, identical to the pump beam.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0060">A &#x201c;top hat&#x201d; type of beam exhibits an almost uniform fluence (energy density) in a circular disc. It is generally formed of diffractive optical elements from a Gaussian beam. It may be obtained by combining a beam profiler (&#x201c;laser beam profiler&#x201d;) with a picosecond laser or a femtosecond laser.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0061">The system further includes a differential photodetector (<b>200</b>) with an element array (<b>201</b> to <b>205</b>) in line or in a square array form measuring at each of its points the difference of the signals before and after disturbance of the incident probe beam on the sample. It optionally allows, as a variant, the output of the respective average values of the outward and return signals in order to balance the respective averages of the outward and return signals on a single reference value. The electrical signals delivered by the elements (<b>201</b> to <b>205</b>) are transmitted to a pre-processing circuit (<b>210</b>) then to a digital analog digitizer (<b>220</b>) making it possible to record the response signals measured by the photodetector (<b>200</b>).</p><p id="p-0057" num="0062">A preferred configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> involves placing the pump (<b>111</b> to <b>113</b>) and probe (<b>121</b> to <b>123</b>) beams at any angle of incidence with respect to the sample interaction plane (<b>150</b>), the angle between the two beams being between 0&#xb0; and 180&#xb0;. A particular case of this configuration appears when the angle of incidence of the probe (<b>121</b> to <b>123</b>) with respect to the normal of the sample (<b>150</b>) is 0&#xb0;.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0063">In this case it is necessary to add a certain number of optical elements.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0064">Similarly, when the angle between the probe (<b>121</b> to <b>123</b>) and pump (<b>111</b> to <b>113</b>) beams is 0&#xb0;, it is necessary to add an optical element (<b>130</b>) allowing the beams to recombine with each other.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0065">The system comprises a synchronous or asynchronous device (<b>100</b>) making it possible to generate two pulsed laser beams (<b>110</b>,<b>120</b>) offset temporally, a Probe beam (<b>110</b>) and a Pump beam (<b>120</b>). The wavelengths of the beams are independent; for the Probe beam (<b>110</b>) the wavelengths are comprised within the spectral band of the photodetector (<b>200</b>).</p><p id="p-0061" num="0066">The Pump beam (<b>120</b>), coming from an asynchronous or synchronous device, passes through an optical device (<b>125</b>) for shaping the beam (<b>120</b>). At the output of the device, the beam has a shape adapted to the sensor array of the photodetector and a uniform distribution of energy over its entire surface (so-called &#x201c;top hat&#x201d; shape of the signal).</p><p id="p-0062" num="0067">The Probe beam (<b>110</b>), coming from an asynchronous or synchronous device (<b>100</b>), passes through a sampling optic, which makes it possible to sample a fraction of power to send it to one of the element arrays of the differential photodetector (<b>200</b>) with an element array (<b>201</b> to <b>205</b>). Initially, the probe beam passes through an optical beam shaping device (<b>115</b>). At the output of the device, the beam has a shape adapted to the sensor array of the photodetector (<b>200</b>) and a uniform distribution of energy over its entire surface (so-called &#x201c;top hat&#x201d; shape of the signal).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0068">Then, in the case of the configuration with a normal incidence of the probe beam (<b>110</b>) on the sample (<b>150</b>) illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the probe beam passes through semi-reflecting optics.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0069">Then, in the case of an angle of 0&#xb0; between the pump (<b>120</b>) and probe (<b>110</b>) beams, the beams are recombined in a recombination optic making it possible to give them a single orientation on the sample (<b>150</b>).</p><p id="p-0065" num="0070">Finally the two beams (<b>110</b>, <b>120</b>) are focused on the sample via an optical focusing device. In the case of a configuration with non-normal incidence of the probe beam on the sample, the probe beam passes through two different optical focusing devices, the paths before and after the sample not being similar, the semi-reflecting optics are not used in this configuration.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0071">The probe beam reflected or transmitted (<b>151</b> to <b>153</b>) by the sample (<b>150</b>) is then injected into the differential photodetector (<b>200</b>) with an element array (<b>201</b> to <b>205</b>). The element array (<b>201</b> to <b>205</b>) of the photodetector (<b>200</b>) discretizes the signal into n signals.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0072">Afterwards, these signals are subtracted from the probe signal measured before reflection or transmission of the probe beam on the sample. The signals are conditioned and then digitized by the multi-channel A/D digitizer (<b>220</b>). In addition, the digitizer (<b>220</b>) is synchronized with the laser sources (<b>100</b>) to allow a temporal reconstruction of the n responses of the sample (<b>150</b>) by digital processing of the measurements.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0073">In the case of a normal incidence of the probe channel on the sample (<b>150</b>), the probe beam reflected or transmitted (<b>151</b> to <b>153</b>) by the sample (<b>150</b>) is reflected by the semi-reflecting optics in the differential photodetector (<b>200</b>) with an element array. The element array (<b>201</b> to <b>205</b>) of the photodetector discretizes the signal into n signals.

The advantage of line/square sensors is that the elements have a common cathode.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0083">The current passing through the cathode is the sum of all the currents generated by each photosensitive element (<b>201</b> to <b>205</b>). Current flowing through the resistor R (<b>206</b>) creates a voltage across its terminals.
