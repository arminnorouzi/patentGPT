Common examples of such loads are rigid jumper pipes or spool pipes, which effect fluid connections in hydrocarbon production installations as used in the subsea oil and gas industry.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">When being transported and installed, a jumper pipe or spool pipe, including its heavy end connectors, must be lifted onto and off an installation vessel and then from the vessel down through the water column to the seabed. Whilst nominally rigid, the pipe will tend to bend along its length under the loads of self-weight and installation. The pipe must therefore be supported carefully during transportation and installation so as to avoid plastic deformation.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention is particularly concerned with spreader structures such as spreader bars and spreader frames. Spreader bars are used to lift relatively light loads, typically of up to 50 tonnes, and loads with relatively simple, largely two-dimensional shapes that lie substantially in an upright plane. Conversely, spreader frames are used to lift relatively heavy loads, typically of up to 150 tonnes or more, and loads with relatively complex, substantially non-planar, more three-dimensional shapes.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, spreader structures are apt to be used as installation aids for transporting, lifting and installing elongate loads that may have complex shapes. They provide appropriate location points to which the load is attached or from which the load is suspended. By doing so, spreader structures maintain equilibrium and support the load at multiple points along its length so as to minimise stress.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, spreader structures provide an interface between a load and a crane. Specifically, the crane typically suspends a spreader structure from a set of upper ropes or slings. The spreader structure, in turn, supports or suspends the load, for example from a set of lower ropes or slings.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Consequently, the crane lifts the spreader structure and the load together, meaning that the weight of the spreader structure reduces the effective lifting capacity of the crane. Typically, however, spreader structures are fabricated from steel. This makes them heavy, and so significantly increases the aggregate weight that has to be lifted by the crane.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An oversized standard spreader frame may be used for onshore lifts, for example in ports where large-capacity cranes are readily available. In that case, ropes or slings may be attached to the frame at various locations to comply with the size and shape of the load to be lifted. However an oversized spreader frame may be unsuitable for offshore lifting, where the capacity of an available crane is likely to be much more limited.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another approach, a spreader structure may be modified for each specialised lift. This is less convenient where there are time constraints and where space and weight are constrained by the working deck of the vessel.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The bulkier and more complex the load, the more likely it is that a matching spreader structure will have to be designed and fabricated for that particular load on a bespoke, one-off basis. In that case, the spreader structure may have to be scrapped after just a single use. This is exceedingly wasteful, not just of materials but also of design and manufacturing resources.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In use, spreader structures may be subjected to various potentially damaging influences, namely: large lifting loads, which can give rise to compression and bending stresses; fatigue and impact loads; significant temperature variations; degradation due to the marine environment; and substantial hydrostatic pressure if the structure comprises sealed hollow members that are not flooded. Even where a spreader structure is apt to be used offshore more than once, these influences militate against its repeated long-term use. For example, the spreader structure may suffer from corrosion or fatigue with prolonged or repeated use. In any event, it may be challenging to provide a suitable place to store such a large structure that is in merely intermittent use.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Spreader bars that can be adjusted by telescoping beams or tubes are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,222,903. However, the practical usefulness of this solution is limited by a requirement for case-by-case recertification of non-standard heavy-lift equipment for use offshore. WO 98/12455 discloses another example of an adjustable spreader bar system.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Modular lattice spreader frames of steel are also known, for example as sold by Modulift UK Ltd under the trade mark &#x2018;Modulift&#x2019;. In this example, steel tubes with end flanges are connected together by coupling the flanges.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">To reduce weight, tubular members of thermoplastic composites have been used or proposed for various structural applications as an alternative to steel. However, flanges of composite material are more sensitive to shear stresses than flanges of steel.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Tubular members can instead be connected by fitting together their facing ends telescopically in male/female relation. For example, EP 0415012 discloses a conical coupler between pipes that may be of metals or plastics. However, that arrangement is not capable of withstanding large structural loads, especially in tension. Tapered pipe joints or spigots are also taught in U.S. Pat. No. 3,567,257, but only in the context of a soldered or brazed joint between a pipe and a fitting.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">US 2019/002246 A1 discloses the use of bars, joined together by lugs and pins, to be used in spreader bar assembly configurations, while CN 208829096 U describes a sectional lifting beam to be used in the joint operation of two cranes. End sections of the beam comprise lugs that can attach to each crane and the sectional beam can be fitted with a hook section to enable further connections. Middle beam sections of varying lengths can be positioned between the end sections and hook sections, with all sections being connected through the use of flanges and pins.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Against this background, the invention resides in a modular spreader structure for use in offshore lifts. The structure comprises a plurality of elongate primary tubular elements made primarily of composite material. Each primary tubular element comprises an axial coupler formation for end-to-end coupling with a complementary axial coupler formation of another primary tubular element of the structure, aligned on a common longitudinal axis.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">For example, an axial coupler formation of at least one of the tubular elements may comprise a male formation, which may taper distally. The male formation may be surrounded by a distally-facing shoulder. Similarly, an axial coupler formation of at least one of the primary tubular elements may comprise a complementary female formation, which may taper proximally. The female formation may be surrounded by a distally-facing flange that abuts the shoulder when the formations brought together into full mutual engagement.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">The axial coupler formation of each primary tubular element suitably extends distally from, or within, a radially-enlarged portion of the tubular element that has locally-increased wall thickness.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Adjoining primary tubular elements are preferably interengageable by virtue of longitudinal overlap between their axial coupler formations. In that case, the tubular elements may be locked together by at least one locking pin that extends through mutually-aligned transverse bores in the axial coupler formations. To ensure angular alignment for this purpose, an alignment key in at least one of the axial coupler formations may be cooperable with an opposed notch in another of the axial coupler formations.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Advantageously, the axial coupler formations may be covered by a protective cover or liner of a stiffer or more wear-resistant material than the composite material, such as of steel.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">At least one of the primary tubular elements may comprise an external stopper formation such as a ridge that extends circumferentially around that primary tubular element.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The structure of the invention may further comprise at least one secondary elongate tubular element that is also made primarily of composite material. The secondary tubular element has a node connector that is configured to attach the secondary tubular element to the structure at an orientation that intersects or is inclined relative to the common longitudinal axis of the primary tubular elements.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The node connector may be integral with the secondary tubular element or may be joined to the secondary tubular element, for example by additional axial coupler formations like those used to join together successive primary tubular elements.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In examples to be described, the node connector may be configured to attach the secondary tubular element to an outer surface of one of the primary tubular elements. For this purpose, the node connector suitably comprises at least one jaw with a distal end face that has curvature complementary to the outer surface of that primary tubular element.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The distal end face of the or each jaw is preferably curved about an axis of curvature that is substantially aligned with a central longitudinal axis of the secondary tubular element. The axis of curvature may also be substantially orthogonal to the central longitudinal axis of the secondary tubular element. Also, the distal end face of the or each jaw may comprise a recess or other formation that is engageable with an external stopper formation of at least one of the primary tubular elements.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The or each jaw is preferably made from a composite material that is integral with the composite material of the secondary tubular element. In that case, the or each jaw may further comprise an insert of steel or other more rigid material than the composite material of the jaw.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">At least two external stopper formations may be spaced apart longitudinally along a primary tubular element, in which case the node connector may be engaged with that primary tubular element between those external stopper formations.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The structure of the invention may further comprise attachment points for suspending the structure from a lifting point and for suspending a load from the structure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The inventive concept also embraces a corresponding method of assembling a spreader structure, made primarily of composite material, for use in an offshore lift. The method comprises interengaging elongate primary tubular elements end-to-end in mutual alignment on a common longitudinal axis by virtue of longitudinal overlap between axial coupler formations of the primary tubular elements.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">At least one elongate secondary tubular element may be attached to the primary tubular elements, for example by being attached to an outer surface of at least one of the primary tubular elements. In that case, the or each secondary tubular element may be engaged or abutted with at least one stopper formation on the outer surface of at least one of the primary tubular elements.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">The method of the invention may further comprise disassembling the spreader structure and then reassembling the spreader structure at a different installation site or in a different configuration. Advantageously, the tubular elements may be placed into a standard shipping container for storage or transportation after disassembly of the spreader structure. For this purpose, it is beneficial that no part of the structure is of more than 12 m in length when disassembled.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Embodiments of the invention provide a lightweight modular spreader structure for offshore lifts that comprises several tubes of thermoplastic composite material, each tube being hollow and having two ends, each end being either an axial coupler or a node connector.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">An axial coupler may be either a male coupler or a female coupler, and suitably comprises a hard cover or insert, for example of steel, to protect the contact interface between adjoining tubes. Two such couplers may overlap each other longitudinally.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The interface between adjoining tubes may be tapered. The interface may comprise at least one key or a groove to engage a key of a connecting tube.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">An axial connector may be formed by coupling a male coupler and a female coupler. The axial connector may then be secured by inserting a transverse pin through bores of the two couplers.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">A node connector may, for example, comprise at least one half clamp, to connect to a second half clamp that mounts around a perpendicular tube, or a flange assembly to mount a clamping means. The node connector may be integral to the tube or may be connected to an axial coupler.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The outer surface of a tube may comprise at least one stopper rim or other formation for stopping a clamp or collar.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Advantageously, the tubes may be no more than 12 m (40 feet) long so that they can be stored and transported in standard shipping containers.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The composite modular spreader bar or frame of the invention offers various advantages compared to spreader structures of steel, such as: reusability; recyclability; light weight, noting that polymer composite material may have a density of about 20% of the density of steel; an excellent ratio of weight to rigidity and toughness; good mechanical, thermal and chemical properties; excellent corrosion resistance; and high fatigue capacity.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">In view of these beneficial properties, a spreader bar or frame of the invention can be designed to suit long-term repeat usage over several successive projects, for example over a period of 25 years. This gives rise to significant cost savings in the long term and minimises environmental impact, with no need for scrapping after each project and with the possibility of recycling at the end of its life.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A spreader bar or frame of the invention can be made from multiple sections. The sections may be joined together to make spreader bars of different lengths based on the project requirement. The sections can be disassembled after use for compact storage and easy transportation before eventual re-use, potentially to make a spreader structure of a different size or shape to that used previously.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In summary, the invention provides modular spreader structure for use in offshore lifts that comprises a plurality of elongate tubular elements made primarily of composite material. Primary tubular elements each comprise an axial coupler formation for end-to-end coupling with a complementary axial coupler formation of another primary tubular element, aligned on a common longitudinal axis. The adjoining primary tubular elements may be interengageable by longitudinal overlap between male and female axial coupler formations.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Secondary tubular elements may each comprise a node connector that is configured for attachment to the structure at an orientation inclined relative to the common longitudinal axis of the primary tubular elements. Thus, the secondary tubular elements can be attached to an outer surface of one of the primary tubular elements.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In order that the invention may be more readily understood, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings in which:</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of a spreader structure of the invention in use supporting a jumper pipe;</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view in longitudinal section of an axial coupler interface between adjoining tubular elements of the spreader structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in the process of assembly;</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a longitudinal sectional view of the interface shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, when assembled;</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exploded part-sectional side view of a node connector joining perpendicular tubes of the spreader structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a part-sectional side view of a variant of the node connector shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is an exploded top view of another variant of the node connector, showing a stopper arrangement; and</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a top view of another node connector, showing a variant of the stopper arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring firstly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> of the drawings, a spreader structure <b>10</b> of the invention is shown here suspended by upper slings <b>12</b> that radiate outwardly and downwardly from a lifting point <b>14</b> such as a hook of a crane (not shown).

Conversely, angular alignment between the holes <b>50</b> is assured by alignment of, and engagement between, a key formation <b>52</b> projecting from the shoulder <b>36</b> of the male coupler and a complementary notch <b>54</b> in the opposed flange <b>42</b> of the female coupler.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">Moving on to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> to <b>7</b></figref>, these drawings show various node connectors <b>30</b> of the invention. The simplest of these node connectors <b>30</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> and comprises a jaw formation <b>56</b> at an end of an outrigger tube <b>22</b>. The jaw formation <b>56</b> is of thermoplastic composite material and is conveniently formed integrally with the composite wall of the outrigger tube <b>22</b>. The concave-curved distal end face <b>58</b> of the jaw formation <b>56</b> is faced by, or reinforced with, an embedded steel insert layer <b>60</b> to protect or strengthen the composite material.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The distal end face <b>58</b> of the jaw formation <b>56</b> is part-circular in longitudinal section, with a substantially constant radius of curvature. The radius of curvature is centred on an axis of curvature <b>62</b> that is orthogonal to, and intersected by, the central longitudinal axis of the outrigger tube <b>22</b>. The radius of curvature of the distal end face <b>58</b> corresponds to the outer radius of the spreader bar <b>20</b>. Thus, when the outrigger tube <b>22</b> is assembled with the spreader bar <b>20</b> such that the central longitudinal axis <b>38</b> of the spreader bar <b>20</b> lies on the axis of curvature <b>62</b> of the distal end face, a tubular element <b>26</b> of the spreader bar <b>20</b> is received snugly in the jaw formation <b>56</b>.</p><p id="p-0068" num="0067">The jaw formation <b>56</b> is held in engagement with the spreader bar <b>20</b> by an oppositely-curved jaw element <b>64</b> of steel. Thus, the jaw formation <b>56</b> and the jaw element <b>64</b> cooperate with each other in the manner of half-shells. The jaw element <b>64</b> is suitably bolted to the jaw formation <b>56</b> via washers <b>66</b> and may thereby deform resiliently to apply clamping force to the spreader bar <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the variant of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the jaw formation <b>56</b> of the node connector <b>30</b> is not integral with an outrigger tube <b>22</b> but is instead coupled to an end of an outrigger tube <b>22</b> by an axial coupler <b>28</b> like that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, shown here in a partially-engaged state. Like numerals are used for like features of the axial coupler <b>28</b>, and so need not be described further here.</p><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Frictional engagement between the spreader bar <b>20</b> and the jaw formation <b>56</b> of a node connector <b>30</b> may be sufficient to keep an outrigger tube <b>22</b> in fixed relation to the spreader bar <b>20</b>. However, the spreader bar <b>20</b> and the jaw formation <b>56</b> may additionally, or instead, be connected to each other by mechanical engagement. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> show arrangements for the node connector <b>30</b> that effect mechanical engagement between these parts.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the spreader bar <b>20</b> is encircled by a circumferential stopper ridge <b>68</b> that is received in complementary grooves <b>70</b> provided in the concave faces of the jaw formation <b>56</b> and the opposed jaw element <b>64</b>. The stopper ridge <b>68</b> may be formed integrally with a tubular element <b>26</b> of the spreader bar <b>20</b> by locally increasing the wall thickness of the tubular element <b>26</b>, or may be bonded or otherwise attached to the tubular element <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">When the spreader bar <b>20</b> is clamped between the jaw formation <b>56</b> and the jaw element <b>64</b>, engagement between the stopper ridge <b>68</b> and the grooves <b>70</b> prevents the node connector <b>30</b> and the outrigger tube <b>22</b> sliding along the spreader bar <b>20</b>. Moreover, the spreader bar <b>20</b> has one or more key formations <b>72</b>, conveniently formed integrally with the stopper ridge <b>68</b>, that engage with one or more complementary recesses <b>74</b> of the jaw formation <b>56</b> and/or the jaw element <b>64</b>. Engagement of the or each key formation <b>72</b> with the or each recess <b>74</b> prevents the node connector <b>30</b> and the outrigger tube <b>22</b> pivoting or swinging about the spreader bar <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Finally, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the spreader bar <b>20</b> is encircled by a pair of circumferential stopper ridges <b>68</b> that are spaced apart longitudinally. The jaw formation <b>56</b> and the jaw element <b>64</b> are clamped together around the spreader bar <b>20</b> in the space between the stopper ridges <b>68</b>. The stopper ridges <b>68</b> thereby prevent the node connector <b>30</b> and the outrigger tube <b>22</b> sliding beyond them along the spreader bar <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">Many variations are possible within the inventive concept. For example, the jaw formations <b>56</b> of the node connectors <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> need not be integral with the outrigger tube <b>22</b> but may instead be coupled to an end of an outrigger tube <b>22</b> by an axial coupler <b>28</b> like that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">The principles of the invention may be used to construct spreader structures of various shapes or sizes, including box-section or triangulated lattices that may comprise diagonal braces. Consequently, it is not essential that adjoining tubular members of the spreader structure are in mutually orthogonal relation. It would instead be possible for adjoining members of the structure to be at angles of greater or less than 90&#xb0; relative to each other. Thus, the axis of curvature of a jaw formation may lie at any required angle relative to the central longitudinal axis of a tubular member that carries the jaw formation.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">The cover layer, liner layer and insert layer need not be of steel but could instead be of other metals or of other suitably robust materials.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The length of at least some of the tubular members of the spreader structure may be adjustable, for example by a telescoping action.</p><p id="p-0078" num="0077">At least some of the tubular members of a spreader structure such as a spreader bar or an outrigger tube may support lift clamps. Each lift clamp may, for example, comprise a sleeve that encircles the supporting member and may have a frictionless design so as to pivot freely around that member. In that case, unwanted sliding of a lift clamp along a member of the spreader structure may be resisted by stopper arrangements like those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Whilst the drawings show the outrigger tubes as being of substantially the same outer diameter as the tubular elements of the spreader bar, the outrigger tubes and the tubular elements could instead have different outer diameters.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
