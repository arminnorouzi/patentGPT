For example, a UE and/or a base station (for example, a gNB (gNodeB)) may use a beam used to transmit a signal (also referred to as a transmit beam, a Tx beam, and so on), and a beam used to receive a signal (also referred to as a receive beam, an Rx beam, and so on).</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the environment using BF, it is assumed that radio link quality is deteriorated because the radio link quality is liable to suffer the influence of interruption of an obstruction. Due to deterioration of the radio link quality, a radio link failure (RLF) may frequently occur. When RLF occurs, reconnection to a cell is required. Therefore, frequent occurrence of RLF causes deterioration of system throughput.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For NR, to reduce occurrence of RLF, the following is under study: when quality of a specific beam is deteriorated, a procedure of switching to another beam (which may be referred to as beam recovery (BR), beam failure recovery (BFR), L1/L2 (Layer 1/Layer 2) beam recovery, and so on) is performed. Note that the BFR procedure may be simply referred to as BFR.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram to show an example of a beam recovery procedure. The number of beams and so on are merely examples, and are not restrictive. In an initial state (Step S<b>101</b>) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the UE receives a downlink control channel (PDCCH (Physical Downlink Control Channel)) transmitted by using two beams.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In Step S<b>102</b>, due to interruption of radio waves from the base station, the UE cannot detect the PDCCH. Such interruption may occur due to the influence of an obstruction between the UE and the base station, fading, interference, and so on, for example.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">When certain conditions are satisfied, the UE detects a beam failure. When there is no notification from the UE, or when the base station receives a certain signal (beam recovery request in Step S<b>104</b>) from the UE, the base station may determine that the UE has detected the beam failure.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In Step S<b>103</b>, for the sake of beam recovery, the UE initiates search for a new candidate beam to be used for new communication. When the UE detects the beam failure, the UE may perform measurement based on preconfigured downlink signal (which may be referred to as DL-RS (Reference Signal) and so on) resources, and may identify one or more desirable new candidate beams (for example, one or more new candidate beams having excellent quality). In the case of the present example, one beam is identified as a new candidate beam.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The DL-RS resources may be associated with resources and/or ports for a synchronization signal block (SSB) or a channel state measurement RS (CSI-RS (Channel State Information RS)). Note that the SSB may be referred to as an SS/PBCH (Physical Broadcast Channel) block and so on.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">The DL-RS may be at least one of a primary synchronization signal (PSS (Primary SS)), a secondary synchronization signal (SSS (Secondary SS)), a mobility reference signal (MRS (Mobility RS)), a signal included in an SSB, a CSI-RS, a demodulation reference signal (DMRS), a beam-specific signal, and so on, or may be a signal configured by extending and/or modifying the above signals (for example, a signal configured by modifying density and/or a period). The DL-RS may be referred to as a signal for new candidate beam detection.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In Step S<b>104</b>, the UE that has identified the new candidate beam transmits a beam recovery request (BFRQ (Beam Failure Recovery reQuest)). The beam recovery request may be referred to as a beam recovery request signal, a beam failure recovery request signal, and so on.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, the beam recovery request may be transmitted by using at least one of an uplink control channel (PUCCH (Physical Uplink Control Channel)), a random access channel (PRACH (Physical Random Access Channel)), and a UL grant free PUSCH (Physical Uplink Shared Channel).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The beam recovery request may include information of the new candidate beam identified in Step S<b>103</b>. Resources for the beam recovery request may be associated with the new candidate beam. Information of the beam may be notified by using a beam index (BI), a port for a certain reference signal, a resource index (for example, a CSI-RS resource indicator (CRI)), and/or the like.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In Step S<b>105</b>, the base station that has detected the beam recovery request transmits a response signal for the beam recovery request from the UE. The response signal may include reconfiguration information (for example, configuration information of DL-RS resources) related to one or a plurality of beams. For example, the response signal may be transmitted in a UE-common search space for a PDCCH. The UE may determine a transmit beam and/or a receive beam to be used, based on the beam reconfiguration information.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In Step S<b>106</b>, the UE may transmit a message to the base station, indicating that beam reconfiguration has been completed. For example, the message may be transmitted on a PUCCH, or may be transmitted on a PUSCH.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Beam recovery success (BR success) may represent a case where the processing has reached Step S<b>106</b>, for example. On the other hand, beam recovery failure (BR failure) may represent a case where no candidate beam can be identified in Step S<b>103</b>, for example.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Note that the numbers of the above steps are merely numbers assigned for the sake of description. A plurality of steps may be combined together, or the order may be rearranged. Whether or not BFR is performed may be configured for the UE by using higher layer signaling.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">Here, for example, the higher layer signaling may be any one or combinations of RRC (Radio Resource Control) signaling, MAC (Medium Access Control) signaling, broadcast information, and the like.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, the MAC signaling may use MAC control elements (MAC CEs), MAC PDUs (Protocol Data Units), and the like. For example, the broadcast information may be master information blocks (MIBs), system information blocks (SIBs), minimum system information (RMSI (Remaining Minimum System Information)), other system information (OSI), and the like.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">For NR, CB-BFR (Contention-Based BFR), which is BFR based on a contention-based random access (RA) procedure, and CF-BFR (Contention-Free BFR), which is BFR based on a contention-free random access procedure, are under study.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In CB-BFR, the UE may transmit a preamble selected from one or a plurality of preambles (each also referred to as an RA preamble, a random access channel (PRACH (Physical Random Access Channel)), a RACH preamble, and so on) at random. On the other hand, in CF-BFR, the UE may transmit a preamble that is allocated for the UE in a UE-specific manner by the base station. In CB-BFR, the base station may allocate the same preamble for a plurality of UEs. In CF-BFR, the base station may allocate a preamble individually for a UE.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In CB-BFR, when the base station receives a certain preamble as the beam recovery request, the base station may not be able to identify to which UE the preamble is transmitted. When contention resolution is performed at some point between the beam recovery request and the beam reconfiguration completion, the base station can identify an identifier (for example, a cell-radio RNTI (C-RNTI)) of the UE to which the preamble is transmitted.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">It may be assumed that the signal (for example, a preamble) transmitted by the UE during the RA procedure is the beam recovery request.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In either case of CB-BFR or CF-BFR, information related to PRACH resources (RA preamble) may be notified by using higher layer signaling (RRC signaling and so on), for example. For example, the information may include information indicating correspondence between a detected DL-RS (beam) and PRACH resources, and different PRACH resources may be associated for each DL-RS.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Detection of a beam failure may be performed in a MAC layer. Regarding CB-BFR, when the UE receives a PDCCH corresponding to a C-RNTI related to the UE itself, it may be determined that contention resolution has succeeded.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">RA parameters of CB-BFR and CF-BFR may be of the same parameter set.

The term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; or &#x201c;sector&#x201d; refers to part of or the entire coverage area of a base station and/or a base station subsystem that provides communication services within this coverage.</p><p id="p-0233" num="0253">In this specification, the terms &#x201c;mobile station (MS),&#x201d; &#x201c;user terminal,&#x201d; &#x201c;user equipment (UE),&#x201d; and &#x201c;terminal&#x201d; may be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0234" num="0254">A mobile station may be referred to, by a person skilled in the art, as a &#x201c;subscriber station,&#x201d; &#x201c;mobile unit,&#x201d; &#x201c;subscriber unit,&#x201d; &#x201c;wireless unit,&#x201d; &#x201c;remote unit,&#x201d; &#x201c;mobile device,&#x201d; &#x201c;wireless device,&#x201d; &#x201c;wireless communication device,&#x201d; &#x201c;remote device,&#x201d; &#x201c;mobile subscriber station,&#x201d; &#x201c;access terminal,&#x201d; &#x201c;mobile terminal,&#x201d; &#x201c;wireless terminal,&#x201d; &#x201c;remote terminal,&#x201d; &#x201c;handset,&#x201d; &#x201c;user agent,&#x201d; &#x201c;mobile client,&#x201d; &#x201c;client,&#x201d; or some other appropriate terms in some cases.</p><p id="p-0235" num="0255">Furthermore, the radio base station in this specification may be interpreted as a user terminal. For example, each aspect/embodiment of the present disclosure may be applied to the structure that replaces a communication between a radio base station and a user terminal with a communication between a plurality of user terminals (&#x201c;D2D (Device-to-Device)&#x201d;). In this case, the user terminals <b>20</b> may have the functions of the radio base stations <b>10</b> described above. The words &#x201c;uplink&#x201d; and &#x201c;downlink&#x201d; may be interpreted as &#x201c;side&#x201d;. For example, an uplink channel may be interpreted as a side channel.</p><p id="p-0236" num="0256">Likewise, the user terminal in this specification may be interpreted as a radio base station. In this case, the radio base stations <b>10</b> may have the functions of the user terminals <b>20</b> described above.</p><p id="p-0237" num="0257">Actions which have been described in this specification to be performed by a base station may, in some cases, be performed by upper nodes. In a network including one or a plurality of network nodes with base stations, it is clear that various operations that are performed to communicate with terminals can be performed by base stations, one or more network nodes (for example, MMEs (Mobility Management Entities), S-GW (Serving-Gateways), and so on may be possible, but these are not limiting) other than base stations, or combinations of these.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0258">The aspects/embodiments illustrated in this specification may be used individually or in combinations, which may be switched depending on the mode of implementation. The order of processes, sequences, flowcharts, and so on that have been used to describe the aspects/embodiments in this specification may be re-ordered as long as inconsistencies do not arise. For example, although various methods have been illustrated in this specification with various components of steps in exemplary orders, the specific orders that are illustrated herein are by no means limiting.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0259">The aspects/embodiments illustrated in this specification may be applied to LTE (Long Term Evolution), LTE-A (LTE-Advanced), LTE-B (LTE-Beyond), SUPER 3G, IMT-Advanced, 4G (4th generation mobile communication system), 5G (5th generation mobile communication system), FRA (Future Radio Access), New-RAT (Radio Access Technology), NR(New Radio), NX (New radio access), FX (Future generation radio access), GSM (registered trademark) (Global System for Mobile communications), CDMA 2000, UMB (Ultra Mobile Broadband), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi (registered trademark)), IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX (registered trademark)), IEEE 802.20, UWB (Ultra-WideBand), Bluetooth (registered trademark), systems that use other adequate radio communication methods and/or next-generation systems that are enhanced based on these.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0260">The phrase &#x201c;based on&#x201d; (or &#x201c;on the basis of&#x201d;) as used in this specification does not mean &#x201c;based only on&#x201d; (or &#x201c;only on the basis of&#x201d;), unless otherwise specified. In other words, the phrase &#x201c;based on&#x201d; (or &#x201c;on the basis of&#x201d;) means both &#x201c;based only on&#x201d; and &#x201c;based at least on&#x201d; (&#x201c;only on the basis of&#x201d; and &#x201c;at least on the basis of&#x201d;).</p><p id="p-0241" num="0261">Reference to elements with designations such as &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; and so on as used in this specification does not generally limit the quantity or order of these elements. These designations may be used in this specification only for convenience, as a method for distinguishing between two or more elements. Thus, reference to the first and second elements does not imply that only two elements may be employed, or that the first element must precede the second element in some way.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0262">The term &#x201c;judging (determining)&#x201d; as in this specification may encompass a wide variety of actions. For example, &#x201c;judging (determining)&#x201d; may be interpreted to mean making &#x201c;judgments (determinations)&#x201d; about calculating, computing, processing, deriving, investigating, looking up, (for example, searching a table, a database, or some other data structures), ascertaining, and so on. Furthermore, &#x201c;judging (determining)&#x201d; may be interpreted to mean making &#x201c;judgments (determinations)&#x201d; about receiving (for example, receiving information), transmitting (for example, transmitting information), input, output, accessing (for example, accessing data in a memory), and so on. In addition, &#x201c;judging (determining)&#x201d; as used herein may be interpreted to mean making &#x201c;judgments (determinations)&#x201d; about resolving, selecting, choosing, establishing, comparing, and so on. In other words, &#x201c;judging (determining)&#x201d; may be interpreted to mean making &#x201c;judgments (determinations)&#x201d; about some action.</p><p id="p-0243" num="0263">The terms &#x201c;connected&#x201d; and &#x201c;coupled,&#x201d; or any variation of these terms as used in this specification mean all direct or indirect connections or coupling between two or more elements, and may include the presence of one or more intermediate elements between two elements that are &#x201c;connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; to each other. The coupling or connection between the elements may be physical, logical, or a combination thereof. For example, &#x201c;connection&#x201d; may be interpreted as &#x201c;access.&#x201d;</p><p id="p-0244" num="0264">In this specification, when two elements are connected, the two elements may be considered &#x201c;connected&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; to each other by using one or more electrical wires, cables and/or printed electrical connections, and, as some non-limiting and non-inclusive examples, by using electromagnetic energy having wavelengths in radio frequency regions, microwave regions and/or (both visible and invisible) optical regions, or the like.</p><p id="p-0245" num="0265">In this specification, the phrase &#x201c;A and B are different&#x201d; may mean that &#x201c;A and B are different from each other.&#x201d; The terms &#x201c;separate,&#x201d; &#x201c;be coupled&#x201d; and so on may be interpreted similarly.</p><p id="p-0246" num="0266">When terms such as &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; and variations of those are used in this specification or in claims, these terms are intended to be inclusive, in a manner similar to the way the term &#x201c;including, comprising, or being provided&#x201d; is used.
