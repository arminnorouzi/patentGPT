No. 9,763,654, to Van Dyke, is said to disclose an orthopedic joint distractor that includes a stem post defining a pivoting axis, an actuator configured to cause translational movement of the stem post, a locking sleeve holding the actuator and the stem post, a distractor arc held by the locking sleeve orthogonally to the pivoting axis and having a surface, and a first locking member held by the locking sleeve that can be advanced away from and toward the surface. The first locking member is said to prevent rotation of the distractor arc about the pivoting axis when it has advanced a sufficient distance toward the surface.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 9,044,270, to Gabriel, et al., is said to disclose an apparatus and related method for controlling a load on a human hip joint during normal gait while preserving motion. The approach is intended to treat osteoarthritis of the hip without substantially resisting an angular displacement associated with full mobility of the pelvis and femur bones.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Patent Publication No. 2012/0046754, by Clifford, et al., is also said to disclose an apparatus and related method for controlling a load on a human hip joint during normal gait while preserving motion, an approach intended to treat osteoarthritis of the hip without substantially resisting an angular displacement associated with full mobility of the pelvis and femur bones.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 6,162,223, to Orsak, et al., is said to disclose a joint fixator apparatus that conforms to the natural axis of rotation of the joint in question, such as a patient's wrist or knee to avoid the possibility of bone fragment displacement and/or fracture reduction. The apparatus is said to include two fixation rod sections or shaft sections with a spring module therebetween. The spring module is said to be in the form of a flexible coupler that connects to respective ends of the external fixator rod. The patent is said to disclose that the module can include a removable clip to restrain the motion of the spring a desired amount such as before healing takes place; that the rods can be used to hold pin clamps which then hold bone pins for attachment to selected bones of the patient such as above and below a joint or above and below a fracture, and that the pin clamps can be moved along the rod sections to provide distraction of the joints for a ligamentotaxis effect in reducing the fracture.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Methods and systems for relieving or removing the weight from a hip joint are generally intrusive, painful, maintenance-intensive, or reduce or eliminate joint mobility. Methods and systems for off-loading hip joints that are not intrusive, painful, or maintenance intensive and which do not reduce or eliminate joint mobility are desirable.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments of the disclosure, a hip-off-loading device is disclosed as including a pelvic assembly including: a pelvic base plate configured for attachment to a human pelvis; a distraction adjustment mechanism coupled to the pelvic base plate, wherein the distraction adjustment mechanism is lockable, to provide for adjusting the distal distraction of the hip-off-loading device; and at least a portion of a rotation mechanism to provide for internal or external rotation or both, and to provide for non-dynamic interoperative adjustment of abduction, adduction, or both; a link movably coupled to the pelvic assembly to provide for internal or external rotation or both; and a femoral assembly movably coupled to the link and including a femoral attachment mechanism for attachment to a femur to provide for flexion, extension, or both.

In this embodiment, hip-off-loading device <b>1000</b> includes a pelvic assembly <b>1100</b>, an adjustable link <b>1300</b>, and a femoral assembly <b>1400</b>. The hip-off-loading device <b>1000</b> is shown in position relative to human pelvis <b>2</b> with iliac crest <b>4</b> and acetabulum <b>6</b> and a human femur <b>8</b> with femoral head <b>10</b> and femoral neck <b>12</b>. The pelvic assembly <b>1100</b> is attached to the iliac crest <b>4</b> of the pelvis <b>2</b> just above the acetabulum <b>6</b> with fasteners such as, e.g., bone screws (not depicted). The adjustable link <b>1300</b> is coupled to the pelvic assembly at one end of the link <b>1300</b> and the opposite end is coupled to the femoral assembly <b>1400</b>. The femoral assembly <b>1400</b> is attached to the shaft of the femur <b>8</b> using bone screws (not shown) and is able to be contoured to match patient anatomy.

The pelvic base plate <b>1105</b> attaches to the pelvic bone via bone screws (not shown). The pelvic plate mounting holes are able to be contoured by the surgeon in order to match up to patient anatomy for secure attachment. Centrally mounted through the pelvic base plate <b>1105</b> is a gear rack <b>1110</b> which has rotational bearing surfaces at either end to engage the upper internal/external rotational bearing <b>1115</b> and lower internal/external rotational bearing <b>1120</b>. Rotation of the bevel gear <b>1125</b> drives a worm drive (not shown) which is engaged with the rack gear <b>1110</b> and thereby drives the rack gear <b>1110</b> both proximally and distally, at surgeon discretion, in order to both fit patient anatomy and also to provide adjustable distraction of the femur <b>8</b> relative to the iliac <b>4</b> (not shown). A gearbox cover <b>1130</b> encloses the worm drive and the bevel gear and keeps them in proper relationship to one another. The upper and lower internal/external rotation bearings, <b>1115</b> and <b>1120</b>, respectively, permit the femur <b>8</b> to rotate both internally and externally about the centroid of the femoral head <b>10</b> (not shown).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> shows another detail view of the pelvic assembly <b>1100</b>, with the upper and lower internal/external rotation bearings <b>1115</b> and <b>1120</b> and gearbox cover <b>1130</b> (not shown) removed.

Actuation of the worm drive <b>1140</b>, drives the rack gear <b>1110</b> both proximally and distally for both joint distraction and to accommodate unique patient anatomy. An advantage of the pelvic assembly <b>1100</b> is that anatomical loads placed on the worm drive <b>1140</b> cannot drive the move the rack gear <b>1110</b> up or down.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a detail of the adjustable link <b>1300</b>, which connects the pelvic assembly <b>11</b> to the femoral assembly <b>1400</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1400</b></figref>). The upper link <b>1305</b> attaches the lower internal/external bearing <b>1120</b> via screw. The opposing faces have radially arrayed teeth which prevent rotational translation once the screw is tightened. The distal end of the upper link <b>1305</b> is threaded into a female nut <b>1310</b> which has both right-handed and left-handed threads so that when it is turned the upper link <b>1305</b> and lower link <b>1315</b> can be drawn together simultaneously or pushed apart thereby shortening or lengthening the assembly. The lower link <b>1315</b> has radially arrayed teeth which prevent rotational movement when secured using a screw through the center. The angulation of the upper link <b>1305</b> and lower link <b>1315</b> can be adjusted to match the patient specific angle of the femoral neck and then locked into place by tightening the locking screws through the holes in the upper link <b>1305</b> and lower link <b>1315</b>.
