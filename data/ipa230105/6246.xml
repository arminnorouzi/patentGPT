The resulting powder mixture is heat-treated in an inert gas atmosphere with adjusted oxygen concentration and moisture concentration (for example, an argon atmosphere having a dew point of &#x2212;60&#xb0; C. or less). The heat treatment temperature may be, for example, 200&#xb0; C. or more and 650&#xb0; C. or less.

The proportion of 0 in the surface region of the solid electrolyte material is increased by the heat treatment at a temperature lower than the melting point. The raw material powders may be mixed at a molar ratio adjusted in advance so as to offset a composition change that may occur in the synthesis process. The oxygen amount in a solid electrolyte material is determined by selecting the raw material powders, the oxygen concentration in the atmosphere, the moisture concentration in the atmosphere, and the reaction time.
