A pixel circuit for controlling a light-emitting element to emit light is a core element of the OLED display apparatus, and also has a research value.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the pixel circuit in the related art, due to operating characteristics of a driving transistor, the display apparatus has different brightness between a first phase and a second phase, thereby affecting the display effect. Especially in a low-gray-scale and low-frequency display state of the display apparatus, the brightness difference between the first phase and the second phase is obvious. The first phase refers to a phase including a data writing phase and a light-emitting phase. The second phase is a phase that is performed after the first phase, and does not include the data writing phase but includes the light-emitting phase.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">A first aspect of the present disclosure provides a display apparatus. The display apparatus includes pixel circuits and a threshold detection module. The pixel circuits include a driving transistor configured to generate a light-emitting driving current, and a data voltage writing module having an output terminal that is electrically connected to the driving transistor. The threshold detection module is configured to detect a threshold voltage of the driving transistor. An operating process of the pixel circuit includes a first phase and a second phase subsequent to the first phase. The first phase includes a data writing phase and a light-emitting phase subsequent to the data writing phase. The second phase includes an adjusting phase and a light-emitting phase subsequent to the adjusting phase. The data voltage writing module is configured to transmit a data voltage to the driving transistor during the data writing phase. The data voltage writing module is configured to transmit an adjusting voltage to the driving transistor during the adjusting phase. The adjusting voltage corresponds to the threshold voltage of the driving transistor detected by the threshold detection module.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">A second aspect of the present disclosure provides a method for driving the above display apparatus. The method includes: transmitting, by the data voltage writing module, a data voltage to the driving transistor during the data writing phase; and transmitting, by the data voltage writing module, the adjusting voltage corresponding to the threshold voltage of the driving transistor to the driving transistor during the adjusting phase.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to more clearly illustrate technical solutions of embodiments of the present disclosure, the accompanying drawings used in some embodiments are briefly described below.
