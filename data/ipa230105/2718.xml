Translation stage <b>122</b> may be incorporated in base <b>110</b>, for example as part of a microscope that includes fluorescence imager <b>140</b>. In an alternative embodiment, not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, translation stage <b>122</b> is instead configured to translate needle <b>130</b> in the x and y dimensions.

Control system <b>150</b> may include an image analysis module <b>152</b> that analyzes fluorescence image(s) <b>182</b> to automatically select a cell for extraction and record its location in the x-y plane. Image analysis module <b>152</b> may apply a computational algorithm to fluorescence image(s) <b>182</b> to identify a cell that meets one or more criteria for selection. Image analysis module <b>152</b> may be configured to select a cell according to an analysis of intensity of two fluorescence color channels. The two fluorescence color channels may be two color channels of FRET (Forster resonance energy transfer) fluorescence.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Control system <b>150</b> may also include a motion controller <b>154</b> that controls translation stages <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> to position needle <b>130</b> at the selected cell. Motion controller <b>154</b> controls translation stage <b>122</b> to adjust the position of needle <b>130</b> in the x-y plane to position needle <b>130</b> at the recorded location of the selected cell in the x-y plane. After that needle <b>130</b> has been placed at the recorded location in the x-y plane, motion controller <b>154</b> controls translation stage <b>124</b> to lower needle <b>130</b> to the selected cell such that needle <b>130</b> can remove the selected cell from cell culture plate <b>112</b>. Motion controller <b>154</b> may then control translation stages <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> to deposit the extracted cell elsewhere, such as in a suitable container. In one implementation, control system <b>150</b> includes a processor and a non-transitory memory encoding machine-readable instructions that, when executed by the processor, controls the processor to (a) perform the control functions of control system <b>150</b> and/or (b) effect that the control functions of control system <b>150</b> be performed by other electronic circuitry.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">Cell sorter <b>100</b> may further include a pump <b>160</b> that is hydraulically coupled to needle <b>130</b>. Pump <b>160</b> is, for example, a peristaltic pump or a piston pump. The piston pump may include a gas-tight sterile syringe.

The image sensor may be a CCD image sensor or a CMOS image sensor. In this embodiment, the imaging objective images fluorescence from sample <b>180</b> onto the image sensor, such that the image sensor can capture the fluorescence image. The image sensor may be a color image sensor such that the image sensor may capture several different spectral types of fluorescence in one shot. Alternatively, the image sensor may be a monochrome image sensor. Even in the case of a monochrome image sensor, fluorescence imager <b>140</b> may be operated to discriminately image different spectral types of fluorescence. For example, fluorescence imager <b>140</b> may include two or more fluorescence emission filters that are inserted into the optical train of fluorescence imager <b>140</b> one at a time, to capture a different fluorescence image for each of the two or more fluorescence emission filters. Selection of a cell for extraction may be based on a comparison of two or more resulting fluorescence images.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another embodiment, fluorescence imager <b>140</b> is a scanning system that includes a photomultiplier tube (or another photodetector) and a motorized translation stage configured to scan position of the photomultiplier tube relative to cell culture plate <b>112</b>, to build the one or more fluorescence images by scanning. Also in this embodiment, fluorescence imager <b>140</b> may include two or more fluorescence emission filters that are inserted into the optical train of fluorescence imager <b>140</b> one at a time, to capture a different fluorescence image for each of the two or more fluorescence emission filters.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Although shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> as being located beneath base <b>110</b>, a portion of fluorescence imager <b>140</b>, such as an image sensor or photomultiplier tube, may be located elsewhere and utilize relay optics to view cell culture plate <b>112</b> from underneath, so as to image sample <b>180</b> through a bottom of cell culture plate <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a needle end <b>300</b>, with the cross section being orthogonal to the x-y plane. Needle end <b>300</b> is an embodiment of the end of needle <b>130</b> closest to cell culture plate <b>112</b>. Needle end <b>300</b> is tube-shaped and has a wall <b>310</b> that forms a channel <b>320</b> into which a selected cell may be collected. Needle end <b>300</b> has an inner diameter <b>370</b> and an outer diameter <b>372</b>. Wall <b>310</b> has a thickness <b>374</b>. Without departing from the scope hereof, two or more of inner diameter <b>370</b>, outer diameter <b>372</b>, and thickness <b>374</b> may vary in the z-dimension. In order to remove a selected cell without also removing other nearby non-selected cells, the dimensions of needle end <b>300</b> are generally small. In one embodiment, inner diameter <b>370</b> is in the range between 5 and 200 microns. Thickness <b>374</b> is, for example, 100 microns or less. In one example, inner diameter <b>370</b> is between 25 and 50 microns (e.g., 35 microns), and outer diameter <b>372</b> is between 100 and 150 microns (e.g., 120 microns). Needle end <b>300</b> may be made of a metal, such as stainless steel. With the small dimensions mentioned here, needle end <b>300</b> may be relatively fragile and likely to be damaged if driven into the bottom of cell culture plate <b>112</b> with a certain force.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, cell extraction module <b>120</b> may incorporate a mechanism that positions needle <b>130</b> within sufficient proximity of a cell selected for extraction while protecting needle <b>130</b> from pressing against cell culture plate <b>112</b> with sufficient force to damage the end of needle <b>130</b>. In one such embodiment, cell extraction module <b>120</b> includes a sensor <b>132</b> coupled to needle <b>130</b>. Sensor <b>132</b> is communicatively coupled to translation stage <b>124</b> to stop downward translation of needle <b>130</b>, by translation stage <b>124</b>, when needle <b>130</b>, according to sensor <b>132</b>, is (a) in a threshold degree of contact with cell culture plate <b>112</b> and/or the selected cell or (b) at a threshold distance above cell culture plate <b>112</b> and/or the selected cell. Sensor <b>132</b> may be communicatively coupled with translation stage <b>124</b> via control system <b>150</b>, such that control system <b>150</b> either allows or prevents downward translation by translation stage <b>124</b> according to an output or state of sensor <b>132</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one implementation, sensor <b>132</b> includes a pressure sensor that senses when needle <b>130</b> reaches the bottom of cell culture plate <b>112</b>. In another implementation, sensor <b>132</b> includes an electrical sensor that senses when needle <b>130</b> is in electrical contact with cell culture plate <b>112</b> and/or sample <b>180</b>. In this implementation, sensor <b>132</b> may detect, electrically, that needle <b>130</b> has reached sample <b>180</b> and thus stop translation stage <b>124</b> from lowering needle <b>130</b> all the way to the bottom of cell culture plate <b>112</b>. Needle <b>130</b> may be mounted in cell extraction module <b>120</b> in a manner that allows needle <b>130</b> to slide upwards when pushed by a threshold force, such that, even if translation stage <b>124</b> continues downward translation of needle <b>130</b> slightly beyond contact with the bottom of cell culture plate <b>112</b>, needle <b>130</b> is protected from pressing on cell culture plate <b>112</b> with high pressure.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another implementation, sensor <b>132</b> includes at least one of a photodetector and a light source. In embodiments, sensor <b>132</b> is, or includes, one of an optical proximity sensor and an optical limit switch. In embodiments, sensor <b>132</b> is an acoustic sensor, such as an ultrasonic proximity sensor.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an example use scenario, cell extraction module <b>120</b> uses sensor <b>132</b> to position needle <b>130</b> no more than 1-2 microns above the cell selected for extraction, while the manufacturing tolerance for flatness of the bottom of cell culture plate <b>112</b>, in this scenario, is at least 100 microns. For example, in the case of a multiwell plate, different wells may have depth that differ from each other by up to approximately 100 microns or even greater. In such situations, sensor <b>132</b> facilitates accurate and rapid positioning of needle <b>130</b>, in each of a series of wells, within sufficient proximity of the cell selected for extraction while protecting needle <b>130</b> from damaging impact on the bottom of the wells.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">When needle <b>130</b> is in contact with sample <b>180</b>, needle <b>130</b> may pick up debris from sample <b>180</b>. It may be beneficial to clean this debris off needle <b>130</b> before using needle <b>130</b> again to remove another cell. Cellular debris is predominantly negatively charged plasma membrane. In an embodiment, cell sorter <b>100</b> is configured to apply a transient negative electrical charge to needle <b>130</b> to assist with cleaning of needle <b>130</b>. In this embodiment, cell sorter <b>100</b> may include a needle charge control module <b>170</b> that applies a transient, negative electrical charge to needle <b>130</b> when needle <b>130</b> is lowered into a liquid medium. This transient, negative electrical charge serves to repel, from needle <b>130</b> and into the liquid medium, negatively charged cellular debris. In operation, this cleaning may be performed in a dedicated cleaning fluid, or in sample <b>180</b>. For example, needle charge control module <b>170</b> may apply the transient negative charge when needle <b>130</b> first contacts a liquid medium of sample <b>180</b> during downward translation of needle <b>130</b> toward a selected cell. Control system <b>150</b> may control needle charge control module <b>170</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates one cell sorting method <b>400</b> that may be performed by cell sorter <b>100</b>. Method <b>400</b> includes steps <b>410</b>, <b>420</b>, and <b>440</b>. Step <b>410</b> captures, through a bottom of a cell culture plate, one or more fluorescence images of a fluorescently labeled sample of cells disposed in the cell culture plate. In one example of step <b>410</b>, fluorescence imager <b>140</b> captures one or more fluorescence images <b>182</b> of sample <b>180</b> through the bottom of cell culture plate <b>112</b>. Step <b>420</b> selects, based upon the one or more fluorescence images captured in step <b>410</b>, a cell from the sample of cells and records the location of the selected cell in the cell culture plate. In one example of step <b>420</b>, image analysis module <b>152</b> processes fluorescence image(s) <b>182</b> to select a cell and record its location in the x-y plane.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Step <b>440</b> extracts the selected cell from the cell culture plate. Step <b>440</b> includes steps <b>442</b>, <b>444</b>, and <b>446</b>. Step <b>442</b> positions a needle above the location recorded in step <b>420</b>. Step <b>444</b> lowers the needle to the selected cell. Step <b>446</b> hydraulically removes the selected cell with the needle. Step <b>440</b> may be performed by cell extraction module <b>120</b>, for example as controlled by control system <b>150</b>. In one example of step <b>442</b>, control system <b>150</b> controls translation stage <b>122</b> to position cell culture plate <b>112</b> such that needle <b>130</b> is above the location of the selected cell. Needle <b>130</b> is thereby placed at the x-y location of the selected cell in cell culture plate <b>112</b>, but a non-zero distance in the z-dimension above sample <b>180</b>. In one example of step <b>444</b>, control system <b>150</b> controls translation stage <b>124</b> to lower needle <b>130</b> to the selected cell. In one example of step <b>446</b>, control system <b>150</b> controls pump <b>160</b> to hydraulically remove the selected cell with needle <b>130</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In certain embodiments, step <b>444</b> includes steps <b>450</b> and <b>452</b>. Step <b>450</b> senses a property sensitive to proximity of the needle to at least one of the first cell and the cell culture plate. In one example of step <b>450</b>, sensor <b>132</b> senses proximity of needle <b>130</b> to the selected cell and/or cell culture plate <b>112</b>. Step <b>452</b> stops downward translation of the needle when the step <b>450</b> indicates that the needle is (a) in a threshold degree of contact with at least one of the first cell and the cell culture plate or (b) at a threshold distance above at least one of the first cell and the cell culture plate. In one example of step <b>452</b>, motion controller <b>154</b> stops downward translation by translation stage <b>124</b> when an output or state of sensor <b>132</b> indicates that needle <b>130</b> is (a) in a threshold degree of contact with at least one of the first cell and the cell culture plate or (b) at a threshold distance above at least one of the first cell and the cell culture plate.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one use scenario, the cells in sample <b>180</b> are adhered to the cell culture plate before and during image capture in step <b>410</b>. When implemented in this scenario, method <b>400</b> may include a step <b>430</b>, performed after step <b>410</b> and before step <b>440</b>, of chemically or biochemically reducing the adherence of the cells to the cell culture plate without changing locations of the cells in the cell culture plate. When a de-adhering agent is added in step <b>430</b>, cells may change from a flattened, adhered state to a round state that is either not or only slightly adhered to the cell culture plate. Step <b>430</b> enables hydraulic removal of the selected cell in step <b>446</b> with no need for harsh removal processes such as scraping or local application of de-adhering agents. It is therefore possible to use a thin (and thus relatively fragile) needle, such as needle <b>130</b> with needle end <b>300</b>, which in turn makes it possible to accurately and selectively extract the selected cell even when the selected cell is in close proximity to other non-selected cells. In one embodiment, step <b>430</b> adds EGTA to the cell culture plate to reduce the adherence of cells to the cell culture plate. In another embodiment, step <b>430</b> utilizes another agent, for example selected from the group consisting of EDTA, trypsin, and nonspecific proteases. Cell sorter <b>100</b> does not require movement of cell culture plate <b>112</b> between fluorescence imaging in step <b>410</b> and cell extraction in step <b>440</b>, and the cells therefore stay in place even though they are not adhered or only weakly adhered to cell culture plate <b>112</b>.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In situations where step <b>420</b> identifies several cells that meet the selection criteria, method <b>400</b> may perform step <b>440</b> once for each such cell.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Step <b>440</b> may include a step <b>448</b> of clean the needle upon insertion into a liquid media containing the sample of cells by applying a transient negative charge to the needle during the insertion. In one example of step <b>448</b>, needle charge control module <b>170</b> applies a transient, negative electrical charge to needle <b>130</b> while needle <b>130</b> is being inserted in sample <b>180</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates one cell extraction module <b>500</b> for extracting a pre-selected cell from sample <b>180</b> in cell culture plate <b>112</b>.

However, when needle <b>130</b> reaches the bottom of cell culture plate <b>112</b> (potentially with a portion of sample <b>180</b> pressed therebetween), continued downward translation of translation stage <b>124</b> causes needle <b>130</b> to slide in low-friction amount <b>730</b> and push against lever <b>720</b> to lift lever <b>720</b> away from conductivity sensor <b>710</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>).
