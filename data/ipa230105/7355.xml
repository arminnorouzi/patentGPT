Upon receiving a user request to switch from a current channel to a new channel, a conventional digital entertainment system may not render media content corresponding to the new channel in a timely manner. For example, it may take a second or more for a conventional digital entertainment system to prepare the media content for display by tuning to the new channel, obtaining video signals and/or audio signals being broadcast on the new channel, decoding and/or decompressing the video signals and/or the audio signals, synchronizing the video signals and the audio signals, preparing a video buffer of a display device, etc. As a result, a user may have to wait one or more seconds after pressing a channel change button for the desired content to appear.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, new mechanisms for presenting media content in response to a channel change request are desirable.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Methods, systems, and media for presenting media content in response to a channel change request are provided.

In some implementations, the thumbnail content can include a thumbnail image, a video comprising a set of frames having a reduced spatial and/or temporal resolution, an animation, and/or any other suitable content. In some implementations, the channel navigation interface can be presented on multiple screens concurrently.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some implementations, the mechanisms can simultaneously present the thumbnail content and a full-screen display/or nearly full-screen display of media content provided on a current channel.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some implementations, in response to a user selection of a channel from the channel navigation interface (e.g., by selecting a thumbnail image presented in the channel navigation interface), the mechanisms can present a full-screen display or nearly full-screen display of thumbnail content and corresponding audio representing media content provided on the selected channel while media content from the selected channel is prepared for presentation. The thumbnail content representing the media content provided on the selected channel can be presented in a full-screen display or nearly full-screen display of as a set of moving images, an animation, or in any other suitable form, in some implementations.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some implementations, the mechanisms can identify one or more candidate channels that are likely to be selected and store suitable thumbnail content for the candidate channel(s) so that the thumbnail content can be available for presentation in response to a channel change request.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some implementations, the mechanisms can arrange and/or present available channels by category (e.g., movies, sports, high-definition content, related media content, and/or any other suitable category of channels). For example, the mechanisms can present thumbnail content representing media content provided on a set of channels associated with a particular category (e.g., a category that is selected by a user) on one or more screens. In a more particular example, when presenting media content provided on a current channel (e.g., a television show about kittens), the mechanisms can present thumbnail content of related media content provided on a set of channels (e.g., kitten videos provided on a video sharing Web site, a Web page with information about kittens, video-on-demand programs related to kittens, a Web page of a store that sells kitten supplies, information on kitten related offers, and/or any other suitable related content).</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The mechanisms can be implemented with respect to any suitable channels, such as an analog television channel, a digital television channel, a Web-based television channel, a video-on-demand channel, a Web content channel, a channel provided by a video hosting Web site, a radio channel, an audio channel, a program that can be used to present suitable media content (such as a Web browser, a media player, a streaming program, a gaming program, a book reader, a word processor, a presentation program, and/or any other suitable program), and/or any other suitable channel that contains a visual component and/or an audio component.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some implementations, any suitable media content can be provided on a channel. For example, media content can include any suitable type(s) of content, such as one or more of audio content, video content, text, graphics, multimedia content, closed captioning content, Web content, and/or any other suitable content. As another example, media content may be provided as part of any suitable media product or service, such as programs broadcast over-the air, programs broadcast by a cable television provider, programs broadcast by a satellite television provider, on-demand programs, over-the-top programs, Internet content, streaming programs, recorded programs, and/or any other suitable programs. As yet another example, media content may have any suitable format, such as one or more of JPEG, H.264, MPEG-4AVC, MPEG-7, MP3, ASCII codes, WebP, WebM, and/or any other suitable format.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a generalized block diagram of an example <b>100</b> of a system for presenting media content in response to a channel change request in accordance with some implementations of the disclosed subject matter is shown.

Additionally, certain information about the user can be stored locally (e.g., not shared), encrypted, and/or treated in one or more ways before it is stored to remove personally identifiable information. For example, a user's identity can be treated such that no personally identifiable information can be determined for the user. As another example, a user's geographic location can be generalized where location information is obtained (e.g., to a city level, a ZIP code level, a state level, etc.), so that a particular location of a user cannot be determined.
