The spacer cap <b>32</b> is disposed between the sash panel <b>26</b> of the sash <b>20</b> and the projection <b>42</b> in a direction substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal axis A of the projection <b>42</b>.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In conventional sash covers, the material of the projection and the clear coat on the sash panel have substantially similar coefficients of friction such that movement of the sash cover relative to the sash panel generates a noise. The spacer cap <b>32</b> in accordance with the exemplary embodiments of the present invention is disposed between the projection <b>42</b> and the sash panel <b>26</b> of the panel <b>20</b> to prevent contact between the projection <b>42</b> and the sash panel <b>26</b> of the sash <b>20</b> when the sash cover <b>30</b> is connected to the sash <b>20</b>. The projection <b>42</b> and the spacer cap <b>32</b> are made of different materials, such that the coefficients of friction of the spacer cap <b>32</b> and the sash <b>20</b> are different, thereby substantially eliminating the generation of a noise resulting from movement of the sash cover <b>30</b> relative to the sash <b>20</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The second and third sash cover assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>25</b> are configured and installed to the second sash <b>24</b> similarly to the first sash cover assembly <b>18</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, each of the second and third sash cover assemblies <b>22</b> and <b>25</b> includes two projections <b>70</b> that are configured similarly to the projections <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> of the first sash assembly <b>18</b> and that receive spacer caps <b>32</b> to facilitate securing the second and third sash cover assemblies to the second sash <b>24</b>.</p><heading id="h-0007" level="1">General Interpretation of Terms</heading><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In understanding the scope of the present invention, the term &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; and its derivatives, as used herein, are intended to be open ended terms that specify the presence of the stated features, elements, components, groups, integers, and/or steps, but do not exclude the presence of other unstated features, elements, components, groups, integers and/or steps.
