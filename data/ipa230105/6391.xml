Usually, however, the known connection strips cannot be adapted to different applications, or they can only be adapted to a very limited extent.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is therefore the object of the present disclosure to provide an improved connection strip and a method for its manufacture to easily adapt the respective connection strip to different applications during its manufacture.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it is an object of the present disclosure to provide a connection strip which is designed as a printed circuit board connector and has a strip-like connection housing including one or a plurality of parts. The connection housing has a plurality of outer sides, the first outer side having a mating face side on which there are at least two or more mating face plug-in contacts, which can each be connected with a plug-in contact of a corresponding plug connector. The connection housing is further designed to have printed circuit board plug-in contacts on one, two or more of the other outer sides. These contacts project beyond the respective outer side so that a printed circuit board can be attached on the one or more outer sides from which printed circuit board plug-in contacts project. In this way, plug connectors with different connection directions for connecting one or more printed circuit boards can be implemented in a simple manner.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">The printed circuit board plug-in contacts are provided on at least two different outer sides and project outward from these outer sides of the connection housing so that at least two differently oriented printed circuit boards can be arranged on the connection housing.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a preferred embodiment, the printed circuit board plug-in contacts project from at least two parallel aligned outer sides of the connection housing, facing away from one another, so that at least two printed circuit boards aligned parallel in space can be arranged on the connection housing.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a preferred embodiment, the printed circuit board plug-in contacts project from at least two perpendicularly aligned outer sides of the connection housing, so that at least two perpendicularly aligned printed circuit boards can be arranged on the connection housing.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a further embodiment, a third printed circuit board is provided on a further, third outer side.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another embodiment, to easily attach printed circuit boards to a plurality of sides of the connection housing, the connection housings and/or individual connection housings have a generally cuboid configuration, including an upper side, a lower side, a mating face side, a back side and one or two connecting sides.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to provide variants of the printed circuit board connector, the printed circuit board plug-in contacts and the mating face plug-in contacts each preferably form the two ends of integrally formed contact pins that are inserted into the connection housing and are fixed thereto. It is then particularly advantageous for the printed circuit board plug-in contacts and the mating face plug-in contacts to each form the two ends of straight contact pins or the two ends of L-shaped contact pins. In this way, connection strips of various types can be manufactured in a simple manner such that printed circuit boards can be easily connected to them on different outer sides. The contact pins preferably have a square cross-section. However, they can also have a rectangular or other cross-section. The cross-section can be longitudinally constant, if necessary, except for the tapering ends. But it can also vary over the length.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The disclosure also provides an arrangement of a connection strip and at least two printed circuit boards, wherein the printed circuit board plug-in contacts project outward from at least two different outer sides of the connection strip, particularly the connection housing. On each of these sides a printed circuit board is soldered to the printed circuit board plug-in contacts.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">In this case, printed circuit board plug-in contacts project from two outer sides of the connection housing and a printed circuit board is soldered to the printed circuit board plug-in contacts on each of these sides, so that the two printed circuit boards are aligned parallel to one another. Alternatively, male printed circuit board contacts project from the housing and a printed circuit board is soldered to the printed circuit board contacts on each of these sides, so that these two printed circuit boards are aligned perpendicularly to one another. Arrangements with three printed circuit boards can also be implemented.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The respective plug-in contact preferably penetrates the housing in at least one region, in particular in an inner wall region.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The optionally provided individual connection housings, also referred to herein as sub-housings, can be connected to one another and held securely to one another via corresponding mechanical connection mechanisms. These connection mechanisms can include one or more latching hooks and corresponding latching traps/recesses.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is advantageous if the individual connection housings connected to one another are mechanically connected via corresponding mechanical connection mechanisms. That is, a first of the connection housings to be connected to one another in the connection direction has two lugs, one of which projects as an extension of an upper side and one projects as an extension of a lower side of the connection housing in the direction of an adjacent further connection housing, and the adjacent additional connection housing has a recess on the upper side and the lower side that corresponds to the lugs, in which the lugs of the adjacent first connection housing engage in a form-fitting manner when plugged together.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">In this way, a simple yet secure connection of the individual connection housings lined up next to one another is provided, which leads to a good fit of the connection housing in the assembled connection strip.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In this case, however, the individual connection housings alternatively or additionally have further corresponding mechanically acting connection mechanisms. According to a further development, a tongue and groove connection is formed between one or both lugs and the corresponding recess(es).</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">In this way, a connection between aligned individual connection housings that is easy to assemble and yet particularly stable is realized, in which the individual connection housings in the connection strip can be secured multiple times and in a plurality of directions.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is preferred that the individual connection housings are essentially cuboid and have an upper side, a lower side, a mating face side, a back side and two connecting sides.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to a further development, on one or more of the respectively corresponding locking mechanisms, in particular on the locking projection, a bevel is formed to facilitate the locking process during assembly.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a further advantageous embodiment, the lugs and the recesses in the plane of the upper side or the lower side engage in a step-like form-fitting manner. In this way, a form fit is arranged in the plug-in direction.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to a first embodiment, the connection strip can only have connection housings with the same mating faces. However, embodiments of connection strips can also be implemented in which the connection housings only partially have the same mating faces and partially have different mating faces. In this case, however, the connection devices are preferably nevertheless designed to be compatible.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">It can be provided that at least one or more of the mating faces each have a contact pin, a socket contact and/or a shield contact.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The disclosure also provides a method for manufacturing connection strips configured according to one of the preceding embodiments, including at least the following steps: (1) providing one or more individual connection housings of the connection strip and providing the first type straight contact pins and the second type L-shaped contact pins; (2) mounting the straight or L-shaped contact pin(s) into the connection housing(s) or individual connection housings so that one end of each pin forms a mating face plug-in contact and the other end forms a printed circuit board contact pin; (3) if a plurality of the individual connection housings are provided on the respective printed circuit board connector, assembling the plurality of individual connection housings, which can be done before or after steps (1) or (2); and (4) mounting, in particular soldering, the one or more printed circuit boards to at least one of the outer sides having protruding circuit board contact pins of the connection housing.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">With this method, not only can the respective individual circuit board connector be manufactured in a simple manner, but also a system made of a large number of different circuit board connectors can be realized or manufactured by repeatedly performing the method. The connectors of such a system differ by the connection direction relative to the printed circuit board or a plurality of circuit boards. For different connection directions toward the printed circuit board, contact pins of the same or possibly different type&#x2014;in particular straight and/or L-shaped type&#x2014;have to be mounted in the connection housings, which preferably include an identical construction.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0028" num="0027">Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent from a study of the following description when viewed in the light of the accompanying drawing, in which:</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>D</figref> are, a perspective view of a connection strip, the connection strip during an assembly step, a front view of the connection strip during assembly, a front view of an individual connection housing of the connection strip, and an enlarged front view of a portion of a connection housing, respectively;</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>D</figref> are, a rear perspective view of the connection strip from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a front perspective view of the connection strip arranged on a printed circuit board, a rear perspective view of the arrangement of connection strip and printed circuit board, and a rear perspective view of the printed circuit board and connection strip spaced apart prior to assembly, respectively;</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> are a perspective view of a second connection strip and a perspective view of the individual connection housings spaced apart prior to assembly, respectively, wherein one of the connection housings is an exploded view;</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> are front and rear perspective views, respectively, of the second connection strip from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> arranged on two printed circuit boards aligned in parallel;</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> is a rear perspective view of the connection strip of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> with the two printed circuit boards and the connection strip spaced apart prior to assembly;</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> are perspective views of third and fourth connection strips, respectively;</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> is a perspective view of the third connection strip from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> with the individual connection housings spaced apart prior to assembly, wherein one of the connection housings is an exploded view;</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref> are front and rear perspective views, respectively, of the third connection strip from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> arranged on two printed circuit boards that are perpendicularly aligned;</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>C and <b>6</b>D</figref> are rear perspective views of the connection strip and circuit boards of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B</figref> with one circuit board spaced apart from the connection strip prior to assembly and both printed circuit boards spaced apart, respectively;</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> is a rear perspective view of a fourth connection strip;</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>B and <b>7</b>C</figref> are rear and side perspective views, respectively, of the connection strip from <b>7</b>A during assembly of its contact pins;</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> is a rear perspective view of a fifth connection strip; and</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>B-<b>8</b>D</figref> are rear, top and side perspective views, respectively, of the connection strip from <b>8</b>A during assembly of its contact pins.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a first embodiment of a connection strip <b>1</b> designed as a printed circuit board connector. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>8</b></figref> show variants of such connection strips <b>1</b>, <b>100</b> which are designed or can be used as printed circuit board connectors.
