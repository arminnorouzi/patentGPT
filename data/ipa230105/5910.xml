A first transistor <b>110</b> is disposed in the first dielectric layer <b>120</b>. A second transistor <b>130</b> is disposed in the second dielectric layer <b>140</b>. The first transistor <b>110</b> is connected to the second transistor <b>130</b> by using a connecting wire <b>150</b> disposed in the first dielectric layer <b>120</b> and the second dielectric layer <b>140</b>.

A parasitic capacitance in the first transistor <b>110</b> or the second transistor <b>130</b> is used as a memory element to replace the capacitor in the related art, such that the volume occupied by the memory cells <b>100</b> can be reduced, to ensure that the memory cells <b>100</b> are developed in an integration direction.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">In addition, the first transistor <b>110</b> and the second transistor <b>130</b> are both metal-oxide thin-film transistors, such that the memory can have longer retention time of charge, to improve the performance of the memory while decreasing the volume of the memory.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">It should be noted that the first transistor <b>110</b> and the second transistor <b>130</b> are of the same structure. For ease of description, the first transistor <b>110</b> is used as an example in the following embodiment, and the structure of the first transistor <b>110</b> is described.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the first transistor <b>110</b> includes an active layer <b>111</b>, a gate oxide layer <b>112</b>, and a gate <b>113</b>.

Projection of the gate <b>113</b> on the active layer <b>111</b> covers the channel region, such that there is an overlapping region between the gate <b>113</b> and the active layer <b>111</b>. In this way, when a voltage difference is generated between the active layer <b>111</b> and the gate <b>113</b>, a capacitance is formed between the gate <b>113</b> and the active layer <b>111</b>. The capacitance is used as a memory element of the memory cell, to read or write data.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In addition, in this embodiment, a material of the active layer <b>111</b> may include an indium gallium zinc oxide, which has higher carrier mobility, thereby greatly improving the sensitivity of the first transistor and reducing the power consumption of the memory cell.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">A material of the gate oxide layer <b>112</b> may include silicon oxide and/or aluminum oxide, and the material of the gate <b>113</b> may include one of the group consisting of titanium nitride, tantalum nitride, aluminum and tungsten.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">It should be noted that in this embodiment, the projection of the gate <b>113</b> on the active layer <b>111</b> covers the channel region, which may be understood to be that an area of the projection of the gate <b>113</b> on the active layer <b>111</b> is equal to that of the channel region or that the area of the projection of the gate <b>113</b> on the active layer <b>111</b> is smaller than that of the channel region.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, the first transistor <b>110</b> further includes a protective layer <b>114</b>.

An electrical signal on the source or drain of the second transistor <b>130</b> is used to control the first transistor <b>110</b> to open or close.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">It should be noted that the shape of the connecting wire <b>150</b> may be arbitrary.
