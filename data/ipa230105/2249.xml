Both fluids must then be treated, purified or disposed, for instance by incineration. Examples of such petrochemical processes are the production of phenol and acetone from a feed stream containing benzene and propylene via the cumene hydroperoxide process and the production of propylene oxide using cumene.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">The cumene hydroperoxide process comprises the reaction of benzene and propylene to cumene, before the cumene is converted in the presence of molecular oxygen to cumene hydroperoxide, which is then cleaved, usually using an acid catalyst, into phenol and acetone. The cleavage product contains the products phenol and acetone as well as a couple of by-products and impurities, such as acetophenone, cumene, 2-phenyl-2-propanol and others. Conventionally, the phenol and acetone products are separated from the cleavage product by distillation. Moreover, the unconverted cumene is conventionally recovered from the cleavage product, purified by vacuum distillation and recycled into the process. The other by-products and impurities have to be processed. For instance, in a plant designed to produce 200 kilotons per annum phenol, about 1,000 kg per hour of a heavy waste oil stream containing about 20% by weight of acetophenone and the remainder other impurities and by-products and about 5,000 to 10,000 kg per hour of a wastewater stream, which contains methanol, acetone, phenol, cumene and others, are generated.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another illustrative example of a petrochemical process, during which significant amounts of waste fluids comprising at least one water-based wastewater stream and at least one organic fluid-based waste fluid stream are generated, is the production of propylene oxide using cumene. During this process, cumene is oxidized in air to obtain cumene hydroperoxide, wherein the cumene hydroperoxide is used to epoxidize propylene in the presence of an appropriate epoxidation catalyst to propylene oxide. The cumene is converted during the epoxidation to dimethyl benzyl alcohol, which is hydrogenated with molecular hydrogen so as to recover the cumene. After purification, the recovered cumene is recycled to the cumene oxidation step. During this process significant amounts of organic fluid-based waste fluid streams containing acetophenone, phenol and the remainder other impurities and by-products are generated, as well as wastewater, which contains phenol, other impurities and by-products.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">One option for processing the waste stream(s) is to dispose them for instance by incineration. Such a method is for instance disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,164,087. More specifically, the method disclosed in this document comprises concentrating a water-based wastewater stream, before subjecting it together with another waste fluid stream to incineration. The purpose of concentrating a water-based wastewater stream, before subjecting it together with the other waste fluid stream to incineration, is to reduce the energy required for the incineration by removing some of the water included in the original wastewater stream. However, this process still requires a lot of energy for the incineration.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of this, the object underlying the present disclosure is to provide a process for treating waste fluid generated during a petrochemical process by incineration, wherein the waste fluid comprises at least one water-based wastewater stream and at least one organic fluid-based waste fluid stream, wherein the process exploits as much as possible of the components of the waste fluid but nevertheless requires a minimum amount of energy for the incineration.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with the present disclosure, this object is satisfied by providing a process for treating or purifying waste fluid generated during a petrochemical process, the waste fluid comprising at least one first water-based wastewater stream and at least one second organic fluid-based waste fluid stream, the process comprising:</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">subjecting the at least one first water-based wastewater stream to at least one freeze concentration stage so as to produce a third clean water stream and a fourth concentrated water-based wastewater stream,</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">subjecting the at least one second organic fluid-based waste fluid stream to at least one separation stage so as to produce a fifth purified product stream and a sixth concentrated organic fluid-based waste fluid stream, and</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">forwarding the fourth concentrated water-based wastewater stream and the sixth concentrated organic fluid-based waste fluid stream to an incinerator and incinerating the fourth concentrated water-based wastewater stream and the sixth concentrated organic fluid-based waste fluid stream in the incinerator,</p><p id="p-0013" num="0000">the process being controlled such that incineration of the sixth concentrated organic fluid-based waste fluid stream generates at least 70% of an energy necessary to incinerate the fourth concentrated water-based wastewater stream.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0012">By controlling the process so that the incineration of the sixth concentrated organic fluid-based waste fluid stream generates at least 70% of the energy necessary to incinerate the fourth concentrated water-based wastewater stream, at least the major part of the energy required for the incineration of the fourth concentrated water-based wastewater stream is exploited from the sixth concentrated organic fluid-based waste fluid stream being generated during the process. In other words, the sixth concentrated organic fluid-based waste fluid stream is used as fuel for the incineration, however, only after one or more valuable compounds being included in the second organic fluid-based waste fluid stream have been separated therefrom. Consequently, the valuable part of the second organic fluid-based waste fluid is separated therefrom and may be then used as raw material for a synthesis process or may be recycled within the process or the like, whereas the remaining part of the second organic fluid-based waste fluid is used as fuel for the incineration. Therefore, the amount of energy to be externally supplied into the process can be significantly reduced or even completely avoided. Controlling the process such that at least 70% of the energy necessary to incinerate the fourth concentrated water-based wastewater stream is generated by the sixth concentrated organic fluid-based waste fluid stream may be achieved by controlling or adjusting the process parameters accordingly, as further described in detail below.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0013">In accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure, the at least one second organic fluid-based waste fluid stream is subjected to at least one separation stage so as to produce a fifth purified product stream and a sixth concentrated organic fluid-based waste fluid stream. A purified product stream means in this regard a stream including one or more compound(s) as a major component, wherein the one or more compound(s) may be a product of the petrochemical process, may be a by-product of the petrochemical process and/or may be even an impurity of the petrochemical process. Decisive is only that the one or more compound(s) separated off in the at least one separation stage are of any value, i.e. may be used in the petrochemical process or in any other process as raw material, as catalyst or the like. Preferably, in the at least one separation stage, one compound is separated so that the fifth purified product stream mainly consists of this one compound and possibly minor amounts of impurities.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0014">As set out above, in an embodiment of the present disclosure, the process is controlled such that the incineration of the sixth concentrated organic fluid-based waste fluid stream generates at least 70% of the energy necessary to incinerate the fourth concentrated water-based wastewater stream. This may be in particular achieved by adjusting during the process at least one of: the concentration degree during the at least one freeze concentration stage, the separation degree during the at least one separation stage, and the ratio between the fourth concentrated water-based wastewater stream and the sixth concentrated organic fluid-based waste fluid stream such that the incineration of the sixth concentrated organic fluid-based waste fluid stream generates at least 70% of the energy necessary to incinerate the fourth concentrated water-based wastewater stream. For instance, if more energy is needed for the incineration because the volume of the first water-based wastewater stream is comparably high, i) the concentration degree during the at least one freeze concentration stage may be increased so as to remove more water of this stream so as to reduce the amount of the water to be incinerated, ii) the ratio between the fourth concentrated water-based wastewater stream and the sixth concentrated organic fluid-based waste fluid stream may be decreased so that more of the concentrated organic fluid-based waste fluid stream as fuel based on a given volume of the fourth concentrated water-based wastewater stream is fed into the incineration, and/or iii) the separation degree during the at least one separation stage is decreased so that more of the organic fluid-based waste fluid is present as fuel for the incineration.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0015">Taking into account that the initial concentration of impurities in the first water-based wastewater stream may be higher and/or the final concentration of impurities in the first water-based wastewater stream may be high, it is preferred that at least two and more preferably all of the concentration degree during the at least one freeze concentration stage, the separation degree during the at least one separation stage, and the ratio between the fourth concentrated water-based wastewater stream and the sixth concentrated organic fluid-based waste fluid stream are controlled during the process such that the incineration of the sixth concentrated organic fluid-based waste fluid stream generates at least 70% of the energy necessary to incinerate the fourth concentrated water-based wastewater stream.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0016">In a further embodiment of the present disclosure, the process is controlled such that the incineration of the sixth concentrated organic fluid-based waste fluid stream generates at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, and most preferably at least all, of the energy necessary to incinerate the fourth concentrated water-based wastewater stream.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0017">The present disclosure is not particularly limited concerning the composition of the at least one first water-based wastewater stream. However, it is preferred that the at least one first water-based wastewater stream includes 70 to 99.5% by weight of water and remainder to 100% by weight, i.e. 0.5 to 30% by weight of impurities being dissolved and/or dispersed. in the water. Even more preferably, the at least one first water-based wastewater stream includes 80 to 95% by weight of water and remainder to 100 by weight, i.e. 5 to 20 by weight, of impurities dissolved and/or dispersed in the water.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0018">Also concerning the kind of freeze concentration, the present disclosure is not particularly restricted. However, good results are in particular obtained, when the at least one first water-based wastewater stream is subjected for freeze concentration to at least one suspension crystallization stage or at least one layer crystallization stage. The layer crystallization stage may be a static crystallization stage or a falling film crystallization stage, with a static crystallization stage being preferred. For instance, the at least one first water-based wastewater stream is subjected for freeze concentration to one suspension crystallization stage or to one static crystallization stage. Alternatively, the at least one first water-based wastewater stream is subjected for freeze concentration to two or more suspension crystallization stages. Even more preferably, the at least one first water-based wastewater stream is subjected for freeze concentration to at least one suspension crystallization stage and to at least one static crystallization stage, wherein most preferably the at least one suspension crystallization stage is performed before the static crystallization stage.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0019">In accordance with a first particular preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, the at least one first water-based wastewater stream is subjected for freeze concentration to at least one suspension crystallization stage. Suspension crystallization has the following advantages: only requiring a comparably compact layout, leading to a comparably high purity in only one step or stage, respectively, having a comparably low energy consumption, and having comparably low installation costs. Typically, suspension crystallization is divided into two steps, namely firstly the production of the crystals of the compound to be purified and secondly the separation of the crystals from the remaining mother liquor.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0020">In view of this, it is preferred that the at least one suspension crystallization stage comprises at least one crystallization block for producing water crystals and at least one separation block for separating the crystals produced in the at least one crystallization block from the mother liquor. In one variant, the crystallization block comprises at least one scraped surface crystallizer for removing the crystallization heat and a growth vessel where the produced crystals have time to grow to a separable size, wherein the separation block preferably comprises at least one wash column. In an alternative and in fact preferred variant, the crystallization block comprises a scraped surface crystallizer, but no growth vessel. In this variant, the scraped surface crystallizer combines the function of crystallizer and growth vessel.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0021">In accordance with a particular preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, the wash column comprises</p><p id="p-0024" num="0022">a cylindrical vessel comprising:</p><p id="p-0025" num="0023">a piston with a piston head and a piston rod, the piston being arranged reciprocatingly movable in the cylindrical vessel and bounding above the piston head a wash chamber inside the cylindrical vessel, and the piston head comprising at least one filter,</p><p id="p-0026" num="0024">an inlet for supplying the crystal suspension mixture produced in the crystallization block composed of crystals and mother liquor into the cylindrical vessel,</p><p id="p-0027" num="0025">an outlet for discharging the mother liquor from the cylindrical vessel, and</p><p id="p-0028" num="0026">an outlet for discharging the crystals and/or crystal melt from the cylindrical vessel.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0027">In a further embodiment of the present disclosure, the separation block comprises a circulation conduit for circulating melt arranged outside the cylindrical vessel, i.e., the cylindrical vessel is connected to a circulation conduit for circulating melt arranged outside the cylindrical vessel, which is in communication with the wash chamber and a means for partial melting and disintegration of the crystal bed arranged in the wash chamber for restricting the movement of the crystal bed that has been compacted in the wash chamber by the piston and for directing the wash liquid entering into the cylindrical vessel from the circulation conduit so as to homogeneously distribute it over the entire cross-section of the wash column.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0028">Preferably, the at least one first water-based wastewater stream is subjected for freeze concentration to at least two stages, such as two suspension crystallization stages, in particular if a high concentration of the first water-based wastewater stream shall be obtained. Such a two stage suspension crystallization allows an about 10% higher concentration than a one stage suspension crystallization. Each of the two suspension crystallization stages comprises a crystallizer, wherein both crystallizers may have the same design or a different design. The first suspension crystallization stage comprises, in addition to its crystallizer, a wash column as described above, wherein the slurry obtained in the crystallizer of the first suspension crystallization stage is transported into the wash column, in which the crystals obtained in the crystallizer of the first suspension crystallization stage are separated from the mother liquor. While the crystals and/or crystal melt, respectively, are removed as the third clean water stream, the mother liquor obtained as filtrate of the wash column is transported into the crystallizer of the second suspension crystallization stage, which further comprises a thickener. The slurry obtained in the crystallizer of the second suspension crystallization stage is transported into the thickener. The slurry is compacted in the thickener to a packed crystal bed in the same way as in a wash column, but the crystal bed is not, or at least not completely, washed as it is in a wash column. While the crystal bed obtained in the thickener, after passing the means for disintegration of the crystal bed, is transported into the crystallizer of the first suspension crystallization stage, at least a part of the concentrate obtained as filtrate of the thickener is removed as the fourth concentrated water-based wastewater stream, whereas optionally another part of the concentrate is returned into the crystallizer of the second suspension crystallization stage.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0029">In accordance with a second particular preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, the at least one first water-based wastewater stream is subjected for freeze concentration to at least one layer crystallization stage, which may be at least one falling film crystallization stage or preferably at least one static crystallization stage.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">In accordance with a third particular preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, the at least one first water-based wastewater stream is subjected for freeze concentration to at least one suspension crystallization stage and to at least one layer crystallization stage, which may be at least one falling film crystallization stage or preferably at least one static crystallization stage. More preferably, the at least one first water-based wastewater stream is subjected for freeze concentration to one suspension crystallization stage and subsequently to one layer crystallization stage, wherein the layer crystallization stage is more preferably a static crystallization stage. The advantage of this embodiment is that the teed stream may be concentrated to a very high degree, i.e. that a first water-based wastewater streams may be treated so as to produce a third clean water stream and a fourth highly concentrated water-based wastewater stream, and this even in the case that the first water-based wastewater stream is comparably highly viscous. During suspension crystallization, the viscosity of the slurry exponentially increases with increasing concentration, thus setting an upper limit to the concentration in a suspension crystallization stage. When subjecting the mother liquor obtained in the suspension crystallization stage to a static crystallization stage, the concentration of the obtained fourth concentrated water-based wastewater stream can be further increased.

During the process, also a first water-based wastewater stream <b>8</b>, a second organic fluid-based waste fluid stream <b>10</b> and optionally further waste <b>12</b> is generated. For instance, the main process <b>4</b> is a process for producing cumene hydroperoxide and the raw materials <b>2</b> are benzene and propylene leading to cumene hydroperoxide as main product <b>6</b>. In this case, the first water-based wastewater stream <b>8</b> contains methanol, acetone, phenol, cumene and other compounds, whereas the second organic fluid-based waste fluid stream <b>10</b> contains acetophenone and the further waste <b>12</b> contains other by-products. The further waste <b>12</b> is disposed and/or subjected to a primary treatment in device <b>14</b>. The first water-based wastewater stream <b>8</b> is led into a freeze concentration stage <b>24</b>, in which the first water-based wastewater stream <b>8</b> is separated into a third clean water stream <b>26</b> and a fourth concentrated water-based wastewater stream <b>28</b>.
