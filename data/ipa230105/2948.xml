Top-load or vertical axis washing machines rotate the drum about the vertical axis at various points during the cleaning cycle. Various components provide for adding fluid into the drum and for imparting motion to the fluid and articles being washed in order to clean the articles.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, the washing appliance may include a knob or other switch by which the user selects the level of fluid in the vertical axis washing machine based on e.g., the load size of articles being washed. The user visually determines the desired fluid level based on the anticipated load size. Many washing appliance users are also accustomed to seeing a conventional agitator in the form of a post extending up from the bottom of the wash basket and configured to impart motion to the fluid and articles during the cleaning cycles. Users may associate factors such as fluid level and movement of the agitator as directly related to the effective cleaning of the articles and may believe that increased fluids levels and agitator action are advantageous.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Certain articles may require more wash space within the wash drum. For example, large garments, pillows, comforters and the like may require more volume for washing than typical articles of clothing. Sufficient space is required in order for the washing appliance to be able to impart motion to the articles and wash fluid as part of the cleaning process. Conventional agitator designs having a post that extends into the wash basket necessarily consume at least part of this space. In addition, in such designs the agitator is typically not designed for removal by the user of the appliance.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Improvements in technology and increasing water conservation requirements have resulted in washing appliances that can use less water during the cleaning cycle and may use features other than the conventional post-type agitator for imparting the desired movement of the articles within the wash basket or wash drum. For example, rotatable impellers have been developed that can impart the desired movement while consuming less volume inside the wash drum than the conventional agitator. Some washing appliances utilizing such designs may also be able to use less water during the cleaning cycle as well.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, user perception of washing machine features that provide for the best cleaning experience may contradict the actual impact of such features. As previously mentioned, consumers familiar with a conventional post-type agitator extending vertically from the bottom of the wash drum may be reluctant to purchase or use a vertical-axis washing appliance lacking such feature. Yet, depending on the particular design employed, an impeller located at the bottom of the wash drum may have more impact in creating the desired agitation and cleaning of articles than the conventional agitator&#x2014;including under conditions of less water usage. And for larger loads or loads with larger articles, the space consumed by the conventional post-type agitator is needed for the articles.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, a washing appliance with a removable agitator would be useful. More particularly, a washing appliance that allows the user to readily install or remove an agitator while still providing for effective cleaning of articles would be beneficial. Such as washing appliance that can allow of the installation or removal without requiring special tools would be particularly beneficial.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additional aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be apparent from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one exemplary embodiment, the present invention provides a washing appliance including a cabinet and a wash tub positioned in the cabinet and defining a wash chamber.

In this regard, wash drum <b>122</b> is spaced apart from wash tub <b>118</b> to define a space for wash fluid to escape wash chamber <b>120</b>. During a spin cycle, wash fluid within articles being washed (e.g., clothing) and within wash chamber <b>120</b> is urged through perforations <b>132</b> wherein it may collect in a sump <b>134</b> defined by wash tub <b>118</b>. Washing machine appliance <b>100</b> further includes a pump assembly <b>148</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) that is located beneath wash tub <b>118</b> and wash drum <b>122</b> for gravity assisted flow when draining wash tub <b>118</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">An exemplary article movement mechanism <b>200</b>, including impeller <b>204</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>) and agitator post <b>202</b>, is rotatably mounted within wash drum <b>122</b> to impart motion to articles and liquid in wash drum <b>122</b>. More specifically, impeller <b>204</b> and agitator post <b>202</b> extend into wash drum <b>122</b> and assist agitation of articles disposed within wash drum <b>122</b> (as will be later described) during operation of washing appliance <b>100</b>, e.g., to facilitate improved cleaning. For this exemplary embodiment, agitator post <b>202</b> includes one or more helical vanes <b>210</b> extending from the outer surface <b>212</b> of agitator post <b>202</b> and extending vertically between bottom end <b>216</b> and top end <b>214</b> thereof. Helical vanes <b>210</b> may be configured to assist the agitation of articles or support the overall desired motion thereof during a cleaning cycle. As will be understood by one of skill in the art using teachings disclosed herein, helical vanes <b>210</b> may have different shapes, thickness, and other features from what is depicted in the figures and may actually include multiples sets of overlapping or non-overlapping vanes.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">In different embodiments, impeller <b>204</b> and agitator post <b>202</b> may rotate separately or together. Such rotations include a single action element (i.e., oscillatory only), a double action element (oscillatory movement at one end, single direction rotation at the other end) or a triple action element (oscillatory movement plus single direction rotation at one end, single direction rotation at the other end). Impeller <b>204</b>, agitator post <b>202</b>, and wash drum <b>122</b> are oriented to rotate about a vertical axis of rotation VA (which is substantially parallel to vertical direction V). For example, impeller <b>204</b> and/or agitator post <b>202</b> may rotate back and forth in alternate directions about vertical axis VA during a cleaning cycle. Additional description of the actions of impeller <b>204</b> and agitator post <b>202</b> are set forth below.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">As stated, washing machine appliance <b>100</b> includes a motor assembly <b>128</b> in mechanical communication with wash drum <b>122</b> to selectively rotate wash drum <b>122</b> (e.g., during a wash cycle or a rinse cycle of washing machine appliance <b>100</b>). In addition, motor assembly <b>128</b> may also be in mechanical communication with impeller <b>204</b> and agitator post <b>202</b>. For example, impeller <b>204</b> may be connected with assembly <b>128</b> using a fastener <b>254</b> that attaches impeller <b>204</b> to a shaft <b>252</b> from assembly <b>128</b>. Motor assembly <b>128</b> may be configured for selectively and independently rotating or oscillating wash drum <b>122</b>, impeller <b>204</b>, and/or agitator post <b>202</b> during various operating cycles of washing machine appliance <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>3</b></figref>, a control panel <b>138</b> with at least one input selector <b>140</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>) extends from top panel <b>130</b>. Control panel <b>138</b> and input selector <b>140</b> collectively form a user interface input for operator selection of machine cycles and features of washing appliance <b>100</b>. A display <b>142</b> of control panel <b>138</b> indicates selected features, operation mode, a countdown timer, and/or other items of interest to appliance users regarding operation.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Operation of washing machine appliance <b>100</b> is controlled by at least one controller or processing device <b>146</b> that is operatively coupled to control panel <b>138</b> for user manipulation to select washing machine cycles and features. In response to user manipulation of control panel <b>138</b>, controller <b>146</b> operates the various components of washing machine appliance <b>100</b> to execute selected machine cycles and features. According to an exemplary embodiment, controller <b>146</b> may include a memory and microprocessor, such as a general or special purpose microprocessor operable to execute programming instructions or micro-control code associated with methods described herein. Alternatively, controller <b>146</b> may be constructed without using a microprocessor, e.g., using a combination of discrete analog and/or digital logic circuitry (such as switches, amplifiers, integrators, comparators, flip-flops, AND gates, and the like) to perform control functionality instead of relying upon software. Control panel <b>138</b> and other components of washing machine appliance <b>100</b> may be in communication with controller <b>146</b> via one or more signal lines or shared communication busses.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">During operation of washing machine appliance <b>100</b>, laundry items are loaded into wash drum <b>122</b> through opening <b>126</b>, and washing operation is initiated through operator manipulation of input selector <b>140</b>. Water, detergent and/or other fluid additives can be added to wash tub <b>118</b> and wash drum <b>122</b> through dispenser <b>124</b> and/or other dispensers as well. Controller <b>146</b> can operate one or more valves of washing appliance <b>100</b> to provide for filling wash tub <b>118</b> and wash drum <b>122</b> to the appropriate level for the amount of articles being washed and/or rinsed. By way of example for a wash mode, once wash drum <b>122</b> is properly filled with fluid, the contents of wash drum <b>122</b> can be agitated (e.g., with article movement mechanism <b>200</b> as discussed previously) for washing of laundry items in wash drum <b>122</b>. The specific operation of wash appliance <b>100</b> by controller <b>146</b> will depend on various inputs including the cycle and other settings that may be selected by the user, the amount of article placed in wash chamber <b>120</b>, and other variables as will be understood by one of skill in the art using the teachings disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">By way of continuing example, after wash tub <b>118</b> is filled and the agitation phase of the wash cycle is completed, wash tub <b>118</b> and drum <b>122</b> can be drained, e.g., by drain pump assembly <b>148</b>. Laundry articles can then be rinsed by again adding fluid to wash drum <b>122</b> and tub <b>118</b> again depending on the specifics of the cleaning cycle selected by a user. The impeller <b>204</b> and/or agitator post <b>202</b> may also provide agitation within wash drum <b>122</b>. One or more spin cycles may also be used as part of the cleaning process. In particular, a spin cycle may be applied after the wash cycle and/or after the rinse cycle in order to wring wash fluid from the articles being washed. During a spin cycle, wash drum <b>122</b> is rotated at relatively high speeds to help wring fluid from the laundry articles through perforations <b>132</b>. After articles disposed in wash drum <b>122</b> are cleaned and/or washed, the user can remove the articles from wash drum <b>122</b>, e.g., by reaching into wash drum <b>122</b> through opening <b>126</b>.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">As will now be further described, the exemplary article movement mechanism <b>200</b> allows desired movements to be imparted to articles in wash drum <b>122</b> during a cleaning cycle. These movements, which can include combinations of movement along vertical direction V and radial direction R, assist in cleaning articles while in the wash fluid. One exemplary pattern of movement will now be described. Using the teachings disclosed herein, one of skill in the art will understand that other patterns or paths of fluid and/or article movement in drum <b>122</b> may be used as well in other embodiments of the invention.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, after articles to be cleaned and fluid are loaded into cylindrical wash drum <b>122</b>, rotations of impeller <b>204</b> may impart an inverse toroidal motion to articles in wash drum <b>122</b> during a cleaning cycle. In such motion, articles may move vertically upward from impeller <b>204</b> along agitator post <b>202</b> and then radially outward (the radial direction is indicated by arrow R in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, which is a direction perpendicular to vertical axis VA) at the top of an article load towards the cylindrical portion <b>123</b> of wash drum <b>122</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">The articles then move vertically downward towards impeller <b>204</b> and radially inward along the bottom of an article load towards agitator post <b>202</b> where the cycle repeats under the influence of components such as impeller <b>204</b>. Accordingly, during a cleaning cycle, this inverse toroidal motion results generally in a turnover of articles in wash drum <b>122</b>. As used herein, &#x201c;inverse toroidal motion&#x201d; or &#x201c;inverse toroidal movement&#x201d; does not refer to the specific movement necessarily of any individual article but to the overall movement of articles in wash drum <b>122</b> instead. A variety of factors create the inverse toroidal motion the occurs in wash drum <b>122</b> including, for example, the relative amounts of fluid and articles present in drum <b>122</b>, the shape of wash drum <b>122</b>, the configuration and movements of agitator post <b>202</b>, the configuration and movements of impeller <b>204</b>, and other factors as well.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, for this exemplary embodiment of mechanism <b>200</b>, impeller <b>204</b> includes a plurality of radial lobes <b>206</b> spaced apart along circumferential direction C. Each lobe <b>206</b> has thickness T as measured along the circumferential direction C that varies moving along radial direction R. For the exemplary embodiment shown, thickness T narrows and then widens moving along radial direction R and away from agitator post <b>202</b>. Each lobe <b>206</b> also has a height H above impeller base <b>208</b> along axial direction A that also varies along radial direction R. For the exemplary embodiment shown, height H gradually decreases moving along radial direction R and away from agitator post <b>202</b>. Impeller <b>204</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> is provided by way of example only.

In addition, using features as will also be described, agitator post <b>202</b> can be readily installed or removed by a user of appliance <b>100</b> without the use of special tools. Removal of agitator post <b>202</b> allows more volume within wash drum <b>122</b> for the receipt of articles and/or fluid. At the same time, agitator post <b>202</b> can be readily installed as may be needed for a particular movement of articles in drum <b>122</b> or as may be based on e.g., user preference.

As agitator tabs <b>228</b> move downwardly along vertical direction V within access channels <b>226</b>, tabs <b>228</b> eventually reach grooves <b>222</b>. The user can then rotate agitator post <b>202</b>, which causes agitator tabs <b>228</b> to move from first end <b>262</b> to second end <b>264</b>.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">Upon reaching second end <b>264</b>, the user can release agitator post <b>202</b>, which allows biasing element <b>230</b> to urge agitator post <b>202</b> upwardly. Agitator tabs <b>228</b> will move upwardly along vertical direction V until received into notches <b>224</b>. This secures the position of agitator post <b>202</b> and allows torque from impeller <b>204</b> to be transferred to agitator post <b>202</b>. The user can remove agitator post <b>202</b> by simply reversing the movement just described for installation. Spring <b>230</b> will urge agitator post <b>202</b> upwardly as tabs <b>228</b> move upwardly along access channels <b>226</b> so that agitator post <b>202</b> may be removed from receptacle <b>218</b>. Upon removal of agitator post <b>202</b>, the user can place removable cap <b>242</b> into receptacle <b>218</b> as previously described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>. As such, as with previous embodiments, this embodiment of article movement mechanism <b>200</b> allows also washing appliance <b>100</b> to be used with or without agitator post <b>202</b>. When agitator post <b>202</b> is not present, removable cap <b>242</b> can be used to preclude articles from migrating into recess <b>220</b> while also providing improved aesthetics.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">A different number of tabs, access channels, notches, and grooves may be used from that shown in the figures. Although shown as uniformly spaced along circumferential direction C, different spacings may be used as well. Additionally, the present invention is not limited to the particular shape, size, or configuration of agitator post <b>202</b> or impeller <b>204</b>&#x2014;including lobes <b>206</b> and vane <b>210</b>. While the embodiments shown in the figures would use a clockwise rotation (as viewed downwardly along vertical direction V) to secure agitator post <b>202</b> and a counter-clockwise rotation to release it, the features within receptacle <b>218</b> may be readily rearranged to provide for an opposite operation to secure or release&#x2014;as will be understood by one of skill in the art using the teachings disclosed herein.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">This written description uses examples to disclose the invention, including the best mode, and also to enable any person skilled in the art to practice the invention, including making and using any devices or systems and performing any incorporated methods. The patentable scope of the invention is defined by the claims, and may include other examples that occur to those skilled in the art. Such other examples are intended to be within the scope of the claims if they include structural elements that do not differ from the literal language of the claims, or if they include equivalent structural elements with insubstantial differences from the literal languages of the claims.</p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
