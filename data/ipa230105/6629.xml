Currently, U-NII allocates Wi-Fi channels in the 5 GHz band across four sub-bands: U-NII-1 (5.150 to 5.250 GHz), U-NII-2 (5.250 GHz to 5.725 GHz), U-NII-3 (5.725 GHz to 5.850 GHz), and U-NII-4 (5.850 GHz to 5.925 GHz).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, there have been efforts to include the 6 GHz band for Wi-Fi communications. For instance, it has been proposed to allocate Wi-Fi channels in the 6 GHz U-NII radio band across four sub-bands: U-NII-5 (5.945 to 6.425 GHz), U-NII-6 (6.425 GHz to 6.525 GHz), U-NII-7 (6.525 GHz to 6.875 GHz), and U-NII-8 (6.875 GHz to 7.125 GHz). Such channel allocation in the 6 GHz band would greatly increase the number of available channels for Wi-Fi communications, especially as currently available Wi-Fi bands (e.g., 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz) become increasingly congested from usage by ISPs and wireless local area networks (WLANs). Moreover, such channel allocation in the 6 GHz band brings the possibility of higher aggregated throughput across all Wi-Fi bands.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description of examples of the invention, given by way of example only, which is made with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which:</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example network device <b>100</b> for continuous 5 GHz and 6 GHz operation by selective filtering.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example switching device <b>200</b> for continuous 5 GHz and 6 GHz operation by selective filtering.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example system <b>300</b> for continuous 5 GHz and 6 GHz operation by selective filtering.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an example functionality <b>400</b> of a network device for continuous 5 GHz and 6 GHz operation by selective filtering.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example computer system <b>500</b> in which various embodiments described herein for continuous 5 GHz and 6 GHz operation by selective filtering may be implemented.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">Despite the great potential that the 6 GHz band offers for increasing channel availability and throughput for Wi-Fi communications, Wi-Fi channel allocation in the 6 GHz band may create co-existence issues with existing 5 GHz Wi-Fi channels. For instance, when a network device simultaneously operates both a 5 GHz radio using the 5 GHz U-NII channel allocation and a 6 GHz radio using the proposed U-NII 6 GHz channel allocation, jamming and interference may occur for certain Wi-Fi channels within the 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands. Specifically, when the network device receives a signal in a Wi-Fi channel at or near an upper bound of the 5 GHz band while generating another signal in a Wi-Fi channel at or near a lower bound of the 6 GHz band (or alternatively, when the network device receives a signal in a Wi-Fi channel at or near a lower bound of the 6 GHz band while generating another signal in a Wi-Fi channel at or near an upper bound of the 5 GHz band), the received signal may experience jamming and interference from the generated signal, thereby resulting in de-sensitization (e.g., shorter coverage range) and signal quality degradation (e.g., lower throughput) of the received signal. Moreover, existing RF filtering technologies require a wide transition bandwidth (e.g., 250 MHz or more) between passband filters for 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands to achieve a minimum dB rejection (e.g., at least 50 dB) required to mitigate such jamming and interference. As a result, existing RF filtering techniques do not adequately address 5 GHz and 6 GHz Wi-Fi channel co-existence issues for a network device when a narrow transition bandwidth (e.g., 200 MHz) is required between Wi-Fi channels at or near the bounds of the 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands. In addition, existing RF filtering techniques may limit the combinations of Wi-Fi channels in the 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands that may be used during continuous 5 GHz and 6 GHz operation by a network device.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">To address these issues, examples described herein provide selective filtering for continuous 5 GHz and 6 GHz operation by a network device. Examples described herein may receive, by the network device, a first signal in a 5 GHz band, and generate, by the network device, a second signal in a 6 GHz band. Examples herein may select, by the network device, a first filter or a second filter to be applied the first signal in the 5 GHz band, wherein the first filter allows a lower frequency band to pass than the second filter in the 5 GHz band. Examples herein may select, by the network device, a third filter or a fourth filter to be applied to the second signal in the 6 GHz band, wherein the third filter allows a lower frequency band to pass than the fourth filter in the 6 GHz band. Example herein may simultaneously apply, by the network device, the selected first or second filter to the first signal and the selected third or fourth filter to the second signal.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this manner, examples described herein may provide selective filtering by a network device for continuous 5 GHz and 6 GHz operation. For instance, in such examples, a network device may select a first filter or a second filter to be applied to a first signal in the 5 GHz band, wherein the first filter allows a lower frequency band to pass than the second filter in the 5 GHz, select a third filter or a fourth filter to be applied to a second signal in the 6 GHz band, wherein the third filter allows a lower frequency band to pass than the fourth filter in the 6 GHz band, and simultaneously apply the selected first or second filter to the first signal in the 5 GHz band and the selected third or fourth filter to the second signal in the 6 GHz band. Such selective filtering of the 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands allows a narrow transition gap (e.g., 200 MHz) to be maintained between Wi-Fi channels at or near an upper bound of the 5 GHz band and a lower bound of the 6 GHz band, while still achieving a minimum dB rejection (e.g., at least 50 dB) to mitigate jamming and interference of received signals in such Wi-Fi channels. Accordingly, examples described herein may prevent de-sensitization and degradation of a received 5 GHz signal in the presence of a generated 6 GHz signal (or a received 6 GHz signal in the presence of a generated 5 GHz signal) by a network device across wider frequency band ranges in the 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands, and may allow greater channel availability and higher aggregated throughput for continuous 5 GHz and 6 GHz operation. In addition, examples described herein may allow more combinations of Wi-Fi channels in the 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands to be used during continuous 5 GHz and 6 GHz operation by a network device.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram of an example network device <b>100</b> for continuous 5 GHz and 6 GHz operation by selective filtering.
