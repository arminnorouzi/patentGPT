These reactions involve electrons moving between electrodes via an electronically-conducting phase (typically, but not necessarily, an external electrical circuit), separated by an ionically-conducting and electronically insulating membrane (or ionic species in a solution). When a chemical reaction is effected by a potential difference, as in electrolysis, or if electrical potential results from a chemical reaction as in a battery or fuel cell, it is called an electrochemical reaction. Unlike chemical reactions, in electrochemical reactions electrons (and necessarily resulting ions), are not transferred directly between molecules, but via the aforementioned electronically conducting and ionically conducting circuits, respectively. This phenomenon is what distinguishes an electrochemical reaction from a chemical reaction.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Related to the electrochemical water gas shift (WGS) reactor and methods of use, various components of the reactor are described such as electrodes and membranes along with materials of construction of the components.
