However, conventional antenna modules have problems such as insufficient removal of out-of-band electromagnetic waves, which often causes noise and multiple reflections, resulting in deterioration of transmission performance.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">As described above, the antenna module according to the present disclosure includes a frame body in which a metal film covers at least the outer surface or the inner surface of the frame body. Furthermore, a resin having a higher dielectric constant than air is located in a region surrounded by the frame body such that the first antenna patch conductors are coated with the resin. Therefore, the frame body coated with the metal film functions as a waveguide. The presence of the resin having a higher dielectric constant than air shortens the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves passing through the waveguide and reduces the waveguide height. This provides a compact antenna module that can easily attenuate out-of-band electromagnetic waves and reduce noise generation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The antenna module according to an embodiment of the present disclosure will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>. The antenna module <b>1</b> according to the embodiment includes a control board <b>11</b>, an antenna board <b>12</b>, and a frame body <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The control board <b>11</b> includes a control circuit that functions to control the strength of the electromagnetic waves or the timing of transmission and reception of the electromagnetic waves. Although illustrated in a simplified manner in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>1</b>B</figref>, the control board <b>11</b> has, for example, a build-up structure in which the insulating layer and the wiring conductor layer are alternately stacked.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">The insulating layer may be made of any material having an insulating property. Examples of the material having an insulating property include resins such as an epoxy resin, a bismaleimide-triazine resin, a polyimide resin, and a polyphenylene ether resin. Two or more of these resins may be mixed and used.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">The insulating layer may contain a reinforcing material. Examples of the reinforcing material include insulating fabric materials such as glass fiber, glass non-woven fabric, aramid non-woven fabric, aramid fiber, and polyester fiber. Two or more types of reinforcing materials may be used in combination. In addition, inorganic insulating fillers made of, for example, silica, barium sulfate, talc, clay, glass, calcium carbonate, or titanium oxide may be dispersed in the insulating layer.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">The wiring conductor layer may be made of any material having electrical conductivity. Examples of a material having electrical conductivity include metals such as copper. Specifically, the wiring conductor layer is made of a metal foil such as a copper foil or formed by metal plating such as copper plating. Furthermore, the control board <b>11</b> includes an internal antenna <b>10</b>. Providing the internal antenna <b>10</b> in the control board <b>11</b> can increase the bandwidth of the electromagnetic waves used.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The antenna board <b>12</b> is located on the surface of the control board <b>11</b> and is electrically connected to the control board <b>11</b>. The antenna board <b>12</b> includes an insulating plate <b>13</b>, antenna patch conductors <b>14</b>, a shield through hole <b>15</b>, a filter <b>16</b>&#x2032;, and a signal conductor <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The insulating plate <b>13</b> may be made of any material having an insulating property. Examples of a material having an insulating property include fluororesin, liquid crystal polymer, and other resins mentioned above. The insulating plate <b>13</b> may also contain the reinforcing material described above, or an inorganic insulating filler may be dispersed in the insulating plate <b>13</b>, as necessary.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The antenna patch conductors <b>14</b> are provided to receive electromagnetic waves. When the antenna board <b>12</b> is viewed in a plan view, a plurality of antenna patch conductors <b>14</b> are arranged in a matrix manner. Typically, the antenna patch conductors <b>14</b> are aligned at equal intervals.</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the antenna board <b>12</b>, the antenna patch conductor <b>14</b> is provided at both upper and lower surfaces of the insulating plate <b>13</b> at opposing positions. For convenience, the antenna patch conductor <b>14</b> provided on the upper surface of the insulating plate <b>13</b> is referred to as a &#x201c;first antenna patch conductor&#x201d;, and the antenna patch conductor <b>14</b> provided on the lower surface of the insulating plate <b>13</b> is referred to as a &#x201c;second antenna patch conductor&#x201d; in the present specification. The antenna patch conductor <b>14</b> may be made of any material having an insulating property. Such a material is, for example, a metal such as copper, as in the wiring conductor layer described above.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">When the antenna board <b>12</b> is seen in a plan view, the shield through hole <b>15</b> is located between the antenna patch conductors <b>14</b> that are adjacent to each other. The shield through hole <b>15</b> is a ground through hole which functions to prevent the influence of the electromagnetic waves on the filter circuit as well as the influence of the electromagnetic waves from the filter circuit on the electromagnetic waves for transmission and reception.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The shield through hole <b>15</b> is located along the circumference of the antenna patch conductor <b>14</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>1</b>B</figref>, the shield through hole <b>15</b> is illustrated along only two sides of the antenna patch conductor <b>14</b>. However, in practice, the shield through hole <b>15</b> is also present along the remaining two sides. The shield through hole <b>15</b> is made of a metal such as copper, for example.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>1</b>B</figref>, the signal conductor <b>18</b> electrically connects the wiring conductor layer of the control board <b>11</b> to the internal antenna <b>10</b>. The signal conductor <b>18</b> passes through the filter <b>16</b>&#x2032; between the wiring conductor layer of the control board <b>11</b> and the internal antenna <b>10</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the antenna board <b>12</b>, the filter <b>16</b>&#x2032; is embedded in the antenna board <b>12</b> (insulating plate <b>13</b>) and is sandwiched between the shield through holes <b>15</b> (the antenna patch conductors <b>14</b>). The filter <b>16</b>&#x2032; has a function of separating the electromagnetic waves of the required frequency band from the electromagnetic waves of an &#x2018;unwanted frequency band among the electromagnetic waves received by the antenna patch conductors <b>14</b> or the electromagnetic waves emitted from the antenna patch conductors <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The filter <b>16</b>&#x2019; includes, for example, a high-pass filter (HPF) and a low-pass filter (LPF). By providing the HPF and the LPF, the electromagnetic waves in the high-frequency band and the electromagnetic waves in the low-frequency band can be removed. The filter <b>16</b>&#x2032; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>1</b>B</figref> also includes a bandpass filter (bandpass filter: BPF) in addition to the HPF and the LPF.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">For example, in the antenna module <b>1</b> according to the embodiment, the electromagnetic waves received by the antenna patch conductor <b>14</b> (first antenna patch conductor) are transmitted to the internal antenna <b>10</b> provided in the control board <b>11</b> via the antenna patch conductor <b>14</b> (second antenna patch conductor) provided at a position facing the first antenna patch conductor. Subsequently, the electromagnetic waves having reached the internal antenna <b>10</b> are transmitted through the signal conductor <b>18</b> to the filter <b>16</b>&#x2032;. The electromagnetic waves transmitted to the filter <b>16</b>&#x2032; are divided into the electromagnetic waves of the required frequency band and the electromagnetic waves of the unwanted frequency band. The electromagnetic waves of the required frequency band are transmitted to the control circuit through the signal conductor <b>18</b> provided in the control board <b>11</b>. On the other hand, the electromagnetic waves of the unwanted frequency band are transmitted to the ground layer formed in the control board <b>11</b>, for example, and emitted to the outside of the antenna module <b>1</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The electromagnetic waves transmitted from the control board <b>11</b> are transmitted through the signal conductor <b>18</b> to the filter <b>16</b>&#x2032;. The electromagnetic waves transmitted to the filter <b>16</b>&#x2032; are divided into the electromagnetic waves of the required frequency band and the electromagnetic waves of the unwanted frequency band. The electromagnetic waves of the required frequency band are transmitted through the signal conductor <b>18</b> to the internal antenna <b>10</b> provided in the control board <b>11</b>. On the other hand, the electromagnetic waves of the unwanted frequency band are transmitted to the ground layer formed in the control board <b>11</b>, for example, and emitted to the outside of the antenna module <b>1</b>. Subsequently, the electromagnetic waves transmitted to the internal antenna <b>10</b> are then transmitted to the antenna patch conductor <b>14</b> (first antenna patch conductor) via the antenna patch conductor <b>14</b> (second antenna patch conductor). The electromagnetic waves are, then, emitted externally via the frame body <b>16</b> which functions as a waveguide, which will be described later.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the antenna module <b>1</b> according to the embodiment, the filter <b>16</b>&#x2032; is embedded in the antenna board <b>12</b>. The antenna module <b>1</b>, therefore, does not include another substrate including the filter <b>16</b>&#x2032;. This prevents the multi-layered structure of the antenna module <b>1</b> according to the embodiment, so that the antenna module <b>1</b> has a simple structure which contributes to size reduction of the communication device.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>1</b>B</figref>, the frame body <b>16</b> is disposed on the antenna board <b>12</b> surrounding the antenna patch conductors <b>14</b> (first antenna patch conductors) and separating the antenna patch conductors <b>14</b> from each other. At least the outer surface or the inner surface of the frame body <b>16</b> is coated with a metal film <b>161</b>. This allows the frame body <b>16</b> to function as a waveguide. Thus, it is easier to attenuate the electromagnetic waves of the unwanted frequency band.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, in the antenna module <b>1</b> according to the embodiment, a resin <b>17</b> having a higher dielectric constant than air is located in the region surrounded by the frame body <b>16</b> so as to cover the first antenna patch conductor <b>14</b>. That is, the resin <b>17</b> is located on the antenna board <b>12</b> surrounded by the frame body <b>16</b> and on the first antenna patch conductor <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In order for the frame body <b>16</b> coated with the metal film <b>161</b> to function as a waveguide, the height of the frame body <b>16</b> is set to a length equivalent to one wavelength that the electromagnetic waves applied to the module have in air. That is, the height is set to the length equivalent to one wavelength of the frequency of the electromagnetic waves in the air transmitted through the signal conductor <b>18</b>. At this time, the use of the resin <b>17</b> having a higher dielectric constant than air makes the wavelength of electromagnetic waves passing through the waveguide be shortened as expressed by the equation below. Thus, the height of the frame body <b>16</b> can be shorter than the length of the one wavelength of the electromagnetic waves in the air. As a result, it is possible to decrease the height of the frame body <b>16</b> (waveguide), and this can contribute to the size reduction of the antenna module <b>1</b>. Keeping the height of the frame body <b>16</b>, the height of the metal film <b>161</b>, and the height of the resin <b>17</b> the same is advantageous in that it facilitates reduction of the height of the frame body <b>16</b> (waveguide).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Wavelength (&#x3bb;) of electromagnetic waves in resin=wavelength in air (&#x3bb;0)/&#x221a;(dielectric constant of resin)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0032" num="0030">The resin <b>17</b> having a higher dielectric constant than air may be made of any resin having a higher dielectric constant than air, such as an epoxy resin, a fluorine resin, a polyimide resin, or the like.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0031">The material of the frame body <b>16</b> is not particularly limited. Examples of the material of the frame body <b>16</b> having an insulating property include resins such as an epoxy resin, a bismaleimide-triazine resin, a polyimide resin, a polyphenylene ether resin, a fluorine-based resin, a liquid crystal polymer, or another resin. Two or more of these resins may be mixed and used.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0032">Examples of the metal film <b>161</b> include a film of copper, gold, aluminum, or the like. The metal film <b>161</b> is formed by any method, and the metal film <b>161</b> may be formed by, for example, plating, or by bonding a metal foil. Furthermore, the upper end surface of the frame body <b>16</b> may be coated with the metal film <b>161</b>. In a case where gold is used as the metal film <b>161</b>, the formation of the oxide film can be reduced, which is advantageous for transmission of the electromagnetic waves. As used herein, the outer surface of the frame body <b>16</b> means a surface that does not face the antenna patch conductor <b>14</b>, that is, the outer peripheral surface of the frame body <b>16</b>. The inner surface of the frame body <b>16</b> refers to surfaces facing the antenna patch conductor <b>14</b> surrounded by the frame body <b>16</b>. That is, the inner surface refers to four surfaces surrounding the antenna patch conductor <b>14</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0033">As described above, the antenna module according to the present disclosure includes the frame body <b>16</b> having at least the outer surface or the inner surface coated with the metal film <b>161</b>, as described above. Furthermore, the resin <b>17</b> having a higher dielectric constant than air is located in the region surrounded by the frame body <b>16</b> so as to cover the first antenna patch conductor <b>14</b>. The frame body <b>16</b> coated with the metal film <b>161</b>, therefore, functions as a waveguide, facilitating attenuation of the out-of-band electromagnetic waves and reducing the occurrence of noise. This allows transmission and reception of specific electromagnetic waves preferentially. Since the height of the frame body <b>16</b> (waveguide) can be reduced, the antenna module <b>1</b> can be reduced in size. Furthermore, the presence of the frame body <b>16</b> enables reduction of the warpage and deformation of the antenna module <b>1</b> due to a difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion between the control board <b>11</b> and the antenna board <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0034">The present disclosure is not limited to the antenna module <b>1</b> according to the above-described embodiment, and various modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>1</b>B</figref>, the filter <b>16</b>&#x2032; is built into the antenna board <b>12</b>. However, like an antenna module <b>2</b> according to another embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the filter <b>16</b>&#x2032; may be built into the frame body <b>16</b>. The members described in connection with the antenna module <b>1</b> according to the above-described embodiment are denoted by the same reference numerals in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and detailed description of each member is omitted.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0035">In this case, it is easier to secure the storage area for the filter <b>16</b>&#x2032; in the frame body <b>16</b> than in the case of the antenna board <b>12</b> having many wires. This is advantageous in improving freedom of design and for size reduction of the antenna board <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0036">The resin <b>17</b> having a higher dielectric constant than air may be used alone, or two or more types of resins <b>17</b> having different dielectric constants may be used in combination. When two or more resins <b>17</b> having different dielectric constants are used in combination, for example, the resins are packed in layers as in an antenna module <b>3</b> according to still another embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Specifically, the resins should be packed in layers so that the resin <b>17</b> with a higher dielectric constant is placed closer to the antenna patch conductor <b>14</b> (first antenna patch conductor). The members described in the antenna module <b>1</b> according to the above-described embodiment are denoted by the same reference numerals in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and detailed description of each member is omitted.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0037">To stack the resins in layers, a layer of the resin with the highest dielectric constant of the resins <b>17</b> to be used is formed first in a region surrounded by the frame body <b>16</b>. Next, a layer of the resin having the second highest dielectric constant is formed on the surface of the layer of the resin having the highest dielectric constant. In this way, the layers of resins are formed until the desired number of layers is achieved, so that the layer of resin located at the outermost surface is formed with the resin having the lowest dielectric constant.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0038">The number of layers may be at least two layers, and may be four or more layers. Considering the effect of reducing multiple reflections and the complexity of the manufacturing process, the number of layers should be about 10 to 20 at most. The thickness of each layer is not limited, and all layers may have the same thickness, and at least some layers may have different thicknesses. For example, the layer of the resin <b>17</b> having the highest dielectric constant may be formed to be the thickest. In that case, the thickness of the layer of the resin <b>17</b> having the highest dielectric constant is preferably approximately from 5% to 70% of the total thickness of the resins <b>17</b>. In this manner, multiple reflections can further be reduced by layering two or more types of resins having different dielectric constants in a layered manner.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0039">In the antenna module <b>1</b> according to the above-described embodiment, the internal antenna <b>10</b> is provided in the control board <b>11</b>. Alternatively, the internal antenna <b>10</b> may be provided in the antenna board <b>12</b>. In that case, only the first antenna patch conductor <b>14</b> described above is provided as the antenna patch conductor <b>14</b>, and the internal antenna <b>10</b> is provided in place of the second antenna patch conductor <b>14</b>. This is advantageous in that the structure of the control board <b>11</b> can be simplified.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0040">Furthermore, the antenna module <b>1</b> of the present disclosure may include a metal frame (stiffener) on the lower surface of the control board to reduce the warpage. Examples of the metal frame include a frame made of, for example, copper, Alloy 42, cobalt, stainless steel, or aluminum.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">REFERENCE SIGNS LIST</heading><p id="p-0043" num="0000"><ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0041"><b>1</b> Antenna module</li>    <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0042"><b>10</b> Internal antenna</li>    <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0043"><b>11</b> Control board</li>    <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0044"><b>12</b> Antenna board</li>    <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0045"><b>13</b> Insulating plate</li>    <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0046"><b>14</b> Antenna patch conductor</li>    <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0047"><b>15</b> Shield through hole</li>    <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0048"><b>16</b> Frame body</li>    <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0049"><b>16</b>&#x2032; Filter</li>    <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0050"><b>161</b> Metal film</li>    <li id="ul0002-0011" num="0051"><b>17</b> Resin</li>    <li id="ul0002-0012" num="0052"><b>18</b> Signal conductor</li></ul></p><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="tail"?></description><claims id="claims"><claim id="CLM-00001" num="00001"><claim-text><b>1</b>.
