The carbon nanomaterials have shown outstanding advantages in many fields such as energy, biology, medicine, measurement and manufacturing, and have become the frontiers and hotspots of current scientific communities. Carbon quantum dots are a kind of spherical zero-dimensional carbon nanomaterials with particle sizes less than 10 nanometers (nm). The carbon quantum dots have the advantages of low toxicity, stable fluorescence characteristics and good biocompatibility, so they are widely used in the fields of biological imaging, fluorescent labeling, bio sensors and so on.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">At present, preparation methods of fluorescent carbon quantum dots mainly include a laser method, a microwave synthesis method, an arc discharge method, a chemical vapor deposition method, a hydrothermal/solvothermal method, a liquid plasma method and so on. Equipment required by the laser method is complex and expensive, and the yield is not high, so it is not suitable for large-scale production. The chemical vapor deposition method requires to add catalysts, but the introduction of catalysts makes products easy to contain impurities, and the purity of the product needs to be improved. Growth processes of carbon quantum dots by the microwave synthesis method and the arc discharge method are difficult to control, and the particle sizes are uneven. The hydrothermal/solvothermal method usually needs a long heating time, so that the preparation time is excessively long and the energy consumption is excessively high. The liquid plasma method has advantages of simple operation, rich in raw materials and fast preparation speed, but the liquid discharge is unstable and the discharge process is of great randomness, and the applied discharge voltage is relatively large. Therefore, it is of great significance to reduce the discharge voltage and improve the discharge stability of the liquid phase plasma method/technology.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of shortcomings of the prior art, the disclosure provides a method for preparing fluorescent carbon quantum dots by using gas-liquid two-phase plasma.
