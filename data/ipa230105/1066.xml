More specifically, the present disclosure relates to regulating the flow of blood in extracorporeal circulation.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Usually, the main blood pump in a heart lung machine (HLM) is either a roller pump or a centrifugal pump. Roller pumps are occlusive, such that the speed of a roller pump, which may be measured in revolutions per minute (RPMs), linearly corresponds to the flow rate of the blood. In a roller pump, the relation between speed and blood flow depends only on the cross-sectional area of the pump's tubing segment. Centrifugal pumps are non-occlusive, such that the speed of the centrifugal pump does not linearly correspond to the flow rate of the blood. Instead, the flow rate depends on the resistance in the tubing (e.g., of the oxygenator and filters) and on the patient's systemic resistance. For this reason, a centrifugal pump in an HLM is associated with a flow sensor for measuring the actual flow rate of the blood and an electronic remote clamp (ERC) that is used to clamp the blood flow line (e.g., tubing) and stop the flow of blood whenever needed, such as to prevent blood from flowing in the retrograde or wrong direction.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, a centrifugal pump is operated in one of two control modes that is selectable by manually activating a button or switch. One button activates a flow control mode and the other button activates a speed control mode. Manually switching from one mode to the other can be done at any time during pump operation. Also, the control system of a centrifugal pump contains a control knob for manually increasing or decreasing the flow rate in flow control mode and for manually increasing or decreasing the speed of the pump in speed control mode. In addition, the control system may include an ERC-close button to manually close the ERC, and an ERC-open button to manually open the ERC.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The flow control mode allows the user to set a flow rate that the centrifugal pump maintains by automatically changing the speed of the pump according to changes of hydraulic resistance in the fluid circuit, i.e., increasing the speed if the resistance increases and decreasing the speed if the resistance decreases. The speed control mode allows the user to set a pump speed, such as measured in RPMs, that is kept constant and results in flow rate changes in response to changes in the hydraulic resistance in the fluid circuit, i.e., the flow rate decreases with increasing resistance and increases with decreasing resistance.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Often, in operation, the centrifugal pump is kept in flow control mode to maintain a constant flow rate during extracorporeal circulation of the blood. The HLM includes multiple sensors, such that if a signal from one or more of these sensors is not within a normal range a trigger condition is generated and the system reacts to provide safe operating conditions.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">In response to some trigger conditions, the ERC is closed to stop the flow of blood and the centrifugal pump is slowed to a speed that prevents retrograde blood flow after the trigger condition has been cleared and the ERC opened. Also, after clearing the trigger condition, the HLM is manually switched to speed control mode by pushing the corresponding button, the speed of the centrifugal pump is manually increased by turning the control knob, and the ERC is manually opened by pushing the ERC-open button. After these steps have been taken, the HLM is manually switched back to flow control mode by pushing another button to resume constant flow operations. Thus, operating the HLM requires a user to perform a relatively complicated sequence of steps, which may result in wrong maneuvers and put the patient at risk.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">As recited in examples, Example 1 is a system for regulating blood flow in extracorporeal circulation.

If the controller <b>30</b> detects one or more trigger conditions, the controller <b>30</b>: automatically closes the ERC <b>28</b> to fully occlude the arterial blood flow line <b>46</b><i>b</i>; automatically slows the speed of the centrifugal pump <b>24</b> to a predetermined, calibrated minimum RPM value that is sufficient to avoid retrograde blood flow; and automatically switches from flow control mode to speed control mode for as long as the trigger condition persists.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">After clearing the trigger condition, operation of the system <b>20</b> depends on the type of trigger condition that was cleared. After a blood level trigger condition is cleared, the controller <b>30</b> automatically ramps up the speed of the centrifugal pump <b>24</b> and, after reaching a threshold speed value, the ERC <b>28</b> automatically starts opening. In embodiments, the threshold speed value, which may be an RPM threshold speed value, is predetermined and greater than the above-mentioned minimum RPM value.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">After a flow trigger condition or an air bubble trigger condition is cleared, the speed of the centrifugal pump <b>24</b> is ramped up by manually manipulating, such as by turning, the operational element <b>60</b>, such that after reaching a threshold speed value the ERC <b>28</b> automatically starts opening. In embodiments, the threshold speed value, which may be an RPM threshold speed value, is predetermined and greater than the above-mentioned minimum RPM value. Also, in embodiments, the threshold speed value is the same for the blood level trigger condition, the blood flow trigger condition, and the air bubble trigger condition.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">In each situation, increasing the speed of the centrifugal pump <b>24</b> to be greater than the threshold value, automatically starts the opening of the ERC <b>28</b>. Also, after the ERC <b>28</b> is in the fully open condition, and the controller <b>30</b> automatically switches from the speed control mode to the flow control mode. In embodiments, the controlled blood flow value is the same as the blood flow value provided prior to the trigger condition, such as a blood level trigger condition. In embodiments, the controlled blood flow value is the blood flow value set by the operational element <b>60</b> at the time the ERC <b>28</b> is fully opened, such as after blood flow and air bubble trigger conditions.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus, the only manual action required by the user in operating the centrifugal pump <b>24</b> and the ERC <b>28</b>, is to manipulate, such as by turning, the operational element <b>60</b> to increase or decrease the speed of the centrifugal pump <b>24</b> or the blood flow provided by the centrifugal pump <b>24</b>. System <b>20</b> does not require buttons for choosing between the flow control mode and the speed control mode nor does it require buttons for opening and closing the ERC. This greatly simplifies operation of the system <b>20</b> in comparison to previous systems. In various embodiments, however, the system <b>20</b> does includes buttons for other purposes, including for example, a button to be used only in speed control mode and/or a button to open the ERC to perform retrograde autologous priming (RAP). In various embodiments, such buttons are not visible in the primary display of the touch screen, but rather in subordinate windows of the touch screen.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a flow chart diagram <b>100</b> illustrating operation of the system <b>20</b>, in accordance with embodiments of the subject matter of the disclosure. At <b>102</b>, in operation without trigger conditions, the system <b>20</b> operates in flow control mode. The controller <b>30</b> controls the centrifugal pump <b>24</b> and the ERC <b>28</b> to maintain a constant blood flow rate to the patient <b>40</b>. The controller <b>30</b> acts on the speed of the centrifugal pump <b>24</b> to maintain the constant blood flow rate through the blood flow lines <b>46</b><i>a </i>and <b>46</b><i>b </i>and the controller <b>30</b> keeps the ERC <b>28</b> open.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">At <b>104</b>, one or more trigger conditions occur, including one or more of a blood level trigger condition, a negative blood flow or retrograde blood flow trigger condition, and an air bubble trigger condition. The air bubble trigger condition includes detecting air bubbles in the arterial blood flow line <b>46</b><i>b</i>. The blood level trigger condition includes a low level/volume in the venous reservoir <b>22</b>. The blood flow trigger condition includes negative or retrograde blood flow being measured in the blood flow line <b>46</b><i>b</i>, where the negative or retrograde blood flow can be caused by stopping or almost stopping the centrifugal pump <b>24</b> and/or by a gravity gradient, such as where the patient <b>40</b> is higher than the centrifugal pump <b>24</b>.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In response to the one or more trigger conditions at <b>104</b>, the controller <b>30</b>: at <b>106</b>, automatically closes the ERC <b>28</b> to fully occlude the arterial blood flow line <b>46</b><i>b</i>; at <b>108</b>, automatically reduces or slows the speed of the centrifugal pump <b>24</b> to a minimum RPM value that is sufficient to avoid retrograde blood flow; and, at <b>110</b>, automatically switches from flow control mode to speed control mode for as long as the trigger condition persists.</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">After a period, indicated at <b>112</b>, the trigger condition is cleared or ends at <b>114</b> and the system <b>20</b> further responds to the trigger condition.

At <b>122</b>, if the trigger condition was a blood flow trigger condition or an air bubble trigger condition, the speed of the centrifugal pump <b>24</b> is manually increased by manipulating the operational element <b>60</b>, such as by turning a knob.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">At <b>124</b>, the controller <b>30</b> determines whether the speed of the centrifugal pump <b>24</b> exceeds a pre-set speed threshold value, which may be a pre-set speed threshold value, that is greater than the above minimum RPM value. At <b>126</b>, if the speed of the centrifugal pump <b>24</b> exceeds the pre-set speed threshold value, the controller <b>30</b> automatically begins to open the ERC <b>28</b> from the fully closed position toward the fully open condition.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">At <b>128</b>, after a pre-set time delay, the controller <b>30</b> determines whether the ERC <b>28</b> is fully open and, at <b>130</b>, the controller <b>30</b> automatically switches the system <b>20</b> from speed control mode to flow control mode. In embodiments, where the trigger condition was a blood level trigger condition, the controlled flow rate coincides with the pre-trigger value. In embodiments, where the trigger condition was a blood flow trigger condition or an air bubble trigger condition, the controlled flow rate is established by the manual action on the operational element <b>60</b> at the point in time when the ERC <b>28</b> is fully opened.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">The advantages provided by the system <b>20</b>, including the automated way of handling the centrifugal pump <b>24</b> and the ERC <b>28</b>, is evident in terms of easier and user friendlier operations, as compared to previous systems. The user only acts to set the speed of the centrifugal pump <b>24</b> or the blood flow rate provided by the centrifugal pump <b>24</b>. Fastidious calibrations of the low speed or minimum RPM value of the centrifugal pump <b>24</b> in alarm, manual transitions between speed control mode and flow control mode, and manual openings of the ERC <b>28</b> after an alarm, are no longer required by the user.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flow chart diagram illustrating a method of regulating blood flow in an extracorporeal circulation system, such as system <b>20</b>, in accordance with embodiments of the subject matter of the disclosure.</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">At <b>200</b>, the method includes receiving blood, from a patient, in a blood reservoir and, at <b>202</b>, the method includes pumping the blood from the blood reservoir along a blood flow path through blood flow lines to an oxygenator and back to the patient using a centrifugal pump.
