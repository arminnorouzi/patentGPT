The term &#x201c;contact touch&#x201d; can be referred to herein to denote the scenario in which a pointer makes physical contact with the touch screen. For the position corresponding to the proximity touch of the pointer relative to the touch screen, such position will correspond to a position where the pointer is perpendicular to the touch screen.

The second audio output unit <b>152</b><i>b </i>and the second camera <b>121</b><i>b </i>can be disposed at a rear surface of the body frame of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0112" num="0111">However, the above-described components are not limited to this arrangement. The above-described components can be excluded or replaced as needed, or can be disposed at other surfaces as needed. For example, the first manipulation unit <b>123</b><i>a </i>may not be disposed at the front surface of the terminal body, and the second audio output unit <b>152</b><i>b </i>can be disposed at the side surface of the terminal body rather than the rear surface of the terminal body.</p><p id="p-0113" num="0112">The display unit <b>151</b> can be configured to output information processed in the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. For example, the display unit <b>151</b> can display execution screen information of the application program executed in the mobile terminal <b>100</b> or user interface (UI) and graphical user interface (GUI) information in response to the execution screen information.</p><p id="p-0114" num="0113">The display unit <b>151</b> outputs information processed in the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. The display unit <b>151</b> can be implemented using one or more suitable display devices. Examples of such suitable display devices include a liquid crystal display (LCD), a thin film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD), an organic light emitting diode (OLED), a flexible display, a 3-dimensional (3D) display, an e-ink display, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0115" num="0114">The display unit <b>151</b> can be implemented using two display devices, which can implement the same or different display technology. For instance, a plurality of the display units <b>151</b> can be arranged on one side, either spaced apart from each other, or these devices can be integrated, or these devices can be arranged on different surfaces.</p><p id="p-0116" num="0115">The display unit <b>151</b> can also include a touch sensor which senses a touch input received at the display unit. When a touch is input to the display unit <b>151</b>, the touch sensor can be configured to sense this touch and the controller <b>180</b>, for example, can generate a control command or other signal corresponding to the touch. The content which is input in the touching manner can be a text or numerical value, or a menu item which can be indicated or designated in various modes.</p><p id="p-0117" num="0116">The touch sensor can be configured in a form of a film having a touch pattern, disposed between the window <b>151</b><i>a </i>and a display on a rear surface of the window <b>151</b><i>a</i>, or a metal wire which is patterned directly on the rear surface of the window <b>151</b><i>a</i>. Alternatively, the touch sensor can be integrally formed with the display. For example, the touch sensor can be disposed on a substrate of the display or within the display.</p><p id="p-0118" num="0117">The display unit <b>151</b> can also form a touch screen together with the touch sensor. Here, the touch screen can serve as the user input unit <b>123</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>). Therefore, the touch screen can replace at least some of the functions of the first manipulation unit <b>123</b><i>a. </i></p><p id="p-0119" num="0118">The first audio output module <b>152</b><i>a </i>can be implemented in the form of a speaker to output voice audio, alarm sounds, multimedia audio reproduction, and the like.</p><p id="p-0120" num="0119">The window <b>151</b><i>a </i>of the display unit <b>151</b> will typically include an aperture to permit audio generated by the first audio output module <b>152</b><i>a </i>to pass. One alternative is to allow audio to be released along an assembly gap between the structural bodies (for example, a gap between the window <b>151</b><i>a </i>and the front case <b>101</b>). In this case, a hole independently formed to output audio sounds may not be seen or is otherwise hidden in terms of appearance, thereby further simplifying the appearance and manufacturing of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>.</p><p id="p-0121" num="0120">The optical output module <b>154</b> can be configured to output light for indicating an event generation. Examples of such events include a message reception, a call signal reception, a missed call, an alarm, a schedule notice, an email reception, information reception through an application, and the like. When a user has checked a generated event, the controller can control the optical output unit <b>154</b> to stop the light output.</p><p id="p-0122" num="0121">The first camera <b>121</b><i>a </i>can process image frames such as still or moving images obtained by the image sensor in a capture mode or a video call mode.

The first and second manipulation units <b>123</b><i>a </i>and <b>123</b><i>b </i>can also be commonly referred to as a manipulating portion, and can employ any tactile method that allows the user to perform manipulation such as touch, push, scroll, or the like. The first and second manipulation units <b>123</b><i>a </i>and <b>123</b><i>b </i>can also employ any non-tactile method that allows the user to perform manipulation such as proximity touch, hovering, or the like.</p><p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates the first manipulation unit <b>123</b><i>a </i>as a touch key, but possible alternatives include a mechanical key, a push key, a touch key, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0125" num="0124">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, input received at the first and second manipulation units <b>123</b><i>a </i>and <b>123</b><i>b </i>can be used in various ways. For example, the first manipulation unit <b>123</b><i>a </i>can be used by the user to provide an input to a menu, home key, cancel, search, or the like, and the second manipulation unit <b>123</b><i>b </i>can be used by the user to provide an input to control a volume level being output from the first or second audio output modules <b>152</b><i>a </i>or <b>152</b><i>b</i>, to switch to a touch recognition mode of the display unit <b>151</b>, or the like.</p><p id="p-0126" num="0125">As another example of the user input unit <b>123</b>, a rear input unit can be located on the rear surface of the terminal body. The rear input unit can be manipulated by a user to provide input to the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. The input can be used in a variety of different ways. For example, the rear input unit can be used by the user to provide an input for power on/off, start, end, scroll, control volume level being output from the first or second audio output modules <b>152</b><i>a </i>or <b>152</b><i>b</i>, switch to a touch recognition mode of the display unit <b>151</b>, and the like. The rear input unit can be configured to permit touch input, a push input, or combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0127" num="0126">The rear input unit can be located to overlap the display unit <b>151</b> of the front side in a thickness direction of the terminal body. As one example, the rear input unit can be located on an upper end portion of the rear side of the terminal body such that a user can easily manipulate it using a forefinger when the user grabs the terminal body with one hand.</p><p id="p-0128" num="0127">Alternatively, the rear input unit can be positioned at most any location of the rear side of the terminal body.</p><p id="p-0129" num="0128">Embodiments that include the rear input unit can implement some or all of the functionality of the first manipulation unit <b>123</b><i>a </i>in the rear input unit. As such, in situations where the first manipulation unit <b>123</b><i>a </i>is omitted from the front side, the display unit <b>151</b> can have a larger screen.</p><p id="p-0130" num="0129">As a further alternative, the mobile terminal <b>100</b> can include a finger scan sensor which scans a user's fingerprint. The controller <b>180</b> can then use fingerprint information sensed by the finger scan sensor as part of an authentication procedure. The finger scan sensor can also be installed in the display unit <b>151</b> or implemented in the user input unit <b>123</b>.</p><p id="p-0131" num="0130">The microphone <b>122</b> is shown located at an end of the mobile terminal <b>100</b>, but other locations are possible. If desired, multiple microphones can be implemented, with such an arrangement permitting the receiving of stereo sounds.</p><p id="p-0132" num="0131">The interface unit <b>160</b> can serve as a path allowing the mobile terminal <b>100</b> to interface with external devices. For example, the interface unit <b>160</b> can include one or more of a connection terminal for connecting to another device (for example, an earphone, an external speaker, or the like), a port for near field communication (for example, an Infrared Data Association (IrDA) port, a Bluetooth port, a wireless LAN port, and the like), or a power supply terminal for supplying power to the mobile terminal <b>100</b>. The interface unit <b>160</b> can be implemented in the form of a socket for accommodating an external card, such as Subscriber Identification Module (SIM), User Identity Module (UIM), or a memory card for information storage.</p><p id="p-0133" num="0132">The second camera <b>121</b><i>b </i>is shown as being located at the rear side of the terminal body and includes an image capturing direction that is substantially opposite to the image capturing direction of the first camera unit <b>121</b><i>a</i>. If desired, the second camera <b>121</b><i>a </i>can alternatively be located at other locations, or made to be moveable, in order to have a different image capturing direction from that which is shown.</p><p id="p-0134" num="0133">The second camera <b>121</b><i>b </i>can include a plurality of lenses arranged along at least one line. The plurality of lenses can also be arranged in a matrix configuration. The cameras can be referred to as an &#x201c;array camera.&#x201d; When the second camera <b>121</b><i>b </i>is implemented as an array camera, images can be captured in various manners using the plurality of lenses and images with better qualities.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0134">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, a flash <b>124</b> is shown as being adjacent to the second camera <b>121</b><i>b</i>. When an image of a subject is captured with the camera <b>121</b><i>b</i>, the flash <b>124</b> can illuminate the subject.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0135">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the second audio output module <b>152</b><i>b </i>can be located on the terminal body. The second audio output module <b>152</b><i>b </i>can implement stereophonic sound functions in conjunction with the first audio output module <b>152</b><i>a</i>, and can be also used for implementing a speaker phone mode for call communication.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0136">At least one antenna for wireless communication can be located on the terminal body. The antenna can be installed in the terminal body or formed by the case. For example, an antenna which configures a part of the broadcast receiving module <b>111</b> can be retractable into the terminal body.
