Monsanto commercialized an Rh-based homogeneous catalyst for the carbonylation of methanol to produce acetic acid, under reaction conditions of 180-220&#xb0; C. and 2-4 MPa (Paulik, et al., <i>Chem. Commun., </i>1968, 11, 1578). BP Chemicals developed the Cativa process, which uses an Ru-promoted Ir catalyst and is similar in process operation to the Monsanto process. Although both of these processes require methyl-iodide to participate in each catalytic turnover (Maitlis, P. M.; Haynes, A.; Sunley, G. J.; Howard, M. J., <i>J. Chem. Soc., Dalton Trans., </i>1996, 11, 2187), and are operated in the liquid phase, the Cativa process is reported to exhibit higher catalytic activity at lower water content and produce less byproducts compared to the Monsanto process (Sunley, et al., <i>Catal. Today, </i>2000, 58, 293). However, current methanol carbonylation processes require the separation of catalysts and water, in addition to the use of halides, which increases process costs and environmental concerns (Haynes, A., <i>Top. Organomet. Chem., </i>2006, 18, 179; Ni, et al., <i>Catal. Sci. Technol., </i>2017, 7, 4818).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current attempts to immobilize organometallic complexes on solid supports require the use of halides and water in the catalytic process, which minimizes the potential benefit of the immobilized catalysts (Howard, et al., <i>Catal. Today, </i>1993, 18, 325; Hjortkj&#xe6;r, et al., <i>Appl. Catal., </i>1990, 67, 269; U.S. Pat. No. 2,729,651 to Arnold, et al).</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">There have been reports that halide-free, gas-phase methanol carbonylation to acetic acid can be achieved using zeolites, such as H-mordenite (H-MOR) (Fujimoto, et al., <i>Chem. Lett., </i>1984, 13, 2047). In these systems, methanol adsorbs on Br&#xf8;nsted acid sites to form methoxy groups, which can react directly with gas phase CO to form an acylium cation that can be quenched by H<sub>2</sub>O to produce acetic acid (Stepanov, et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>1995, 117, 3615; Luzgin, et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>1996, 118, 10890). Further promotion of reactivity can be achieved by using Cu-modified H-MOR (Cu-MOR), where CO adsorbed to Cu cations promotes the rate of CO insertion into methoxy species on nearby acid sites through a bifunctional mechanism (Zhou, et al., <i>Solid State Nucl. Magn. Reson., </i>2016, 80, 1).</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, methoxy species on acidic sites can also react with gas phase methanol to produce dimethyl ether (DME) and Cu promotes carbonylation of dimethyl ether to produce methyl acetate (Blasco, et al., <i>Angew. Chem., Int. Ed., </i>2007, 46, 3938). As a result of these alternate reaction pathways, high selectivity to acetic acid requires process operation at high CO to methanol ratios (i.e., &#x3e;50:1 molar ratio), which would necessitate the use of very large recycle streams in industrial processes (Ni, et al., <i>Catal. Sci. Technol., </i>2017, 7, 4818).</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">There remains a need for improved catalysts and methods for carbonylation reactions, such as alcohol carbonylation and/or ester carbonylation, particularly ones that are suitable for industrial scale use.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide improved catalysts for carbonylation reactions, such as alcohol carbonylation and/or ester carbonylation.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is also an object of the present invention to provide reactors for use with improved catalysts for carbonylation reactions, such as alcohol carbonylation and/or ester carbonylation.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is another object of the present invention to provide methods of using catalysts for carbonylation reactions, such as alcohol carbonylation and/or ester carbonylation.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0013" num="0012">Catalysts containing a support and a metal oxide are described herein.

Catalysts</heading><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Catalysts described herein generally include a support and a metal oxide, and are generally suitable for use in heterogeneous reactions, such as catalytic carbonylation reactions, for example, alcohol carbonylation and ester carbonylation. The metal oxide is dispersed on the surface of the support.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">A. Support</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">The support includes suitable support materials, it can be in a variety of suitable forms, and is has a high surface area.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">1. Materials for Support</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">The material for the support is generally chemically inert, i.e. non-acidic and non-basic, and is porous. The material for the support is typically not an acidic material or a material that can become acidic, such as zirconium dioxide. The material for the support is typically not a basic material, such as magnesium oxide. The chemically inert material for the support does not react with any of the reactants and products in the catalytic reaction for which it is selected for use.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">a. Chemically Inert Materials</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">Examples of suitable chemically inert materials for the support include, but are not limited to, silicon dioxide and carbon-based materials.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">A carbon-based material generally refers to a material where the number of carbon atoms are at least 50% of the total number of atoms in the material.

Porosity</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Generally, the material for the support is a mesoporous material or a microporous material. In some embodiments, the material for the support is a mesoporous material and has an average pore diameter from 1 nm to 50 nm. For example, the material for the support is a mesoporous material and the mesoporous material has an average pore diameter of at least 1 nm, at least 2 nm, at least 3 nm, at least 4 nm, up to 50 nm, up to 40 nm, up to 30 nm, up to 10 nm, between 1 nm and 40 nm, between 1 nm and 30 nm, between 1 nm and 20 nm, between 1 nm and 15 nm, between 1 nm and 10 nm, or between 5 nm and 15 nm. For example, the material for the support can be mesoporous silicon dioxide nanoparticles with an average pore diameter between 5 nm and 15 nm, such as SBA-15 (Sigma-Aldrich).</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In other embodiments, the material for the support is a microporous material and has an average pore diameter up to 1 nm, such as from 0.4 nm to 1 nm.

Forms of the Support</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The support can be in a variety of suitable forms, such as a sheet, powder, particles, microparticles, and/or nanoparticles. For example, the support can be in the form of silicon dioxide nanoparticles or silicon microparticles. In some embodiments, the support can be in the form of a carbon sheet (e.g. graphene sheet), carbon powder, carbon particles, or carbon nanoparticles (e.g. carbon nanotubes).</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">When the support is in the form of microparticles, the microparticles can have an average diameter up to 500 &#x3bc;m, up to 400 &#x3bc;m, up to 300 &#x3bc;m, up to 200 &#x3bc;m, up to 150 &#x3bc;m, up to 100 &#x3bc;m, up to 10 &#x3bc;m, or up to 5 &#x3bc;m.

Surface Area</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">The support is generally selected to have a high surface area. When calculating surface area of the support, any surface, including internal surfaces within the pores of the mesoporous material that the reactants are able to contact is typically included. Surface area of the support can be measured by techniques known in the art, for example, by nitrogen physisorption.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">Typically, the support has a surface area of at least 50 m<sup>2</sup>/g, at least 100 m<sup>2</sup>/g, at least 200 m<sup>2</sup>/g, at least 300 m<sup>2</sup>/g, at least 400 m<sup>2</sup>/g, at least 500 m<sup>2</sup>/g, up to 1000 m<sup>2</sup>/g, up to 900 m<sup>2</sup>/g, up to 800 m<sup>2</sup>/g, between 100 m<sup>2</sup>/g and 1000 m<sup>2</sup>/g, between 200 m<sup>2</sup>/g and 1000 m<sup>2</sup>/g, between 300 m<sup>2</sup>/g and 1000 m<sup>2</sup>/g, between 400 m<sup>2</sup>/g and 1000 m<sup>2</sup>/g, or between 500 m<sup>2</sup>/g and 1000 m<sup>2</sup>/g, such as about 700 m<sup>2</sup>/g.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">B. Metal Oxide</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">The metal oxide can contain a single metal or is a mixture of metals. The metal oxide is dispersed on the surface of the support. The metal oxide may be atomically dispersed or form clusters on the surface of the support. The distribution and form of the metal oxide can be determined by any suitable method, for example X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), STEM such as high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM), and UV-vis (Ultraviolet-visible) spectroscopy or spectrophotometry.</p><p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some catalysts, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, or at least 90% of the metal oxide is atomically dispersed on the surface of the support with the remainder of the metal oxide being in the form of clusters, as determined using statistical analysis of metal oxide structures in STEM images. For example, about 90% of the metal oxide is atomically dispersed on the surface of the support, and about 10% of the metal oxide forms clusters on the surface of the support, as determined using statistical analysis of metal oxide structures in STEM images.</p><p id="p-0060" num="0059">1. Metals and/or Mixture of Metals</p><p id="p-0061" num="0060">Typically, the metal or the mixture of metals is/contains a transition metal, such as an acidic early transition metal. For example, the metal oxide can contain a single metal (i.e. MOx), such as rhenium, aluminum, tungsten, or molybdenum. In some embodiments, the metal oxide contains rhenium. The metal oxide can contain a mixture of two or more metals, where at least one of the metals, and optionally both of the metals are rhenium, aluminum, tungsten, or molybdenum.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">Optionally, the metal oxide contains a mixture of metals, where a first metal in the mixture of metals is selected from rhenium, aluminum, tungsten, molybdenum, and a combination thereof, and a second metal in the mixture of metals that is different from the first metal. The second metal in the mixture of metals can be rhodium, iridium, palladium, or a combination thereof. For example, the metal oxide contains a mixture of two metals (i.e. M<sub>2</sub>-M<sub>1</sub>O<sub>x</sub>), where the first metal is rhenium, aluminum, tungsten, or molybdenum and the second metal is rhodium, iridium, or palladium. For example, the metal oxide can contain a mixture of two metals and where the first metal is rhenium (Re) and the second metal is rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), or iridium (Ir).</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Optionally, the catalyst contains more than one metal oxide. Each of the metal oxides may contain a single metal or a mixture of metals. Any metal or mixture of metals described above may be used. Each of two or more metal oxides in the catalyst contains a metal that is different from the other. In some embodiments, at least one of the metal oxides contains a metal or a mixture of metals selected from the group consisting of rhenium, aluminum, tungsten, molybdenum, or a combination thereof. For example, the catalyst may contain three metal oxides, where the first metal oxide contains rhenium, the second metal oxide contains rhodium, and the third metal oxide contains a mixture of rhenium and rhodium.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">2.

The amount of HReO<sub>4 </sub>solution needed to prepare 5%, 10%, or 20% Re weight loading in the ReOx/SBA-15 catalyst was calculated following the above calculation.</p><p id="p-0232" num="0225">The support was chosen based on its high surface area and inertness. For the deposition of ReO<sub>x </sub>species, appropriate amounts of Re precursor were dissolved in 10 mL of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade water (JT4218-3, J. T. Baker) and the desired amounts of TEA with 8 times molar of Re was added into the solution under magnetic stirring for 30 min. The addition of 8:1 molar ratio of TEA is to promote Re dispersion. The Re precursor solution was mixed with the 100 mL SBA-15 support suspension under magnetic stirring with syringe pump under 5 mL/hr injection speed. After mixing for 12 hours at room temperature, the solution was dried at 80&#xb0; C. by rotary evaporator.

In-situ UV-vis spectroscopy measurements of the edge energy (Eg) for the LMCT electronic transition were executed under an oxidative environment, and reaction conditions. Eg provides useful information regarding the electronic structure of the ReOx species, which is sensitive to the ReOx domain size and structure (moving from discrete electronic structure of monomeric species to bands existing in bulk structures). The Eg of ReO<sub>x</sub>/SBA-15 catalysts after dehydration was measured with in situ UV-Vis spectroscopy to determine the domain size of ReO<sub>x </sub>species, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The Eg reflects the electronic structure determined by local environments such as the level of distortion, number of nearest polyhedral neighbors, and bonds between each of those neighbors (Barton, D. G., et al., <i>J. Phys. Chem. B, </i>103(4):630-640 (1999) Lwin, S. et al., <i>ACS Catal., </i>5:1432-1444 (2015)). As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the bandgap energies of KReO<sub>4 </sub>and Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, representing isolated and oligomeric Re oxide species, were 4.1 and 2.8 eV, respectively, demonstrating that the bandgap energy depends on the ReO<sub>x </sub>domain size.</p><p id="p-0249" num="0242">The samples were treated under two conditions: oxidation at 350&#xb0; C. for 1 h (circles in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and oxidation at 350&#xb0; C. for 1 h and then reduction at 250&#xb0; C. for 1 h which is similar with reaction conditions (squares in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The reaction was at 250&#xb0; C. Under both conditions, the Ep shows a similar trends. The bandgap energy of ReO<sub>x</sub>/SBA-15 with Re weight loading of 1% and 5% was 4.45 eV, demonstrating that under these weight loadings, ReO<sub>x </sub>resided as isolated species on SBA-15. When the Re weight loading of the ReO<sub>x</sub>/SBA-15 catalyst is 10%, the sample showed a lower bandgap energy at 4.3 eV, which demonstrates that ReO<sub>x </sub>is mainly isolated dispersed, but there is some Re cluster formation. The bandgap energy of ReO<sub>x</sub>/SBA-15 where the Re weight loading is 20% was below 4.1 eV, demonstrating that at this weight loading, ReO<sub>x </sub>structure is mainly in a cluster. A comparison of the Eg values to those of control samples, dispersed (KReO<sub>4</sub>, Eg=4.1 eV) species, and bulk (Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, Eg=2.8 eV) ReOx species, shows that at lower Re weight loadings (1, 5, and 10 wt %), ReOx exists predominantly in the form of atomically dispersed species, while ReOx clusters are present at higher Re weight loadings and their size increases with increasing Re loading. The similar Eg following calcination and reaction conditions shows that ReOx domains remain stable under reaction conditions. This is in contrast to a previous report in which ReOx on SiO<sub>2 </sub>was unstable after 2 h during 2-butanol dehydration (She, et al., <i>ACS Catal., </i>2012, 2 (6), 1020-1026), demonstrating that the use of TEA during synthesis promotes the stability of a highly dispersed ReOx species on SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="p-0250" num="0243">The ReO<sub>x </sub>structures at different weight loading are also supported by HAADF-STEM images of the calcined (450&#xb0; C., dry air) samples. In HAADF-STEM, the higher atomic number of Re as compared to Si allows identification of Re domains via increased scattering of the electron beam. While atomically dispersed ReOx species were primarily observed for the 5 wt % Re sample, an increase in the density and existence of ReOx clusters was observed with increasing Re loading to 10 and 20 wt %. The fraction of ReOx clusters in each sample is likely an over estimation of the as-prepared state due to the electron beam induced coalescense during image acquisition (Mishra, et al., <i>MRS Bull., </i>2017, 42 (9), 644-652). Previous analysis of WOx species on ZrOx noted that analysis by STEM imaging showed higher concentrations of WOx clusters than atomically dispersed species as compared to correlated spectrscopic measurements (Zhou, et al., <i>Nat. Chem., </i>2009, 1 (9), 722-728). Accordingly, the STEM results show that ReO<sub>x </sub>of 5% Re weight loading was isolated dispersed on SBA-15 (data not shown). For the ReO<sub>x</sub>/SBA-15 catalyst where the Re weight loading is 10%, some ReO<sub>x </sub>clusters form, and for the ReO<sub>x</sub>/SBA-15 catalyst where the Re weight loading is 20%, mainly ReO<sub>x </sub>clusters were present.</p><p id="p-0251" num="0244">XAS was used to further characterize the oxidation state and structure of ReOx species on the support. ReOx/SBA-15 samples of various Re weight loadings showed nearly identical XANES spectra following oxidation (data not shown), with edge energies correlating to Re in +7 oxidation state, which was also confirmed by XPS (data not shown). EXAFS spectra were fit with a proposed ReO<sub>4 </sub>model that is consistent with the Re +7 oxidation state observed from XANES, in which Re makes a single bond to the support via oxygen (Re&#x2014;O 1.77&#xb1;0.04 &#x212b;), and is coordinated to three additional Re&#x2550;O double bonds (Re&#x2014;O 1.69&#xb1;0.01 &#x212b;). The fit yielded a good match to the measured EXAFS spectrum for the 5 wt % Re sample (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). The EXAFS data and fit (data not shown) are also in agreement with previously reported structures of atomically dispersed ReO<sub>4 </sub>(Vicente, et al., <i>J. Phys. Chem. C, </i>2011, 115 (18), 9012-9024; Bare, et al., <i>J. Phys. Chem. C, </i>2011, 115 (13), 5740-5755). Notably, the EXAFS data for the 5, 10, and 20 wt % Re samples did not vary considerably (data not shown), showing that this sample averaged technique may not be able to unambiguously identify small, subnanometer ReOx clusters within a sample containing atomically dispersed ReO<sub>4 </sub>species (Resasco, et al., <i>J. Am. Chem. Soc., </i>2020, 142 (1), 169-184). This is not unsuspected, as even bulk crystalline oligomeric Re species (Re<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) show Re&#x2014;O&#x2014;Re scattering at long bond lengths (data not shown), which is thus more sensitive to destructive interference from competing multiple scattering paths. Therefore, EXAFS likely, in contrast to STEM, underestimates the existence of ReOx clusters present.</p><p id="p-0252" num="0245">On the basis of a combination of STEM, UV-vis and XAS, it was concluded that ReOx was primarily atomically dispersed as ReO<sub>4 </sub>species for 1 and 5 wt % Re, a mix of atomically dispersed ReO<sub>4 </sub>and small ReOx clusters for 10 wt % Re, and primarily in the form of ReOx clusters for 20 wt % Re.</p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 2.

Also, the combination of two surface methoxy groups pathway shows lower energy barrier than gas phase attacking surface methoxy groups pathway. Therefore, increasing the Re loading to 20 wt % resulted in a 30-fold increase in the DME production rate at 280&#xb0; C., while the AA production rate decreased by 5-fold compared to that of the 1 and 5 wt % ReOx/SBA-15.

Two strong bands centered at 2091 and 2030 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>were observed for 0.2 wt % Rh/SiO<sub>2</sub>, which are assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric stretches of the Rh(CO)<sub>2 </sub>gem-dicarbonyl species, demonstrating the predominant existence of atomically dispersed Rh species (Yates, et al., <i>J.

Another CO stretch at 2107 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>was observed, which was assigned to an atomically dispersed Rh species that is simultaneously coordinated to CO and an additional O (Rice, et al., <i>J.

A blue-shift of &#x2dc;6 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>in the CO stretch frequency for Rh(CO)<sub>2 </sub>species was observed comparing Rh/ReOx-SiO<sub>2 </sub>and Rh/SiO<sub>2</sub>. The CO stretch frequency in Rh(CO)<sub>2 </sub>depends on the supports ability to withdraw or donate charge to Rh. Thus, the blue shift is evidence that Lewis acidic ReOx species reduced the charge transfer to CO species bound to Rh (Lwin, et al., <i>ACS Catal., </i>2015, 5 (3), 1432-1444; Ro, et al., <i>ACS Catal., </i>2019, 9, 10899-10912; Hoffman, et al., <i>ACS Catal., </i>2018, 8 (4), 3489-3498).

Oxidative addition of methyl iodide to metal produced methyl-metal species, followed by the rapid insertion of carbon to yield an acyl-metal species (Schrod and Luff, <i>Ind. Eng. Chem. Prod. Res.

The combination of these ReOx/SBA-15 catalysts with Rh or other metals allows further improvements in AA production rates and selectivity.
