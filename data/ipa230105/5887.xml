In the OLED, lifespan is shorter, the production yield is not sufficient, and the efficiency is low.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">On the other hand, when a semiconductor light emitting diode (micro LED (uLED)) having a diameter or cross-sectional area of 100 microns or less is used for a display, very high efficiency can be achieved because the display does not absorb light using a polarizing plate or the like. However, since a large display requires millions of semiconductor light emitting diodes, it is difficult to transfer the diodes compared to other technologies.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The technologies currently being developed for a transfer process may include pick &#x26; place technology, Laser Lift-off</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">(LLO) technology, self-assembly technology or the like.

Accordingly, a longer time is required to supply the semiconductor light emitting diodes, and there is a limitation in uniformly supplying the semiconductor light emitting didoes for each assembly line. In addition, as the semiconductor light emitting devices are excessively supplied (in amount or height), some semiconductor light emitting diodes may be damaged.
