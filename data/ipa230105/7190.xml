The image sensor <b>10</b> includes a filter array <b>11</b>, a pixel array <b>12</b>, and a processing circuit <b>13</b>. The filter array <b>11</b> includes a plurality of filter regions <b>111</b> each including a plurality of filter units <b>1111</b>. Each filter unit <b>1111</b> includes at least one first color filter A, at least one second color filter B, and at least one third color filter C. The pixel array <b>12</b> includes a plurality of pixels <b>120</b> each corresponding to one filter <b>110</b> in the filter array <b>11</b> and configured to receive light passing through the corresponding filter <b>110</b> to generate an electrical signal. The processing circuit <b>13</b> is provided on a substrate <b>14</b> having the pixel array <b>12</b> and configured to combine the electrical signals generated by the pixels <b>120</b> corresponding to each filter unit <b>1111</b> for outputting as a combined luminance value and forming a first intermediate image. The combined luminance value represents luminance of light applied to the pixels <b>120</b> corresponding to the filter unit <b>1111</b>. The processing circuit <b>13</b> is further configured to generate a first color signal, a second color signal, and a third color signal based on the electrical signals generated by the pixels <b>120</b> corresponding to each filter region <b>111</b>. The first color signal represents a value in a first color channel of light applied to the pixels <b>120</b> corresponding to the filter region <b>111</b>, the second color signal represents a value in a second color channel of the light applied to the pixels <b>120</b> corresponding to the filter region <b>111</b>, and the third color signal represents a value in a third color channel of the light applied to the pixels <b>120</b> corresponding to the filter region <b>111</b>. The processing circuit <b>13</b> is further configured to process the first color signal, the second color signal, and the third color signal to obtain a plurality of second intermediate images representing chrominance values of the filter region <b>111</b>, and fuse the first intermediate image and the plurality of second intermediate images to obtain a first target image.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the image sensor <b>10</b> according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, since the combined luminance value is a combined output of the electrical signals from all the pixels <b>120</b> corresponding to each filter unit <b>1111</b>, the combined output of the electrical signals from the pixels <b>120</b> is equivalent to increasing the photosensitive area of the pixels, such that the photosensitive capability of the pixels can be improved. Therefore, the obtained combined luminance value is more accurate, and the first target image formed by using the combined luminance value is also more accurate. In addition, since the color signals (the first color signal, the second color signal, and the third color signal) are generated by the pixels <b>120</b> corresponding to the filter region <b>111</b>, the color signals in the present disclosure are also more accurate than color signals generated by one single pixel <b>120</b> (especially in a low-luminance environment),</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> again, the number of filter units <b>1111</b> in each filter region <b>111</b> may be M*M, where M is an integer greater than or equal to 2. For example, the value of M may be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, etc., and the present disclosure is not limited to any of these examples. When M is relatively large, the first color signal, the second color signal, and the third color signal corresponding to the filter region <b>111</b> will be more accurate. When M is relatively small, the image that can be acquired by the filter array <b>11</b> of a same size will have a higher resolution. The number of filters <b>110</b> in each filter unit <b>1111</b> may be N*N, where N is an integer greater than or equal to 2. For example, the value of N may be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, etc., and the present disclosure is not limited to any of these examples. When N is relatively large, the combined luminance value corresponding to the filter unit <b>1111</b> will be higher. When N is relatively small, the image that can be acquired by the filter array <b>11</b> of a same size will have a higher resolution. M and N may be the same or different. For example, the number of filter units <b>1111</b> in each filter region <b>111</b> may be 2*2, and the number of filters <b>110</b> in each filter unit <b>1111</b> may be 2*2. In this case, the first color signal, the second color signal, the third color signal, and the combined luminance value are all relatively accurate, and the resolution of the image is relatively high. Of course, the number of filter units <b>1111</b> in each filter region <b>111</b> may be 3*3, or 4*4, etc., and the number of filters <b>110</b> in each filter unit <b>1111</b> may be 3*3 or 4*4, etc.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the image sensor <b>10</b> according to the embodiment of the present disclosure, the plurality of filter units <b>1111</b> may have a same ratio between the number of first color filters A, the number of second color filters B, and the number of the third color filters C in each filter unit <b>1111</b>. For example, the ratio between the number of first color filters A, the number of second color filters B, and the number of third color filters C in each filter unit <b>1111</b> may be 2:1:1. In another example, the ratio between the number of the first color filter A, the number of the second color filter B, and the number of the third color filter C in each filter unit <b>1111</b> may be 5:2:2.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the embodiment of the present disclosure, each first color filter A may be a green filter G, each second color filter B may be a red filter R, and each third color filter C may be a blue filter Bu. In the example where the ratio between the number of first color filters A, the number of second color filters B, and the number of third color filters C in each filter unit <b>1111</b> is 2:1:1, the ratio between the number of green filters G, the number of red filters R, and the number of blue filters Bu in each filter unit <b>1111</b> is 2:1:1. That is, the combined luminance value is R+2G+B, which is similar to the calculation of the luminance signal (y=0.299R+0.586G+0.114B), the combined luminance value obtained in this case is more accurate.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the filter array <b>11</b> may include a plurality of first sets of filters <b>1131</b> and a plurality of second sets of filters <b>1132</b>. Each of the plurality of first sets of filters <b>1131</b> may include a plurality of first color filters A and a plurality of second color filters B, and a number of first color filters A and a number of second color filters B are same in each of the plurality of first sets of filters <b>1131</b>. Each of the plurality of second sets of filters <b>1132</b> may include a plurality of first color filters A and a plurality of third color filters C, and a number of first color filters A and a number of third color filters C are same in each of the plurality of second sets of filters <b>1132</b>. A sub-array formed by arrangement of all the first sets of filters <b>1131</b> and all the second sets of filters <b>1132</b> is a part of the filter array <b>11</b>, or a sub-array formed by arrangement of all the filter regions <b>111</b> is a part of the filter array <b>11</b>. In a low-luminance mode, the image sensor <b>10</b> may be configured to obtain the first target image. In a clear texture mode, the processing circuit <b>13</b> may be configured to combine the electrical signals generated by the pixels <b>120</b> corresponding to each of the plurality of first sets of filters <b>1131</b> to generate a first pixel signal and a third pixel signal. The first pixel signal represents a value in the first color channel of light applied to the pixels <b>120</b> corresponding to the first set of filters <b>1131</b>, and the third pixel signal represents a value in the second color channel of the light applied to the pixels <b>120</b> corresponding to the first set of filters <b>1131</b>. The processing circuit <b>13</b> may be further configured to combine the electrical signals generated by the pixels <b>120</b> corresponding to each of the plurality of second sets of filters <b>1132</b> to generate a second pixel signal and a fourth pixel signal. The second pixel signal represents a value in the first color channel of the light applied to the pixels <b>120</b> corresponding to the second set of filters <b>1132</b>, and the fourth pixel signal represents a value in a third color channel of light applied to the pixels <b>120</b> corresponding to the second set of filters <b>1132</b>. The processing circuit <b>13</b> may be further configured to obtain a second target image based on the first pixel signal, the second pixel signal, the third pixel signal, and the fourth pixel signal.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, if the filter array <b>11</b> is manufactured in units of filter regions <b>111</b>, all the first sets of filters <b>1131</b> and all the second sets of filters <b>1132</b> are arranged to form a sub-array which is a part of the filter array <b>11</b>. When acquiring the first target image, the electrical signals generated by all the pixels <b>120</b> are read. When acquiring the second target image, the electrical signals generated by the pixels <b>120</b> in the first row and/or the first column are not read. Taking the filter array <b>11</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> as an example, when acquiring the second target image, the electrical signals generated by the pixels <b>120</b> in the first row and the last row are not read, or the electrical signals generated by the pixels <b>120</b> in the first and last columns are not read.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, in the example where the ratio between the number of first color filters A, the number of second color filters B, and the number of third color filters C in each filter unit <b>1111</b> is 2:1:1, one first color filter A and one second color filter B in one filter unit <b>1111</b> and one first color filter A and one first color filter B in another filter unit <b>1111</b> are combined into a first set of filters <b>1131</b>. One first color filter A and one third color filter C in one filter unit <b>1111</b> and one first color filter A and one third color filter C in another filter unit <b>1111</b> are combined into a second set of filters <b>1132</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, if the filter array <b>11</b> is manufactured in units of first sets of filters <b>1131</b> and second sets of filters <b>1132</b>, all the filter regions <b>111</b> are arranged to form a sub-array which is a part of the filter array <b>11</b>. When acquiring the first target image, the electrical signals generated by the pixels <b>120</b> in the first row and/or the first column are not read.

Taking the filter array <b>11</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> as an example, when acquiring the first target image, the electrical signals generated by the pixels <b>120</b> in the first row and the last three rows are not read, or the electrical signals generated by the pixels <b>120</b> in the first column and the last three columns are not read.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an embodiment of the present disclosure, the user can switch the mode by selecting his/her desired mode. For example, the display interface may display the low-luminance mode and the clear texture mode. When the user selects the low-luminance mode, the first target image is outputted, or when the user selects the clear texture mode, the second target image is outputted. In this way, the switching between the low-luminance mode and the clear texture mode can be achieved respectively with the same filter array <b>11</b>. In the low-luminance mode, since the combined luminance value is outputted by combining the electrical signals of all the pixels <b>120</b> corresponding to each filter unit <b>1111</b>, and the color signal is generated by the pixels <b>120</b> corresponding to the filter region <b>111</b>, the low-luminance mode can still be used to acquire images accurately and effectively in a low-luminance environment. That is, the low-luminance mode can be applied in the low-luminance environment. In the clear texture mode, since both the first set of filters <b>1131</b> and the second set of filters <b>1132</b> have the first color filter A, both the pixels <b>120</b> corresponding to the first set of filters <b>1131</b> and the pixels <b>120</b> corresponding to the second set of filters <b>1132</b> are capable of generating pixel signals having values in the first color channel. Therefore, in the process of generating the second target image, no interpolation is needed for the values in the first color channel, and the color reproduction of the color image can be more accurate.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the image sensor <b>10</b> according to the embodiment of the present disclosure includes a microlens array <b>15</b>, a filter array <b>11</b>, and a pixel array <b>12</b>.

The image sensor <b>10</b> can combine the electrical signals generated by the two pixels <b>120</b> that receive the light passing through the first color filters A to obtain the first pixel signal, and combine the electrical signals generated by the two pixels <b>120</b> that receive the light passing through the second color filters B to obtain the third pixel signal.

Therefore, a combined pixel that cannot output the third pixel signal needs to be subjected to an interpolation process to calculate a value in the second color channel of the combined pixel, and a combined pixel that cannot output the fourth pixel signal also needs to be subjected to the interpolation process to calculate a value in the third color channel of the combined pixel. In this way, each combined pixel can obtain the values in the first color channel, the second color channel, and the third color channel, and a color image can be generated by means of color space calculation.</p><p id="p-0167" num="0140">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, in the existing filter array arranged in a Bayer array, a pixel corresponding to each filter can only generate a pixel signal having the value in one color channel. For example, the pixel corresponding to the pixel signal in the first row and first column from the left only has a value in the second color channel, and a value in the first color channel and a value in the third color channel of the pixel need to be obtained by interpolation; The pixel corresponding to the pixel signal in the first row and the second column only has a value in the first color channel, and a value in the second color channel and a value in the third color channel of the pixel need to be obtained by interpolation. The pixel corresponding to the pixel signal in the second row and the second column from the left only has a value in the third color channel, and a value in the first color channel and a value in the second color channel of the pixel need to be obtained by interpolation. In this way, the values in the other color channels of the pixel corresponding to each pixel signal need to be obtained by interpolation. However, an accuracy of the pixel signals obtained by interpolation is not high enough, which will cause a color reproduction of a final resulting color image to be inaccurate. In addition, in the existing filter array arranged in a Bayer array, when the pixel signal having a value in the first color channel is generated by interpolation and the pixel signal having a value in the second color channel is generated by interpolation, most of the pixel signals generated by interpolation can only be calculated using two pixel signals. For example, in the image signal in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> that only contains pixel signals having values in the second color channel, the pixel corresponding to the pixel signal in the second row and the third column from the left does not have a value in the second color channel, and the value in the second color channel of the pixel needs to be obtained from the pixel signals of the pixels adjacent to the pixel and having a value in the second color channel, i.e., based on the pixel signal having a value in the second color channel in the first row and the third column and the pixel signal having a value in the second color channel in the third row and the third column. In another example, in the image signal in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> that only contains the pixel signals having values in the third color channel, the pixel signal in the third row and the second column from the left does not have a value in the third color channel, and the value in the third color channel of the pixel corresponding to the pixel signal needs to be obtained from the pixel signals of the pixels adjacent to the pixel and having a value in the third color channel, i.e., based on the pixel signal having a value in the third color channel in the second row and the second column and the pixel signal having a value in the third color channel in the fourth row and the second column. In this way, the number of the pixel signals usable for generating the pixel signal by interpolation is relatively small, and the accuracy of the pixel signal generated by interpolation is not high enough.</p><p id="p-0168" num="0141">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, in the image sensor <b>10</b> according to the embodiments of the present disclosure, compared with a resolution of the pixel array <b>12</b> composed of the pixels <b>120</b>, the resolution of the image composed of the pixel signals corresponding to the combined pixels is reduced. However, as each combined pixel has a pixel signal having a value in the first color channel, the value in the first color channel does not need to be obtained by interpolation, and the color reproduction of the final resulting color image will be more accurate. Since each combined pixel of the pixel array <b>12</b> directly obtains the corresponding pixel signal of the first color channel, more information can be obtained in the subsequent signal processing procedure.</p><p id="p-0169" num="0142">In addition, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, in the image sensor <b>10</b> according to the embodiments of the present disclosure, when the interpolation process is performed on a combined pixel that cannot output the third pixel signal, for most of the combined pixels, the value in the second color channel of the combined pixel can be calculated from four third pixel signals with each having a value in the second color channel. For example, in the second image signal M2 formed by a plurality of third pixel signals illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the third pixel signal in the second row and the third column from the left may be calculated from the third pixel signal in the first row and the third column from the left, the third pixel signal in the second row and the second column from the left, the third pixel signal in the second row and the fourth column from the left, and the third pixel signal in the third row and the third column from the left. In the image sensor <b>10</b> according to the embodiments of the present disclosure, when the interpolation process is performed on a combined pixel that cannot output the fourth pixel signal, for most of the combined pixels, the value in the third color channel of the combined pixel can be calculated from four fourth pixel signals each having a value in the third color channel. For example, in the third image signal M3 formed by a plurality of fourth pixel signals illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the fourth pixel signal in the third row and the third column from the left may be calculated from the fourth pixel signal in the second row and the third column from the left, the fourth pixel signal in the third row and the second column from the left, the fourth pixel signal in the third row and the fourth column from the left, and the fourth pixel signal in the fourth row and the third column from the left.

Moreover, when performing the interpolation process on values in the second color channel (or values in the third color channel), most of the values in the second color channel to be generated by interpolation (or the values in the third color channel to be generated by interpolation) can be calculated from four adjacent pixel signals each having a value in the second color channel (or four adjacent pixels each having a value in the third color channel), such that the pixel signal having a value in the second color channel (or the third color channel) generated by interpolation can be more accurate, thereby further improving the accuracy of the color reproduction of the color image.</p><p id="p-0171" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> are schematic diagrams each illustrating an arrangement of some filters <b>110</b> in the filter array <b>11</b> according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

The image memory <b>930</b> may be a part of a memory device, a storage device, or an independent dedicated memory in an electronic device, and may include Direct Memory Access (DMA) features.</p><p id="p-0238" num="0205">Upon receiving the raw image data from an interface of the image sensor <b>914</b>, the interface of the sensor <b>920</b>, or the image memory <b>930</b>, the ISP processor <b>940</b> can perform one or more image processing operations, such as time-domain filtering, or as another example, process the first pixel signal, the second pixel signal, the third pixel signal, the fourth pixel signal to obtain a color image, etc. The processed image data (for example, the color image) can be transmitted to the image memory <b>930</b> for further processing before being displayed. The ISP processor <b>940</b> can receive the processed data from the image memory <b>930</b>, and perform image data processing on the processed data in an original domain and in RGB and YCbCr color spaces. The image data processed by the ISP processor <b>940</b> may be outputted to the display <b>970</b> for viewing by the user and/or further processing by a graphics engine or a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). In addition, the output of the ISP processor <b>940</b> can also be transmitted to the image memory <b>930</b>, and the display <b>970</b> can read the image data from the image memory <b>930</b>. In one embodiment, the image memory <b>930</b> can be configured to implement one or more frame buffers. In addition, the output of the ISP processor <b>940</b> can be transmitted to an encoder/decoder <b>960</b> for encoding/decoding the image data. The encoded image data can be saved and decompressed before being displayed on the display device <b>970</b>. The encoder/decoder <b>960</b> may be implemented by a CPU or GPU or a co-processor. For example, when the computer device is in a preview mode or a video recording mode, the ISP processor <b>940</b> can process an image signal including a plurality of image signal units U (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>) to generate image data of a color image. The ISP processor <b>940</b> can transmit the color image to the encoder/decoder <b>960</b> for encoding the color image. The encoded color image can be saved in the image memory <b>930</b> and can also be displayed on the display <b>970</b>.</p><p id="p-0239" num="0206">The statistical data determined by the ISP processor <b>940</b> can be transmitted to the control logic unit <b>950</b>. For example, the statistical data may include statistical information of the image sensor <b>914</b> for automatic exposure, automatic white balance, automatic focusing, flicker detection, black level compensation, and shading correction for the lens <b>912</b>. The control logic <b>950</b> may include a processor and/or a micro-controller that executes one or more routines (such as firmware). The one or more routines can determine control parameters for the imaging apparatus <b>910</b> and control parameters for the ISP processor <b>940</b> based on the received statistical data. For example, the control parameters for the imaging apparatus <b>910</b> may include control parameters for the sensor <b>920</b> (such as gain, integration time of exposure control, anti-shake parameters, etc.), flash control parameters for the camera, control parameters for the lens <b>912</b> (such as focus or focal length for zooming), or any combination thereof. The ISP control parameters may include gain level and color correction matrices for automatic white balance and color adjustment (for example, during RGB processing), and shading correction parameters for the lens <b>912</b>.</p><p id="p-0240" num="0207">In the present disclosure, the description with reference to the terms &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;some embodiments&#x201d;, &#x201c;an example&#x201d;, &#x201c;a specific example&#x201d;, or &#x201c;some examples&#x201d;, etc., means that specific features, structures, materials, or characteristics described in conjunction with the embodiment(s) or example(s) are included in at least one embodiment or example of the present disclosure.
