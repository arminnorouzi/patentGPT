level="1">BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">Collapsible containers generally include a base, a pair of opposed long walls connected to long edges of the base and pivotable between a collapsed position on the base and an upright, use position. A pair of opposed short walls are connected to short edges of the base and are pivotable between a collapsed position on the long walls on the base and an upright use position.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The long walls are longer than the short walls, such that the long walls will overlap one another when collapsed (because the long walls are closer to one another) and the short walls do not overlap one another. In some collapsible containers, when the second long wall is collapsed onto the first long wall, it will not be parallel to the base, which will increase the height of the collapsed container.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some collapsible containers, one of the long walls is pivotably connected to the base about an axis that is higher than the other, such that lower-axis long wall must be collapsed onto the base and the higher-axis long wall must be collapsed onto the lower-axis long wall. This provides flat, collapsed long walls, but requires a particular sequence of collapsing the two long walls.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some collapsible containers provide long walls with hinges that are also vertically translatable such that either long wall can be collapsed directly onto the base and either long wall can be collapsed onto the first long wall and in either sequence, both long walls will be parallel to the base. In other words, the long walls can be collapsed in either sequence. This provides a compact volume when collapsed, but the vertically translatable hinges do not always pivot and slide smoothly, especially when moving from the collapsed position directly on the base to the upright position.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The assignee of the present application has developed a series of containers with at least one retractable wall through which product in the container can be retrieved even while other containers are stacked thereon. For example, such a container may be filled with cartons of eggs. A stack of such containers could be loaded into a refrigerator of a store. While stacked, the front walls of the containers could be retracted, providing customers with access to the egg cartons in the containers without the need to unload the containers. The containers may be collapsible, such that when they are empty, they can be collapsed to an efficient volume for storage and return to the warehouse for reuse.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some retractable wall designs, the retractable wall includes a plurality of wall portions that are pivotable outward to provide access to the interior. To retract the wall, the user releases a latch and then pivots an upper portion outward. This causes one or more lower portions to pivot outward as well. It is desirable for this motion to be smooth, without binding.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An improved vertically translatable hinge is disclosed herein. The improved hinge could be used with any collapsible container, with or without one or more retractable walls.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An improved retractable wall for a container is also disclosed herein.

The coupling members <b>66</b> may be C-shaped coupling members, capable of a snap-fit rotatable connection.

As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the mid hinge pins <b>36</b> are positioned toward the interior of the container <b>10</b> and the lower member <b>62</b> of the link <b>60</b> is positioned toward the exterior of the container <b>10</b>, putting the link <b>60</b> at about a ten-degree angle. The lower member <b>62</b> of the link <b>60</b> is the axis about which the lower portion <b>28</b> pivots relative to the link <b>60</b>.</p><p id="p-0085" num="0084">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the upper portion <b>24</b> has been pivoted outward slightly on its hinges <b>33</b> (not visible). This forces the upper ends of the arms <b>64</b> of the link <b>60</b> outward as well. The stop members <b>68</b> of the link <b>60</b> bear against the wall portion <b>38</b> of the lower portion <b>28</b>, which causes the lower member <b>62</b> of the link <b>60</b> to move the upper end of the lower portion <b>28</b> outward, pivoting the lower portion <b>28</b> on its hinge pins <b>43</b> within the lower hinge receivers <b>78</b>. In this way, by causing the lower portion <b>28</b> to pivot outward soon after the upper portion <b>24</b> starts to pivot outward, the front wall <b>18</b> movement is smoother and less likely to bind. Generally, the hinge pins <b>43</b> start to slide downward and inward (rearward) away from the upper forward ends of the lower hinge receivers <b>78</b>. This helps keep the force vector outside the lower rotation point (the hinge pins <b>43</b>), which again provides smoother movement and avoids binding.</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>18</b></figref>, as the upper portion <b>24</b> is pivoted further outward, the upper portion <b>24</b> pushes outward and downward on the lower portion <b>28</b> via the arms <b>64</b> of the link <b>60</b>, which is now outward of the hinge pins <b>43</b>. Because the forces are outward of the hinge pins <b>43</b>, the lower portion <b>28</b> is ensured to pivot smoothly without binding.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b> and <b>20</b></figref> show the upper portion <b>24</b> and lower portion <b>28</b> pivoted further outwardly.

This causes the hinge pins <b>43</b> to start to pivot outward (forward toward the exterior) in the lower hinge receivers <b>78</b>, which also lifts the lower portion <b>28</b> as the hinge pins <b>43</b> travel up the lower hinge receivers <b>78</b>.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, the hinge pins <b>43</b> are returned to the uppermost portions of the lower hinge receivers <b>78</b>, which lifts the lower portion <b>28</b> sufficiently to be received within the cavity of the upper portion <b>24</b>. The stop members <b>68</b> are also partially received within the flange <b>17</b> of the base <b>12</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>. In this manner, the upper portion <b>24</b> and lower portion <b>28</b> are nested within one another and flat against the front flange <b>17</b> of the base <b>12</b> and lower horizontal portion <b>21</b> of the frame <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b> and <b>25</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">As an additional, independent feature (i.e. it could be practiced with or without a retractable front wall), the hinges that connect the two overlapping walls (in this case, the front wall <b>18</b> and rear wall <b>14</b>) are vertically translatable. By permitting vertical translation of the hinge, when the walls <b>14</b>, <b>18</b> are collapsed, either one can be collapsed first with the other on top of the first, and both walls will be flat on the base <b>12</b>.
