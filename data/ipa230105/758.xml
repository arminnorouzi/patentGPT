Such products have limitations as they only provide a temporary hydrophobic surface barrier effect which is not part of skin's natural and healthy barrier function. Whereas, direct administration of biomimetic and precursor topical ingredients, i.e. ceramides, cholesterol, other biopmimetic lipids, also present limitations, including challenges in topically delivering ceramides with limited absorption and distribution within lamellae bodies or identifying which of the large number of epidermal ceramides to utilize. Ceramides have been classified into 19 categories based on their sphingoid base and fatty acid moieties and topical use of only 1 or 2 may be of limited value. To prepare a truly biomimetic topical composition which is most consistent with skin's natural compositions is very difficult.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR&#x3b1;) is a nuclear hormone receptor involved in the transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, and glucose homeostasis. Its activation stimulates antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, whose expression is decreased in aged human skin. PPAR&#x3b1; mRNA levels have been shown to be significantly decreased in intrinsically aged and photoaged human skin as well as in UV-irradiated skin. Furthermore, PPAR&#x3b1; activation-induced upregulation of catalase leads to scavenging of ROS produced due to UV irradiation or aging. PPAR&#x3b1; activation triggers catalase expression and ROS scavenging, thereby protecting skin from UV-induced damage and intrinsic aging.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">The PPAR agonist complex described herein activates the skin's natural biosynthetic barrier lipids and epidermal proteins, i.e. ceramides, filaggrin, transglutaminase, also known as the &#x201c;Barrier Repair Cascade.&#x201d; Embodiments described herein are directed to a topical PPAR agonist complex composition comprising glyceryl linoleate, glyceryl linolenate, xymenynic acid and <i>Pterocarpus marsupium </i>bark extract. The PPAR agonist complex described herein is used to improve skin barrier function, improve skin surface texture, provide desquamation, improve skin brightening, mitigates irritation, and supports the skin's natural ability to defend itself against environmental stressors.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Hair</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">PPAR pathways and activation are also implicated in the metabolic activities of both hair follicles and sebaceous glands and are involved in hair growth.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), which belong to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, are potent key regulators of epidermal development. PPAR alpha, -delta and -gamma are expressed in both dermal and epithelial human hair follicle cells.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The PPAR agonist complex described herein activates hair follicles and sebaceous glands, i.e. by stimulating collagen 17, a critical molecule for HFSC (hair follicle stem cell) maintenance. Embodiments described herein are directed to a topical PPAR agonist complex composition comprising glyceryl linoleate, glyceryl linolenate, xymenynic acid and <i>Pterocarpus marsupium </i>bark extract. The PPAR agonist complex described herein is used to stimulate hair growth, maintain healthy hair, increase hair density and volume, and improve the look and feel of hair.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Acne</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The condition of acne involves excessive keratinocyte proliferation and abnormal desquamation which contributes to clogged pores and plugged follicles leading to pathogenic behavior by <i>P. acnes </i>bacteria. Increased sebum levels combined with follicular hyperkeratinization are a prerequisite of acne vulgaris. As peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are known to control lipid metabolism in several human tissues they have been considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris. PPAR activators offer antiapoptotic effects, promotes keratinocyte differentiation, and maintains epidermal homeostasis. Normalizing keratinocytes differentiation and desquamation is essential for managing acne breakouts.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The main function of the human sebaceous gland is sebum excretion. PPAR agonists may modulate sebaceous secretions by increasing sebum secretion, as well as modifying the differentiation and lipid metabolism of sebocytes. The composition of sebum and clearance from the ducts and follicles is important. Thick, sticky sebum may contribute to follicle clogging which is known to promote proliferative and pathogenic activity by <i>P. acnes </i>bacteria. Increasing sebum secretion or thinning sebum may help clear plugs.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">PPAR agonists may also provide beneficial anti-inflammatory activity for minimizing the appearance of acne and calming irritation associated with acne lesions.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The PPAR agonist complex described herein modulates sebaceous glands, i.e. by activating PKB/Akt and p44/42, two kinases involved in antiapoptosis and proliferation, respectively or decreasing arachidonic acid-derived keto-metabolites (e.g. 5KETE, 12KETE) known to be increased in acne-prone skin. Embodiments described herein are directed to a topical PPAR agonist complex composition comprising glyceryl linoleate, glyceryl linolenate, xymenynic acid and <i>Pterocarpus marsupium </i>bark extract. The PPAR agonist complex described herein is used to treat acne vulgaris, decrease inflammation and irritation caused by acne lesions, inhibit <i>P. acnes</i>, prevent follicle clogging, and reduce the number of acne lesions.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Without wishing to be bound by theory, glyceryl linoleate, glyceryl linolenate are not known to induce PPAR agonist activity. Hydrolysis by esterase enzymes in skin leads to the release of known PPAR agonists (linoleic and linolenic acids). When tested in combination glyceryl linoleate plus glyceryl linolenate do not demonstrate significant PPAR activity. Glyceryl linoleate and glyceryl linolenate in combination with xymenynic acid provide a great solvent for <i>Pterocarpus marsupium </i>Bark Extract and are highly penetrative polar oil carriers.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">Without wishing to be bound by theory, xymenynic acid (acetylenic fatty acid) is a very mild PPAR&#x3b1; agonist, a moderate PPAR&#x3b3; agonist with irreversible binding to arachidonic acid. Also, it provides a benefit in that it is a solvent aid for <i>Pterocarpus marsupium </i>Bark Extract, helping to prevent crystallization on freeze-thaw.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Without wishing to be bound by theory, <i>Pterocarpus marsupium </i>bark extract is not known to be a PPAR agonist but the major stilbene (90% pterostilbene) is known to be a PPAR agonist in a synthetic form. However, at concentrations necessary to provide any beneficial effect, <i>Pterocarpus marsupium </i>bark extract, tested alone, did not produce a PPAR agonist effect due to its high cytotoxicity. <i>Pterocarpus marsupium </i>Bark Extract is beneficial because there is no color change over time as with other stilbenes, it activates sirtuins, is an inhibitor of COX-2, and has anti-glycation activity.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">Various aspects will be described in detail hereinafter. Such aspects may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey its scope to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">Where a range of values is provided, it is intended that each intervening value between the upper and lower limit of that range and any other stated or intervening value in that stated range is encompassed within the disclosure. For example, if a range of 1 wt % to 8 wt % is stated, it is intended that 2 wt %, 3 wt %, 4 wt %, 5 wt %, 6 wt %, and 7 wt % are also explicitly disclosed, as well as the range of values greater than or equal to 1 wt % and the range of values less than or equal to 8 wt %.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">All percentages, parts and ratios are based upon the total weight of the formulations and compositions and all measurements made are at about 25&#xb0; C., unless otherwise specified.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">The singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.

The objective of this test was to measure the antioxidant potential of the test materials listed in Table I using lipophilic oxygen radical absorbance capacity (Lipo-ORAC) assay (Stock solutions were prepared in acetone at 2% and diluted in 7% RMCD immediately before the experiment).</p><p id="p-0191" num="0183">Lipo-ORAC assay measures the ability of antioxidant compounds to inhibit the decline in disodium fluorescein (FL) fluorescence that is induced by peroxyl radical generator, 2&#x2032;,2&#x2032;-Azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH). The peroxyl radical is one of the most common reactive oxygen species (ROS) found in the body. This procedure incorporates random methylated beta-cyclodextrin as a solubility enhancer and allows for quantification of antioxidant potential of lipophilic samples, using Trolox as standard.

It was determined that RFV3 diluted to 10% (v:v) in Finsolv has no irritation activity in this model.</p><p id="p-0195" num="0186">Materials and Methods: Thirty p of each sample was applied on top of EpiDerm skin substitutes. RFV3 was tested at 10%, using Finsolv TN C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate as the diluent/solvent.</p><p id="p-0196" num="0187">EpiDerm skin substitutes (cat. EPI-200-SIT; Lot #29690) and 5% SDS solution (positive control) were obtained from MatTek (Ashland, Mass.). The test was generally performed according to MatTek protocol. The study was conducted in line with requirements of OECD GD 34 and ECVAM Performance Standard document for applying human skin models to in vitro skin irritation. This protocol utilizes the MTT-based cytotoxicity readout as the experimental endpoint, and thus effectively measures the cytotoxicity of test materials at the level of the skin. MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, a tetrazole] which is yellow, is reduced to purple formazan in living cells and this conversion is measured in a colorimetric assay. MTT assay measures the activity of succinate dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in the respiratory electron transport chain in mitochondria and is a generally-accepted test for measuring cytotoxicity.</p><p id="p-0197" num="0188">The test material was assayed in duplicates. Controls were assayed in triplicates. The negative control was type I sterile water and Finsolv. The positive control was 5% SDS. All incubations were at 37&#xb0; C. The pre-incubation time 1 (tissue acclimatization time) was overnight and the exposure to samples was 60 min. Tissues were then rinsed with sterile PBS and placed in the new culture medium. Post-incubation time 1 was 24 h, afterward medium was collected and saved at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. for later interleukin quantification, and tissues were placed in new medium. Post-incubation time 2 was 18 h (both post-incubation times are to allow the consequences of the potential irritation to fully develop), MTT test (irritation readout) was 3 h and the extraction was left overnight. The extracted formazan (the product of the MTT conversion, proportional to cell viability) was quantified with Molecular Devices microplate reader MAX190 by colorimetry. Signal quantification was performed using SoftMax3.1.2PRO at 560 nm. For IL-8 quantification (a complementary method for assessing skin irritation), 100 &#x3bc;l samples of media from each well were tested in triplicates using CytoSet antibody pair for ELISA from Thermo Fischer Scientific (Waltham, Mass.; cat. #133301) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The colorimetric signal proportional to IL-8 concentration in the tissue-conditioned medium was acquired with Molecular Devices microplate reader MAX190.</p><p id="p-0198" num="0189">Statistically significant variation was defined as &#x2265;15% variation from the water control with p value&#x3c;0.05 calculated using double-tailed t-test.</p><p id="p-0199" num="0190">Results and Discussion: The colorimetric quantification of the product of MTT metabolism (formazan) is provided in Table 2. As reported in Table 3 below, the viability of tissues treated with all experimental conditions, except the positive control (SDS), was above 50% of the water (negative) control, which classifies RFV3 at 10% as non-irritant and non-cytotoxic in this model system. Table 2 also summarizes the non-irritant (NI) or irritant (I) classification for all materials and controls used in this assay. The treatment with the positive control, 5% SDS detergent, was cytotoxic, as expected, leaving only 12% of cells viable. The replicates met standard deviation (SD) criterion defined by the protocol i.e., SD&#x3c;18% and the viability of Positive Control (5% SDS) tissues was less than 20% of the negative control. Table 2 presents the results of IL-8 quantification in the media conditioned by EpiDerm tissues exposed to different experimental conditions. The level of IL-8 detected in the EpiDerm-conditioned media correlates with the irritation rate and is a secondary readout method. The test material did not stimulate the IL-8 output. SDS (the positive control) triggered a 55% decrease of the IL-8 level due to cytotoxicity, technically validating the experiment.</p><p id="p-0200" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00003" num="00003"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="259pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 3</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Viability of EpiDerm tissues exposed to different experimental</entry></row><row><entry>conditions with SD and statistical significance vs. water.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry>Mean of</entry><entry>Statistical</entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Test</entry><entry>Mean of</entry><entry>SD of</entry><entry>Viability</entry><entry>significance</entry></row><row><entry>Material</entry><entry>OD</entry><entry>OD</entry><entry>[% water]</entry><entry>(p value)</entry><entry>Classification</entry><entry>Qualification</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="7"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="28pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="42pt" align="char" char="."/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Water</entry><entry>0.331</entry><entry>0.009</entry><entry>100</entry><entry>1.000</entry><entry>NI</entry><entry>qualified</entry></row><row><entry>5% SDS</entry><entry>0.038</entry><entry>0.004</entry><entry>2</entry><entry>0.000</entry><entry>I</entry><entry>qualified</entry></row><row><entry>Finsolv</entry><entry>0.392</entry><entry>0.036</entry><entry>118</entry><entry>0.000</entry><entry>NI</entry><entry>qualified</entry></row><row><entry>RFV3</entry><entry>0.419</entry><entry>0.008</entry><entry>131</entry><entry>0.000</entry><entry>NI</entry><entry>qualified</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="left" id="FOO-00001">SD: standard deviation.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="left" id="FOO-00002">OD: optical density (absorbance).</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="left" id="FOO-00003">I = irritant; NI = non irritant.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="7" align="left" id="FOO-00004">&#x201c;qualified&#x201d;: test criteria fulfilled.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 3: Transcriptional Regulation by PPAR-&#x3b1;</heading><p id="p-0201" num="0191">Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-&#x3b1;) is a nuclear receptor protein encoded by the PPARA gene.

PPAR&#x3b3; increases mitochondrial biogenesis, oxygen consumption, &#x394;&#x3a8;m, antioxidant defenses, regulates autophagy, and increases transcription factors, like PGC1&#x3b1;, NRF1-2, TFAM. Also PPAR&#x3b3; agonists regulate apoptosis and reduce inflammation. Thus, PPAR&#x3b3; agonists regulate the expression of several target genes improving mitochondrial function and increasing redox capacity. Experimental Condition tested was UVA-irradiated adult human dermal fibroblasts (HDF).</p><p id="p-0210" num="0198">The objective of this project was to determine the effects of the test material on a series of skin-relevant parameters in UVA-irradiated adult human dermal fibroblasts (HDF), in the context of the total mitochondrial metabolism and proliferation of these cells.</p><p id="p-0211" num="0199">Materials and Methods: Test material was dissolved in DMSO at 100 mg/ml and further dilutions were made in distilled water (dH<sub>2</sub>O). Samples were added in triplicates to exponentially growing aged adult human dermal fibroblasts (HDF; 10,000 cells/well of a 96 well plate; p. 12 Cell Applications, San Diego, Calif., cat. #106-05a; lot #3014). Cultures were maintained in DMEM/10% FBS and 24 h after sample additions, they were irradiated with UVA at 5.2 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>for 30 min. with UVA lamp UVA-28T (Ultra-lum), in order to induce photo-oxidative stress in plasma and mitochondrial membranes. Seventy-two h. later the experiment was terminated and type I collagen was quantified in the cell culture medium (soluble fraction) and on fixed cells (insoluble fraction) by ELISA. IL-8 was also measured in the cell culture-conditioned medium. Total insoluble (cytoskeletal) proteins were quantified to determine the effect of test materials on cell proliferation (cell numbers or cell #). These values were also used to standardize type I collagen and IL-8 output data to cell numbers, using the formula:</p><p id="p-0212" num="0000"><br/><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>[macromolecule of interest raw read-out value]/[cell number raw read-out value]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?></p><p id="p-0213" num="0200">This standardization was performed separately for every well. Each experimental condition and control was assayed at least in triplicates. The effect of the test material on mitochondrial metabolism was measured by the MTT assay, which measures the activity of mitochondrial dehydrogenases, such as succinate dehydrogenase, implicated in the respiratory electron transport chain in mitochondria. All colorimetric measurements were performed using Molecular Devices microplate reader MAX190 and SoftMax3.1.2PRO software. Statistical significance was assessed with paired Student test. Deviations of &#x2265;20% as compared to water control with p values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p><p id="p-0214" num="0201">Results and Discussion: UVA radiation is the prevalent component of the solar UV spectrum and main effector of photoaging. It penetrates deeper into the skin than UVB and induces photooxidative stress not only in the epidermal layer but also in the dermis. The UVA irradiation protocol followed (with modifications) in this project was designed to study the effects of carotenoids on human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) subjected to photooxidative stress.</p><p id="p-0215" num="0202">The results (Table 6) show that UVA irradiation triggered an increase of soluble type I collagen, perhaps partially due to an increase of metalloproteinase activity. This is supported by the fact that the deposited, insoluble collagen was modestly decreased (by 10%) by UVA irradiation. A modest (15%) increase of IL-8 secretion was also detected in UVA-irradiated cells.</p><p id="p-0216" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00006" num="00006"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="217pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 6</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Effect of UVA irradiation on IL-8 in the HDF culture media and on</entry></row><row><entry>soluble and insoluble type I collagen, standardized to cell numbers</entry></row><row><entry>and expressed as % of values recorded in non-irradiated HDF culture.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="4"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="63pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="63pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>HDF Irradiation</entry><entry>Type 1 Collagen</entry><entry>Type 1 Collagen</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>Status</entry><entry>(deposited)</entry><entry>(soluble)</entry><entry>IL-8</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>UVA-irradiated</entry><entry>&#x2002;90%</entry><entry>167%</entry><entry>117%</entry></row><row><entry>Non-irradiated</entry><entry>100%</entry><entry>100%</entry><entry>100%</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="4" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0217" num="0203">Table 6 shows that RFV3 was cytotoxic at the highest tested concentrations (500 &#x3bc;g/ml). This data established the upper limit of the concentration framework to employ in further cell-based assays with this material. Table 7 also shows that at the non-cytotoxic concentrations 20 &#x3bc;g/ml and 100 &#x3bc;g/ml RFV3 did not have a statistically-significant effect on cell proliferation, type I collagen output (soluble and insoluble) nor interleukin-8 secretion to the cell culture conditioned medium. It did however significantly stimulate the mitochondrial metabolism (bolded). Importantly, this increase was dose-dependent. These results suggest that RFV3 could provide mitochondrial health-related benefits to the skin without the irritation side effect at a broad range of concentrations. These mitochondrial health-related benefits could include increased ATP production, upregulated oxidative respiration (as opposed to glycolysis, which is more used by cancer cells) and stimulate energy and macromolecule output for skin regeneration.</p><p id="p-0218" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00007" num="00007"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0" pgwide="1"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="1"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="266pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" rowsep="1">TABLE 7</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="1" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Effect of RFV3 on IL-8 in the HDF culture media and on soluble and</entry></row><row><entry>insoluble type I collagen, standardized to cell numbers and expressed</entry></row><row><entry>as % of values recorded in water-treated control culture.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="left"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Experimental</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Condition in</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>UVA-</entry><entry>Type I</entry><entry>Type I</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>irradiated</entry><entry>Collagen</entry><entry>Collagen</entry><entry/><entry>Mitochondrial</entry><entry>Cell</entry></row><row><entry>HDF</entry><entry>(deposited)</entry><entry>(soluble)</entry><entry>IL-8</entry><entry>Metabolism</entry><entry>Numbers</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="49pt" align="left"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="49pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="42pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry>Water</entry><entry>100%</entry><entry>100%</entry><entry>100%</entry><entry>100%&#x2002;</entry><entry>100%&#x2002;</entry></row><row><entry>RFV3</entry><entry>116%</entry><entry>104%</entry><entry>117%</entry><entry>141%*</entry><entry>93%</entry></row><row><entry>20 &#x3bc;g/ml</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>RFV3</entry><entry>125%</entry><entry>&#x2002;85%</entry><entry>104%</entry><entry>195%*</entry><entry>92%</entry></row><row><entry>100 &#x3bc;g/ml</entry><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>RFV3</entry><entry>N/A</entry><entry>N/A</entry><entry>N/A</entry><entry>N/A</entry><entry>N/A</entry></row><row><entry>500 &#x3bc;g/ml</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="left" id="FOO-00005">*p value &#x3c; 0.05.</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="6" align="left" id="FOO-00006">N/A: does not apply (cytotoxic).</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 5: Effect of RFV3 on Melanin Content in Melanocytes and Melanocyte-Conditioned Medium</heading><p id="p-0219" num="0204">This project was to assess the effects of the test material on the intracellular melanin content in human melanocytes.</p><p id="p-0220" num="0205">Materials &#x26; Methods: Test material was dissolved at 100 mg/ml in DMSO the day of the experiment, diluted in sterile distilled water and samples were added in duplicates to confluent cultures of C57BL/6 mouse melanocytes well plate format.

Epidermal substitutes (cat. #102-3D-12; lot #2744) were obtained from Cell Applications (San Diego, Calif.). They were prepared in vitro in PCF inserts from neonatal keratinocytes and fibroblasts, and differentiated over a period of about two weeks into stratified squamous epithelium. Such 3D cultures approximate human epidermis and are commonly used for skin aging research. Tissues were equilibrated in cell culture incubator for 60 min. and were exposed to the test material at 2% (diluted in glycerin), and to the negative control (glycerin) in triplicates for 24 h. At the end of the incubation (24 h) tissues were rinsed and RNA was extracted and purified with NucleoSpin RNA kit from Macherey-Nagel (cat. #740955.240C; Bethlehem, Pa.), using QiaCube robotic station (Qiagen, Germantown, Md.). Purified total RNA was assessed at 260 nm and 280 nm with NanoDrop Lite (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Mass.), pure samples with A260A/280 and A260/A230 ratios of &#x3e;1.7 were standardized and the expression of the panel of genes of interest was quantified by qPCR with BioRad iCycler iQ Detection System using primers from Realtimeprimers (RTP; Elkins Park, Pa.), 5&#xd7; All-In-One 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Mix (cat. #AZ-1996, Azura Genomics/RTP) and Fast Green qPCR Master Mix-Fluor (cat. #4375; Azura Genomics/RTP).

The main unit of the SC is the corneocyte, anucleated cell filled by a hydrophilic mass of keratin filaments and surrounded by a lipid-rich extracellular matrix. The most important intercellular lipids of corneocytes are ceramides, cholesterol and fatty acids, representing 50%, 25% and 10%, respectively, of the total lipidic mass of the SC. Intercellular lipids, including ceramides, limit the trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). In addition, they represent a real physical barrier protecting the epidermis from external stimuli. Ceramides are the precursors of all sphingolipids. They are formed by the link between a fatty acid and a sphingoid base, the sphingosin for ceramides, and the dehydro-sphingosin for dehydro-ceramides. Phytoceramides, with a base of phyto-sphingosin associated to a C-4 hydroxyl group are also found in the SC.</p><p id="p-0241" num="0224">Filaggrin: Filaggrin is initially synthetized as its precursor, the pro-filaggrin, a protein of about 400 kDa highly phosphorylated and insoluble. It represents the major constituent of keratohyalin granules of the stratum granulosum. During the late phase of the differentiation program of the epidermis, pro-filaggrin is dephosphorylated and cleaved by caspase-14 in several monomers of filaggrin. Successively, filaggrin is linked to keratin filaments, participating in their aggregation in microfibrils and in the formation of the cornified cell envelop. In the medial stratum corneum, filaggrin is then proteolysed in different fragments: this proteolysis is a central step for the formation of the natural moisturing factor (NMF). The NMF, due to its hygroscopic proprieties is directly implicated in the hydration of the horny layer.</p><p id="p-0242" num="0225">Transglutaminase 1: Epidermal keratinocytes undergo terminal differentiation involving keratin aggregation, nuclear degradation, and replacement of the plasma membrane with a tough, insoluble proteinaceous envelope, the cornified envelop, that is cross-linked to extracellular lipid providing barrier function. Transglutaminases (TGMs) are Ca2+-dependent cross-linking enzymes that catalyze an acyl-transfer reaction between the-carboxamide group of protein-bound glutamine and various primary amines, most commonly the -amino group of lysine residues, thus forming isopeptide bonds between proteins that generate insoluble macromolecular assemblies. Four of the seven human TGases (1, 2, 3, 5) are expressed in terminally differentiating epithelia, including the skin.
