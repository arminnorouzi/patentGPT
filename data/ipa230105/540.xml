id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an electrode unit, a treatment system and a method for operating the electrode unit, and more specifically relates to an electrode unit for treating a tissue inside a body cavity using a high-frequency electric current, a treatment system and a method for operating the electrode unit.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, in the medical field, endoscope systems, which are medical apparatuses for, under endoscopic observation, performing treatment, for example, resection or coagulation of a living tissue inside a body cavity of a subject such as a human body, using an energy device, such as an electric surgical knife, that uses a high-frequency electric current, have been publicly known. Endoscope systems including this type of energy device have widely been used when treatment, for example, resection of a living tissue inside an organ such as a bladder, is performed.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, Japanese Patent Nos. 4495493 and 3730796 each disclose an endoscope system in which under endoscopic observation, a living tissue inside a body cavity of a subject is subjected to treatment such as resection or coagulation using an energy device that uses a high-frequency electric current.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The endoscope system disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 4495493 includes an electrode unit that includes an electrode formed in a hook-shaped shape, and performs treatment, such as resection or coagulation of a desired living tissue, by making a high-frequency electric current flow in the hook-shaped electrode. The hook-shaped electrode disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 4495493 is configured to be capable of being arbitrarily set in two states, a state in which the electrode is rotatable relative to a sheath around an axis of the sheath with an entirety of the electrode projecting from a distal end of the sheath and a rotation-restricted state in which the electrode is restricted from rotating relative to the sheath around the axis of the sheath with only an arbitrary length of the electrode projecting from the distal end of the sheath.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">This configuration enables the endoscope system disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 4495493 to during treatment such as resection of a living tissue, restrict rotation of the hook-shaped electrode around the sheath axis and hold the electrode in a stable posture. Therefore, the configuration enables a user to more stably perform a desired operation.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0008" num="0007">An electrode unit according to an aspect of the present invention includes: an electrode including one end and another end, the other end including a free end; and an electrode supporting portion that supports the one end of the electrode. The electrode is disposed in a second plane that is different from a first plane in which the electrode supporting portion is moved to advance or withdraw when the electrode supporting portion is moved to advance or withdraw in a direction along a longitudinal axis of the electrode supporting portion, and the electrode is supported by the electrode supporting portion via a flexed portion projecting from the first plane to the second plane.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A treatment system according to an aspect of the present invention includes: an endoscope including an insertion portion; and an electrode unit that projects from a distal end of the insertion portion, the electrode unit being configured to treat a tissue. The electrode unit includes an electrode including one end and another end, the other end including a free end, and an electrode supporting portion that supports the one end of the electrode, the electrode is disposed in a second plane that is different from a first plane in which the electrode supporting portion is moved to advance or withdraw when the electrode supporting portion is moved to advance or withdraw in a direction along a longitudinal axis of the electrode supporting portion, and the electrode is supported by the electrode supporting portion via a flexed portion projecting from the first plane to the second plane.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">A method for operating an electrode unit according to an aspect of the present invention is a method for operating an electrode unit for treating a tissue inside a body cavity using a high-frequency electric current, the method including: creating a detached fragment, a part of the detached fragment sticking to an inside of the body cavity, via an electrode; applying the electrode to the part of the detached fragment, the part sticking to the inside of the body cavity, with an electrode supporting portion disposed under the detached fragment, the electrode supporting portion supporting the electrode; providing energy to the electrode to create the detached fragment, a part of the detached fragment sticking to the inside of the body cavity; applying the electrode to the part of the detached fragment, the part sticking to the inside of the body cavity, with a part of the electrode unit disposed under the detached fragment; and providing energy to the electrode to separate the detached fragment off from the inside of the body cavity.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention"

Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading><p id="p-0070" num="0069">Generally, in conventional endoscope systems of a type that includes an electrode unit including a hook-shaped electrode, in order to resect a desired lesion region in one piece, for example, it is necessary to successively perform a plurality of different operations such as an operation of marking the periphery of the lesion region, an operation of dissecting the periphery of the lesion region and an operation of detaching the dissected region, which requires complicated handling and thus is problematic in requiring much skill.</p><p id="p-0071" num="0070">Furthermore, in the aforementioned endoscope system disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 4495493, even enhancement in ease of handing is achieved by preventing rotation of the electrode during a procedure, no control in depth direction in which the electrode penetrates from a wall surface of a living tissue is considered, which may cause unevenness in thickness of the resected living tissue.</p><p id="p-0072" num="0071">Generally, in a case where a resected living tissue is used for a biopsy, the tissue needs to have a predetermined thickness, and thus, it is considered preferable that a thickness of the resected tissue, that is, a resection depth be constant.</p><p id="p-0073" num="0072">On the other hand, the apparatus disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 3730796 includes an electrode unit that includes an electrode formed in a looped shape, and performs treatment, such as resection or coagulation of a living tissue, by making a high-frequency electric current flow in the looped electrode. The looped electrode-type electrode unit is advantageous in ease of handling.</p><p id="p-0074" num="0073">However, in conventional endoscope systems of the type that includes an electrode unit including a looped electrode, a dimension in a width direction of the electrode is restricted by, e.g., a diameter of a sheath that allows insertion of the electrode, or a diameter of a channel of an endoscope, the channel allowing insertion of the sheath, and thus, a resection width narrows, causing the problem of impossibility of performing one-piece resection of a desired lesion region.</p><p id="p-0075" num="0074">Generally, a size of an electrode, the size allowing the electrode to be inserted through a device channel of, e.g., a resectoscope or a cystoscope, is less than 1 cm. On the other hand, in ordinary cases, a living tissue desired to be resected in one piece is around 4 cm at a maximum.</p><p id="p-0076" num="0075">Therefore, the present invention enables provision of an electrode unit that performs treatment of a tissue inside a body cavity using a high-frequency electric current, the electrode unit having a structure that enables one-piece resection of a living tissue inside a body cavity to be performed easily, and a method for operating the electrode unit.</p><p id="p-0077" num="0076">The present invention will be described below based on embodiments illustrated in the drawings. Each of the drawings used for the below description is a schematic one, and in order to illustrate respective components in sizes that are large enough to be recognized in the drawings, the components may be illustrated so as to be different in, e.g., dimensional relationship among respective members and scale. Therefore, the present invention is not limited to the illustrated forms in terms of, e.g., counts of the respective components, shapes of the respective components, ratios in size among the respective components and relative positional relationships among the respective components indicated in each drawing.</p><heading id="h-0008" level="1">First Embodiment</heading><p id="p-0078" num="0077">An endoscope system including an electrode unit of a first embodiment of the present invention is a medical apparatus for under endoscopic observation, performing desired treatment such as resection or coagulation of a living tissue inside a subject.</p><p id="p-0079" num="0078">Therefore, before detailed description of the electrode unit of the first embodiment of the present invention, first, a schematic configuration of the entire endoscope system including the electrode unit of the present embodiment will be described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p><p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating a configuration of an endoscope system including an electrode unit of the first embodiment of the present invention.</p><p id="p-0081" num="0080">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an endoscope system <b>1</b> including an electrode unit <b>30</b> of the present embodiment includes, e.g., a resectoscope <b>10</b>, which is an endoscope, the electrode unit <b>30</b> of the present embodiment and an external apparatus <b>50</b>.</p><p id="p-0082" num="0081">The endoscope system <b>1</b> includes the electrode unit <b>30</b> of the present embodiment is an example of an endoscope system in which a subject is a human body. Furthermore, in the endoscope system <b>1</b> in the example configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an endoscope of a form generally called a resectoscope is employed. However, the electrode unit of the present invention is not limited to this example configuration and can also be applied to, for example, a flexible endoscope.</p><p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the endoscope system <b>1</b> including the electrode unit <b>30</b> of the present embodiment, the resectoscope <b>10</b> includes, e.g., a sheath <b>11</b>, a slider <b>20</b> and a telescope <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The sheath <b>11</b> is formed in a straight shape along a longitudinal axis L and is formed of a hollow tubular member.

The proximal end <b>11</b><i>b </i>of the sheath <b>11</b> is a part disposed outside the subject when the resectoscope <b>10</b> is used.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">Here, a first axis X and a second axis Y that are a pair of axes orthogonal to the longitudinal axis L and orthogonal to each other are set.

In this case, it is assumed that: the right side as the distal end side (far end side) is viewed from the proximal end side is the rightward direction; and the left side as the distal end side (far end side) is viewed from the proximal end side is the leftward direction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Furthermore, it is assumed that one of directions along the second axis Y is an upward direction; and the other is a downward direction.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">In this case, in an image picked up using the telescope <b>21</b>, a horizontal direction of the image is substantially parallel to the first axis X and a vertical direction is substantially parallel to the second axis Y. Furthermore, the upward direction and the downward direction on the second axis Y of the image correspond to the upper side and the lower side of the image in the image picked up using the telescope <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">In at least a surface in the vicinity of the distal end <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the sheath <b>11</b>, a collection electrode <b>11</b><i>c </i>including an electrically conductive material is provided so as to be exposed to the outside.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">The entire sheath <b>11</b> includes an electrically conductive material such as a metal.

For example, if operations of the third round onwards are performed in a manner that is similar to the manner of the second-round dissection operation and the above-described final dissection operation is performed as a last dissection operation, a wider area of a living tissue can be resected.</p><p id="p-0188" num="0186">Furthermore, although in the present embodiment, as a form of the electrode <b>35</b>, an example configuration including a proximal end <b>35</b><i>a </i>provided so as to extend in the downward direction along the second axis Y and a beam portion <b>35</b><i>b </i>extending from an extremity of the proximal end <b>35</b><i>a </i>in the leftward direction along the first axis X has been indicated, the present invention is not limited to this form.</p><p id="p-0189" num="0187">As a form of the electrode <b>35</b>, the form being different from the above, for example, the electrode <b>35</b> can be configured by a beam portion <b>35</b><i>b </i>alone, the beam portion <b>35</b><i>b </i>extending from the facing surface <b>36</b><i>a </i>of the distal end rigid portion <b>36</b> in the leftward direction along the first axis X.</p><p id="p-0190" num="0188">In the electrode unit <b>30</b> of the present embodiment, the electrode supporting portion <b>32</b> and the tissue retaining portion <b>40</b> are brought into abutment with a living tissue and then press the living tissue in a same direction, which makes a part of the living tissue, the part being between the electrode supporting portion <b>32</b> and the tissue retaining portion <b>40</b>, deform into an outwardly bulging shape. Therefore, even the electrode <b>35</b> being formed so as to extend in the first axis X direction (horizontal direction) from the facing surface <b>36</b><i>a </i>of the distal end rigid portion <b>36</b> still enables resection of a living tissue that is stable in shape.</p><p id="p-0191" num="0189">As described above, according to the first embodiment, in an electrode unit that performs treatment of a living tissue inside a body cavity, for example, more specifically, one-piece resection of a living tissue including a lesion part such as a cancer, using a high-frequency electric current, the electrode supporting portion <b>32</b> and the tissue retaining portion <b>40</b> are brought into abutment with the living tissue, enabling the electrode <b>35</b> supported by the electrode supporting portion <b>32</b> to be stable on a surface of the living tissue and also enabling restriction of a depth to which the electrode <b>35</b> penetrates in a depth direction from the surface of the living tissue. Consequently, there are no concerns of, e.g., the electrode <b>35</b> pierces a wall surface of the living tissue.</p><p id="p-0192" num="0190">Furthermore, in this state, the electrode supporting portion <b>32</b> being slid from the distal end side (far end side) to the proximal end side in the longitudinal axis L direction enables the electrode <b>35</b> to be slid in the same direction to dissect the living tissue. Furthermore, at this time, the tissue retaining portion <b>40</b> moves in a direction that is the same as the direction of sliding of the electrode <b>35</b> while retaining the surface of the living tissue, enabling a resection target region to be kept stable. Therefore, an operation to dissect the living tissue via the electrode <b>35</b> can stably and reliably be performed. Then, mere repetition of such simple operation enables one-piece resection of a desired region of the living tissue.</p><p id="p-0193" num="0191">Therefore, as a result of the above, the resected living tissue is in one piece. Therefore, use of a one-piece resected fragment (pathology specimen) enables, for example, efficient pathological diagnosis and can contribute to enhancement in accuracy of diagnosis.</p><p id="p-0194" num="0192">Note that respective configurations of the electrode supporting portion, the electrode and the tissue retaining portion included in the electrode unit of the present invention are not limited to the example configurations indicated in the first embodiment described above.
