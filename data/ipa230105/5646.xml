The invention also concerns the process for preparing such a biocompatible oily ferrofluid and its use as a contrast agent or in a cancer treatment by magnetic-induced hyperthermia. Finally, the invention concerns a nanoemulsion comprising such a biocompatible oily ferrofluid.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">A ferrofluid is made up of a kinetically stable dispersion of superparamagnetic nanoparticles in a carrier liquid which may be an aqueous or organic solvent, or an oil. A ferrofluid becomes magnetic when a static external magnetic field is applied. A ferrofluid is able to move or deform under the action of a magnetic field. In the context of use in magnetically-induced hyperthermia, the magnetic particles are used as a heating mediator under the effect of an alternating external magnetic field.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Depending on the use of these ferrofluids, the magnetic particles are dispersed in aqueous medium, in oily medium or in an emulsion.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, aqueous ferrofluids are especially known for use as contrast agents in MRI and in the therapy of solid tumours by magnetic-induced hyperthermia. For example, in the context of the NanoTherm&#xae; therapy developed by MagForce AG&#xae;, iron oxide nanoparticles in aqueous suspension are injected into the tumour and agglomerate in the target tissue. Nanoparticles generate a release of heat under the effect of an external magnetic field applied, which induces the destruction of tumour cells. This treatment can be applied as a complement to chemotherapy or radiation therapy.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">An effective ferrofluid must make it possible to destroy a large tumour volume in a short magnetic induction treatment time and for a low concentration of nanoparticles. However, the calorific performances of aqueous dispersing media are not as good as those of an oily medium (whether included in an emulsion or not). Indeed, generally the calorific capacity of oil is much lower than that of water and its thermal conductivity is also lower. Thus, in order to improve the efficacy of the ferrofluid composition in magnetic hyperthermia treatment, it would be preferable to use an oily ferrofluid composition or at least a dispersion of magnetic particles in an oil phase of an emulsion.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Moreover, systemic injection of aqueous ferrofluid in a patient poses the problem of the quantity of magnetic particles present at the target, which must be sufficient to compensate for thermal losses in the living environment, which is an aqueous environment thermoregulated at 37&#xb0; C. Improving the efficacy of such a treatment by systemic administration would require the injection of a large quantity of injected nanoparticles, well beyond the recommended doses (of around 0.8 mg Fe/kg for iron oxide contrast agents) associated with a sufficient accumulation at the pathological area provided by favorable pharmacokinetics and effective targeting.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Ferrofluid nanoemulsions or ferrofluid oily suspensions are mainly known for use as MRI contrast agents and for cancer treatment by magnetic hyperthermia.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">An example of ferrofluid in emulsion used as contrast agent is reported in application FR 3 001 154, which describes an oil-in-water nanoemulsion comprising an aqueous phase, a lipid phase comprising an oil, C6-C18 saturated fatty acid glycerides and magnetic particles based on an iron compound covered by one or more C8-C22 fatty acids and surfactants comprising at least one amphiphilic lipid and at least one targeting ligand. Such a nanoemulsion contains additives, such as surfactants, necessary for the stabilization of the nanoemulsion, that can alter the biocompatibility of the ferrofluid composition. Yet excellent biocompatibility is essential for medicinal use.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">In this context, the Applicant sought to improve the biocompatibility of ferrofluid compositions for medicinal use and their efficacy (especially heat transfer by reduction of the dissipation rate of heat in the living environment in the context of use in magnetic induced hyperthermia) for the intended use, while having a chemical and colloidal stability at a temperature making it possible to restore the magnetic energy of the nanoparticles into thermal energy, and preferably compatible with a mode of administration by injection. The ferrofluid compositions of the invention can be envisaged for different medicinal applications and especially for cancer treatment by magnetic hyperthermia or as a contrast agent.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to improve the efficacy of ferrofluids, the Applicant is particularly interested in oily ferrofluids, especially in view of their application for magnetic hyperthermia or as a contrast agent, as well as ferrofluid emulsions.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">Since iron oxide nanoparticles are biocompatible, the Applicant sought to improve the biocompatibility of the medium in which these nanoparticles are dispersed. In particular, the Applicant sought to use only biocompatible additives and liquid carrier and to avoid anything that is not biocompatible and could therefore lead to toxicity for the patient.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this context, the invention proposes a novel biocompatible oily ferrofluid comprising iron-oxide based magnetic nanoparticles and an oil phase comprising at least one fatty acid ester, wherein said nanoparticles are surface functionalized by molecules of one or more phospholipids. Advantageously, in the oily ferrofluids according to the invention, iron-oxide based magnetic nanoparticles are dispersed and, preferably, in the form of a colloidal dispersion, in an oil phase containing at least one fatty acid ester.</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Indeed, the formation of magnetic aggregates can lead to a reduction in heating efficiency of the nanoparticles under induction (i.e., under the effect of an alternating magnetic field). Thus, particular attention should be paid to the dispersion of these nanoparticles in order to prevent, as much as possible, the formation of aggregates, and especially large aggregates.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thus, colloidal stability is a necessary condition to improve the performances of ferrofluid compositions, whether for their use in magnetic hyperthermia, as a contrast agent, or any other therapeutic application. In general, iron oxide nanoparticles are stabilized kinetically from the colloidal viewpoint under oily conditions and in emulsions using surfactants or dispersion agents, which prevents the formation of magnetic nanoparticle aggregates that can be detrimental to heating efficiency, especially due to magnetic dipolar interactions. Under the temperature conditions of use, magnetic nanoparticles should not flocculate under the effect of an applied alternating or static magnetic field and remain single phase. However, surfactants or dispersion agents are often poorly or not at all biocompatible.</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">The Applicant therefore sought the conditions for nanoparticle dispersibility at different temperatures for application in hyperthermia without using either surfactants or dispersion agents (or any other non-biocompatible additive). The Applicant thus worked on the surface chemistry of the metal oxide nanoparticles used. Indeed, the Applicant observed that a judiciously chosen chemical surface functionalization, combined with the presence of certain components in the oil phase, make it possible to significantly improve the colloidal stabilization of oily ferrofluid compositions under temperature conditions compatible with an injection.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">Thus, the invention preferably concerns a biocompatible oily ferrofluid comprising iron-oxide based magnetic nanoparticles and an oil phase comprising at least one fatty acid ester, said iron-oxide based magnetic nanoparticles forming a colloidal dispersion in said oil phase from a temperature belonging to the range from 20 to 80&#xb0; C., characterized in that said magnetic nanoparticles are surface functionalized by molecules of one or more phospholipids which do not completely cover the surface of the iron-oxide based magnetic nanoparticles and, in particular, which ensure a coverage rate of the surface of the iron-oxide based magnetic nanoparticles such that the fatty acid ester(s) present in the oil phase have access to the surface of the iron-oxide based magnetic nanoparticles.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">The biocompatible oily fluid according to the invention advantageously has one or another of the following characteristics, alone or in combination, or even all the following characteristics:<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0018">the oily ferrofluid is free of water and/or free of surfactant;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0019">the phospholipid molecules ensure a coverage of 19 to 76%, preferably of 29 to 76% and preferentially of 34 to 50%, of the surface of the iron-oxide based magnetic nanoparticles;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0020">the surface density of functionalization (also called surface density of grafting) in phospholipid molecules belongs to the range from 0.32 molecule/nm<sup>2 </sup>to 1.22 molecules/nm<sup>2</sup>, preferably from 0.48 molecule/nm<sup>2 </sup>to 1.22 molecules/nm<sup>2</sup>; and preferentially from 0.56 molecule/nm<sup>2 </sup>to 0.79 molecule/nm<sup>2</sup>;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0021">the phospholipid(s) contain at least one fatty chain, preferably 2 fatty chains, in particular C6-C30 and preferably C8-C24 or even C10-C22, and in particular C18 saturated or mono- or polyunsaturated, branched or, preferably, linear hydrocarbon chains;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0022">the oil phase comprises at least 70% by mass of fatty acid ester(s), preferably the oil phase comprises from 80% to 95% by mass of fatty acid ester(s), relative to the total mass of the oil phase;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0023">the fatty acid ester(s) of the oil phase are chosen from C6-C12, preferably C6-C10, saturated fatty acid triglycerides and C6-C12, preferably C6-C10 saturated fatty acid propylene glycols used singly or in mixture;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0024">the content of magnetic nanoparticles belongs to the range from 0.01% to 50% by mass, preferably from 0.1% to 10% by mass, relative to the total mass of the oily ferrofluid; when it is a question of magnetic nanoparticle content, this only comprises iron oxide-based magnetic nanoparticles and does not include functionalization;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0008" num="0025">the magnetic nanoparticles are in the form of a spheroid, a polyhedron such as nanocubes, bipyramids or nanostars, a wafer, a nanorod, a nanodisk, or a nanoflower;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0009" num="0026">the phospholipid(s) have an &#x2014;O(O)P(OH)O<sup>&#x2212;</sup> polar head and are preferably chosen from salts of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidic acid and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidic acid;</li>        <li id="ul0002-0010" num="0027">the biocompatible oily ferrofluid further comprises a lipophilic active ingredient, in particular chosen from cancer treatment drugs, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, or carmustine.</li>    </ul>    </li></ul></p><p id="p-0019" num="0028">The functionalized iron-oxide based magnetic nanoparticles such as defined in the context of the invention, regardless of its variant of embodiment, are also an integral part of the invention.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0029">The invention also concerns a process for preparing a biocompatible oily ferrofluid according to the invention.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0030">The process for preparing a biocompatible oily ferrofluid according to the invention makes it possible to disperse the magnetic nanoparticles without using an additive that could be detrimental to the biocompatibility of the oily ferrofluid.

The colloidal stability of magnetic ferrofluid dispersions as a function of temperature of the medium can be characterized qualitatively by their clarity and translucence, as opposed to a suspension of aggregates or flocculates that has a turbid, cloudy or opaque character. A quantitative evaluation can be done by measuring transmittance at 800 nm. For example, nanoparticle dispersions of mass concentration of 0.2 g/L in Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&#x2014;&#x3b3; in the size range from 5 to 15 nm is qualified unstable when such dispersions have lost at least 30% of their transmittance at 800 nm relative to that of a stable dispersion of the same concentration.

To do this, an organic acid is added to the non-functionalized colloidal sol of magnetic nanoparticles. Preferably, a weak organic acid is used.

Indeed, an excess of phospholipids shifts the reaction equilibrium and increases the chemisorption kinetics of phospholipids at the surface of the magnetic nanoparticles. Such an excess is advantageous when this functionalization reaction is not kinetically favorable, for example when the polar phosphate head of the phospholipid molecules used is sterically hindered. The reaction time for phospholipid molecules contained in the colloidal sol is then the parameter to consider depending on the excess of phospholipid molecules. The reaction is stopped by the addition of a solvent causing nanoparticle flocculation and precipitation of the excess phospholipid molecules, such as ethanol, for example. Thus, for example, for a 2000% excess of phospholipids with a hindered polar head such as phosphatidylserine, the chemisorption time necessary for the dispersion of the magnetic nanoparticles in the oils described in the context of the invention is chosen in the interval from 5 to 30 minutes, preferably from 6 to 10 minutes, and better still from 7 to 8 minutes. According to this embodiment, the process comprises a subsequent step of eliminating the excess phospholipid molecules, for example by successive washes, preferably with a mixture of organic solvents, such as an ethanol/chloroform mixture (3:1) as well as a final step of eliminating the chloroform with ethanol.</p><p id="p-0135" num="0165">According to a second embodiment, the quantity of phospholipid molecules used is present in deficit with respect to the developed surface of the non-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles, preferably in a percentage ranging from 38% to 100% of the quantity necessary to form a monolayer saturated with phospholipid(s), and in particular ranging from 38% to less than 100%. Indeed, a deficit of phospholipid molecules allows controlling the functionalization rate of the magnetic nanoparticles by the phospholipid molecules. Such a deficit is advantageous when the functionalization reaction is kinetically very favorable, for example when the phospholipid used has an &#x2014;O(O)P(OH)O<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, M<sup>+</sup>, polar head, with M being an alkali metal atom, preferably a sodium atom.</p><p id="p-0136" num="0166">At the end of the functionalization step d, the percentage of coverage and/or the surface density of the functionalization of the magnetic nanoparticles is such as described for the functionalized magnetic nanoparticles of the biocompatible oily ferrofluid according to the invention. The conditions for the process according to the invention are adjusted by the skilled person to have such coverage percentages and/or such surface densities of functionalization.</p><p id="p-0137" num="0167">Once the functionalization of the magnetic nanoparticles has been completed, the dispersive medium of the colloidal sol and almost all of the solvent S3 of the phospholipid solution used are eliminated (step e), for example by evaporation under a flow of inert gas (nitrogen or argon) to prevent phospholipid oxidation, in order to obtain aggregates of magnetic nanoparticles functionalized by phospholipid molecules.</p><p id="p-0138" num="0168">Finally, these functionalized nanoparticles are dispersed in an oil phase comprising at least one fatty acid ester (step e).

The oil phase and the fatty acid ester are such as described for the biocompatible oily ferrofluid according to the invention. This dispersion in the colloidal form in the oil phase occurs either spontaneously at ambient temperature, or with heating to a temperature ranging from 30 to 80&#xb0; C.

In the case of phospholipids, the bulk volume of the two parts (polar and hydrophobic) is equivalent so that a lipid is a cylinder rather than a cone. It is this particular feature that allows them to assemble themselves into vesicular membranes rather than micelles. The area bulk values of phospholipids are generally between 60 and 65 &#x212b;<sup>2 </sup>depending on the environment in which they are found, alone or in a mixture, the number of unsaturations, interactions with a solid surface (supported lipid membrane) or in a liquid medium (vesicle) and different physicochemical parameters such as temperature. The reference value of a phospholipid molecule comprising an &#x2014;O(O)P(OH)O<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> phosphatidyl head ((as is the case of DOPA and DSPA) is 62 &#x212b;<sup>2 </sup>corresponding to the molecular crowding within a saturated monolayer contained in a lipid membrane. This molecular surface density value is the one found for lipid membranes (phospholipid bilayers) by considering a single monolayer. Obviously, there are slight differences when the OH function is substituted. Thus for dioleoyl phosphatidylserine, the developed molecular surface area is around 65 &#x212b;<sup>2</sup>/molecule and for dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine is generally measured between 60 and 65 &#x212b;<sup>2</sup>.

This value of 62 &#x212b;<sup>2 </sup>is used, in the context of the invention, for calculating the percentages of coverage of the surface of the nanoparticles and for calculating the surface functionalization densities in phospholipid molecules, regardless of the phospholipid envisaged.</p><p id="p-0225" num="0247">The &#x201c;nominal or theoretical coverage rate&#x201d; in phospholipid is the molar percentage represented by the quantity of lipid involved in relation to the quantity necessary to form a monolayer, calculated from the average size of the nanoparticles measured by TEM and the surface of reference of the polar head of the phospholipid used. When the nanoparticles are spheroids, it is considered that the average size of the nanoparticles measured by TEM is taken as the diameter to evaluate the average surface developed by the particles. For nanoflowers, given their surface roughness, their developed surface was estimated by repeated coatings of silica of different thickness by sol-gel route (St&#xf6;ber synthesis route). This method thus made it possible to estimate the surface area 15% greater than that of a smooth sphere of the same diameter.</p><p id="p-0226" num="0248">TGA measurements make it possible to determine the quantity of phospholipid molecules actually present on the nanoparticles per surface unit from the total mass loss measured between 200&#xb0; C. and 600&#xb0; C., from the molar mass of the organic residues decomposed during complete combustion relative to the surface developed by the nanoparticles involved.

The quality of the nanoparticle dispersions is also checked by DLS (method D1). When &#x201c;+&#x201d; appears in the tables of the examples, this means that the colloidal character is obtained by dispersing the nanoparticles in the oil phase at the corresponding temperature and that this colloidal character is still present at least 24 hours after it is obtained, the time elapsed at least between the preparation of the dispersion and the measurement of the transmittance.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">Example 1: Dispersion of the FF1, FF2 and FF3 Nanoparticles in Chloroform</heading><p id="p-0236" num="0258">The purpose of this example is to transfer the nanoparticles of the aqueous ferrofluids FF1, FF2 and FF3 into chloroform without resorting to surfactants in order to be able to perform the phospholipid grafting of by chemisorption. To do so, a volume of 1 mL of an ammonia solution (28-30%, m/m) is added to 35.4 mL of FF1 at 69 g/L in &#x3b3;&#x2014;Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The nanoparticle flocculates are decanted by means of a permanent magnet and then the supernatant is eliminated. The aggregated nanoparticles are washed twice with water. Then the aggregated nanoparticles are washed five times with ethanol. Finally, a volume of 80 mL of chloroform is added to the nanoparticles and the nanoparticles are redispersed in an ultrasound bath for 3 minutes.

For an induction time of 10 seconds, the temperature of the aqueous dispersion FF3 increases by approximately 3.5&#xb0; C. while for the same nanoparticles derived from FF3 functionalized with DOPA and dispersed in Miglyol M840&#xae;, the increase in temperature is approximately 11 to 12 times higher. The oily ferrofluids can therefore potentially make it possible to drastically reduce the treatment time under induction.</p><p id="p-0295" num="0300">Performing several heating cycles by induction demonstrates that the dispersions withstand the local temperature increase of the nanoparticles with no changes in the properties of the nanoparticles and the oil phase.

This property can prove interesting from the perspective of meeting the need to multiply magnetic-induced hyperthermia treatment sequences.</p><p id="p-0296" num="0301">The SAR values were also measured by varying the dispersion volume of nanoparticles FF3 (5 g/Kg) from 500 &#x3bc;L to 1 &#x3bc;L, in water and in oil (Miglyol M840&#xae;) from the temperature profiles represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>B and <b>7</b>C</figref>.</p><p id="p-0297" num="0302">The thermogenic power of the dispersions as well as the temperature plateau value decrease with the volume of the dispersions due to the thermal losses which become increasingly predominant with the increase in the surface area to volume ratio. For oily dispersions, the thermal losses are much lower relative to the aqueous ferrofluid due to their weaker thermal conductivity and the absence of endothermal phenomena such as evaporation. For volumes of 200 and 500 &#x3bc;L, the heating power is still as high, 9 times greater than that of aqueous dispersions, and no temperature plateau can be observed for these measurement conditions. Temperature thresholds of 85&#xb0; C. and 75&#xb0; C. are reached fairly quickly (2-3 minutes), respectively, for the volumes of 50 and 10 &#x3bc;L due to their still very high SAR values. The plateau values and especially the SAR values remain much higher, by a factor of approximately 5 to 10, than those of the aqueous dispersions of FF3. The FF3 in Miglyol M840&#xae; dispersion thus shows very high SAR values even for small volumes up to 10 &#x3bc;L.</p><p id="p-0298" num="0303">The SAR value for a volume of 1 &#x3bc;L is measured by directly depositing the ferrofluid at the tip of the sensor.

The evaporation of water manifested by a decrease in the temperature of the medium of 7&#xb0; C. is too rapid to measure the SAR of the aqueous dispersion FF3 for this volume.</p><p id="p-0299" num="0304"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> represents the kinetic temperature profile for a volume of 1 &#x3bc;L of dispersion FF3 dispersed in Miglyol M840&#xae; used for the animal experiments of thermoablation of tumours by magnetic hyperthermia presented in Example 6.

This dispersion concentrated at 300 g/L allows very rapid local temperature increases, even for very small volumes, of the order of a &#x3bc;L, which can contribute to improving the precision of the treatment in the context of thermoablations of low volume tumours.</p><heading id="h-0015" level="1">Example 5: Preparation of Nanoemulsions from the Oily Ferrofluid</heading><p id="p-0300" num="0305">The magnetic nanoparticles FF1 functionalized by DOPA obtained at point 2.1.1 fora coverage density of 1.12 molecules/nm<sup>2 </sup>are dispersed in the oil phase made up of Miglyol 840.

The different volumes were then estimated around 170&#xb1;20 mm<sup>3 </sup>depending on the specimen.</p><p id="p-0315" num="0314">Given the tumour volumes, the experiments were carried out by performing intratumoral microinjections of oily ferrofluid with an iron oxide concentration of 300 &#x3bc;g/&#x3bc;L. The oily ferrofluids were injected directly into the tumour. The injections were performed using a 10 &#x3bc;L Hamilton syringe equipped with a beveled needle (26 gauge), under isoflurane anaesthesia then the mice are placed in a heated bed under the induction coils. Only one induction treatment at 473.5 kHz and 13.36 kA.m<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>for 15 minutes was performed for each mouse.</p><p id="p-0316" num="0315">In a first experiment, an intratumoral injection of 2 &#x3bc;L of oily ferrofluid FF3 (300 &#x3bc;g/&#x3bc;L in iron oxide, i.e., a mass of 600 &#x3bc;g) is performed at a depth of 2.5 mm on a new specimen separated into two times 1 &#x3bc;L with a one-minute wait between the two injections (performed at the same injection point). At the end of the last injection, a wait time of one minute is applied again before withdrawing the needle. The thermal dose dissipated by the nanoparticles in the tumoral volume (Q<sub>V</sub>) can, in first approximation, be calculated according to the formula: Q<sub>V</sub>=m<sub>P </sub>(Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)&#xd7;SAR(1 &#x3bc;L)&#xd7;t/V<sub>tumour</sub>. Under these operating conditions, the thermal dose Q<sub>V</sub>=0.17 J/mm<sup>3</sup>. The bioluminescence and fluorescence images were produced following the injection before the induction treatment and 24 h after. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>, one area of thermoablation can be clearly observed at the center of the tumour. During the application of the alternating magnetic field, the temperature difference measured by the thermal camera was 3&#xb0; C. Tumour growth, measured by integration of bioluminescence 24 h later, is slowed. The ex vivo fluorescent images after tumour resection show the location of the ferrofluid injection area. The ex vivo bioluminescence image indicates a loss of viability of cancer cells at the site where the ferrofluid was injected (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>).</p><p id="p-0317" num="0316">In a second experiment, multiple injections of three times 1 &#x3bc;L of oily ferrofluid FF3 (300 &#x3bc;g/&#x3bc;L, i.e., a mass of 900 &#x3bc;g) were performed at a depth of 2.5 mm, distributed over three distinct sites of the tumour (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>). A wait time of one minute was applied before withdrawing the needle for each injection. Under these operating conditions, the thermal dose Q<sub>V</sub>=0.25 J/mm<sup>3</sup>. 24 h after the application of the alternating magnetic field (&#x394;T&#x2248;20&#xb0; C.), the tumour ablation areas in the vicinity of the ferrofluid injection areas can be easily distinguished.
