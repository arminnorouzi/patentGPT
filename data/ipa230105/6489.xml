FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates to the electric and mechanical field, and particularly relates to a rotor core and a motor including the rotor core.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. BACKGROUND</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Axial flux motors are different from general motors. The axial flux motors each have an axial direction as a magnetic flux direction, and a stator and a rotor core that are formed in a disk type. The axial flux motors have advantages such as compact structure, small volume, light weight, and high torque density.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typical radial flux type motors are often designed such that a magnet is incorporated to achieve both high performance and high efficiency while the number of magnets to be used is reduced in response to demand for large power or large dimensions. Unfortunately, the axial flux motors are rarely designed to incorporate a magnet due to a difference in magnetic flux direction from general radial flux motors and limitation by a manufacturing method.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although some axial flux motors designed to incorporate magnets are currently available, the magnets are typically disposed in a circumferential direction in these designed motors.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It should be noted that the above introduction to the technical background merely serves to facilitate understanding of those skilled in the art while helping to provide a clearer and more complete description of the technical idea of the present disclosure. The foregoing technical manners described in the technical background section of the present application should not be simply considered to be publicly known to those skilled in the art.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Unfortunately, these conventional designs have one or more of problems as follows: a rotor has a complicated structure; another mechanical structure for maintaining rigidity of the rotor is required; magnets need to be gathered one by one in a manufacturing process; a cumulative error is likely to occur, and thus a complete rotor cannot be formed; and the axial flux motor has a three-dimensional (3D) structure, and thus a phenomenon of magnetic flux leakage still occurs around magnetic pole surfaces of the magnets.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure provides example embodiments of a rotor core and a motor including the rotor core. When a rotor yoke according to a preferred embodiment of the present disclosure is provided with magnetic pole core groups in a circumferential direction and each magnetic pole core group includes a magnetic conductor at its center and permanent magnets around the magnetic conductor, the structure becomes compact and reliable as a whole such that another mechanical structure to maintain rigidity of the rotor is not required. Methods for manufacturing magnetic pole core groups according to other example embodiments of the present invention facilitate mass production and manufacturing without causing a cumulative error in manufacturing and assembly. The center of each magnetic pole core group is defined by the magnetic conductor, so that the number of magnets to be used can be reduced at the maximum to achieve low cost. Then, the permanent magnets around the magnetic conductor enables increasing magnetic flux concentration effect while preventing magnetic flux leakage. Thus, both high efficiency and high performance of the motor can be achieved.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure provides example embodiments of rotor cores and a motors including the rotor cores, in each of which a rotor yoke is provided with magnetic pole core groups in a circumferential direction and each magnetic pole core group includes a permanent magnet at its center and permanent magnets around this permanent magnet, so that structure becomes compact and reliable as a whole, and thus another mechanical structure to maintain rigidity of the rotor is not required. The method for manufacturing the magnetic pole core groups facilitates mass production and manufacturing without causing a cumulative error in manufacturing and assembly. Both the center and the periphery of each magnetic pole core group are defined by the permanent magnets, so that the magnetic flux concentration effect can be increased while magnetic flux leakage is prevented. Thus, high efficiency and high performance of the motor can be ensured to the maximum.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">A first example embodiment of the present disclosure provides a rotor core including a rotor yoke including silicon steel sheets stacked in an axial direction of the rotor yoke and magnetic pole core groups accommodated in respective accommodation holes in the rotor yoke in a circumferential direction of the rotor yoke.
