The motive power of the motor <b>15</b> is transmitted to the output shaft <b>21</b>. More specifically, the transmission mechanism <b>18</b> transmits the motive power of the motor <b>15</b> to the output shaft <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The output shaft <b>21</b> is a part that rotates upon receiving the driving force transmitted from the motor <b>15</b> via the transmission mechanism <b>18</b>. The socket <b>23</b> is fixed to the output shaft <b>21</b>. The tip tool <b>28</b> is attached removably to the socket <b>23</b>. The tip tool <b>28</b> rotates along with the output shaft <b>21</b>. The electric tool system <b>1</b> is designed to rotate the tip tool <b>28</b> by turning the output shaft <b>21</b> with the driving force applied by the motor <b>15</b>. That is to say, the electric tool system <b>1</b> is a tool for driving the tip tool <b>28</b> with the driving force applied by the motor <b>15</b>. The tip tool <b>28</b> (also called a &#x201c;bit&#x201d;) may be a screwdriver bit or a drill bit, for example.

The thread portion <b>303</b> has a thread thereon.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">The tip tool <b>28</b> fits the fastening member <b>30</b>. That is to say, the tip tool <b>28</b> is inserted into the screw hole on the head portion <b>301</b> of the fastening member <b>30</b>. In this state, the tip tool <b>28</b> is caused to rotate by being driven by the motor <b>15</b>, thereby turning the fastening member <b>30</b>.

The drive shaft <b>22</b> is connected to the planetary gear mechanism <b>25</b> and the impact mechanism <b>17</b>. The planetary gear mechanism <b>25</b> reduces the rotational power of the rotary shaft <b>16</b> of the motor <b>15</b> at a predetermined reduction ratio and outputs the rotational power thus reduced as the rotational power of the drive shaft <b>22</b>.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">The impact mechanism <b>17</b> is coupled to the output shaft <b>21</b>. The impact mechanism <b>17</b> transmits the rotational power (of the rotary shaft <b>16</b>) of the motor <b>15</b>, which has been received via the planetary gear mechanism <b>25</b> and the drive shaft <b>22</b>, to the output shaft <b>21</b>. In addition, the impact mechanism <b>17</b> also performs an impact operation of applying impacting force to the output shaft <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The impact mechanism <b>17</b> includes a hammer <b>19</b>, an anvil <b>20</b>, and a spring <b>24</b>. The hammer <b>19</b> is attached to the drive shaft <b>22</b> via a cam mechanism. The anvil <b>20</b> is in contact with, and rotates along with, the hammer <b>19</b>. The spring <b>24</b> biases the hammer <b>19</b> toward the anvil <b>20</b>. The anvil <b>20</b> is formed integrally with the output shaft <b>21</b>. Alternatively, the anvil <b>20</b> may also be formed separately from, and be fixed to, the output shaft <b>21</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Unless a load (torque) with a predetermined magnitude or more is applied to the output shaft <b>21</b>, the impact mechanism <b>17</b> causes the output shaft <b>21</b> to turn continuously with the rotational power of the motor <b>15</b>. That is to say, in that case, the drive shaft <b>22</b> and the hammer <b>19</b> that are coupled to each other via the cam mechanism rotate along with each other and the hammer <b>19</b> and the anvil <b>20</b> also rotate with each other. Thus, the output shaft <b>21</b> formed integrally with the anvil <b>20</b> rotates.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">On the other hand, upon the application of a load with a predetermined magnitude or more to the output shaft <b>21</b>, the impact mechanism <b>17</b> performs an impact operation. In performing the impact operation, the impact mechanism <b>17</b> generates impacting force by transforming the rotational power of the motor <b>15</b> into pulses of torque. That is to say, while the impact operation is being performed, the hammer <b>19</b> retreats by overcoming the biasing force applied by the spring <b>24</b> (i.e., goes away from the anvil <b>20</b>) while being regulated by the cam mechanism between the drive shaft <b>22</b> and the hammer <b>19</b> itself. At a point in time when the hammer <b>19</b> retreats to be decoupled from the anvil <b>20</b>, the hammer <b>19</b> starts advancing (i.e., toward the output shaft <b>21</b>) while rotating, thereby applying impacting force to the anvil <b>20</b> in the rotational direction and causing the output shaft <b>21</b> to rotate. That is to say, the impact mechanism <b>17</b> applies rotational impact around the axis (output shaft <b>21</b>) to the output shaft <b>21</b> via the anvil <b>20</b>. While the impact mechanism <b>17</b> is performing the impact operation, the hammer <b>19</b> repeatedly performs the operation of applying impacting force to the anvil <b>20</b> in the rotational direction. Every time the hammer <b>19</b> advances and retreats, the impacting force is generated.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">The trigger switch <b>29</b> is an operating member for accepting the operation of controlling the rotation of the motor <b>15</b>. The motor <b>15</b> may be selectively activated (turned ON or OFF) by the operation of pulling the trigger switch <b>29</b>. In addition, the rotational velocity of the motor <b>15</b> is adjustable depending on the manipulative variable of the operation of pulling the trigger switch <b>29</b> (i.e., depending on how deep the trigger switch <b>29</b> is pulled). As a result, the rotational velocity of the output shaft <b>21</b> is adjustable depending on the manipulative variable of the operation of pulling the trigger switch <b>29</b>.
