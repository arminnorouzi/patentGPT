Invention" end="lead"?><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This non-provisional application claims priority to and the benefit of Italian Patent Application no. No. 102021000016733 filed Jun. 25, 2021, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p><p id="p-0003" num="0002">The subject of the invention is hair-straightening compositions in liquid form with an aqueous base, or in the form of an emulsion with a fatty phase, comprising glyoxylic acid and levulinic acid.</p><heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIOR ART</heading><p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the field of cosmetic products for the hair treatment, straightening agents, which are able to vary the shape of the hair from curly/wavy to straight, occupy substantial shares of the market.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">One of the major problems with hair-straightening compounds is that they are highly aggressive towards the hair.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The disulphide bonds (&#x2014;S&#x2014;S&#x2014;) of keratin fibre help to maintain the natural smooth or curly configuration of the hair. Said bonds are formed by oxidation of the thiol groups of two cysteines, with the formation of a cystine molecule. The remodelling of said bonds permanently modifies the shape of the hair. The hair structure can also be modified semi-permanently, by using chemical agents able to bond covalently to the keratin fibres.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Four general methods are currently used to reshape the hair:</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">1: Permanent Straightening With Reducing Agents</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">This method involves reduction of cystine to cysteine, followed by reconfiguration of the hair fibres and re-formation of cystine by oxidation. Thiol compounds such as ammonium thioglycolate are used as reducing agents. Hydrogen peroxide is generally used for the oxidation stage. One of the drawbacks of reducing agents is that they weaken the hair structure. The reasons are: 1) formation of lanthionine during the reduction stage because of the alkaline pH; 2) formation of cysteic acid during the oxidation stage; 3) reduction of tensile properties due to transverse swelling and longitudinal contraction effects on the hair during treatment.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">2: Permanent Straightening With Alkaline Agents</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010">This method involves the use of strong bases, generally alkaline earth metal hydroxides, to modify the disulphide bridges (&#x2014;S&#x2014;S&#x2014;) irreversibly with the formation of lanthionine (&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;S&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;) and lysinoalanine. Unlike the disulphide bridge, responsible for the tenacity of the hair, the lanthionine bond considerably weakens the hair structure. The irreversible transformation of the cystine residues makes it impossible to perform a subsequent treatment to change the shape of the hair again.</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011">The most commonly used base is sodium hydroxide, in compositions at pH 12-14, a very aggressive treatment for both the scalp and the hair, which are irreparably damaged. In addition to lanthionine formation, hydrolysis of the peptide and isopeptide bonds may take place. There is also massive loss of the lipid component of the cuticle. At the end of treatment, the hair is extremely dry and fragile, and the use of leave-on conditioning products is required to improve combability, reduce the static effect and protect the hair cuticle.</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012">3: Semi-Permanent Straightening Based on Formaldehyde</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013">Semi-permanent hair straightening, also known as Brazilian straightening, is a method for straightening the hair effectively with the combined use of a formaldehyde-based product and a hair iron. Formaldehyde (or compounds that release it) creates new bonds in the polypeptide structure, forming inter-chain crosslinks and enabling the straightening induced by the iron to be maintained. The typical concentration of formaldehyde used in such types of straightener ranges from 5 to 10% w/w. The straightening process is promoted by removal of water during the drying stage, and by the heat supplied by the iron. Due to the volatility of the molecule, a considerable amount of formaldehyde evaporates during the treatment. The use of formaldehyde has been regulated, and its maximum concentration was set at 0.2% v/v because of its strong irritant potential towards the eyes and respiratory mucosa, and its classification as a carcinogen in 2004. Formaldehyde-based straighteners can therefore no longer be used.</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014">4: Semi-Permanent Straightening With Carboxylic Acids</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015">To obviate all the drawbacks of the methods described above, the use of carboxylic acids of formula RCOCOOH (wherein R&#x2550;H, alkyl), especially glyoxylic acid and/or pyruvic acid, has been proposed.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016">The action mechanism of glyoxylic acid (similar to that of formaldehyde) and the structure-activity correlations were described by Boga C. et al. in &#x201c;International Journal of Cosmetic Science, 2014, 36, 459-470.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">To perform a straightening effect, the amount of glyoxylic acid present in the composition must be at least 5% w/w, but effective, lasting straightening is only obtained at concentrations of 10-20% w/w of the total weight of the composition. The straightening performance sometimes fails to meet expectations. In particular, the combability of the hair after treatment is often unsatisfactory and the hair remains rather frizzy, especially in the case of level 4 curly hair (&#x201c;very curly&#x201d; on the scale devised by De La Mettrie et al., Hum. Biol. 2007, 79, 265-281).</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is important to note that treatment with a semi-permanent straightener at a highly acid pH gives rise to a colour change and/or colour fading in both natural hair and already dyed hair. This problem sometimes leads to dissatisfaction, and the need to perform a supplementary tonalising treatment.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">WO2015094788 describes a method designed to give form to a fibrous material like hair, using an active agent, a photocatalyst and electromagnetic radiation. Levulinic acid is listed among the active agents.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">WO2013092959 describes a hair-straightening treatment involving the use of a) one or more liquid fatty substances, b) one or more surfactants, and c) one or more dicarbonyl compounds other than a). The preferred dicarbonyl compounds are alpha-keto acids such as glyoxylic acid and pyruvic acid. Levulinic acid is also mentioned, but no example of a composition containing it is provided. Ingredients a) and b) are contained in an inverse emulsion (water-in-oil), while ingredient c) is in a separate composition. The fatty phase contained in the straightening compositions in emulsion tends to produce a considerable amount of smoke during the passage of the hot iron, so that hair needs to be rinsed before ironing, leading to a reduction in straightening performance.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">JP2019123701 describes a hair treatment composition at pH 1.5-3 containing 13-30 mass% of levulinic acid and 1-2 mass % of glyoxylic acid, so that the total content of levulinic acid and glyoxylic acid is at least 15%. According to the inventor, the small percentage of glyoxylic acid prevents fading of the cosmetic colour present on the hair, and the composition provides sufficient straightening. However, the patent does not mention the duration of said straightening effect following subsequent washes, and there is no mention of an efficient, persistent/semi-permanent straightening effect.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention aims to develop a straightening composition that ensures efficient, lasting hair straightening. The invention also aims to reduce frizziness to a lasting extent, even on the most difficult curls, and to make the hair not only more manageable during treatment, but also easily combed and soft after treatment.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0024" num="0023">It has surprisingly been found that by combining glyoxylic acid with levulinic acid in suitable ratios, a straightening effect is obtained which is better and more lasting than that obtainable with the straighteners on the market which only contain glyoxylic acid. An improvement is also obtained in terms of combability and softness, with a reduction in frizziness even after several washes.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</heading><p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows two representative images showing the photos after processing.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows that at time zero, formula B improves frizziness by nearly 10% compared to reference formula E.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows frizzy hair effect after washing.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows that at the end of straightening of the locks, formula A exhibited better compatibility on dry and on wet hair.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows that at the end of straightening of the locks, formula B exhibited better compatibility on dry and on wet hair.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a representative example of the straightening efficacy.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows the straightening power of the formulas containing levulinic acid.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows locks representative of each experimental group.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><p id="p-0033" num="0032">A first subject of the invention therefore relates to semi-permanent hair straightening compositions in liquid form with an aqueous base, or in the form of an emulsion with a fatty phase, comprising 15 to 20% by weight of glyoxylic acid and 0.1 to 5% by weight of levulinic acid.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">&#x201c;Semi-permanent straightening composition&#x201d; here means a composition able to maintain the straightening effect for up to three months (Boga C et al., &#x201c;Formaldehyde replacement with glyoxylic acid in semi-permanent hair straightening: a new and multidisciplinary investigation&#x201d; in International Journal of Cosmetic Science, 2014, 36, 459-470).</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">The compositions according to the invention, in liquid form with an aqueous base or in the form of an emulsion with a fatty phase (fatty alcohols, fatty acids and the esters thereof), not exceeding 15% by weight (unless otherwise specified, in the present description the percentages by weight are percentages in relation to the total weight of the composition), comprise glyoxylic acid and levulinic acid.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">Said compositions give rise to an efficient, persistent straightening effect, and also reduce frizziness.

This test simulates the various environmental factors that cause keratin fibre to regain its original shape in time. In practice, it simulates the return of the curl after 4 months' washing 3 times a week. The locks are immersed in a hermetically sealed container containing a solution of tapwater+4ml/L Keratin Therapy Lisse Design Maintenance Shampoo. The container is then placed in a stove at 45&#xb0; C. for accelerated washing lasting 96 hours. The locks are photographed at the end of the cycle. The photos are then processed with the Image J program. The images are processed with a pre-set macro, and a grid is overlaid on each photo. Using the &#x201c;multi-point&#x201d; function of the program, a point is marked at each intersection between the columns of the grid and the lock.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a representative example of this processing. The data of each point on the y-axes are then acquired. The greater the curvature of the lock, the wider will be the distribution of said values.

However, if the percentage of levulinic acid is increased at the expense of the glyoxylic acid content, as described in JP2019123701 (formulas G and H), straightening power is lost, to a level which is unacceptable for a semi-permanent professional treatment.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0000"><tables id="TABLE-US-00007" num="00007"><table frame="none" colsep="0" rowsep="0"><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="56pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="84pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="77pt" align="center"/><thead><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" rowsep="1">TABLE 7</entry></row></thead><tbody valign="top"><row><entry namest="1" nameend="3" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>Pre-treatment</entry><entry>Time zero</entry><entry>96 h washing at 45&#xb0; C.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup><tgroup align="left" colsep="0" rowsep="0" cols="8"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="3" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="5" colwidth="35pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="6" colwidth="21pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="7" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><colspec colname="8" colwidth="28pt" align="center"/><tbody valign="top"><row><entry/><entry>Wave </entry><entry>Wave </entry><entry/><entry/><entry>Wave </entry><entry/><entry/></row><row><entry>Formula</entry><entry>(mm)</entry><entry>(mm)</entry><entry>SD</entry><entry>%</entry><entry>(mm)</entry><entry>SD</entry><entry>%</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row><row><entry>E (ref.)</entry><entry>5.53</entry><entry>1.25</entry><entry>0.43</entry><entry/><entry>4.16</entry><entry>0.86</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>A</entry><entry>5.53</entry><entry>1.05</entry><entry>0.25</entry><entry>&#x2212;15.72</entry><entry>3.96</entry><entry>0.64</entry><entry>&#x2212;4.70</entry></row><row><entry>B</entry><entry>5.53</entry><entry>1.06</entry><entry>0.21</entry><entry>&#x2212;14.99</entry><entry>3.48</entry><entry>0.85</entry><entry>&#x2212;16.41</entry></row><row><entry>C</entry><entry>5.53</entry><entry>1.03</entry><entry>0.23</entry><entry>&#x2212;20.77</entry><entry>2.86</entry><entry>0.74</entry><entry>&#x2212;31.26</entry></row><row><entry>G</entry><entry>5.53</entry><entry>5.12</entry><entry>1.17</entry><entry/><entry>5.42</entry><entry>0.57</entry><entry/></row><row><entry>H</entry><entry>5.53</entry><entry>4.97</entry><entry>0.49</entry><entry/><entry>5.53</entry><entry>0.99</entry></row><row><entry namest="1" nameend="8" align="center" rowsep="1"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></tables></p><p id="p-0095" num="0106">In conclusion, the data demonstrate that levulinic acid improves the frizziness of hair, the maximum effect being provided by formula B, containing 2.5% levulinic acid.
