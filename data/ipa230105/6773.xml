In order to meet different performance requirements of various application scenarios, the 3rd Generation Partner Project (3GPP) Radio Access Network (RAN) #72 plenary decided to conduct the study of New Radio (NR), or what is called fifth Generation (5G). The work Item (WI) of NR was approved at the 3GPP RAN #75 session to standardize the NR.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the emergence of small data services, the 3GPP has started development of standards and the work of researches under NR at the 3GPP RAN #86 conference. The services of small or sparse data include two major types: applications in smart phones and applications in non-intelligent handsets. Applications in smart phones provide instant messaging services, like whatsapp, QQ and wechat, and cardiac pacemaker and life maintenance service, as well as push notification; while applications in non-smart phones include services of wearables (e.g., periodic positioning information, etc.), sensors (e.g., periodically- or event-triggered temperature, pressure report) and intelligent instrument.</p><heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The NR Release-16 system introduced the procedure of 2-Step Random Access Channel (2-Step RACH). A Message A (MsgA) in the 2-step random access procedure comprises a PRACH preamble and a PUSCH payload, where the PRACH preamble is transmitted on a RACH Occasion (RO) while the PUSCH payload is transmitted on a PUSCH Occasion (PO), occupying a PUSCH Resource Unit (PRU). The PRACH preamble and PRU in the MsgA are independently configured, and for some conflicts of resources, part of the PRACH preamble and part of the PRU are null. The associated mapping between the PRACH preamble and PRU in the MsgA is determined implicitly, which results in some part of the PRACH preamble having no corresponding PRU linkage. When a User Equipment (UE) always chooses a PRACH preamble without PRU being associated, the PUSCH payload cannot be transmitted in the MsgA, as a result, the UE is actually working in a 4-step random access procedure, and cannot ensure that the demand for access delay is satisfied.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">To address the above issue, the present application provides a mechanism of transmitting random access preamble to avoid the situation in which the UE always selects a random access preamble without associated PRU, thus guaranteeing the normal performance of random access of the UE. It should be noted that if no conflict is incurred, embodiments in a User Equipment (UE) in the present application and the characteristics of the embodiments are also applicable to a base station, and vice versa. What's more, the embodiments in the present application and the characteristics in the embodiments can be arbitrarily combined if there is no conflict. Further, though originally targeted at random access, the present application also applies to Beam Failure Recovery.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, though originally targeted at the Uplink, the present application also applies to the Sidelink. Further, though originally targeted at single-carrier communications, the present application also applies to multi-carrier communications. Further, though originally targeted at single-antenna communications, the present application also applies to multi-antenna communications. Further, the present application is designed targeting terminal-base station scenario, but can be applied to V2X communications, terminal-relay communications as well as relay-base station communications, where similar technical effects can be achieved. Additionally, the adoption of a unified solution for various scenarios, including but not limited to V2X scenario and terminal-base station communications, contributes to the reduction of hardcore complexity and costs.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">It should be noted that interpretations of the Terminology in the present application refer to definitions given in 3GPP TS36, TS37 and TS38, but also to those given in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) protocol specifications.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present application provides a method in a first node for
