Comparing with other types of coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 shares 76-95% protein similarity with SARS-CoV and 29-46% protein similarity with MERSCoV. Despite the striking similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the latter has a 10% case fatality rate.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped coronavirus, belonging to the Coronaviridae family of viruses, and is genetically close to SARS-CoV (&#x2dc;80% sequence similarity) and bat coronavirus RaTG13 (96.2%). The envelope of SARS-CoV-2 is coated by the spike (S) glycoprotein, a small envelope (E) glycoprotein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and several putative accessory proteins. The SARS-CoV-2 mediates its entry into the host cell using the 51 sub-unit of the S glycoprotein by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. However, viral entry into the host cells requires not only binding to the ACE2 receptor, but also priming of the S protein by a transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) via cleavage of the S protein at S1/S2 sites. This cleavage is very crucial for the virus-host cell membrane fusion and cell entry. Following viral replication, assembly, and release, the infected host cells undergo pyroptosis, thus, releasing Damage- Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs are then recognised by surrounding macrophages and monocytes that respond to viral infection by inducing cytokine storm. However, in some cases, an impaired or dysregulated immune response can also occur, causing an Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to develop, there is an urgent need for development of a new therapy strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It was unexpectedly found in the invention that a recombinant fragment of human surfactant protein D (called as &#x201c;rfhSP-D&#x201d; hereinafter) can interfere with the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor.

Interaction of rfhSP-D and Recombinant Human Full-Length SP-D (hFL-SP-D) With 51 Protein and Its RBD</p><p id="p-0058" num="0057">In SARS-CoV, S-protein is the predominant surface glycoprotein recognized by the host innate immune system. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has almost 76% identity to SARS-CoV. Previous studies indicated that SP-D bound S protein of SARS-CoV which required Ca<sup>2+</sup>; the binding was inhibited by maltose. Therefore, the first part of this study was aimed at examining the interaction of LPS-free rfhSP-D and hFL-SP-D with spike protein (Si) using direct binding ELISA. It was found that rfhSP-D/hFL-SP-D bound SARS-CoV-2 Si protein in a dose-dependent manner (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>); this interaction was inhibited by maltose and EDTA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>). Among varied concentrations of rfhSP-D tested, a strong and maximum binding of rfhSP-D with SARS-CoV-2 S1 (5 &#x3bc;g/ml ) was observed at 10 &#x3bc;g/ml. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to its cellular receptor, ACE2, is mediated by the RBD region of the S protein. A higher binding affinity has been reported for RBD of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptor compared to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, RBD of SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested to have a crucial role in spike protein-induced viral attachment, fusion, and entry into the host cells. In this context, this study was also aimed at determining the ability of rfhSP-D/hFL-SP-D to bind RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) via direct ELISA (RBD coated, incubated with two-fold dilutions of rfhSP-D (100 &#x3bc;g/ml ), and probed with anti-SP-D antibody; R&#x26;D Systems). rfhSP-D bound RBD in a dose-dependent manner. It reduced the binding affinity by maltose, but chelation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by EDTA did not significantly affect the interaction between rfhSP-D and RBD region (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>). No rfhSP-D binding was observed in the absence of RBD, indicating a lack of non-specific interaction in this assay. To further evaluate the dose response of Maltose and EDTA (5, 10 and 20 mM), rfhSP-D was coated and probed with Si and RBD (at 2.5 and 5 &#x3bc;g/ml) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>).

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviral particles were produced as a safe strategy to study the involvement of Si glycoprotein in the recognition and neutralization of the virus by a varied concentration of rfhSP-D. The production of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with envelope protein Si was carried out by co-transfecting HEK293T cells with plasmid containing the coding sequence of the indicated pcDNA3.1-nCoV-SD18 (SARS-CoV-2 spike gene), pLAS2w.Fluc.Ppuro, and pCMV-DR8.91.

It Given the findings in the invention that the peptide rfhSP-D acts as an entry inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and is a potent innate immune molecule present in the lung surfactant, the peptide rfhSP-D is expected to play an important protective role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.</p><p id="p-0062" num="0061">It was confirmed in the invention that tge affinity purified, and LPS-free rfhSP-D interacted with S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its receptor binding domain (RBD) in a dose-dependent manner akin to the recombinant hFL-SP-D. It was suggested in the example of inhibition of rfhSP-D binding to S protein by EDTA or maltose that the rfhSP-D bound to the carbohydrate moieties on S protein of SARS-CoV-2. It wasalso examined whether the rfhSP-D treatment can inhibit the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S1 with ACE2 receptor on HEK293T cells. The SARSCoV-2 S1 protein (5 &#x3bc;g/ml ), pre-incubated with a varied concentration of rfhSP-D (0.625-10 &#x3bc;g/ml ), showed reduced binding to HEK293T cells overexpressing ACE2 receptor in a dose-dependent manner.</p><p id="p-0063" num="0062">Targeting viral entry into a host cell is an emerging approach for designing and developing anti-viral therapies as viral propagation can be either restricted or blocked at an early stage of viral cycle, diminishing drug resistance by released viral particles. In the invention, the entry inhibitor role of rfhSP-D against SARS-CoV-2 was examined by luciferase reporter assay. Pseudotyped lentiviral particles were generated as a safe alternative method to mimic the structural surface of SARSCoV-2, and to test whether rfhSP-D treatment can promote or prevent viral entry into the host cells. Approximately 0.5 RLU fold reduction was seen with rfhSP-D (5 or 10 &#x3bc;g/ml ) treatment when compared to untreated sample (1 RLU fold; Cells+SARSCoV-2). A significantly reduced luminescent signal following rfhSP-D treatment indicated that the interaction of rfhSP-D with SARS-CoV-2-S1 restricted the binding and entry of the virus, suggestive of an entry inhibitory role of rfhSP-D against SARSCoV-2 infection.</p><p id="p-0064" num="0063">SARS-CoV-2 mediated lung injury is correlated with diffuse alveolar damage and air space oedema, thus, accompanied by interstitial infiltration of inflammatory cells, triggering of coagulation, and fibrin deposition. Potential biomarkers to be considered during SARS infection include increased levels of inflammatory plasma makers, coagulation, and fibrinolysis. Damage to the alveolar epithelial barrier is a characteristic feature of an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI); levels of plasma surfactant proteins such as SP-A and SP-D may have a prognostic value. Thus, this study prompts further investigation into the role of pulmonary surfactant in COVID-19.</p><p id="p-0065" num="0064">In summary, the peptide rfhSP-D, containing homotrimeric neck and CRD regions, acts as an entry inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection by restricting the viral entry intoHEK293T cells overexpressing ACE2 receptor. Time is ripe for taking the knowledge about the involvement of rfhSP-D and its associated anti-viral effects forward to develop a novel therapeutic approach to target multiple cellular signaling pathways. The mechanisms which enable rfhSP-D to trigger anti-viral effect are virus-specific due to the differential effect and variation in terms of the cell types and putative receptors. There is a clear therapeutic potential of rfhSP-D against SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="p-0066" num="0065">All publications, patents, and patent documents cited herein above are incorporated by reference herein, as though individually incorporated by reference.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">The invention has been described with reference to various specific and preferred embodiments and techniques.
