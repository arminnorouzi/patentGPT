Invention" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading><p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application relates to wireless communication systems, including configuring a search space set for the communication of downlink control information (DCI).</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">INTRODUCTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Wireless communications systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication content such as voice, video, packet data, messaging, broadcast, and so on. These systems may be capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (e.g., time, frequency, and power). A wireless multiple-access communications system may include a number of base stations (BSs), each simultaneously supporting communications for multiple communication devices, which may be otherwise known as user equipment (UE).</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">To meet the growing demands for expanded mobile broadband connectivity, wireless communication technologies are advancing from the long term evolution (LTE) technology to a next generation new radio (NR) technology, which may be referred to as 5<sup>th </sup>Generation (5G). For example, NR is designed to provide a lower latency, a higher bandwidth or a higher throughput, and a higher reliability than LTE. NR is designed to operate over a wide array of spectrum bands, for example, from low-frequency bands below about 1 gigahertz (GHz) and mid-frequency bands from about 1 GHz to about 6 GHz, to high-frequency bands such as millimeter wave (mmWave) bands. NR is also designed to operate across different spectrum types, from licensed spectrum to unlicensed and shared spectrum. Spectrum sharing enables operators to opportunistically aggregate spectrums to dynamically support high-bandwidth services. Spectrum sharing can extend the benefit of NR technologies to operating entities that may not have access to a licensed spectrum. Additionally, NR-Lite or NR-Light technology can be designed to address cases such as internet of things (IoT) applications.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a wireless communication network, a base station (BS) may transmit downlink control information (DCI) to user equipment (UE) on a downlink channel, where the DCI may be used to schedule the communication of uplink and downlink data. The UE may monitor a search space (SS), which includes physical resources such as time and frequency domain(s), in order to detect a downlink channel carrying DCI. In monitoring for DCI, a UE may be configured to search within time domain patterns, within common or UE-specific search space(s), and for various DCI formats.</p><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF SOME EXAMPLES</heading><p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following summarizes some aspects of the present disclosure to provide a basic understanding of the discussed technology.

The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the various concepts. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that these concepts may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and components are shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring such concepts.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">This disclosure relates generally to wireless communications systems, also referred to as wireless communications networks. In various embodiments, the techniques and apparatus may be used for wireless communication networks such as code division multiple access (CDMA) networks, time division multiple access (TDMA) networks, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) networks, orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA) networks, single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) networks, LTE networks, Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) networks, 5<sup>th </sup>Generation (5G) or new radio (NR) networks, as well as other communications networks. As described herein, the terms &#x201c;networks&#x201d; and &#x201c;systems&#x201d; may be used interchangeably.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">An OFDMA network may implement a radio technology such as evolved UTRA (E-UTRA), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11, IEEE 802.16, IEEE 802.20, flash-OFDM and the like. UTRA, E-UTRA, and GSM are part of universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS). In particular, long term evolution (LTE) is a release of UMTS that uses E-UTRA. UTRA, E-UTRA, GSM, UMTS and LTE are described in documents provided from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project&#x201d; (3GPP), and cdma2000 is described in documents from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project 2&#x201d; (3GPP2). These various radio technologies and standards are known or are being developed. For example, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is a collaboration between groups of telecommunications associations that aims to define a globally applicable third generation (3G) mobile phone specification. 3GPP long term evolution (LTE) is a 3GPP project which was aimed at improving the UMTS mobile phone standard. The 3GPP may define specifications for the next generation of mobile networks, mobile systems, and mobile devices. The present disclosure is concerned with the evolution of wireless technologies from LTE, 4G, 5G, NR, and beyond with shared access to wireless spectrum between networks using a collection of new and different radio access technologies or radio air interfaces.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">In particular, 5G networks contemplate diverse deployments, diverse spectrum, and diverse services and devices that may be implemented using an OFDM-based unified, air interface. In order to achieve these goals, further enhancements to LTE and LTE-A are considered in addition to development of the new radio technology for 5G NR networks. The 5G NR will be capable of scaling to provide coverage (1) to a massive Internet of things (IoTs) with a ultra-high density (e.g., &#x2dc;1M nodes/km<sup>2</sup>), ultra-low complexity (e.g., &#x2dc;10 s of bits/sec), ultra-low energy (e.g., &#x2dc;10+ years of battery life), and deep coverage with the capability to reach challenging locations; (2) including mission-critical control with strong security to safeguard sensitive personal, financial, or classified information, ultra-high reliability (e.g., &#x2dc;0.99.9999% reliability), ultra-low latency (e.g., &#x2212;1 ms), and users with wide ranges of mobility or lack thereof; and (3) with enhanced mobile broadband including extreme high capacity (e.g., &#x2dc;10 Tbps/km<sup>2</sup>), extreme data rates (e.g., multi-Gbps rate, 100+ Mbps user experienced rates), and deep awareness with advanced discovery and optimizations.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The 5G NR may be implemented to use optimized OFDM-based waveforms with scalable numerology and transmission time interval (TTI); having a common, flexible framework to efficiently multiplex services and features with a dynamic, low-latency time division duplex (TDD)/frequency division duplex (FDD) design; and with advanced wireless technologies, such as massive multiple input, multiple output (MIMO), robust millimeter wave (mmWave) transmissions, advanced channel coding, and device-centric mobility. Scalability of the numerology in 5G NR, with scaling of subcarrier spacing, may efficiently address operating diverse services across diverse spectrum and diverse deployments. For example, in various outdoor and macro coverage deployments of less than 3 GHz FDD/TDD implementations, subcarrier spacing may occur with 15 kHz, for example over 5, 10, 20 MHz, and the like bandwidth (BW). For other various outdoor and small cell coverage deployments of TDD greater than 3 GHz, subcarrier spacing may occur with 30 kHz over 80/100 MHz BW. For other various indoor wideband implementations, using a TDD over the unlicensed portion of the 5 GHz band, the subcarrier spacing may occur with 60 kHz over a 160 MHz BW. Finally, for various deployments transmitting with mmWave components at a TDD of 28 GHz, subcarrier spacing may occur with 120 kHz over a 500 MHz BW.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The scalable numerology of the 5G NR facilitates scalable TTI for diverse latency and quality of service (QoS) requirements. For example, shorter TTI may be used for low latency and high reliability, while longer TTI may be used for higher spectral efficiency. The efficient multiplexing of long and short TTIs to allow transmissions to start on symbol boundaries. 5G NR also contemplates a self-contained integrated subframe design with UL/downlink scheduling information, data, and acknowledgement in the same subframe. The self-contained integrated subframe supports communications in unlicensed or contention-based shared spectrum, adaptive UL/downlink that may be flexibly configured on a per-cell basis to dynamically switch between UL and downlink to meet the current traffic needs.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Various other aspects and features of the disclosure are further described below. It should be apparent that the teachings herein may be embodied in a wide variety of forms and that any specific structure, function, or both being disclosed herein is merely representative and not limiting. Based on the teachings herein one of an ordinary level of skill in the art should appreciate that an aspect disclosed herein may be implemented independently of any other aspects and that two or more of these aspects may be combined in various ways.

Furthermore, an aspect may comprise at least one element of a claim.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a wireless communication network, a UE may receive DCI transmitted from a BS on a downlink channel(s). DCI may be transmitted on a physical downlink channel, such as a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH). In some aspects, a UE may be configured to detect the transmission of PDCCH carrying DCI by monitoring a search space (SS), which can include certain downlink physical resources. For instance, a UE may be configured to search within certain resources in time and frequency domain(s).</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">A UE may be configured with parameters for monitoring a SS for DCI. In some aspects, a UE may be configured to search within a time domain pattern (e.g., time periods such as symbols), aggregation level (e.g., indicating the amount of physical resources allocated for a PDCCH), and number of candidates (e.g., number of PDCCH(s) that are candidates for carrying DCI). Further, one or more SSs may be configured within the frequency range of a CORESET that is configured for a UE. A UE may be further configured to search within a common search space (CSS) or a UE-specific search space (USS). A CSS may be a search space that a group of UEs or all UEs in a cell monitor to detect PDCCH carrying DCI such as scheduling information for system information blocks (SIBs). A CSS may also carry signaling messages and DCI used by a UE before dedicated channels are established (e.g., PDCCH received during random access, such as scheduling information for a random access response or scheduling grant). A USS may be dedicated to a specific UE and indicated to the UE in a radio resource control (RRC) signaling message. A UE may also be configured to search for various DCI formats, where DCI associated with one format may have a different size (e.g., number of bits) than DCI associated with another format. Further, a single search space may be configured to carry PDCCH having one or more DCI formats. A set of parameters for monitoring a SS may be referred to as a search space set (SS set), and UE may be configured with one or more SS sets.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some aspects, a DCI format may be associated with scheduling an uplink data channel, such as a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH). For instance, downlink DCI formats 0_0 and 0_1 may be associated with scheduling PUSCH in a cell. Format 0_0 may be a fallback format, supporting a limited set of features and using less overhead (e.g., used during a transition period when a UE is being configured for other features). Format 0_1 may be a non-fallback format, supporting more features configured for a UE (e.g., cross-carrier scheduling, BWP switching). Further, a DCI format may be associated with scheduling an downlink data channel. For instance, an DCI format may schedule a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH), and fallback DCI format 1_0 and non-fallback DCI format 1_1 may be associated with scheduling PDSCH in a cell. In some aspects, DCI formats for scheduling PDSCH and PUSCH are as described in 3GPP Technical Specification (TS) 38.212 Release 15, titled &#x201c;3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Radio Access Network; NR; Multiplexing and channel coding,&#x201d; at Table 7.3.1-1, which is incorporated by reference herein.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some aspects, a UE may monitor physical resources for PDCCH(s) carrying DCI(s) via a blind decoding procedure. For instance, a UE may determine PDCCH configuration information, such as the range or set of physical resources to monitor, based on the SS configuration and the CORESET. Within the range or set of physical resources and based on information in the SS configuration, a UE may apply different PDCCH configuration parameters (e.g., aggregation level (AL), number of PDCCH candidates per AL and/or per radio network temporary identifier (RNTI)) in order to determine the possible physical resource locations in which the PDCCH candidates may be transmitted. A UE may further apply an RNTI-based scrambling mask to each PDCCH candidate in order to detect DCI carried on a PDCCH via blind decoding.</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">To detect DCI, a UE may perform a blind decode in each configured SS. In some aspects, uplink and downlink fallback DCIs (e.g., DCI formats 0_0 and 1_0) may have matching sizes, such that monitoring a SS using a single blind decode can detect both uplink and downlink fallback DCIs. Fallback DCIs having matching sizes can be differentiated as either uplink or downlink DCI based on other information such as information provided in the DCI's contents. However, uplink and downlink non-fallback DCIs (e.g., DCI formats 0_1 and 1_1) may not be size matched, such that separate blind decodes are to be used to detect each of uplink non-fallback DCI formats and downlink non-fallback DCI formats.</p><p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a wireless communication network, a single SS can be configured to include PDCCHs carrying DCIs for scheduling both uplink channels (e.g., DCI format 0_1) and downlink channels (e.g., DCI format 1_1). For such a SS that can include both uplink and downlink DCIs, a UE may use separate blind decodes to detect each of the non-size-matched uplink and downlink DCIs. A UE may also be configured to support unbalanced uplink and downlink data traffic, such that DCI formats for scheduling uplink data may be monitored more frequently than DCI formats for scheduling downlink data (or vice versa). For instance, a UE may be configured to transmit PUSCH data more frequently than it receives PDSCH data, and as a result, a UE may monitor a DCI format(s) for scheduling uplink data (e.g., DCI format 0_1) more frequently than DCI format(s) for scheduling downlink data (e.g., DCI format 1_1). In some aspects, a UE may comprise a video surveillance device that frequently transmits uplink video data and thus more frequently monitors a DCI format(s) for scheduling uplink data compared to a DCI format(s) for scheduling downlink data. Alternatively, a UE may be configured to receive PDSCH data more frequently than it transmits PUSCH data, and such a UE may monitor a DCI format(s) for scheduling downlink data (e.g., DCI format 1_1) more frequently than DCI format(s) for scheduling uplink data (e.g., DCI format 0_1).</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">For a single search space configured to include both uplink and downlink DCI formats, a UE is to perform a blind decode to search for uplink DCI as well as a blind decode to search for downlink DCI, causing the UE to perform an unnecessarily large number of blind decodes. For instance, a UE may perform unnecessary blind decodes when traffic in one direction is not as frequent (e.g., a DCI format for scheduling downlink data is detected infrequently) as traffic in the reverse link direction (e.g., a DCI format for scheduling uplink data is detected frequently). By comparison, configuring a search space to include only one of either an uplink DCI format or a downlink DCI format may allow a UE to avoid performing unnecessary blind decodes.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Accordingly, aspects of the present disclosure are directed to communicating, by a first wireless communication device with a second wireless communication device, a SS configuration including a first search space for uplink scheduling and a second search space for downlink scheduling, the second search space being different than the first search space. For instance, the first wireless communication device and a second wireless communication device can communicate a scheduling grant in one of the first search space or the second search space based on the SS configuration. Further, the first wireless communication device and a second wireless communication device can communicate data based on the scheduling grant, such as the first wireless communication device transmitting PDSCH data or the second wireless communication device transmitting PUSCH data.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some aspects, a SS configuration can include a UE-specific search space (USS) configuration, where the USS configuration includes a first field value indicating a first search space is configured for uplink scheduling and a second field value indicating a second search space is configured for downlink scheduling. In some aspects, a SS configuration can include a field, the field including a first field value indicating a first search space is configured for uplink scheduling or a second field value indicating a second search space is configured for downlink scheduling. Further, a first search space can be configured for downlink control information (DCI) format 0_1 and a second search space can be configured for DCI format 1_1.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some aspects, the present disclosure is directed to communicating, by a first wireless communication device with a second wireless communication device, a SS configuration including a first search space that is configurable for either uplink scheduling or downlink scheduling, wherein the SS configuration further indicates the first search space is for one of uplink scheduling or downlink scheduling. For instance, a media access control (MAC) control element (CE), a RRC message, or a PDCCH in a CSS can indicate that a first search space is for one of uplink scheduling or downlink scheduling. Further, a wireless communication device may determine the first search space is for one of uplink scheduling or downlink scheduling based on a rule or an aggregation level configuration. In some aspects, the first search space can be configured for one of DCI format 0_1 or DCI format 1_1.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Aspects of the present disclosure can provide several benefits. For example, a SS configuration that includes DCI formats for scheduling both downlink and uplink data may require separate blind decodes by a UE to detect each of the non-size-matched uplink and downlink DCIs, which can result in unnecessary blind decodes when a UE has unbalanced uplink versus downlink traffic, as discussed above. By comparison, the present disclosure includes configuring a search space to include either an uplink DCI format or a downlink DCI format, or configuring an uplink DCI format in a first search space and configuring a downlink DCI format in a second search space, such that a UE may blind decode a SS for either an uplink DCI format or a downlink DCI format when monitoring the SS for DCI. The present disclosure thus beneficially allows a UE to perform fewer overall blind decodes compared to configuring uplink and downlink DCI formats in the same search space. Additionally, by reducing the number of blind decodes, the present disclosure beneficially provides a network with UEs having improved search-space monitoring and blind decoding efficiencies, while also freeing the UEs' resources for saving power or performing other functions. Further, the present disclosure beneficially includes configuring a SS for an uplink DCI format only, which can beneficially improve monitoring of an uplink DCI format for a UE with unbalanced uplink versus downlink traffic. The present disclosure therefore improves UE and network performance as to search space configuration and monitoring, beneficially providing higher data rates, higher capacity, better spectral efficiency, and increased reliability.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a wireless communication network <b>100</b> according to some aspects of the present disclosure. The network <b>100</b> may be a 5G network. The network <b>100</b> includes a number of base stations (BSs) <b>105</b> (individually labeled as <b>105</b><i>a</i>, <b>105</b><i>b</i>, <b>105</b><i>c</i>, <b>105</b><i>d</i>, <b>105</b><i>e</i>, and <b>1050</b> and other network entities. A BS <b>105</b> may be a station that communicates with UEs <b>115</b> and may also be referred to as an evolved node B (eNB), a next generation eNB (gNB), an access point, and the like. Each BS <b>105</b> may provide communication coverage for a particular geographic area. In 3GPP, the term &#x201c;cell&#x201d; can refer to this particular geographic coverage area of a BS <b>105</b> and/or a BS subsystem serving the coverage area, depending on the context in which the term is used.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">A BS <b>105</b> may provide communication coverage for a macro cell or a small cell, such as a pico cell or a femto cell, and/or other types of cell. A macro cell generally covers a relatively large geographic area (e.g., several kilometers in radius) and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscriptions with the network provider. A small cell, such as a pico cell, would generally cover a relatively smaller geographic area and may allow unrestricted access by UEs with service subscriptions with the network provider. A small cell, such as a femto cell, would also generally cover a relatively small geographic area (e.g., a home) and, in addition to unrestricted access, may also provide restricted access by UEs having an association with the femto cell (e.g., UEs in a closed subscriber group (CSG), UEs for users in the home, and the like). A BS for a macro cell may be referred to as a macro BS. A BS for a small cell may be referred to as a small cell BS, a pico BS, a femto BS or a home BS. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the BSs <b>105</b><i>d </i>and <b>105</b><i>e </i>may be regular macro BSs, while the BSs <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<b>105</b><i>c </i>may be macro BSs enabled with one of three dimension (3D), full dimension (FD), or massive MIMO. The BSs <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<b>105</b><i>c </i>may take advantage of their higher dimension MIMO capabilities to exploit 3D beamforming in both elevation and azimuth beamforming to increase coverage and capacity. The BS <b>105</b><i>f </i>may be a small cell BS which may be a home node or portable access point. A BS <b>105</b> may support one or multiple (e.g., two, three, four, and the like) cells.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">The network <b>100</b> may support synchronous or asynchronous operation. For synchronous operation, the BSs may have similar frame timing, and transmissions from different BSs may be approximately aligned in time. For asynchronous operation, the BSs may have different frame timing, and transmissions from different BSs may not be aligned in time.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">The UEs <b>115</b> are dispersed throughout the wireless network <b>100</b>, and each UE <b>115</b> may be stationary or mobile. A UE <b>115</b> may also be referred to as a terminal, a mobile station, a subscriber unit, a station, or the like. A UE <b>115</b> may be a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless modem, a wireless communication device, a handheld device, a tablet computer, a laptop computer, a cordless phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, or the like. In one aspect, a UE <b>115</b> may be a device that includes a Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC). In another aspect, a UE may be a device that does not include a UICC. In some aspects, the UEs <b>115</b> that do not include UICCs may also be referred to as IoT devices or internet of everything (IoE) devices. The UEs <b>115</b><i>a</i>-<b>115</b><i>d </i>are examples of mobile smart phone-type devices accessing network <b>100</b>. A UE <b>115</b> may also be a machine specifically configured for connected communication, including machine type communication (MTC), enhanced MTC (eMTC), narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) and the like. The UEs <b>115</b><i>e</i>-<b>115</b><i>h </i>are examples of various machines configured for communication that access the network <b>100</b>. The UEs <b>115</b><i>i</i>-<b>115</b><i>k </i>are examples of vehicles equipped with wireless communication devices configured for communication that access the network <b>100</b>. A UE <b>115</b> may be able to communicate with any type of the BSs, whether macro BS, small cell, or the like. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a lightning bolt (e.g., communication links) indicates wireless transmissions between a UE <b>115</b> and a serving BS <b>105</b>, which is a BS designated to serve the UE <b>115</b> on the downlink (DL) and/or uplink (UL), desired transmission between BSs <b>105</b>, backhaul transmissions between BSs, or sidelink transmissions between UEs <b>115</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">In operation, the BSs <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<b>105</b><i>c </i>may serve the UEs <b>115</b><i>a </i>and <b>115</b><i>b </i>using 3D beamforming and coordinated spatial techniques, such as coordinated multipoint (CoMP) or multi-connectivity. The macro BS <b>105</b><i>d </i>may perform backhaul communications with the BSs <b>105</b><i>a</i>-<b>105</b><i>c</i>, as well as small cell, the BS <b>105</b><i>f</i>. The macro BS <b>105</b><i>d </i>may also transmits multicast services which are subscribed to and received by the UEs <b>115</b><i>c </i>and <b>115</b><i>d</i>. Such multicast services may include mobile television or stream video, or may include other services for providing community information, such as weather emergencies or alerts, such as Amber alerts or gray alerts.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">The BSs <b>105</b> may also communicate with a core network. The core network may provide user authentication, access authorization, tracking, Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity, and other access, routing, or mobility functions. At least some of the BSs <b>105</b> (e.g., which may be an example of a gNB or an access node controller (ANC)) may interface with the core network through backhaul links (e.g., NG-C, NG-U, etc.) and may perform radio configuration and scheduling for communication with the UEs <b>115</b>. In various examples, the BSs <b>105</b> may communicate, either directly or indirectly (e.g., through core network), with each other over backhaul links (e.g., X1, X2, etc.), which may be wired or wireless communication links.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">The network <b>100</b> may also support mission critical communications with ultra-reliable and redundant links for mission critical devices, such as the UE <b>115</b><i>e</i>, which may be a drone. Redundant communication links with the UE <b>115</b><i>e </i>may include links from the macro BSs <b>105</b><i>d </i>and <b>105</b><i>e</i>, as well as links from the small cell BS <b>105</b><i>f</i>. Other machine type devices, such as the UE <b>115</b><i>f </i>(e.g., a thermometer), the UE <b>115</b><i>g </i>(e.g., smart meter), and UE <b>115</b><i>h </i>(e.g., wearable device) may communicate through the network <b>100</b> either directly with BSs, such as the small cell BS <b>105</b><i>f</i>, and the macro BS <b>105</b><i>e</i>, or in multi-step-size configurations by communicating with another user device which relays its information to the network, such as the UE <b>115</b><i>f </i>communicating temperature measurement information to the smart meter, the UE <b>115</b><i>g</i>, which is then reported to the network through the small cell BS <b>105</b><i>f</i>. The network <b>100</b> may also provide additional network efficiency through dynamic, low-latency TDD/FDD communications, such asV2V, V2X, C-V2X communications between a UE <b>115</b><i>i</i>, <b>115</b><i>j</i>, or <b>115</b><i>k </i>and other UEs <b>115</b>, and/or vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications between a UE <b>115</b><i>i</i>, <b>115</b><i>j</i>, or <b>115</b><i>k </i>and a BS <b>105</b>.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some implementations, the network <b>100</b> utilizes OFDM-based waveforms for communications. An OFDM-based system may partition the system BW into multiple (K) orthogonal subcarriers, which are also commonly referred to as subcarriers, tones, bins, or the like. Each subcarrier may be modulated with data. In some instances, the subcarrier spacing between adjacent subcarriers may be fixed, and the total number of subcarriers (K) may be dependent on the system BW. The system BW may also be partitioned into subbands. In other instances, the subcarrier spacing and/or the duration of TTIs may be scalable.</p><p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some aspects, the BSs <b>105</b> can assign or schedule transmission resources (e.g., in the form of time-frequency resource blocks (RB)) for downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions in the network <b>100</b>. DL refers to the transmission direction from a BS <b>105</b> to a UE <b>115</b>, whereas UL refers to the transmission direction from a UE <b>115</b> to a BS <b>105</b>. The communication can be in the form of radio frames. A radio frame may be divided into a plurality of subframes or slots, for example, about 10. Each slot may be further divided into mini-slots. In a FDD mode, simultaneous UL and DL transmissions may occur in different frequency bands. For example, each subframe includes a UL subframe in a UL frequency band and a DL subframe in a DL frequency band. In a TDD mode, UL and DL transmissions occur at different time periods using the same frequency band. For example, a subset of the subframes (e.g., DL subframes) in a radio frame may be used for DL transmissions and another subset of the subframes (e.g., UL subframes) in the radio frame may be used for UL transmissions.</p><p id="p-0050" num="0049">The DL subframes and the UL subframes can be further divided into several regions. For example, each DL or UL subframe may have pre-defined regions for transmissions of reference signals, control information, and data. Reference signals are predetermined signals that facilitate the communications between the BSs <b>105</b> and the UEs <b>115</b>. For example, a reference signal can have a particular pilot pattern or structure, where pilot tones may span across an operational BW or frequency band, each positioned at a pre-defined time and a pre-defined frequency. For example, a BS <b>105</b> may transmit cell specific reference signals (CRSs) and/or channel state information&#x2014;reference signals (CSI-RSs) to enable a UE <b>115</b> to estimate a DL channel. Similarly, a UE <b>115</b> may transmit sounding reference signals (SRSs) to enable a BS <b>105</b> to estimate a UL channel. Control information may include resource assignments and protocol controls. Data may include protocol data and/or operational data. In some aspects, the BSs <b>105</b> and the UEs <b>115</b> may communicate using self-contained subframes. A self-contained subframe may include a portion for DL communication and a portion for UL communication. A self-contained subframe can be DL-centric or UL-centric. A DL-centric subframe may include a longer duration for DL communication than for UL communication. A UL-centric subframe may include a longer duration for UL communication than for UL communication.</p><p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some aspects, the network <b>100</b> may be an NR network deployed over a licensed spectrum. The BSs <b>105</b> can transmit synchronization signals (e.g., including a primary synchronization signal (PSS) and a secondary synchronization signal (SSS)) in the network <b>100</b> to facilitate synchronization. The BSs <b>105</b> can broadcast system information associated with the network <b>100</b> (e.g., including a master information block (MIB), remaining system information (RMSI), and other system information (OSI)) to facilitate initial network access. In some instances, the BSs <b>105</b> may broadcast the PSS, the SSS, and/or the MIB in the form of synchronization signal block (SSBs) over a physical broadcast channel (PBCH) and may broadcast the RMSI and/or the OSI over a physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH).</p><p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some aspects, a UE <b>115</b> attempting to access the network <b>100</b> may perform an initial cell search by detecting a PSS from a BS <b>105</b>. The PSS may enable synchronization of period timing and may indicate a physical layer identity value. The UE <b>115</b> may then receive a SSS. The SSS may enable radio frame synchronization, and may provide a cell identity value, which may be combined with the physical layer identity value to identify the cell. The PSS and the SSS may be located in a central portion of a carrier or any suitable frequencies within the carrier.</p><p id="p-0053" num="0052">After receiving the PSS and SSS, the UE <b>115</b> may receive a MIB. The MIB may include system information for initial network access and scheduling information for RMSI and/or OSI. After decoding the MIB, the UE <b>115</b> may receive RMSI and/or OSI. The RMSI and/or OSI may include radio resource control (RRC) information related to random access channel (RACH) procedures, paging, control resource set (CORESET) for physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) monitoring, physical UL control channel (PUCCH), physical UL shared channel (PUSCH), power control, and SRS.</p><p id="p-0054" num="0053">After obtaining the MIB, the RMSI and/or the OSI, the UE <b>115</b> can perform a random access procedure to establish a connection with the BS <b>105</b>. In some examples, the random access procedure may be a four-step random access procedure. For example, the UE <b>115</b> may transmit a random access preamble and the BS <b>105</b> may respond with a random access response. The random access response (RAR) may include a detected random access preamble identifier (ID) corresponding to the random access preamble, timing advance (TA) information, a UL grant, a temporary cell-radio network temporary identifier (C-RNTI), and/or a backoff indicator. Upon receiving the random access response, the UE <b>115</b> may transmit a connection request to the BS <b>105</b> and the BS <b>105</b> may respond with a connection response. The connection response may indicate a contention resolution. In some examples, the random access preamble, the RAR, the connection request, and the connection response can be referred to as message 1 (MSG1), message 2 (MSG2), message 3 (MSG3), and message 4 (MSG4), respectively. In some examples, the random access procedure may be a two-step random access procedure, where the UE <b>115</b> may transmit a random access preamble and a connection request in a single transmission and the BS <b>105</b> may respond by transmitting a random access response and a connection response in a single transmission.</p><p id="p-0055" num="0054">After establishing a connection, the UE <b>115</b> and the BS <b>105</b> can enter a normal operation stage, where operational data may be exchanged. For example, the BS <b>105</b> may schedule the UE <b>115</b> for UL and/or DL communications. The BS <b>105</b> may transmit UL and/or DL scheduling grants to the UE <b>115</b> via a PDCCH. The scheduling grants may be transmitted in the form of DL control information (DCI). The BS <b>105</b> may transmit a DL communication signal (e.g., carrying data) to the UE <b>115</b> via a PDSCH according to a DL scheduling grant. The UE <b>115</b> may transmit a UL communication signal to the BS <b>105</b> via a PUSCH and/or PUCCH according to a UL scheduling grant.</p><p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some aspects, the network <b>100</b> may operate over a system BW or a component carrier (CC) BW. The network <b>100</b> may partition the system BW into multiple BWPs (e.g., portions). A BS <b>105</b> may dynamically assign a UE <b>115</b> to operate over a certain BWP (e.g., a certain portion of the system BW). The assigned BWP may be referred to as the active BWP. The UE <b>115</b> may monitor the active BWP for signaling information from the BS <b>105</b>. The BS <b>105</b> may schedule the UE <b>115</b> for UL or DL communications in the active BWP. In some aspects, a BS <b>105</b> may assign a pair of BWPs within the CC to a UE <b>115</b> for UL and DL communications. For example, the BWP pair may include one BWP for UL communications and one BWP for DL communications.</p><p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some aspects, the network <b>100</b> may communicate DCI to UEs on downlink channels, such as PDCCHs. For instance, BS <b>105</b> (or BS <b>600</b> discussed below at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) may transmit PDCCHs carrying DCI to UE <b>115</b> (or UE <b>500</b> discussed below at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).
