An example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a case in which the predetermined value is the predicted value of the delay that occurs as a result of data that is lost during transmission being retransmitted.

The determining unit <b>14</b> acquires the data quantity of the transmission waiting data that is stored in the transmission queue. In addition, the determining unit <b>14</b> acquires the communication speed of the communication line <b>40</b>. As the communication speed, an available bandwidth that indicates an amount of data that can be transferred per unit time that is estimated by a conventionally known method (also referred to, hereafter, as an &#x201c;estimated speed&#x201d;) may be used. For example, the determining unit <b>14</b> may acquire the estimated speed that is estimated by the reception apparatus <b>20</b> from the reception apparatus <b>20</b>. The determining unit <b>14</b> predicts a predicted transmission-completion time t<b>0</b> when redundant transmission is not performed, based on the acquired data quantity and estimated speed.

The determining unit <b>14</b> determines, as the upper limit of the redundancy level, x that is such that the predicted transmission-completion time tx when redundant transmission is performed is equal to the predicted retransmission-completion time tr. That is, the determining unit <b>14</b> determines the upper limit of the redundancy level such that an upper limit of a data quantity of a redundant packet is a data quantity that can be transmitted within time (tr&#x2212;t<b>0</b>) that is indicated by the predetermined value.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">More specifically, the determining unit <b>14</b> calculates a data quantity D<b>2</b> that can be transmitted within the time (tr&#x2212;t<b>0</b>) that is indicated by the predetermined value by D<b>2</b>=V&#xd7;(tr&#x2212;t<b>0</b>). V is the estimated speed. Then, the determining unit <b>14</b> calculates the upper limit x of the redundancy level by x=(D<b>1</b>+D<b>2</b>)/D<b>1</b>. D<b>1</b> is the data quantity of the transmission waiting data. In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a case in which the number of redundant packets is three for transmission waiting data in the transmission queue being six packets of a same size is the upper limit at which tx does not exceed tr.
