In many cases, the resulting leaflet is supported on the frame and defines a flap having a mounting edge where the leaflet is coupled to the frame and a free edge that allows the flap to move. The flap moves under the influence of fluid pressure. In operation, the leaflets open when the upstream fluid pressure exceeds the downstream fluid pressure and closes when the downstream fluid pressure exceeds the upstream fluid pressure. The free edges of the leaflets coapt under the influence of downstream fluid pressure, closing the valve to prevent downstream blood from flowing retrograde through the valve.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">Valve durability under the repetitive loads of the leaflets opening and closing is dependent, in part, on the load distribution between the leaflet and the frame. Further, substantial load is encountered on the leaflet when in the closed position. Mechanical failure of the leaflet can arise, for example, at the mounting edge, where the flexible leaflet is supported by the relatively rigid frame, particularly at the commissure posts. The repetitive loads of leaflet opening and closing leads to material failure by fatigue, creep or other mechanism, depending in part on the leaflet material. Mechanical failure at the mounting edge is especially prevalent with synthetic leaflets.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">There remains a need for a more durable flexible leaflet prosthetic valve.</p><heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading><p id="p-0007" num="0006">Described embodiments are directed to apparatus, system, and methods for valve replacement, such as cardiac valve replacement. More specifically, described embodiments are directed toward flexible leaflet valve devices having biological or synthetic leaflet material and a frame, and methods of making and implanting the valve devices.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an embodiment, a prosthetic heart valve comprises a leaflet frame assembly. The leaflet frame assembly is an assembly of a leaflet frame, leaflet construct, and retention elements. The leaflet construct is that portion of the valve that comprises the leaflets and the structure for coupling the leaflets to the leaflet frame. In accordance with an embodiment, the leaflet construct defines a contiguous annular ring defining a plurality of leaflets and a bridge region between each of the leaflets. Each bridge region defines a bridge first end adjacent a first leaflet and a bridge second end adjacent a second leaflet. The leaflets extend radially inward from the leaflet frame when coupled to the leaflet frame. Each of the leaflets defines a fold-over portion that is folded over and lies against a leaflet frame outer side of the leaflet frame and coupled thereto such as with a securement structure, such as, but not limited to suture, adhesive, thermal bonding, or other means. Each of the bridge regions defines a bridge loop with a coaptation neck between the bridge loop and the adjacent leaflets. The coaptation neck is operable to pass through one of the post slots so that the bridge loop is adjacent to the outer portion of the leaflet frame and the leaflets extend radially inward from the leaflet frame. A retention element is disposed within the bridge loop effectively preventing the bridge loop from passing through the post slot. The retention element may be coupled to the commissure post, such as with a securement structure, such as, but not limited to suture, adhesive, thermal bonding, or other means. The fold-over portion of each of the leaflets is folded around an inflow edge of the leaflet frame and coupled thereto, such as with a securement structure, such as, but not limited to suture, adhesive, thermal bonding, or other means.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">A method of making a prosthetic valve, in accordance with an embodiment, comprises obtaining a tube comprising one or more layers of expanded PTFE composite. Cutting a leaflet construct including a plurality of leaflets each being separated by a bridge region from the tube. Providing fold-over apertures in fold-over portions of the leaflets and bridge apertures in the bridge region. Obtaining a plurality of retention elements, each retention element defining retention element apertures. Folding each of the bridge regions into a bridge loop and defining a coaptation neck between each bridge loop and two adjacent leaflets, the bridge loops extending radially away from the tube axis. Disposing a retention element into each of the bridge loops. Suturing each retention element to the respective bridge loop passing suture through the bridge apertures and the retention element apertures that are aligned therewith. Cutting a leaflet frame from a metal tube defining leaflet frame windows and commissure posts therebetween where each commissure post defines a post slot dimensioned to receive a double thickness of the bridge region. Providing leaflet window frame apertures in the leaflet window frame and post apertures in the commissure posts. Disposing each coaptation neck in a respective post slot with the retention elements adjacent the post outer side and disposing the leaflets in the leaflet frame. Aligning the retention element apertures with the post apertures. Suturing each retention element to the respective commissure post passing suture through the retention element apertures and the post apertures that are aligned therewith. Folding the fold-over portions of each leaflet along the leaflet frame inflow edge and against the leaflet frame outer side aligning the fold-over apertures with the leaflet window frame apertures. And suturing each fold-over portion to the respective leaflet window frame passing suture through the fold-over apertures and the leaflet window frame apertures that are aligned therewith.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0005" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0010" num="0009">The accompanying drawings are included to provide a further understanding of the present disclosure and are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate embodiments described herein, and together with the description serve to explain the principles discussed in this disclosure.</p><p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is an outflow side perspective view of a prosthetic heart valve in accordance with an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is an inflow side perspective view of the embodiment of the valve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of a leaflet frame assembly of the embodiment of the valve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a side exploded view of the leaflet frame, retention element, leaflet construct and base frame, of an embodiment of a valve;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a representation of the embodiment of the valve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> unrolled to a flat orientation, in accordance with an embodiment;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> is a perspective view of the bridge region formed into a bridge loop, in accordance with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> is a perspective view of the bridge region formed into a bridge loop and containing a retention element, in accordance with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a side view of the bridge region of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>;</p><p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a perspective view of a leaflet frame assembly and a base frame, in accordance with the embodiment of the valve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>; and</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a side view of the bridge region showing fold line at an angle alpha, in accordance with another embodiment.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading><p id="p-0021" num="0020">Persons skilled in the art will readily appreciate that various aspects of the present disclosure can be realized by any number of methods and apparatus configured to perform the intended functions. Stated differently, other methods and apparatus can be incorporated herein to perform the intended functions. It should also be noted that the accompanying drawing figures referred to herein are not necessarily drawn to scale, but may be exaggerated to illustrate various aspects of the present disclosure, and in that regard, the drawing figures should not be construed as limiting.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Although the embodiments herein may be described in connection with various principles and beliefs, the described embodiments should not be bound by theory. For example, embodiments are described herein in connection with prosthetic valves, more specifically cardiac prosthetic valves. However, embodiments within the scope of this disclosure can be applied toward any valve or mechanism of similar structure and/or function. Furthermore, embodiments within the scope of this disclosure can be applied in non-cardiac applications.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">The term leaflet as used herein in the context of prosthetic valves is a flexible component of a one-way valve wherein the leaflet is operable to move between an open and closed position under the influence of a pressure differential. In an open position, the leaflet allows blood to flow through the valve. In a closed position, the leaflet substantially blocks retrograde flow through the valve. In embodiments comprising multiple leaflets, each leaflet cooperates with at least one neighboring leaflet to block the retrograde flow of blood. The pressure differential in the blood is caused, for example, by the contraction of a ventricle or atrium of the heart, such pressure differential typically resulting from a fluid pressure building up on one side of the leaflets when closed. As the pressure on an inflow side of the valve rises above the pressure on the outflow side of the valve, the leaflets open and blood flows therethrough. As blood flows through the valve into a neighboring chamber or blood vessel, the pressure on the inflow side equalizes with the pressure on the outflow side. As the pressure on the outflow side of the valve raises above the blood pressure on the inflow side of the valve, the leaflet returns to the closed position generally preventing retrograde flow of blood through the valve.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">The term membrane as used herein refers to a sheet comprising a single material, such as, but not limited to, expanded fluoropolymer.</p><p id="p-0025" num="0024">The term composite material as used herein refers to a combination of a membrane, such as, but not limited to, expanded fluoropolymer, and an elastomer, such as, but not limited to, a fluoroelastomer. The elastomer can be contained within a porous structure of the membrane, coated on one or both sides of the membrane, or a combination of coated on and contained within the membrane.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">The term laminate as used herein refers to multiple layers of membrane, composite material, or other materials, such as elastomer, and combinations thereof.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">The term film as used herein generically refers to one or more of the membrane, composite material, or laminate.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">The term biocompatible material as used herein generically refers to any material with biocompatible characteristics including synthetic, such as, but not limited to, a biocompatible polymer, or a biological material, such as, but not limited to, bovine pericardium.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">The terms native valve orifice and tissue orifice refer to an anatomical structure into which a prosthetic valve can be placed. Such anatomical structure includes, but is not limited to, a location wherein a cardiac valve may or may not have been surgically removed. It is understood that other anatomical structures that can receive a prosthetic valve include, but are not limited to, veins, arteries, ducts and shunts. It is further understood that a valve orifice or implant site may also refer to a location in a synthetic or biological conduit that may receive a valve.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">As used herein, &#x201c;couple&#x201d; means to join, connect, attach, adhere, affix, or bond, whether directly or indirectly, and whether permanently or temporarily.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">Embodiments herein include various apparatus, systems, and methods for a prosthetic valve, such as, but not limited to, cardiac valve replacement.

Further, the angle alpha of the two loop fold lines <b>336</b> allows for a substantially equal distribution of stresses over the coaptation neck <b>340</b> between the bridge loop <b>338</b> and the adjacent leaflets <b>310</b> whereby reducing the peak stresses in the coaptation neck <b>340</b>.</p><p id="p-0067" num="0066">In accordance with these embodiments, the leaflets <b>310</b> extend perpendicular from the leaflet frame <b>200</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.

An advantage of a separate leaflet frame <b>200</b> and base frame <b>500</b> is that they may have different physical characteristics. By way of example, a relatively less stiff leaflet frame <b>200</b> supporting the leaflets <b>310</b> can be more likely to reduce the loading encountered by the opening and closing leaflets <b>130</b> as compared to a stiffer leaflet frame <b>200</b>. The leaflet frame <b>200</b> having a relatively less stiff property may reduce leaflet accelerations and reduce the closing stresses on the leaflets <b>310</b>.

The amount of force on the cables required to deflect the three commissure posts toward the axis provides a measure of stiffness.
