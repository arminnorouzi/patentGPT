More specifically, the present invention is related to paintball land mines, which can fire multiple paintballs simultaneously and methods of making and using same.</p><heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0003" num="0002">Prior to the present invention, as set forth in general terms above and more specifically below, it is known, that in the game of paintball, each player has a gun that fires small balls of paint at opposing players. When a player is struck, the paintball ruptures, thereby marking the player that was struck by the paintball. Depending upon the rules of play, the marked player is either permanently put out of play, or the marked player can retreat to a replenishment area where, after a set amount of time, the marked player can rejoin the game. In the first example of play, the elimination of teams or all but a single player is the intent. However, in the second example, the conquering and holding of objectives is the purpose. Regardless of the manner of play, it is often the wish of a player or a team of players to have a device that can be set on the field of play and fire multiple paintballs with a high percentage for eliminating a player or players, or to guard an objective.</p><p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore, prior to the present invention, as set forth in general terms above and more specifically below, it is known, to employ various types of paintball firing devices. See for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,207,579 by Campagnuolo, U.S. Pat. No. 5,590,886 by Lush, U.S. Pat. No. 5,877,448 by Denton et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,996,503 by Woodall et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,289,819 by Dolderer, U.S. Pat. No. 6,453,819 by Coates, U.S. Pat. No. 6,688,234 by Huber et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 8,978,561 by Illston. While these various paintball firing devices may have been generally satisfactory, there is nevertheless a need for a new and improved paintball land mine, which can fire multiple paintballs simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is a goal of the present invention to provide a paintball land mine which can fire multiple paintballs simultaneously.</p><p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is another goal of the present invention to provide a paintball land mine that utilizes a firearm blank or nail gun cartridge for its propellant.</p><p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is still a further goal of the present invention to provide a paintball land mine which includes reed valves associated with the ejection of the paintballs so that after the initial blast of the propellant to eject each paintball, the reed valve associated with the ejected paintball is closed, thereby preventing the rapid escape of unused propellant.</p><p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an even further goal of the present invention to provide a paintball land mine that is either detonated by a trip wire or detonated electronically through the use a remote-control device.</p><p id="p-0009" num="0008">The preferred paintball land mine, according to various embodiments of the present invention, offers the following advantages: ease of use; lightness in weight; durability; reusability; the ability to fire multiple paintballs simultaneously; the ability to utilize a firearm blank or nail gun cartridge for its propellant; the use of reed valves associated with the ejection of the paintballs; the ability to substantially prevent the rapid escape of unused propellant; the ability to detonate the land mine using a trip wire; and the ability to detonate the land mine using a remote-control device. In fact, in many of the preferred embodiments, these advantages are optimized to an extent that is considerably higher than heretofore achieved in prior, known paintball firing devices.</p><p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is a purpose of this invention to fulfill these and other needs in the paintball firing devices art in a manner more apparent to the skilled artisan once given the following disclosure.</p><?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="tail"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="lead"?><description-of-drawings><heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading><p id="p-0011" num="0010">The above-mentioned features and steps of the invention and the manner of attaining them will become apparent, and the invention itself will be best understood by reference to the following description of the embodiments of the invention in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like characters represent like parts throughout the several views and in which:</p><p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic, isometric illustration of a paintball land mine, constructed according the present invention;</p><p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic, top view of the paintball land mine, constructed according the present invention;</p><p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic, top view of the paintball land mine, showing the electronic trigger assembly attached, constructed according the present invention;</p><p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic, side view of the paintball land mine, taken along lines <b>4</b>-<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, constructed according the present invention;</p><p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic, top view of the paintball land mine, taken along lines <b>5</b>-<b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, constructed according the present invention;</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a schematic, top view of the paintball land mine, taken along lines <b>6</b>-<b>6</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with the manual trigger assembly in a pre-detonation mode, constructed according the present invention; and</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a schematic, top view of the paintball land mine with the manual trigger assembly in a post-detonation mode, constructed according the present invention.</p></description-of-drawings><?brief-description-of-drawings description="Brief Description of Drawings" end="tail"?><?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?><heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading><p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is a common misconception that gun powder is an explosive. In fact, it is a propellant. Therefore, certain conditions must be met for it to burn, namely heat and pressure. In a conventional fire arm, this is achieved by the projectile being crimped into the cartridge during manufacturing, and the tight fit between the projectile and the barrel.</p><p id="p-0020" num="0019">Once the primer on the firearm cartridge is struck, the short, hot burst of gases that are produced are trapped along with the propellant, thereby causing some of the nitrocellous (commonly known as gun powder) to ignite. Furthermore, still trapped inside the cartridge, the small amount of burning propellant ignites more propellant and a rapid expansion of pressure and heat begins until the limit of adhesion between the projectile and the cartridge are overcome, and the projectile is forced out of the cartridge and into the barrel. Frictional forces between the projectile and barrel require the highest pressures resulting in a complete propellant burn, thousands of pounds of pressure, and heat. It is to be understood that in the case of a blank cartridge, the projectile is replaced with a metallic, paper, or plastic case that encloses the gun powder and the primer.</p><p id="p-0021" num="0020">In order to address the shortcomings of the prior, known paintball firing devices, it would be desirable to utilize a novel, paintball land mine, which can fire multiple paint balls simultaneously. It would be further desirable to provide a paintball land mine that utilizes a firearm blank or nail gun cartridge for its propellant. It would be even further desired to provide a paintball land mine which includes reed valves associated with the ejection of the paintballs so that after the initial blast of the propellant to eject each paintball, the reed valve associated with the ejected paintball is closed, thereby preventing the rapid escape of unused propellant. Finally, it would be still further desired to provide a paintball land mine that is either detonated by a trip wire or detonated electronically through the use a remote-control device.</p><p id="p-0022" num="0021">Reference is made now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, where there is illustrated a paintball land mine <b>2</b>, wherein the paintball land mine <b>2</b> includes, in part, paintball land mine assembly <b>4</b> and manual trigger assembly <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, paintball land mine assembly <b>4</b> includes, in part, openings <b>5</b> located on the front of paintball land mine assembly <b>4</b>.</p><p id="p-0023" num="0022">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates electronic trigger assembly <b>200</b> being attached to the top of paintball land mine <b>2</b> such that electronic trigger assembly <b>200</b> is located adjacent to manual trigger assembly <b>100</b>.

Battery <b>202</b> should be constructed such that battery <b>202</b> is capable of providing the required power to electronic trigger assembly <b>200</b>. Also, receiver <b>206</b> should be constructed such that receiver <b>206</b> is capable of receiving electronic signals from a conventional remote-control device <b>212</b>. In this manner, remote-control device <b>212</b> can be conventionally used to send an electronic signal to receiver <b>206</b> in order to cause solenoid <b>208</b> and extension <b>210</b> to interact with trip pin <b>108</b> in order to activate paintball land mine <b>2</b>. Finally, solenoid <b>208</b> should be capable of receiving a signal from receiver <b>206</b> that will cause solenoid <b>208</b> to move extension <b>210</b> such that movable extension <b>210</b> is capable of interacting with trip pin <b>108</b> in order to activate paintball land mine <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0024" num="0023">A unique aspect of the present invention is the use of electronic trigger assembly <b>200</b>. Electronic trigger assembly <b>200</b> allows for the remote-control activation of paintball land mine <b>2</b>. In particular, remote-control device <b>212</b> can be conventionally used to send an electronic signal to receiver <b>206</b> in order to cause electronic trigger assembly <b>200</b> to interact with trip pin <b>108</b> in order to activate paintball land mine <b>2</b>.

In this manner, the paintball land mine <b>2</b> can still be set on the field of play and fire multiple paintballs <b>18</b> with a high percentage for eliminating a player or players, or to guard an objective without the user having to be in close proximity to the paintball land mine <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0026" num="0025">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, is a portion of manual trigger assembly <b>100</b>. In particular, manual trigger assembly <b>100</b> includes, in part, hammer hinge bolt <b>102</b>, breach block <b>106</b>, trip pin <b>108</b>, cartridge <b>110</b>, hammer <b>112</b>, and breach <b>114</b> which will be discussed in greater detail later.</p><p id="p-0027" num="0026">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, there is illustrated in greater detail paintball land mine assembly <b>4</b> and manual trigger assembly <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, paintball land mine assembly <b>4</b> includes, in part, opening <b>5</b>, barrel assembly <b>6</b>, annular wall <b>7</b>, main body <b>8</b>, reed valve standoff <b>10</b>, combustion chamber <b>12</b>, reed valve <b>14</b>, main body/barrel assembly expansion chamber <b>16</b>, paintball <b>18</b>, heat shield <b>20</b>, barrel pre-detonation <b>22</b>, combustion chamber exhaust port <b>24</b>, barrel restrictor <b>26</b>, expansion/diverter section <b>28</b>, and barrel post detonation <b>30</b>. Preferably, barrel assembly <b>6</b>, main body <b>8</b>, reed valve standoff <b>10</b>, reed valve <b>14</b>, and heat shield <b>20</b> are constructed of any suitable high strength, durable, heat resistant, high pressure resistant, UV resistant material.</p><p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is to be understood that reed valve standoff <b>10</b> and reed valve <b>14</b> operate in substantially the same manner as discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,453,819 to Coates and titled &#x201c;Paint Ball Grenade&#x201d;. In particular, a plurality of barrel restrictors <b>26</b> are radially located to an outer surface of paintball land mine assembly <b>4</b> in alignment with openings <b>5</b>. A flexible reed valve <b>14</b> of rubber, plastic, metal or other suitable material has one end mounted to the inner surface of annular wall <b>7</b> in a covering relation to each opening <b>5</b>. Reed valve <b>14</b> can be constructed to be normally pre-biased to a position to close the respective opening <b>5</b>, although this is not required by the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, each reed valve <b>14</b> can be moved in a radially inward direction by inserting paintball <b>18</b> into barrel restrictor <b>26</b> so as to provide fluid communication between the respective opening <b>5</b> and main body/barrel assembly expansion chamber <b>16</b>. Although reed valves <b>14</b> are shown attached at only one end, reed valves <b>14</b> can be attached at opposite ends on opposite sides of openings <b>5</b> so that only the middle portion of each reed valve <b>14</b> moves in a radially inward direction. A reed valve standoff <b>10</b> is secured to the radially directed outer surface of each reed valve <b>14</b> and extends through the respective opening <b>5</b> and partially within the barrel restrictor <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0029" num="0028">Another unique aspect of the present invention is the use of reed valve standoff <b>10</b> and reed valve <b>14</b>. In particular, initially, the propellant exits very fast through openings <b>5</b> to push out and fire paint balls <b>18</b> from barrel restrictor <b>26</b>. However, after the first paint ball <b>18</b> is fired, the resistance provided by that paint ball <b>18</b> against reed valve standoff <b>10</b> and reed valve <b>14</b> no longer exists so that the propellant would quickly exit out of the barrel restrictor <b>26</b> from which the first paint ball <b>18</b> was fired, since this is the path of least resistance. However, after each paint ball <b>18</b> is fired, the respective reed valve standoffs <b>10</b> are no longer restrained, so that the propellant then forces the respective reed valves <b>14</b> to the closed position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, thus sealing the respective openings <b>5</b>. In this manner, the remaining propellant is still used to fire the other paint balls <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0030" num="0029">With respect to manual trigger assembly <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, manual trigger assembly <b>100</b> includes in part, hammer hinge bolt <b>102</b>, torsion spring <b>104</b>, breach block <b>106</b>, trip pin <b>108</b>, nail gun/blank firearm cartridge <b>110</b>, hammer <b>112</b>, and breach <b>114</b>. Preferably, hammer hinge bolt <b>102</b>, torsion spring <b>104</b>, breach block <b>106</b>, trip pin <b>108</b>, hammer <b>112</b>, and breach <b>114</b> are constructed of any suitable high strength, durable, heat resistant, high pressure resistant, UV resistant material. It is to be understood that nail gun/blank firearm cartridge <b>110</b> is any conventional nail gun or blank firearm cartridge or a round is a type of pre-assembled, blank firearm ammunition packaging a propellant substance (usually either smokeless powder or gun powder) and an ignition device (primer) within a metallic, paper, or plastic case. It is to be further understood that nail gun/blank firearm cartridge <b>110</b> should be made to fit within the breach <b>114</b>. It is to be understood that hammer <b>112</b> is conventionally attached to hammer hinge bolt <b>102</b> by conventional fastening techniques such as welding, soldering, adhesives or the like.</p><p id="p-0031" num="0030">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, there is illustrated manual trigger assembly <b>100</b>, prior to activation (pre-detonation) of manual trigger assembly <b>100</b>. As discussed above, manual trigger assembly includes, in part, hammer hinge bolt <b>102</b>, torsion spring <b>104</b>, breach block <b>106</b>, trip pin <b>108</b>, cartridge <b>110</b>, hammer <b>112</b>, and breach <b>114</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, hammer <b>112</b> is rotated into a locked position adjacent to the trip pin <b>108</b> such that trip pin <b>108</b> retains hammer <b>112</b> in place by locating trip pin <b>108</b> within groove <b>109</b>. It is to be understood that the rotation of hammer <b>112</b> creates torsion on torsion spring <b>104</b>. In this manner, once the trip pin <b>108</b> is removed away from groove <b>109</b> and hammer <b>112</b>, the force on torsion spring <b>104</b> will cause hammer <b>112</b> to rotate quicky towards cartridge <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0032" num="0031">With respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, there is illustrated manual trigger assembly <b>100</b>, after activation (post-detonation) of manual trigger assembly <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, trip pin <b>108</b> has been removed from groove <b>109</b> so that trip pin <b>108</b> no longer retains hammer <b>112</b> in place. As discussed above, since the rotation of hammer <b>112</b> creates torsion on torsion spring <b>104</b>, once the trip pin <b>108</b> has been removed from groove <b>109</b>, the torsional force from torsion spring <b>108</b> will cause hammer <b>112</b> to rotate quickly on hammer hinge bolt <b>102</b> towards cartridge <b>110</b> so that hammer <b>112</b> contacts cartridge <b>110</b> to cause the conventional firing of cartridge <b>110</b>. Once the cartridge <b>110</b> has been fired (or activated), the propellant created from the firing of the gun powder in cartridge <b>110</b> will enter into combustion chamber <b>12</b>, as will be described in greater detail later.</p><p id="p-0033" num="0032">Method of Using the Paintball Land Mine</p><p id="p-0034" num="0033">With respect to the method of using paintball land mine <b>2</b> and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, as discussed above, it is a common misconception that gun powder is an explosive.

It is to be understood that a conventional trip wire (not shown) or other similar detonation device can also be used to activate or otherwise detonate paintball land mine <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0036" num="0035">As discussed earlier, the user places the paintball land mine <b>2</b> on the field of play so that the paintball land mine <b>2</b> will be able to fire multiple paintballs <b>18</b> with a high percentage for eliminating a player or players, or to guard an objective.</p><p id="p-0037" num="0036">Once the paintball land mine <b>2</b> has been placed at it desired location, the user then conventionally connects the electronic trigger assembly <b>200</b> to the manual trigger assembly <b>100</b>. In particular, the receiver <b>206</b> should be constructed such that receiver <b>206</b> is capable of receiving electronic signals from a conventional remote- control device <b>212</b>. In this manner, remote-control device <b>212</b> can be conventionally used to send an electronic signal to receiver <b>206</b> in order to cause electronic trigger assembly <b>200</b> to interact with trip pin <b>108</b> in order to activate landmine assembly <b>2</b>. More particularly, solenoid <b>208</b> should be capable of receiving a signal from receiver <b>206</b> that will cause solenoid <b>208</b> to move extension <b>210</b> such that movable extension <b>210</b> is capable of interacting with trip pin <b>108</b> in order to activate paintball land mine <b>2</b> by causing trip pin <b>108</b> to become dislodged from groove <b>109</b> in order to allow hammer <b>112</b> to rotate and contact cartridge <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0038" num="0037">After hammer <b>112</b> becomes dislodged from being retained by trip pin <b>108</b>, as discussed above, the force on torsion spring <b>104</b> will cause hammer <b>112</b> to rotate quicky towards cartridge <b>110</b>.</p><p id="p-0039" num="0038">The force of the torsion spring <b>104</b> will then cause the hammer <b>112</b> to contact cartridge <b>110</b>. As discussed earlier, the interaction of the hammer <b>112</b> on cartridge <b>110</b> will cause the ignition of the gun powder in cartridge <b>110</b>. Once the cartridge <b>110</b> has been fired (or activated), the propellant created from the firing of the gun powder in cartridge <b>110</b> will enter in breach <b>114</b>.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Once the primer is struck, the short, hot pulse of gases that are produced are trapped along with the propellant, thereby causing some of the gun powder to ignite. Furthermore, still trapped inside the cartridge, the small amount of burning propellant ignites more propellant and a rapid expansion of pressure and heat begins until the limit of adhesion of the cartridge case are overcome, and the propellant is forced out of the cartridge <b>110</b> and into the combustion chamber <b>12</b>.</p><p id="p-0041" num="0040">The propellant consisting of a short pulse of hot, high speed gases then proceeds down along combustion chamber <b>12</b>. It is to be understood that the rearward facing combustion chamber exhaust port <b>24</b> directs the hot, high speed gases against the heat shield <b>20</b>, thereby causing the hot, high speed gases to spread out, slow down, and cool down. Furthermore, while the combustion chamber <b>12</b> serves as a divider to split the hot, high speed gases, further progression of the hot, high speed gases causes the hot, high speed gases to enter into the main body/barrel assembly expansion chamber <b>16</b>. Once in the in the main body/barrel assembly expansion chamber <b>16</b>, the hot, high speed gases then reconverge around the combustion chamber <b>12</b>. This collision along with the further expansion of the hot, high speed gases creates a loss of heat which results in an environment that is compatible with the reed valves <b>14</b>. The hot, high speed gases have now been altered (or massaged) so that the massaged hot, high speed gases now head down the remainder of the main body/barrel assembly expansion chamber <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0042" num="0041">Regarding reed valve standoffs <b>10</b> and reed valves <b>14</b>, as discussed earlier, a plurality of barrel restrictors <b>26</b> are radially located to an outer surface of paintball land mine assembly <b>4</b> in alignment with openings <b>5</b>. A flexible reed valve <b>14</b> of rubber, plastic, metal or other suitable material has one end mounted to the inner surface of annular wall <b>7</b> in covering relation to each opening <b>5</b>. Reed valve <b>14</b> can be constructed to be normally pre-biased to a position to close the respective opening <b>5</b>, although this is not required by the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, each reed valve <b>14</b> can be moved in a radially inward direction by inserting paintball <b>18</b> into barrel restrictor <b>26</b> so as to provide fluid communication between the respective opening <b>5</b> and main body/barrel assembly expansion chamber <b>16</b>. Although reed valves <b>14</b> are shown attached at only one end, reed valves <b>14</b> can be attached at opposite ends on opposite sides of openings <b>5</b> so that only the middle portion of each reed valve <b>14</b> moves in a radially inward direction. A reed valve standoff <b>10</b> is secured to the radially directed outer surface of each reed valve <b>14</b> and extends through the respective opening <b>5</b> and partially within the barrel restrictor <b>26</b>.</p><p id="p-0043" num="0042">Another unique aspect of the present invention is the use of reed valve standoff <b>10</b> and reed valve <b>14</b>. In particular, initially, the propellant exits very fast through openings <b>5</b> to push out and fire paint balls <b>18</b> from barrel restrictor <b>26</b>. However, after the first paint ball <b>18</b> is fired, the resistance provided by that paint ball <b>18</b> against reed valve standoff <b>10</b> and reed valve <b>14</b> no longer exists so that the propellant would quickly exit out of the barrel restrictor <b>26</b> from which the first paint ball <b>18</b> was fired, since this is the path of least resistance. However, after each paint ball <b>18</b> is fired, the respective reed valve standoffs <b>10</b> are no longer restrained, so that the propellant then forces the respective reed valves <b>14</b> to the closed position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, thus sealing the respective openings <b>5</b>. In this manner, the remaining propellant is still used to fire the other paint balls <b>18</b>.</p><p id="p-0044" num="0043">A still another unique aspect of the present invention is the ability to be able to aim or otherwise direct the exhaust from the firing of the cartridge <b>110</b>. It is to be understood that if the hot, high speed gases were allowed to escape in all directions, the result would be the destruction of the delicate reed valves <b>14</b>. In particular, in the present invention, a rearward facing combustion chamber exhaust port <b>24</b> directs the hot, high speed gases against the heat shield <b>20</b>, thereby causing the hot, high speed gases to spread out, slow down, and cool down. While the combustion chamber <b>12</b> serves as a divider to split the hot, high speed gases, further progression of the hot, high speed gases causes the hot, high speed gases to enter into the main body/barrel assembly expansion chamber <b>16</b>.

The hot, high speed gases have now been altered (or massaged) so that the massaged hot, high speed gases now head down the remainder of the main body/barrel assembly expansion chamber <b>16</b>.</p><p id="p-0045" num="0044">It is to be understood that once the primer is struck, the short, hot burst of gases that are produced are trapped along with the propellant, thereby causing some of the gun powder to ignite. Furthermore, still trapped inside the cartridge, the small amount of burning propellant ignites more propellant and a rapid expansion of pressure and heat begins until the limit of adhesion of the cartridge case is overcome, and the short burst of hot, high speed gases is forced out of the cartridge and into the breach <b>114</b>. Forces within the combustion chamber <b>12</b> require the highest pressures thereby, resulting in a complete propellant burn, hundreds of pounds of pressure, and heat.</p><p id="p-0046" num="0045">Given the above, in terms of the present invention, if one were to remove the combustion chamber <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>) and strike the cartridge <b>110</b>, detonation of the primer (not shown) within the cartridge would have enough force to open the cartridge <b>110</b> and eject propellant into the body/barrel assembly expansion chamber <b>16</b>. However, the small amount of burning propellant ignited by the primer lacks a confined space to ignite any further propellant, thereby resulting in a very low, incomplete burn of the propellant.</p><p id="p-0047" num="0046">Another unique aspect of the present invention is that by using a combustion chamber <b>12</b>, one will see that there is a now confined space that creates a high heat, high pressure environment for the unignited propellant which results in a more complete burn of the propellant.</p><p id="p-0048" num="0047">A still another unique aspect of the present invention is the ability to be able to aim or otherwise direct the exhaust from the firing of the cartridge <b>110</b>.
