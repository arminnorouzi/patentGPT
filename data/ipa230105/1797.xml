When a state where the shaft output exceeds 60 kW continues for 20 seconds or longer, it is often determined that the vehicle was running on an uphill whose inclination is at least 4% or more.

The fourth state indicates, for example, that the state of the road is a &#x2018;rough road and stepped&#x2019; state. The &#x2018;rough road and stepped&#x2019; indicates a state of a rough road with a relatively high step. The second shaft output value may be, for example, 20 kW.

When running on a road surface with a step, the motor output increases so as to override the step, so that the motor temperature may rise. In addition, an input to the motor increases due to deceleration after overriding the step, so that the motor temperature may rise. For this reason, by considering the speed and the temperature, it is possible to appropriately determine whether or not the vehicle was running on a rough road with a step. The second temperature value may be, for example, 50&#xb0; C. Note that, the second temperature value may be a value that is determined for each vehicle type identified by the vehicle ID.

The &#x2018;poor view and jumping-out&#x2019; indicates that a view is poor and jumping-out such as a person has occurred. The third shaft output value may be, for example, &#x2212;10 kW. When jumping-out of a person or an object has occurred, the vehicle <b>20</b> is suddenly decelerated so as to avoid the jumping-out, so that the shaft output is often instantaneously lowered.
