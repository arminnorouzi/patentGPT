The row electrode lines <b>501</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>501</b>-<b>3</b> are respectively connected to output terminals of OUT 1 to OUT 3, and the column electrode lines <b>502</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>502</b>-<b>3</b> are respectively connected to input terminals of IN 1 to IN 3. When a predetermined key is pressed, a switch corresponding to the key operates to close. Hereinafter, pressing a key and switching (or switching operation) are used as having the same meaning.</p><p id="p-0090" num="0089">A processor embedded in the key input device scans the input terminals of IN 1 to IN 3 while sequentially applying a low potential signal (logic 0) to the output terminals of OUT 1 to OUT 3. A high potential signal (logic 1) is output from each input terminal when the key is not pressed and a low potential signal is output when the key is pressed, and thus it may be detected that a key at a point where the output terminal to which the low potential signal is applied and the input terminal to which the low potential signal is input cross is pressed. The processor can check which key is pressed through such a key scan process.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">To explain this in more detail, the processor sends logic 0 to OUT 1 and reads IN 1 to 3, then sends logic 0 to OUT 2 again and reads IN 1 to 3 again. After that, the processor sends logic 0 to OUT 3 again, reads IN 1 to 3, and then repeats the process of sending logic 0 to OUT 1 to 3 again to scan whether or not the key is pressed.</p><p id="p-0092" num="0091">In this process, if no key is pressed, logic 1 is measured at IN 1 to 3. However, when any key is pressed, there are places where logic 0 is measured at IN 1 to 3 to which logic 0 is input. If logic 0 is measured at IN 1, it indicates that one of S1, S4, and S7 is pressed. When IN 2 becomes logic 0, it indicates that one of S2, S5, and S8 is pressed. When IN 3 becomes 0, it indicates that one of S3, S6, and S9 is pressed.</p><p id="p-0093" num="0092">In order to know which key is pressed, it is needed to check which of OUT 1 to 3 is applied with logic 0. Assuming that IN 2 becomes logical 0 when sending logic 0 to OUT 2, S5 is the only point where OUT 2 and IN 2 meet. In the end, it can be seen that S5 has been pressed.</p><p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a stacked structure of a key input device <b>150</b> in accordance with still another exemplary embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a block diagram of the key input device <b>150</b> in accordance with still another exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
