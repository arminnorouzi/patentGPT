The blown air flows along the upper surface of the air guide plate <b>7</b> (see the arrows D<b>2</b> and D<b>3</b>). Specifically, the air flows sequentially along the upper surface of the third portion <b>73</b> and the upper surface of the second portion <b>72</b>, and reaches the gap above the first portion <b>71</b>. In this case, since the second portion <b>72</b> of the air guide plate <b>7</b> is gently inclined toward the first portion <b>71</b>, it is possible to reduce a pressure loss that may occur when the air flows from the gap above the second portion <b>72</b> toward the gap above the first portion <b>71</b>.</p><p id="p-0084" num="0083">The air that has reached the gap above the first portion <b>71</b> flows along the upper surface of the first portion <b>71</b>, and is guided from the slit <b>74</b> provided in the first portion <b>71</b> to the gap (the inter-module passage <b>10</b>) between the plurality of battery modules <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B (see an arrow D<b>4</b>).

The air flowing forward further flows forward while cooling the power converter <b>3</b> by passing around the power converter <b>3</b> (see an arrow D<b>8</b>).</p><p id="p-0086" num="0085">Since the second portion <b>72</b> of the air guide plate <b>7</b> is inclined downward from the rear toward the front, the air (cooling air) flowing forward is prevented from rising and is collected downward toward the front. Thus, the cooling air can reliably flow around the power converter <b>3</b>, and the power converter <b>3</b> can be efficiently cooled.</p><p id="p-0087" num="0086">The air that has passed around the power converter <b>3</b> is cooled by passing through the heat exchanger <b>42</b> (see an arrow D<b>9</b>), and the cooled air is sucked from the suction portion <b>41</b><i>b </i>into the cooling fan <b>41</b> and then is blown from the blowing portion <b>41</b><i>a </i>(see the arrow D<b>1</b>). Thus, the air (cooling air) blown from the blowing portion <b>41</b><i>a </i>cools the battery <b>2</b> and the power converter <b>3</b> (the inverter <b>31</b> and the DC-DC converter <b>32</b>) while circulating inside the case <b>5</b>.</p><p id="p-0088" num="0087">As described above, the air guide plate <b>7</b> guides the air blown from the cooling fan <b>41</b> to the battery <b>2</b> and then to the inverter <b>31</b> (the power converter <b>3</b>). In general, the heat-resistant temperature of the battery <b>2</b> is lower than the heat-resistant temperature of the inverter <b>31</b>. For example, the heat-resistant temperature of the battery <b>2</b> is about 60&#xb0; C., and the heat-resistant temperature of the inverter <b>31</b> is about 80&#xb0; C. Thus, the battery <b>2</b> having the low heat-resistant temperature can be cooled more preferentially than the inverter <b>31</b> having the high heat-resistant temperature by first applying the air, which is immediately after being blown from the cooling fan <b>41</b> and which is not warmed yet (at low temperature), to the battery <b>2</b>.</p><p id="p-0089" num="0088">However, the air guide plate <b>7</b> may be configured to guide the air blown from the cooling fan <b>41</b> to the inverter <b>31</b> (the power converter <b>3</b>) and then to the battery <b>2</b>. This configuration can be obtained by, for example, interchanging the positions of the power converter <b>3</b> (the inverter <b>31</b> and the DC-DC converter <b>32</b>) and the battery <b>2</b>. This configuration can also be obtained by disposing the power converter <b>3</b> (the inverter <b>31</b> and the DC-DC converter <b>32</b>) above the second portion <b>72</b> of the air guide plate <b>7</b> without changing the disposition of the battery <b>2</b>.

The inter-cell passage extending in the front-rear direction is disposed below the slit <b>74</b>.</p><p id="p-0091" num="0090">The power supply <b>1</b> can be used as, for example, a device for supplying electric power to a motor (including a motor/generator) for driving an agricultural machine, a construction machine, a utility vehicle, a mower, or the like.
