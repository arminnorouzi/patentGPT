A convention cofferdam is a watertight enclosure that may be pumped dry to permit construction work below a waterline, as when building a bridge or repairing a ship. Cofferdams may also be used in sub-sea applications when sediment is needed to be removed from a subsea location. Suction piles (also known as suction caissons) are fixed platform anchors that are used as anchors for offshore installations, oil platforms, oil drilling platforms, etc. A conventional suction pile is essentially a large cylinder that is closed at one end. The structure is lowered to the ocean floor, with a downwardly facing open end, where the structure partially sinks into ocean-floor sediment of its own weight. Water is then pumped out of the structure causing a negative pressure inside the structure. The negative pressure forces the suction pile into the seabed sediment whereby the suction pile becomes strongly attached to the ocean floor and serves as an anchor. Once installed, the suction pile resists axial and lateral loads and may be used to secure mooring lines that are attached to the suction pile at various load points. As described in greater detail below, suction piles may be attached to a cofferdam structure or the cofferdam structure may include internal structures that may be used as suction piles to secure the cofferdam structure.</p><p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a three-dimensional perspective view of a cofferdam structure <b>100</b> including suction piles, in accordance with one or more embodiments of the disclosure. As described in greater detail below, cofferdam structure <b>100</b> includes double walls each having an open end at the bottom and a closed end at the top so that walls function as a suction pile. In this way, water may be partially or completely removed from the walls of cofferdam structure <b>100</b> so that induced negative pressure within the walls generates a net force that pushes cofferdam structure <b>100</b> into a sediment layer of the seabed. Cofferdam structure <b>100</b> may be used for deep sea operations when it is necessary to excavate sediment from an area of the sea floor for maintenance or installation of a subsea structure such as a drilling rig, an oil well, a pipeline, etc. Cofferdam structure <b>100</b> may also be used for undersea exploration, recovery of a shipwreck, recovery of sunken treasure, etc. In further embodiments, cofferdam structure <b>100</b> may be used for applications other than those requiring excavation from the sea floor. For example, cofferdam structure <b>100</b> may be used for oil/gas well decommissioning, well intervention, control and plugging of wells, abandoning wells, etc.</p><p id="p-0018" num="0017">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, cofferdam structure <b>100</b> includes four walls <b>102</b><i>a, </i><b>102</b><i>b, </i><b>102</b><i>c, </i>and <b>102</b><i>d </i>that form a rectangular open frame structure.

In this regard, it may be necessary to leave at least a thickness h<b>3</b> of sediment to maintain stability of cofferdam structure <b>100</b>. For an operation requiring removal of additional sediment, a second cofferdam structure <b>800</b> having suction piles may be installed. As shown, this second cofferdam structure <b>800</b> may allow removal of an additional amount of sediment down to a thickness of h<b>4</b>. Further, the presence of second cofferdam structure <b>800</b> allows material to be removed down to a depth that is lower than the bottom of cofferdam structure <b>100</b>, as shown. In this example, h<b>4</b> may have a height that is in a range from approximately 0 to 80 feet. These specific dimensions are merely an example and do not imply any limitation. Indeed, other embodiments may have other dimensions for comparable features as needed for various applications. Third, fourth, fifth, etc cofferdams can be placed within each other, respectively, to further telescope deeper into the sea floor. In embodiments, a bottom area of a first cofferdam structure may have a lip or stop surface <b>850</b> located internally at a lower portion thereof.

If desired, generally before sinking region/suction pile <b>1006</b><i>a </i>and region/suction pile <b>1006</b><i>b </i>into the seabed, region/suction pile <b>1006</b><i>a </i>and region/suction pile <b>1006</b><i>b </i>can be repositioned to a desired location. Once in the desired location, region/suction pile <b>1006</b><i>a </i>and region/suction pile <b>1006</b><i>b </i>are typically sunk into the seabed by creating negative pressure or vacuum in an interior of region/suction pile <b>1006</b><i>a </i>or region/suction pile <b>1006</b><i>b </i>as described herein.</p><p id="p-0040" num="0039">Conditional language, such as, &#x201c;can,&#x201d; &#x201c;could,&#x201d; &#x201c;might,&#x201d; or &#x201c;may,&#x201d; unless specifically stated otherwise, or otherwise understood within the context as used, is generally intended to convey that certain implementations could include, while other implementations do not include, certain features, elements, and/or operations.
